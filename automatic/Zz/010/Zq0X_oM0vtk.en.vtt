prax down below this case retails for 34
99<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:14.370> feel<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.450> allow<00:00:15.750> third-party<00:00:16.049> case

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
99 I feel that allow third-party case

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.460 
99 I feel that allow third-party case
makers<00:00:17.039> for<00:00:17.279> ipad<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> new<00:00:18.359> iPad<00:00:18.720> or<00:00:18.960> put<00:00:19.380> on

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
makers for ipad to a new iPad or put on

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.109 
makers for ipad to a new iPad or put on
a<00:00:19.500> disadvantage<00:00:20.100> since<00:00:20.369> Apple<00:00:20.820> released

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
a disadvantage since Apple released

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.970 
a disadvantage since Apple released
their<00:00:21.270> own<00:00:21.449> case<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.439> think<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.710> takes<00:00:22.740> a

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
their own case and I think it takes a

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.650 
their own case and I think it takes a
lot<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.400> switch<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.699> customer<00:00:24.060> if<00:00:24.210> they<00:00:24.330> know

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
lot to switch a customer if they know

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.630 
lot to switch a customer if they know
Apple<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.199> lot<00:00:25.380> or<00:00:25.619> they<00:00:25.710> don't<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.310> shy<00:00:26.609> away

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
Apple a lot or they don't to shy away

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.849 
Apple a lot or they don't to shy away
from<00:00:26.880> using<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.170> know<00:00:28.230> apple<00:00:28.619> brandy

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
from using the you know apple brandy

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.099 
from using the you know apple brandy
case<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.789> personally<00:00:30.300> I've<00:00:30.480> been<00:00:30.720> using<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
case so personally I've been using the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.170 
case so personally I've been using the
smart<00:00:31.320> cover<00:00:31.560> since<00:00:31.949> I've<00:00:32.070> gotten<00:00:32.309> my<00:00:32.489> ipad<00:00:32.910> 2

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
smart cover since I've gotten my ipad 2

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.540 
smart cover since I've gotten my ipad 2
and<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.660> really<00:00:34.200> shy<00:00:34.410> away<00:00:34.559> from<00:00:34.710> try<00:00:35.130> any<00:00:35.430> new

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and I really shy away from try any new

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.700 
and I really shy away from try any new
cases<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.570> was<00:00:36.750> kind<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.079> new<00:00:37.230> experience

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
cases so it was kind of a new experience

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.380 
cases so it was kind of a new experience
for<00:00:37.800> me<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.920> try<00:00:38.190> out<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.430> snow<00:00:38.670> cover<00:00:38.940> this

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
for me to try out this snow cover this

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.450 
for me to try out this snow cover this
non<00:00:39.600> case<00:00:39.809> itself<00:00:40.170> looks<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.100> hybrid

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
non case itself looks like a hybrid

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.369 
non case itself looks like a hybrid
between<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.969> smart<00:00:42.390> cover<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.989> back<00:00:43.140> panel

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
between a smart cover and a back panel

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.900 
between a smart cover and a back panel
so<00:00:43.739> instead<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.040> buying<00:00:44.160> two<00:00:44.430> different<00:00:44.670> parts

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
so instead of buying two different parts

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.029 
so instead of buying two different parts
something<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.899> do<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.200> use<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> blue

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
something like what I do I use a blue

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.569 
something like what I do I use a blue
smart<00:00:47.340> cover<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> back<00:00:47.940> cover<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:49.110> case

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
smart cover with a back cover this case

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.069 
smart cover with a back cover this case
provides<00:00:50.579> full<00:00:50.879> protection<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.690> iPad

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
provides full protection of the iPad

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.200 
provides full protection of the iPad
there<00:00:52.829> are<00:00:52.920> two<00:00:53.100> main<00:00:53.399> things<00:00:53.850> about<00:00:54.059> this

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
there are two main things about this

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.000 
there are two main things about this
case<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.629> really<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.770> after

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
case that I really do like and after

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.500 
case that I really do like and after
using<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.399> case<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:56.820> about<00:00:56.969> two<00:00:57.149> weeks<00:00:57.180> I'll

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
using this case for about two weeks I'll

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.299 
using this case for about two weeks I'll
definitely<00:00:57.690> take<00:00:57.989> note<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.829> first<00:00:59.100> ones

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
definitely take note of the first ones

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.250 
definitely take note of the first ones
actual<00:00:59.699> texture<00:01:00.030> itself<00:01:00.359> I've<00:01:00.600> never<00:01:01.140> seen

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
actual texture itself I've never seen

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.470 
actual texture itself I've never seen
such<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> texture<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.370> an<00:01:02.489> ipad<00:01:02.940> case<00:01:03.239> it's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
such a texture on an ipad case it's

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.600 
such a texture on an ipad case it's
really<00:01:03.719> nice<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.619> only<00:01:04.799> looks<00:01:05.100> black<00:01:05.369> right

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
really nice so it only looks black right

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.250 
really nice so it only looks black right
now<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.479> look<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> little<00:01:06.780> bit<00:01:06.930> closer

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
now but if you look a little bit closer

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.630 
now but if you look a little bit closer
into<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> sunlight<00:01:07.890> there's<00:01:08.189> actually<00:01:08.460> kind

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
into the sunlight there's actually kind

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.160 
into the sunlight there's actually kind
of<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.760> go<00:01:08.880> line<00:01:09.090> design<00:01:09.450> pattern<00:01:09.810> here<00:01:09.990> a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
of a go line design pattern here a

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.800 
of a go line design pattern here a
graininess<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.490> reminds<00:01:12.479> me<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
graininess to it reminds me of the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.330 
graininess to it reminds me of the
planners<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.409> used<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.619> get<00:01:13.770> when<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.070> was<00:01:14.220> in

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
planners I used to get when I was in

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.130 
planners I used to get when I was in
Middle<00:01:14.430> School<00:01:14.580> like<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.150> school<00:01:15.390> planner<00:01:15.689> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
Middle School like a school planner and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.359 
Middle School like a school planner and
I<00:01:16.200> had<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.500> texture<00:01:16.830> they'd<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.009> scratched

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
I had that texture they'd be scratched

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.830 
I had that texture they'd be scratched
across<00:01:17.520> really<00:01:17.970> fast<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.360> their<00:01:18.450> nails<00:01:18.659> made

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
across really fast with their nails made

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.570 
across really fast with their nails made
that<00:01:18.960> really<00:01:19.080> cool<00:01:19.290> noise<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.130> barely

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
that really cool noise if you can barely

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.520 
that really cool noise if you can barely
listen<00:01:21.030> right<00:01:21.180> now<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.869> barely<00:01:22.080> hear<00:01:22.409> if

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
listen right now you can barely hear if

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.770 
listen right now you can barely hear if
it<00:01:22.619> has<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.920> same<00:01:23.189> feeling<00:01:23.570> locally<00:01:24.570> it's

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
it has that same feeling locally it's

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.510 
it has that same feeling locally it's
not<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.080> texture<00:01:25.470> as<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.860> cover<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.250> doesn't

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
not as texture as is cover so doesn't

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.679 
not as texture as is cover so doesn't
feel<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.759> bad<00:01:26.820> when<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.270> rub<00:01:27.390> your<00:01:27.420> nails

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
feel that bad when you rub your nails

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.600 
feel that bad when you rub your nails
against<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.650> same<00:01:28.829> texture<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.189> also<00:01:29.460> on

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
against it the same texture is also on

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.010 
against it the same texture is also on
the<00:01:29.700> back<00:01:29.880> as<00:01:30.060> well<00:01:30.090> which<00:01:30.390> provides<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.780> really

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
the back as well which provides a really

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.260 
the back as well which provides a really
great<00:01:31.140> grip<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.950> unlike<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.460> rubber<00:01:32.700> case<00:01:32.970> or

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
great grip so unlike a rubber case or

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.149 
great grip so unlike a rubber case or
TPU<00:01:33.750> case<00:01:33.960> I've<00:01:34.229> never<00:01:34.619> really<00:01:34.860> seen<00:01:34.979> this

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
TPU case I've never really seen this

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.859 
TPU case I've never really seen this
collect<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.640> much<00:01:35.820> dust<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.720> has<00:01:36.840> a

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
collect that much dust but it has a

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.749 
collect that much dust but it has a
really<00:01:37.140> great<00:01:37.320> texture<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.220> I'm<00:01:38.610> worried

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
really great texture so if I'm worried

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.060 
really great texture so if I'm worried
about<00:01:38.820> holding<00:01:39.450> my<00:01:39.630> iPad<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.259> know<00:01:40.560> that's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
about holding my iPad I know that's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.260 
about holding my iPad I know that's
pretty<00:01:41.280> secure<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.700> my<00:01:41.759> hands<00:01:41.970> because<00:01:42.180> this

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
pretty secure in my hands because this

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.030 
pretty secure in my hands because this
texture<00:01:42.600> make<00:01:42.750> sure<00:01:42.930> has<00:01:43.470> enough<00:01:43.740> friction

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
texture make sure has enough friction

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.069 
texture make sure has enough friction
with<00:01:44.340> my<00:01:44.490> hand<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.850> won't<00:01:45.060> drop<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
with my hand that I won't drop it the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.480 
with my hand that I won't drop it the
second<00:01:46.350> thing<00:01:46.439> about<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.740> case<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.040> really<00:01:47.280> do

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
second thing about this case I really do

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.100 
second thing about this case I really do
like<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.270> how<00:01:48.360> thin<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.810> I'm<00:01:49.049> very

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
like it's just how thin it is I'm very

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.310 
like it's just how thin it is I'm very
used<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.100> using<00:01:50.460> an<00:01:50.729> Apple<00:01:51.329> smart<00:01:51.840> cover<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
used to using an Apple smart cover and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.260 
used to using an Apple smart cover and
like<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.920> TPU<00:01:53.340> back<00:01:53.640> cover<00:01:53.939> which<00:01:54.090> actually

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
like a TPU back cover which actually

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.209 
like a TPU back cover which actually
makes<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.780> iPad<00:01:55.110> pretty<00:01:55.380> bulky<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.950> switching

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
makes the iPad pretty bulky so switching

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.920 
makes the iPad pretty bulky so switching
through<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.520> case<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.270> was<00:01:57.360> actually<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> nice

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
through this case it was actually a nice

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.620 
through this case it was actually a nice
change<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.920> actually<00:01:59.189> pretty<00:01:59.369> thin<00:01:59.700> as<00:02:00.509> you

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
change it's actually pretty thin as you

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.240 
change it's actually pretty thin as you
can<00:02:00.750> see<00:02:00.930> they<00:02:01.110> call<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> thin<00:02:01.799> cover<00:02:02.009> for

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
can see they call it the thin cover for

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.590 
can see they call it the thin cover for
a<00:02:02.280> reason<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.729> shell<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.000> snaps<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
a reason the shell that snaps on the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.179 
a reason the shell that snaps on the
back<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.930> ipad<00:02:04.200> doesn't<00:02:04.619> actually<00:02:04.890> take

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
back of the ipad doesn't actually take

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.370 
back of the ipad doesn't actually take
up<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.399> much<00:02:05.640> space<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.479> actually<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> really

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
up that much space and actually a really

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.469 
up that much space and actually a really
thin<00:02:07.740> profile<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.429> still

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
thin profile so you still

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.440 
thin profile so you still
have<00:02:09.569> all<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.349> thinness<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.129> ipad<00:02:11.580> 2<00:02:12.239> in

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
have all the thinness of the ipad 2 in

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
coverage the porks themselves also are

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.309 
coverage the porks themselves also are
really<00:02:17.580> cut<00:02:17.790> out<00:02:17.819> well<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.810> speaker<00:02:19.140> down

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
really cut out well the speaker down

microphone even the camera is pretty

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.080 
microphone even the camera is pretty
much<00:02:27.810> dead<00:02:28.170> center<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:29.190> buttons<00:02:29.549> here<00:02:29.819> all

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
much dead center the buttons here all

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.089 
much dead center the buttons here all
exposed<00:02:30.629> and<00:02:30.810> really<00:02:31.019> easy<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.379> use<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.709> the

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
exposed and really easy to use and the

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.860 
exposed and really easy to use and the
cuts<00:02:32.310> themselves<00:02:32.519> are<00:02:33.090> really<00:02:33.450> nice<00:02:33.599> there's

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
cuts themselves are really nice there's

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.360 
cuts themselves are really nice there's
no<00:02:33.930> sharp<00:02:34.260> corners<00:02:34.650> or<00:02:34.860> anything<00:02:35.129> so<00:02:35.250> they

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
no sharp corners or anything so they

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.220 
no sharp corners or anything so they
spend<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.610> lot<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.879> care<00:02:36.269> into<00:02:36.299> making<00:02:37.170> this

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
spend a lot of care into making this

since the case is held onto the ipad by

my<00:02:59.459> ipad<00:02:59.819> is<00:03:00.030> indeed<00:03:00.390> turned<00:03:00.660> on<00:03:00.900> i<00:03:01.140> can't<00:03:01.799> turn

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
my ipad is indeed turned on i can't turn

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.550 
my ipad is indeed turned on i can't turn
on<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.250> screen<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:03.720> same<00:03:03.930> goes<00:03:04.079> when<00:03:04.319> I<00:03:04.349> want

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
on the screen the same goes when I want

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.199 
on the screen the same goes when I want
to<00:03:04.650> shut<00:03:04.890> off<00:03:04.980> my<00:03:05.010> iPad<00:03:05.400> swinging<00:03:05.700> by<00:03:05.940> closing

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
to shut off my iPad swinging by closing

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.819 
to shut off my iPad swinging by closing
the<00:03:06.329> cover<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.780> can<00:03:07.109> still<00:03:07.230> see<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> light<00:03:07.799> of

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
the cover I can still see the light of

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.830 
the cover I can still see the light of
my<00:03:08.010> screen<00:03:08.400> flaking<00:03:09.150> off<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.480> back<00:03:09.599> of<00:03:09.750> this

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
my screen flaking off the back of this

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.869 
my screen flaking off the back of this
case<00:03:10.109> so<00:03:10.410> for<00:03:10.859> some<00:03:11.010> reason<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.459> guess<00:03:11.640> it's

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
case so for some reason I guess it's

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.640 
case so for some reason I guess it's
just<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.060> way<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:12.359> case<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.720> built<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.170> just

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
just the way that case is built it just

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.750 
just the way that case is built it just
doesn't<00:03:13.859> reach<00:03:14.010> far<00:03:14.340> enough<00:03:14.370> where<00:03:14.730> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
doesn't reach far enough where the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.960 
doesn't reach far enough where the
magnets<00:03:15.239> are<00:03:15.650> able<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.739> activate<00:03:17.069> so<00:03:17.220> see<00:03:17.489> if<00:03:17.819> I

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
magnets are able to activate so see if I

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.300 
magnets are able to activate so see if I
pull<00:03:18.359> forward<00:03:19.019> or<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.680> case<00:03:19.889> isn't<00:03:20.069> actually

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
pull forward or the case isn't actually

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.849 
pull forward or the case isn't actually
naturally<00:03:20.579> sit<00:03:21.120> on<00:03:21.269> top<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.510> my<00:03:21.810> screen<00:03:22.019> it

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
naturally sit on top of my screen it

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.789 
naturally sit on top of my screen it
activates<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.579> so<00:03:23.790> let's<00:03:23.970> see<00:03:24.410> it<00:03:25.410> open<00:03:25.709> like

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
activates it so let's see it open like

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.740 
activates it so let's see it open like
that<00:03:25.859> there<00:03:26.280> we<00:03:26.370> go<00:03:26.489> but<00:03:27.090> right<00:03:27.239> now<00:03:27.419> the<00:03:27.480> way

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
that there we go but right now the way

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.129 
that there we go but right now the way
it's<00:03:27.930> sitting<00:03:28.139> naturally<00:03:28.739> on<00:03:28.889> the<00:03:29.040> table<00:03:29.340> here

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
it's sitting naturally on the table here

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.830 
it's sitting naturally on the table here
Macy<00:03:31.139> see<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:31.739> doesn't<00:03:31.889> turn<00:03:32.069> off<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.310> cover

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
Macy see it doesn't turn off the cover

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.589 
Macy see it doesn't turn off the cover
and<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:33.959> can't<00:03:34.169> turn<00:03:34.349> on<00:03:35.090> my<00:03:36.090> second<00:03:36.389> complaint

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
and I can't turn on my second complaint

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.330 
and I can't turn on my second complaint
is<00:03:36.870> actually<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.349> stand<00:03:37.709> functionality<00:03:38.310> of

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
is actually the stand functionality of

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.610 
is actually the stand functionality of
this<00:03:38.609> case<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.180> big<00:03:39.810> difference<00:03:40.139> between<00:03:40.260> this

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
this case a big difference between this

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.409 
this case a big difference between this
case<00:03:40.889> and<00:03:40.919> the<00:03:41.280> smart<00:03:41.519> cover<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:41.970> has<00:03:42.090> three

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
case and the smart cover it has three

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.300 
case and the smart cover it has three
panels<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.049> set<00:03:43.169> up<00:03:43.290> for<00:03:43.620> which<00:03:44.160> actually

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
panels and set up for which actually

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.440 
panels and set up for which actually
makes<00:03:44.549> a<00:03:44.639> pretty<00:03:44.760> big<00:03:44.970> difference<00:03:45.090> because

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
makes a pretty big difference because

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.509 
makes a pretty big difference because
when<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.840> fold<00:03:46.049> up<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.349> smart<00:03:46.620> cover<00:03:46.799> that

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
when you fold up the smart cover that

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.159 
when you fold up the smart cover that
extra<00:03:47.970> layer<00:03:48.150> classic<00:03:48.599> here<00:03:48.840> is<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:48.989> little

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
extra layer classic here is a little

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:50.750 
extra layer classic here is a little
triangle<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.739> makes<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.130> hold<00:03:50.280> up<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.519> stand

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
triangle that makes to hold up the stand

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.670 
triangle that makes to hold up the stand
this<00:03:51.389> snow<00:03:51.660> covered<00:03:51.930> up<00:03:52.079> she<00:03:52.200> actually<00:03:52.440> does

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
this snow covered up she actually does

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.530 
this snow covered up she actually does
not<00:03:52.889> have<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.400> same<00:03:53.700> type<00:03:53.910> of<00:03:53.940> security<00:03:54.239> so

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
not have that same type of security so

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.270 
not have that same type of security so
it's<00:03:54.959> kind<00:03:55.139> of<00:03:55.169> awkward<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.739> make<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.160> little

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
it's kind of awkward to make the little

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.220 
it's kind of awkward to make the little
triangle<00:03:56.669> stand<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.359> send<00:03:57.540> up<00:03:57.599> your<00:03:57.720> iPad<00:03:58.019> so

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
triangle stand to send up your iPad so

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.720 
triangle stand to send up your iPad so
you<00:03:58.590> see<00:03:58.739> I'm<00:03:58.829> rolling<00:03:59.129> it<00:03:59.220> up<00:03:59.280> here<00:03:59.579> the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
you see I'm rolling it up here the

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.830 
you see I'm rolling it up here the
panels<00:04:00.060> are<00:04:00.150> actually<00:04:00.359> a<00:04:00.389> little<00:04:00.450> bit<00:04:00.660> larger

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
panels are actually a little bit larger

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.050 
panels are actually a little bit larger
and<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.709> just<00:04:01.919> feel<00:04:02.069> like<00:04:02.099> this<00:04:02.400> doesn't<00:04:02.700> snap

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
and I just feel like this doesn't snap

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.780 
and I just feel like this doesn't snap
in<00:04:03.269> most<00:04:04.049> of<00:04:04.139> the<00:04:04.200> time<00:04:04.410> even<00:04:05.160> when<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.400> stressed

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
in most of the time even when I stressed

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.539 
in most of the time even when I stressed
ended<00:04:06.120> up<00:04:06.329> it<00:04:06.569> always<00:04:06.870> unravels<00:04:07.620> so<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.340> have<00:04:08.459> to

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
ended up it always unravels so I have to

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.550 
ended up it always unravels so I have to
make<00:04:08.669> sure<00:04:08.730> i<00:04:08.849> bring<00:04:08.940> this<00:04:09.239> panel<00:04:09.569> over<00:04:09.930> once

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
make sure i bring this panel over once

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.349 
make sure i bring this panel over once
again<00:04:10.799> it's<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.099> minor<00:04:11.340> complaint<00:04:11.790> but<00:04:11.940> after

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
again it's a minor complaint but after

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.210 
again it's a minor complaint but after
using<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.720> smart<00:04:12.930> cover<00:04:13.199> for<00:04:13.470> so<00:04:13.590> long<00:04:13.799> you

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
using the smart cover for so long you

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.189 
using the smart cover for so long you
kind<00:04:14.430> of<00:04:14.459> get<00:04:14.549> spoiled<00:04:15.150> about<00:04:15.599> how<00:04:15.780> easy<00:04:16.019> it<00:04:16.139> is

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
kind of get spoiled about how easy it is

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.500 
kind of get spoiled about how easy it is
snaps<00:04:16.680> into<00:04:16.859> place<00:04:17.120> make<00:04:18.120> sure<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.299> guys<00:04:18.359> like

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
snaps into place make sure you guys like

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.180 
snaps into place make sure you guys like
one<00:04:18.630> more<00:04:18.719> time<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.049> when<00:04:19.289> I<00:04:19.320> once<00:04:19.650> I<00:04:19.739> wrap<00:04:19.979> this

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
one more time so when I once I wrap this

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.030 
one more time so when I once I wrap this
and<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:20.459> put<00:04:20.700> it<00:04:20.789> down<00:04:21.229> you<00:04:22.229> know<00:04:22.289> which<00:04:22.440> is<00:04:22.560> so

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
and I put it down you know which is so

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.770 
and I put it down you know which is so
around<00:04:23.610> which<00:04:23.790> never<00:04:24.090> really<00:04:24.330> happens<00:04:24.660> with

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
around which never really happens with

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.200 
around which never really happens with
my<00:04:24.930> smart<00:04:25.230> cover<00:04:25.440> so<00:04:26.340> this<00:04:26.490> case<00:04:26.730> from<00:04:26.940> snug

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
my smart cover so this case from snug

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.090 
my smart cover so this case from snug
has<00:04:27.510> a<00:04:27.540> lot<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:27.900> potential<00:04:28.260> of<00:04:28.590> becoming<00:04:28.800> a

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
has a lot of potential of becoming a
