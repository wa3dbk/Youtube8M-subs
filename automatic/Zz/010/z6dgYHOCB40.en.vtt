we've<00:00:29.160> learned<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.640> lot<00:00:29.670> about<00:00:30.120> the<00:00:30.510> role<00:00:30.660> of

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
we've learned a lot about the role of

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.440 
we've learned a lot about the role of
the<00:00:30.840> principal<00:00:31.350> over<00:00:31.950> the<00:00:32.310> last<00:00:32.520> 20<00:00:33.420> years

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the principal over the last 20 years

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.960 
the principal over the last 20 years
there<00:00:34.260> are<00:00:34.500> two<00:00:34.770> mistakes<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.370> people<00:00:35.550> make

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
there are two mistakes that people make

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.729 
there are two mistakes that people make
when<00:00:36.000> they're<00:00:36.810> defining<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.350> role<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
when they're defining the role of the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.760 
when they're defining the role of the
passing<00:00:38.130> policies<00:00:38.580> one<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:40.110> they<00:00:40.350> expect

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
passing policies one is that they expect

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.130 
passing policies one is that they expect
them<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:40.980> solve<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.060> problem<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.720> this<00:00:42.930> is

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
them to solve the problem so this is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.680 
them to solve the problem so this is
really<00:00:43.500> giving<00:00:44.309> too<00:00:44.670> much<00:00:44.850> leeway<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
really giving too much leeway to the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.720 
really giving too much leeway to the
principal<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.379> basically<00:00:47.040> expecting<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
principal and basically expecting the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.760 
principal and basically expecting the
principal<00:00:48.210> as<00:00:48.360> hero<00:00:48.720> to<00:00:49.320> carry<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.739> day

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
principal as hero to carry the day

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.369 
principal as hero to carry the day
because<00:00:50.370> they<00:00:50.520> have<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.790> autonomy<00:00:51.379> change

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
because they have the autonomy change

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.170 
because they have the autonomy change
doesn't<00:00:52.680> happen<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.980> way<00:00:53.250> there's<00:00:53.489> no<00:00:53.550> hero

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
doesn't happen that way there's no hero

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.740 
doesn't happen that way there's no hero
image<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:55.379> either<00:00:56.150> brings<00:00:57.150> about<00:00:57.360> any<00:00:57.540> kind

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
image that either brings about any kind

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.899 
image that either brings about any kind
of<00:00:57.809> change<00:00:58.080> that<00:00:58.260> lasts<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:59.519> other<00:00:59.640> end<00:00:59.850> of

of change that lasts the other end of
the<00:01:00.000> continuum<00:01:00.150> that's<00:01:00.600> also<00:01:00.989> mistake<00:01:01.409> is<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the continuum that's also mistake is the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.710 
the continuum that's also mistake is the
move<00:01:02.040> towards<00:01:02.370> micromanagement<00:01:03.059> at

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
move towards micromanagement at

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.040 
move towards micromanagement at
principal<00:01:04.250> doing<00:01:05.250> one<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.240> trying<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
improve the human capital I guess I'll

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.080 
improve the human capital I guess I'll
call<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.780> above<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> staff<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.340> never<00:01:11.700> adds<00:01:11.880> up

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
call it above the staff it never adds up

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.660 
call it above the staff it never adds up
you<00:01:12.420> don't<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.690> enough<00:01:12.960> time<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.460> do

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
you don't have enough time but if you do

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.700 
you don't have enough time but if you do
what<00:01:15.090> we're<00:01:15.510> finding<00:01:15.690> works<00:01:16.080> which<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
what we're finding works which is the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.710 
what we're finding works which is the
principal<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.400> working<00:01:18.090> through<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
principal is working through the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.080 
principal is working through the
leadership<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.320> others<00:01:19.590> using<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.400> group<00:01:20.729> to

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
leadership of others using the group to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.480 
leadership of others using the group to
change<00:01:21.120> the<00:01:21.630> group<00:01:21.870> so<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.560> principal's<00:01:23.159> main

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
change the group so the principal's main

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.399 
change the group so the principal's main
impact<00:01:23.940> is<00:01:24.120> when<00:01:24.659> they<00:01:24.780> create<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
impact is when they create a

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.380 
impact is when they create a
collaborative<00:01:25.950> group<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.970> they<00:01:27.180> themselves

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
collaborative group that they themselves

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.810 
collaborative group that they themselves
are<00:01:27.930> learner's<00:01:28.229> within<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.979> group<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
are learner's within that group so the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.120 
are learner's within that group so the
role<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> principal<00:01:30.690> is<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.259> create<00:01:31.950> those

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
role of the principal is to create those

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.700 
role of the principal is to create those
conditions<00:01:32.820> where<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.689> collaboration<00:01:34.439> is

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
conditions where the collaboration is

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.819 
conditions where the collaboration is
serious<00:01:35.399> its<00:01:35.700> focused<00:01:36.210> at<00:01:36.390> specific<00:01:36.960> also<00:01:37.530> it

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
serious its focused at specific also it

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.980 
serious its focused at specific also it
turns<00:01:38.130> out<00:01:38.399> that<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:39.119> don't<00:01:39.149> want<00:01:39.479> principals

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
turns out that we don't want principals

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.569 
turns out that we don't want principals
even<00:01:40.289> if<00:01:40.409> they're<00:01:40.590> not<00:01:40.770> collaborative<00:01:41.399> to

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
even if they're not collaborative to

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.910 
even if they're not collaborative to
work<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.939> isolation<00:01:42.329> within<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.960> school<00:01:43.200> the

work in isolation within a school the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.889 
work in isolation within a school the
whole<00:01:44.039> system<00:01:44.430> reform<00:01:44.789> again<00:01:45.060> requires<00:01:45.630> that

whole system reform again requires that

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.050 
whole system reform again requires that
principals<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> certain<00:01:46.920> extent<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.880> what<00:01:48.030> I

principals to a certain extent be what I

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.609 
principals to a certain extent be what I

would call system players I don't mean

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.230 
would call system players I don't mean
they<00:01:49.770> should<00:01:49.979> worry<00:01:50.609> about<00:01:50.880> running<00:01:51.060> the

they should worry about running the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the morning but what they should do is

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.810 
the morning but what they should do is
