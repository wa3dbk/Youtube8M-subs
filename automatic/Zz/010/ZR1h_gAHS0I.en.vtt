00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
so this is where the suspected water is

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.089 
so this is where the suspected water is
that<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:05.580> certainly<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.089> different<00:00:06.990> color<00:00:07.230> you

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
of gravel so this is where it's wet at

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.440

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
the water softener right here this is

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.310 
the water softener right here this is
the<00:00:34.200> water<00:00:34.440> softener<00:00:35.059> and<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.750> what<00:00:36.930> happens

the water softener and so what happens

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.850 
the water softener and so what happens
is<00:00:37.500> somehow<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.370> were<00:00:38.700> down<00:00:38.879> here<00:00:39.120> working<00:00:39.540> and

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
is somehow we were down here working and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.740 
is somehow we were down here working and
we<00:00:40.860> must<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.280> bumped<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.450> became

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
we must have bumped it and it became

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.130 
we must have bumped it and it became
dislodged<00:00:43.350> from<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.100> strange<00:00:44.399> pipe<00:00:44.700> so

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
dislodged from the strange pipe so

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.209 
dislodged from the strange pipe so
really<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> only<00:00:46.289> thing<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.890> needs<00:00:47.129> to

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
really the only thing that needs to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.160 
really the only thing that needs to
happen<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.670> I've<00:00:47.820> shipped<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.510> two<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:48.960> I

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170
