00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello dear friends with you i am 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.799
 fired davidenko and we have another 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:13.110
 unboxing of such a thermos tramp here I 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:17.100
 I bought it myself , its price was 215 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.779
 hryvnia it was not at a discount of 10 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.890
 percentage ie 180 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.439
 there is 8 hryvnia about this somewhere who 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.689
 Russia Belarus or somewhere 23 23 with 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.789
 half dollar 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.630
 start taking yourself on 1 and 2 liters because 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.969
 that liter seems to be as little for me 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.579
 16 there is still a volume of such a thermos 16 I 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.790
 should already like a bust that is and 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.309
 carry extra water and it is a little thicker 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.570
 Cossacks do not fit much anymore 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:52.910
 drawing means this is how it looks with 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.680
 I go through a box of boxes 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.260
 let you down the sharpness I was read 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.210
 everyone will not pause there press 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.790
 read in that square I will just say 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:09.299
 stainless steel grade 18 18 18 by 8 and 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:13.229
 plastic material on the other hand 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.840
 labels that we have this temperature through 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.659
 six hours guarantee 82 degrees 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.180
 after 12 hours at 72 degrees and through 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.680
 24 hours a day promise 58 degrees 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.579
 they not only promise people performed 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.920
 tests really coincide with 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:35.490
 as if the stated result is therefore I 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.500
 tests I will not wear a set 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.960
 is coming 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.280
 a cap that spins up in two 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.729
 cups and the valve as if not a button goes 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.860
 unscrew the valve and from this side 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.320
 boxes, too, can anyone interested in 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.340
 pause click read made in china 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.140
 here representatives of the product are certified and 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.990
 meets hygienic standards 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.990
 here are the guarantees we have a lifetime 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:15.100
 top such an inscription 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:15.100
 but we donâ€™t get anything on the bottom 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:28.180
 streets not in cellophane checks not from a thermos 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:30.780
 up now at the lid let's go over here 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.920
 that is debunked in two parts 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.859
 relatively useful because it comes 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.709
 with a friend or ride he forget the cup 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:47.980
 and you can twist the lid once 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:49.090
 cups by smell plastic is not smelly until 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.819
 thermos such 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.069
 You know many acquaintances 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.900
 satisfied so I decided to take myself 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.079
 such a thermos, too, it is not the first 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:04.859
 natural 3 and the thermos is never enough 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.859
 as practice shows here 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:13.580
 such a cap inside looks like 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.580
 thermos well seen by the way surprisingly 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:24.930
 thread such a cap with a button and yourself 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:29.100
 did not take a thermos because oh principle 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.160
 over few pretenders where it breaks 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.190
 but still the simpler the design 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:39.630
 better than me already old ther with which 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.459
 also use it too, that's such a cap 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.180
 plan price when unscrewed poured 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.190
 and twisted that is, no buttons where 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.510
 tea leaves fall they do not fly 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.220
 and everything is as simple as possible if 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.420
 welding and hit the beach Kata unscrewed and 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.930
 completely took a twist 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.310
 shook the cork back spun and she 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.430
 fine 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.709
 pours hot drink that is not 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.680
 can unscrew and pour here 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.019
 shown arrows on this side can 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.390
 pouring was not worth much 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:24.270
 here there are more such channels and him 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:27.630
 everything twists easily 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.550
 okay the only thing on the forums i'm still 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.530
 by read and heard from people by someone 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.610
 says that here this area and when 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.750
 pour boiling water 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.450
 that thermos starts to get warm here 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.160
 that is, there is heat loss, but someone 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.979
 says he has someone he says 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.780
 that he doesnâ€™t have one 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.810
 to establish the truth or in extreme 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.090
 least truth for my thermos try 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.460
 pour here a full thermos of water now 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.130
 boiling water and try to be there in this 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.960
 areas hot or not and now i'm 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:02.039
 pause and 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.560
 skipyachu be right back so I'm back 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:07.199
 means a thermos of copper then stood for minutes 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.530
 ten with boiling water is basically 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:13.259
 it means enough thermos itself yes 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.210
 ok working cold but 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.849
 really like writing on the forums where 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.039
 then here is this area 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:22.770
 she's pretty well not hot that is 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.690
 I keep calm she is warm that is 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.759
 a little heat transfer through the wall here 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.940
 heat loss is on but i think it is not 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:36.259
 significantly because the top will 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:39.380
 the lid is tightened 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:42.030
 insulate the tula part 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.039
 metal and so i think 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.419
 it is not very significant that is yes 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:49.590
 there is a heat loss goes muershka armor but 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:52.139
 it is not essential 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.539
 on this anbox for this thermos 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:57.240
 can be considered completed thanks that 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:06:00.389
