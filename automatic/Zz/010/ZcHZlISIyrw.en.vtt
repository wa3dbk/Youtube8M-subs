00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.660
 very good all equal gamer we are 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.250
 playing competitive multiplayer testing 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.840
 hardcore is my first gameplay of my 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.940
 first game obviously but if my 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.049
 first gameplay so let's see how 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.969
 is this 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.400
 oh by the way I'm using this that is 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.430
 an exceptional weapon not a weapon 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.199
 legendary is not an exceptional weapon like that 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.029
 that we're going to try it out a bit is not yet 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.250
 much improved and I think it's not very very 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.170
 good for now but I do not know what 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.820
 You can, this is going to catch 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.120
 some of these hatreds more colorful god 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.250
 no no no no I have loaded one in order 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.070
 could make up a lot and play be very 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.800
 well that will always depend on her 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.900
 You already know how this is going to see if I get there 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.490
 there are leaves that with teleportation 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.140
 that I have because instead of flying from 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.520
 teleportation is quite complicated 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.950
 God, I think I'm going to leave the shotgun 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.180
 sectioned in each boom 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:56.180
 like it has not killed those weapons that 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.070
 kill from wherever you are 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.200
 I'm going to put my batteries I do not want 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.810
 fail if I screw her a lot to have to 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.190
 change the shotgun is all in future 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.590
 although he has only put it in for a while 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.810
 that you see it since it is an exceptional 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.040
 it is important to hate this transportation 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.890
 by the wind and this has taken 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.990
 already saw that I have one here 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.869
 up or down I'm going to turn it around 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.930
 this game is really intense hate 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.360
 book does not need to hit it if it is 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.020
 I knew a shot when they are this 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.030
 close a shot 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.229
 oh god that little save my ass 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.229
 die for me 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.180
 now let's go well I'll catch is now 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.620
 a little we will keep their distance 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.460
 that has not even arrived 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:49.130
 the time ago for so intense we go 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:57.290
 first good both today that first of 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:58.010
 my team but in truth or changing 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.840
 of theme 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.610
 I wanted to go up quite a lot and when 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.710
 it came up I told you before it came out 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.560
 I really wanted to go up but 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.300
 lately he was very busy and the 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.750
 Most target videos are videos 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.640
 quite long so if you videos and upload 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.100
 jumps or things like that he knew I'll upload them 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.490
 by parts because they are very very long 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.140
 some not so much but I'll see and I guess 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.180
 that I'll upload more often like 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.890
 if they are looking to raise more items 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.140
 multiplayer because they are more concludes 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.800
 podiums I hate partners of yours 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.720
 I will try to upload short items or by 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.180
 parts I do not want to say very short but 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.700
 no videos of 20 minutes that do not give me 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.650
 time to upload as the case of the video 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.540
 earlier that I had problems with the envelope 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.549
 best plants 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.299
 to see we keep losing god I do not want 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:51.299
 lose in my first client let's go let's 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.080
 and here there are rocks now up here it's going 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.080
 to take a 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:07.930
 immediately come for me 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:11.040
 his raid mode by god as belt gives the 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.040
 back you are me 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.520
 ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.660
 I think it's remembered as much as not the 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.620
 truth is that I think I was changing 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:25.030
 so I did not expect this jo or 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.260
 thank goodness that my tour look at the corpse 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.990
 I would have saved if I was not a politician 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.590
 on tour look at the corpse has a couple of 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.590
 silly stuff 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.840
 Come come come come no closer 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.480
 grace since there were few people with 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.480
 discount and most people have 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.090
 shotgun is a pig including me 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.460
 I now because if the shotgun 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.620
 we always give them the people or not 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.390
 always but I do not know in this game always 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.860
 intends at least all the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.020
 world that sees a shotgun is champion 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.270
 I see how I do not change, I'm going to change 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.190
 unless I change, I'm going to leave the 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.490
 shotgun a mouse I do not think we go 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.350
 losing the course and I do not think it's 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.120
 problem but saying is my first 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.620
 gameplay is that I do not know or always 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.200
 I have bad luck with those with 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.850
 teams right now upload the score 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.890
 I'm surely winning, I do not know, I'm going 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.840
 first on both teams in scoring 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.830
 surely but good the truth is that 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.960
 on the other team there is one that is 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.330
 pretty unique but the rest of me 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.120
 flip equipment happens is that surely the 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:35.540
 Most people in the world 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:38.030
 Come on, you eat it yourself 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.090
 nothing is that it was impossible dead but it 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.720
 has been left with the shock of the club to see 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.300
 we go up here we are still here less badly than 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.430
 control it between transport because the 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.420
 first times you use it you do not know how 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.420
 get anywhere 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.530
 d 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.000
 there are times that it is simply body to 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.310
 body is the best when not only 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.080
 wait you give them two hits if they 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.660
 while there are traumatized 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.010
 you do 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.010
 now wait wait 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:19.340
 and brum or pretended to do that but it 's 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.340
 likely to come 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.130
 but here 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.319
 give him two hits come now 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.379
 well maybe we are losing more we were going 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:36.990
 losing losing a lot but I'm 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:40.520
 going well and it's fine apart I'm 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.520
 happening well support some guys also 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.370
 or 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.659
 beautiful and now someone eastwood goes up 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.620
 and I do not even have to check 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.620
 if he was dead 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:02.820
 and I really like all of them, either between 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.010
 titan and hunter because I am sincere 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.110
 I think the next one that I choose is 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.140
 hunter because I have seen a skill 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.240
 What does it have to do to become invisible or 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.970
 camouflage for a while or something like that 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.190
 and that's the key especially for assault 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.800
 when someone dies and you need 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.479
 reanimating that plane skill 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.479
 has been reanimated and safely 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:29.069
 to see pilla pilla and we are already giving 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:33.199
 back in the two yes truth yes we are 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:33.199
 turning knots but 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.770
 come this one that happens to you that never 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.690
 I get killed at one stroke it is done that 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.009
 was the distance that the attacks are 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.650
 how I want 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.780
 for long distances to which one 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.009
 distinctive olive slap 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.159
 all right 

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:53.159
 He has returned sedated with my shotgun 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:53.159
 exceptional 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.550
 first on the other team but it's already 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:03.770
 point of finishing the game so I'm going to 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.800
 put my final cannonball that yes I know 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:09.229
 they will take you to take them but you do not 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.789
 you deserve it, wait no longer 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.870
 I deserved it and since I do not have time to 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:13.870
 throwing my pipe is not me 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:20.479
 no no no no 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:30.669
 Toma knew he had to kill someone 

00:07:27.929 --> 00:07:32.409
 In short, if we have not won, it is not necessary 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:33.969
 that is to say they have won us the 

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:35.829
 double but good I hope it has 

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:37.959
 liked the gameplay to this university 

00:07:35.829 --> 00:07:39.519
 except not to me I hope you like the 

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:41.319
