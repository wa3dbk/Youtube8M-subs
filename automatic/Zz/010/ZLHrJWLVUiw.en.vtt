00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.940
 we start to knit from the head we take the thread 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.139
 make a ring and knit 6 columns 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:24.060
 nakida inside this ring first 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:29.790
 column second column 3 column 4 5 6 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.119
 we tighten the ring and knit the second 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.540
 row 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.890
 second row we will make six increments 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.670
 tying two columns in each 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:45.360
 loop of the previous row in the first loop 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.490
 knit 2 columns the first column and the second 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:55.650
 column 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:01:01.649
 in the second loop 2 columns 12 in the third 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:10.409
 loop 2 column 12 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:18.180
 in the fourth loop knit increase 12 in 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:20.220
 do the fifth loop when the beam is 12 and in 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:27.960
 knit the last sixth loop 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:30.060
 increase 2 columns in one loop 12 here 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.670
 we finished the second row 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.580
 12 loops in a circle doing the third row 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.760
 increase in each second loop in the first 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.950
 loop knit column in the second 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.950
 loop we do an increase knit 2 columns 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.320
 12 then repeat in the first loop 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:56.640
 column 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:58.890
 in the second gain two columns 12 and so 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.830
 knit to the end of the row while making an increase in 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.200
 every other loop in this way in a row 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.489
 we make 6 increments at the end of the third 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.989
 Row we get 18 loops in a circle 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:12.260
 the fourth row we make an increase in each 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:23.720
 knit the sixth loop 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:27.970
 from columns 1 2 3 4 5 a to the sixth loop 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.970
 knit an increase of 2 columns in one loop 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.739
 12 then repeat repeat need more 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.780
 two times 5 bars and an increase of just 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.510
 row we will make three increments at the end 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.150
 Fourth, we are happy with 21 loops 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.720
 circle the fifth row knit one by one 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.980
 a column in each loop of the previous row 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.900
 in the first loop next loop column 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.829
 the next loop and so we need 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.920
 knit 4 rows from 5 to 8 one by one 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.519
 There are 21 columns in each loop in the row. 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.859
 a loop 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.430
 knit 4 rows one by one in 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:10.549
 knit each loop next 9 knit 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.019
 the five bars gave a decrease in 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.319
 the first loop column 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:19.250
 in the second loop column in the third loop 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:22.370
 column in the fourth loop column and in 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.620
 knit the fifth loop next 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:30.370
 the next 2 loops knit together 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:34.370
 make a downhill 12 tying them together 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.560
 then repeat 5 bars and decrease 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.919
 so in the row we need to do 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.410
 only three subtracts one we have already done in 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:44.329
 the end of the ninth row we get 18 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.769
 loops in a circle knit five columns 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:51.949
 further down 10 row tying column 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:56.859
 in the first loop next two columns together 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:04:01.000
 do a 12 subtract we tie them together 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:03.319
 then repeat the column in the first loop 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.849
 the next 2 loops knit together 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.889
 make a decrease 12 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:12.859
 knit them together and so would u knit 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:15.379
 until the end of the row at the end of the tenth row 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:19.159
 we get 12 loops in a circle we 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:22.070
 let's do six downs tying 10 row with 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:24.469
 using foam rubber we fill our head 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.340
 sheep would not mind to us 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:28.010
 density 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.410
 next 11 row this year we will do 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.600
 six downs 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:38.630
 tying 2 columns together doing 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:44.139
 decrease 1 2 1 decrease then repeat 2 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:48.139
 columns together 12 2 subtraction 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:54.970
 the next two bars together are 3 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:59.240
 decreasing two columns together 4 decreasing two 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:05.360
 tying the column together this is 5 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:07.370
 and two columns together 1 2 is 6 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.620
 last drop in this row 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:14.800
 up times in the eleventh row we tied 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.800
 head our sheep we cut the thread and 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.669
 close the loop 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:33.760
 here's a lamb 's head and ready further knit 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:38.600
 knitting baby hair yarn 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:42.050
 make 2 air loops 1 2 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:49.730
 then in the second loop from the hook knit 6 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:06:01.640
 single crochet 1 column in the same 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:06:11.360
 knit loop the second column 3 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:15.380
 column 4 column 5 column and in the same 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.690
 knit loop 6 column here we are 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.360
 tied up the first row we got 6 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.310
 posts 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:27.100
 the second row is knotted in two columns 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.100
 each loop in the first loop 2 column 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:38.930
 the first column and in the same loop 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:47.630
 knit the second column then 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:52.790
 next loop 2 columns 1 and in the same 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:55.130
 loop the second column and so we will knit 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.320
 to the end of the row making an increase in each 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.740
 we should have a loop at the end 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.570
 second row 12 loops in a circle yet 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.000
 left to make four increases 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:08.960
 the third row is doing an increase in each 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.950
 tying the second loop into the first loop 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:20.900
 column in the second knit increase two 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:23.570
 column 12 then repeat the column and 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.550
 increase so we will do six 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.500
 increments at the end of the third row we have 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.440
 get 18 loops in a circle 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.270
 There are still 5 extras to do. 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.270
 third row we got 8 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:41.830
 loops in a circle haircut ready to cut 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:41.830
 thread and close the loop 

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.889
 This is how our hairstyle will look like.
