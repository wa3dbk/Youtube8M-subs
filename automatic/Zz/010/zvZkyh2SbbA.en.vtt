00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.140 
use in two shots with just a head and we
just<00:01:16.409> did<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> last<00:01:16.890> minute<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:18.000> stick

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
it in but the rest of the sequence was

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.530 
it in but the rest of the sequence was
sort<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.130> cut<00:01:20.369> around<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:21.000> monster<00:01:21.330> where<00:01:21.450> you

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
sort of cut around the monster where you

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.429 
sort of cut around the monster where you
hear<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.170> don't<00:01:22.290> see<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:25.259> there's

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
hear it but you don't see it and there's

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.200 
hear it but you don't see it and there's
a<00:01:25.530> certain<00:01:26.900> creative<00:01:27.900> way<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.880> doing<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.030> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
a certain creative way of doing that I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.670 
a certain creative way of doing that I
mean<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:30.990> where<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.140> don't<00:01:31.439> see

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
mean you can do it where you don't see

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.499 
mean you can do it where you don't see
the<00:01:31.710> monster<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.579> some<00:01:33.030> people<00:01:33.270> would<00:01:33.329> say

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
the monster and some people would say

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.120 
the monster and some people would say
that's<00:01:33.630> more<00:01:33.810> artistic<00:01:34.290> than<00:01:34.320> actually

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
that's more artistic than actually

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.670 
that's more artistic than actually
showing<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.549> but<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.020> 50<00:01:37.259> or<00:01:37.380> because<00:01:37.619> I

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
showing it but in this 50 or because I

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.920 
showing it but in this 50 or because I
really<00:01:37.890> wanted<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.189> see<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.700> monster<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.810> I

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
really wanted to see the monster and I

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.899 
really wanted to see the monster and I
felt<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.380> would<00:01:40.470> add<00:01:40.710> more<00:01:41.220> tension<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
felt it would add more tension to the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.420 
felt it would add more tension to the
scene<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.329> make<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.600> more<00:01:42.720> interesting<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:44.310> we

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
scene and make it more interesting so we

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.710 
scene and make it more interesting so we
were<00:01:44.520> able<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.790> do<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.149> was<00:01:45.329> able<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.570> go

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
were able to do that I was able to go

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.770 
were able to do that I was able to go
back<00:01:46.070> create<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.340> better<00:01:48.149> version<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
back create a better version of the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.399 
back create a better version of the
monster<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.500> shoot<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> scene<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.700> all<00:01:50.939> the

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
monster and shoot the scene in all the

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.960 
monster and shoot the scene in all the
cutaways<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> monsters<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.640> add<00:01:53.820> them

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
cutaways to the monsters and add them

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.340 
cutaways to the monsters and add them
into<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> scene<00:01:54.420> which<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.689> think<00:01:54.869> makes<00:01:55.140> that

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
into the scene which I think makes that

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.800 
into the scene which I think makes that
that<00:01:55.829> ice<00:01:56.159> ceem<00:01:56.729> make<00:01:56.939> more<00:01:57.149> sense<00:01:57.420> than<00:01:57.659> it

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
that ice ceem make more sense than it

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.910 
that ice ceem make more sense than it
did<00:01:58.439> before

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.010 

the<00:02:04.920> snow<00:02:05.220> battle<00:02:05.460> was<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:06.210> challenge<00:02:06.810> when<00:02:06.930> we

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
the snow battle was a challenge when we

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.680 
the snow battle was a challenge when we
did<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.320> because<00:02:07.560> nobody<00:02:07.890> had<00:02:08.009> ever<00:02:08.069> done<00:02:08.690> blue

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
did it because nobody had ever done blue

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.900 
did it because nobody had ever done blue

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
usually do it on dark surfaces we used

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.790 
usually do it on dark surfaces we used
optical<00:02:23.880> technology<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.870> course<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.380> do<00:02:25.680> all

in the daylight every hint of that black
matte<00:02:47.940> line<00:02:48.239> becomes<00:02:48.660> very<00:02:49.290> visible<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:49.950> so

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
matte line becomes very visible and so

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.309 
matte line becomes very visible and so

the snow battle here 17 years ago a lot

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.110 
the snow battle here 17 years ago a lot
of<00:02:55.440> effort<00:02:55.739> went<00:02:55.860> into<00:02:56.010> finding<00:02:56.610> ways<00:02:56.819> to

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
of effort went into finding ways to

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.270 
of effort went into finding ways to
minimize<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.690> black<00:02:57.959> line<00:02:58.290> one<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.100> ways

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
minimize that black line one of the ways

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.210 
minimize that black line one of the ways
was<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.970> not<00:03:00.360> print<00:03:00.720> all<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.500> elements<00:03:01.830> at

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
was to not print all of the elements at

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.020 
was to not print all of the elements at
their<00:03:02.489> full<00:03:02.819> opacity<00:03:03.750> on<00:03:03.900> coming<00:03:04.500> in

their full opacity on coming in

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.070 
their full opacity on coming in
consequently<00:03:06.030> when<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.299> see<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.660> snow

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
consequently when you see the snow

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.440 
consequently when you see the snow
battle<00:03:07.320> on<00:03:07.739> film<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.820> may<00:03:08.970> notice<00:03:09.420> that

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
battle on film you may notice that

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.720 
battle on film you may notice that
there's<00:03:09.840> part<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.799> scenery<00:03:11.250> is

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
there's part of the the scenery is

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.880 
there's part of the the scenery is
visible<00:03:12.239> through<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.600> cockpit<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.320> it<00:03:13.680> was<00:03:13.859> a

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
visible through the cockpit and it was a

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.280 
visible through the cockpit and it was a
constant<00:03:14.609> trade-off<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:15.209> how<00:03:15.420> transparent

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
constant trade-off of how transparent

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.590 
constant trade-off of how transparent
can<00:03:16.440> we<00:03:16.560> make<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.890> cockpit<00:03:17.340> at<00:03:17.910> what<00:03:18.090> point<00:03:18.390> is

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
can we make the cockpit at what point is

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.449 
can we make the cockpit at what point is
the<00:03:19.109> black<00:03:19.290> line<00:03:19.320> more<00:03:19.859> objectionable<00:03:20.400> than

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
the black line more objectionable than

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.180 
the black line more objectionable than
the<00:03:20.760> transparency<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:21.900> there<00:03:22.260> was<00:03:22.440> an

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
the transparency and so there was an

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.069 
the transparency and so there was an
opportunity<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.940> go<00:03:24.060> back<00:03:24.090> into<00:03:24.570> those<00:03:24.690> shots

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
opportunity to go back into those shots

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.990 
opportunity to go back into those shots
use<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.680> computer<00:03:26.160> technology<00:03:26.790> and

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
use the computer technology and

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.449 
use the computer technology and
eliminate<00:03:27.930> all<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.170> transparency<00:03:28.950> but<00:03:29.310> also

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
eliminate all the transparency but also

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.000 
eliminate all the transparency but also
not<00:03:29.970> have<00:03:30.120> any<00:03:30.239> matte<00:03:30.480> lines

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.920 

the<00:03:36.459> other<00:03:36.610> issue<00:03:36.819> was<00:03:37.180> going<00:03:37.510> into<00:03:37.660> cloud

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
the other issue was going into cloud

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.199 
the other issue was going into cloud
city<00:03:38.319> that<00:03:39.099> was<00:03:39.190> a<00:03:39.220> cloud<00:03:39.580> city<00:03:39.849> was<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.000> very

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
city that was a cloud city was a very

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.790 
city that was a cloud city was a very
difficult<00:03:40.420> thing<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:42.269> design<00:03:43.269> and<00:03:43.510> create

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
difficult thing to design and create

originally as a floating city in the

originally as a floating city in the
clouds<00:03:46.260> some<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.349> the<00:03:47.410> mat<00:03:47.560> work<00:03:47.739> there<00:03:47.980> wasn't

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
clouds some of the mat work there wasn't

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.990 
clouds some of the mat work there wasn't
very<00:03:48.310> good<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:50.010> when<00:03:51.010> they<00:03:51.160> built<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.670> set

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
very good and when they built the set

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.030 
very good and when they built the set
it's<00:03:52.269> very<00:03:52.510> confined<00:03:53.019> it's<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.319> very<00:03:53.470> small<00:03:53.769> set

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
it's very confined it's a very small set

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.009 
it's very confined it's a very small set
it<00:03:54.160> doesn't<00:03:54.370> look<00:03:54.519> out<00:03:54.670> onto<00:03:54.940> anything<00:03:55.660> it's

it doesn't look out onto anything it's

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.150 
it doesn't look out onto anything it's
just<00:03:56.080> you<00:03:56.349> get<00:03:56.470> this<00:03:56.590> it's<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:57.010> very

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
just you get this it's a very

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160 
just you get this it's a very
claustrophobic<00:03:57.340> kind<00:03:58.090> of<00:03:58.150> set<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:58.569> that

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
claustrophobic kind of set and that

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.170 
claustrophobic kind of set and that
always<00:03:59.470> bothered<00:03:59.800> me<00:03:59.830> I<00:03:59.950> wanted<00:04:00.819> to<00:04:00.910> be<00:04:01.030> more

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
always bothered me I wanted to be more

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.110 
always bothered me I wanted to be more
open<00:04:01.599> see<00:04:02.349> more<00:04:02.590> of<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.860> city<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:03.340> so<00:04:03.940> what

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
open see more of the city and so what

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.630 
open see more of the city and so what
we've<00:04:04.239> done<00:04:04.480> is<00:04:04.840> we've<00:04:05.190> added<00:04:06.190> to<00:04:06.549> the

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
we've done is we've added to the

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.430 
we've done is we've added to the
