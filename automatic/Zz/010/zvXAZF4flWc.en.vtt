00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
that's pretty cool stuff so we set up

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.920 
that's pretty cool stuff so we set up
several<00:00:39.100> years<00:00:39.340> ago<00:00:39.489> because<00:00:40.210> we<00:00:40.360> had<00:00:40.449> no<00:00:40.600> idea

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
several years ago because we had no idea

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.810 
several years ago because we had no idea
whether<00:00:41.410> or<00:00:41.710> not<00:00:41.829> this<00:00:42.220> would<00:00:42.399> actually<00:00:42.519> work

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
whether or not this would actually work

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.790 
whether or not this would actually work
that<00:00:43.269> was<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:43.510> initial<00:00:43.629> goal<00:00:43.899> that<00:00:44.140> we<00:00:44.199> put<00:00:44.469> a

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
that was the initial goal that we put a

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.920 
that was the initial goal that we put a
bottle<00:00:45.510> inside<00:00:46.510> of<00:00:46.660> a<00:00:46.719> small<00:00:46.960> machine
