so this monitor is connected to the
video<00:01:51.230> card<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:55.780> this<00:01:56.780> monitor<00:01:57.320> is<00:01:57.470> connected

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
video card and this monitor is connected

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.360 
video card and this monitor is connected
to<00:01:58.010> the<00:01:58.370> video<00:01:58.580> card<00:01:58.760> as<00:01:58.910> well<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:02.440> this<00:02:03.440> one

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
to the video card as well and this one

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.520 
to the video card as well and this one
is<00:02:04.520> connected<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.180> USB<00:02:05.570> adapter

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.650 

notice<00:02:09.530> how<00:02:09.649> playbacks<00:02:10.240> video<00:02:11.240> playback<00:02:11.420> is

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660

notice how playbacks video playback is
just<00:02:11.840> fine

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
just fine

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.330 
just fine
now<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:15.020> reason<00:02:15.380> why<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.530> have<00:02:15.830> this<00:02:16.070> setup<00:02:16.430> is

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
now the reason why I have this setup is

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.490 
now the reason why I have this setup is
because<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.460> do<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.640> lot<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:20.000> trading<00:02:20.900> stock

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
because I do a lot of trading stock

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
looks like we're going to fire up all

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:34.450 
looks like we're going to fire up all
the<00:02:26.720> charts<00:02:28.840> I'll<00:02:29.840> step<00:02:30.080> back<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:34.310> can

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
see how everything is running at the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.660 
see how everything is running at the
same<00:02:35.840> time<00:02:36.110> it's<00:02:36.380> really<00:02:36.740> useful<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.280> have<00:02:37.430> all

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
same time it's really useful to have all

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.220 
same time it's really useful to have all
these<00:02:37.850> charts<00:02:38.180> up<00:02:38.270> at<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.480> same<00:02:38.630> time<00:02:38.930> really

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
these charts up at the same time really

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.680 
these charts up at the same time really
helps<00:02:39.440> me<00:02:39.970> have<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.060> better<00:02:41.180> view<00:02:41.330> on<00:02:41.600> the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
helps me have a better view on the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.150 
helps me have a better view on the
entire<00:02:41.930> market<00:02:42.700> however<00:02:43.700> I<00:02:43.940> do<00:02:44.000> notice<00:02:44.360> that

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
entire market however I do notice that

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.760 
entire market however I do notice that
the<00:02:46.160> third<00:02:46.610> monitor<00:02:47.270> rather<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.410> one<00:02:48.560> that's

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
the third monitor rather the one that's

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.030 
the third monitor rather the one that's
next<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.160> USB<00:02:49.580> adapter<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.410> little<00:02:51.920> bit

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
next to the USB adapter is a little bit

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.660 
next to the USB adapter is a little bit
laggy<00:02:52.340> in<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:53.000> application<00:02:54.310> so<00:02:55.310> yeah<00:02:55.430> it's

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
laggy in this application so yeah it's

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.449 
laggy in this application so yeah it's
it's<00:02:55.910> quite<00:02:56.600> fluid<00:02:57.050> here<00:02:57.470> but<00:02:57.980> when<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.280> moves

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
it's quite fluid here but when it moves

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.009 
it's quite fluid here but when it moves
over<00:02:58.670> here<00:02:58.910> it's<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.239> little<00:02:59.510> bit<00:02:59.840> laggy

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
over here it's a little bit laggy

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:08.560 
over here it's a little bit laggy
nothing<00:03:04.120> nothing<00:03:05.200> crazy<00:03:06.200> but<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:07.100> mean<00:03:07.670> it's

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
nothing nothing crazy but I mean it's

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.000 
nothing nothing crazy but I mean it's
very<00:03:08.660> fluid<00:03:09.050> here<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.709> then<00:03:10.250> laggy<00:03:11.380> laggy<00:03:12.380> on

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
very fluid here and then laggy laggy on

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.860 
very fluid here and then laggy laggy on
that<00:03:13.310> one<00:03:15.489> it's<00:03:16.489> even<00:03:16.820> it's<00:03:17.360> even<00:03:17.630> getting

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
that one it's even it's even getting

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.190 
that one it's even it's even getting
quite<00:03:18.410> distorted<00:03:18.769> right<00:03:19.100> now<00:03:19.780> but<00:03:20.780> that's<00:03:21.050> not
