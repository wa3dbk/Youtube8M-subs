00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:15.390 
looking at a group of life chains I

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.940 
looking at a group of life chains I
wanted<00:00:16.290> the<00:00:16.680> seat<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.220> seat<00:00:17.580> drink<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.950> I

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
wanted the seat in a seat drink and I

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.990

and they haven't done very well so I

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.230 
and they haven't done very well so I
have<00:00:26.000> decided<00:00:26.180> to<00:00:26.919> make<00:00:27.919> two<00:00:28.250> group<00:00:28.669> plantings

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
sure what the result will be but I'll

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.060 
sure what the result will be but I'll
have<00:00:38.149> a<00:00:38.180> go

that's<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.520> wages

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.560 

well<00:01:01.780> here<00:01:02.080> we<00:01:02.170> go<00:01:02.200> with<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:03.330> smaller<00:01:04.330> one

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
well here we go with the smaller one

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.400 
well here we go with the smaller one
first<00:01:04.780> I<00:01:05.050> think<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:06.720> we'll<00:01:07.720> come<00:01:07.900> back<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:08.140> it

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
first I think and we'll come back to it

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.880 
first I think and we'll come back to it
shortly

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.890 

unfortunately<00:01:11.890> my<00:01:12.220> battery<00:01:13.210> ran<00:01:13.240> out<00:01:13.420> and<00:01:13.810> I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
unfortunately my battery ran out and I

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.330 
unfortunately my battery ran out and I
had<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.140> put<00:01:14.290> it<00:01:14.380> on<00:01:14.470> charger<00:01:14.980> and<00:01:15.160> in<00:01:15.250> the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
had to put it on charger and in the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.800 
had to put it on charger and in the
meantime<00:01:15.550> I<00:01:15.880> have<00:01:16.680> managed<00:01:17.680> to<00:01:17.950> get<00:01:18.570> all<00:01:19.570> the

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
meantime I have managed to get all the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.420 
meantime I have managed to get all the
trees<00:01:20.410> in<00:01:20.580> blue<00:01:21.580> pot<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:23.650> bit<00:01:23.830> tough<00:01:24.130> because

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
trees in blue pot it's bit tough because

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.140 
trees in blue pot it's bit tough because
the<00:01:25.050> roots<00:01:26.050> there<00:01:26.920> are<00:01:27.010> tap<00:01:27.220> roots<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.790> if<00:01:28.060> I

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
the roots there are tap roots and if I

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.730 
the roots there are tap roots and if I
cut<00:01:28.360> those<00:01:28.540> off<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:29.020> saplings<00:01:29.440> are<00:01:29.530> quite

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
cut those off the saplings are quite

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.180 
cut those off the saplings are quite
small<00:01:30.130> so<00:01:30.690> they're<00:01:31.690> not<00:01:31.870> quite<00:01:32.110> straight<00:01:32.650> but

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
small so they're not quite straight but

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.890 
small so they're not quite straight but
I<00:01:33.220> hope<00:01:33.520> to<00:01:33.850> sort<00:01:34.840> that<00:01:35.020> out<00:01:36.450> as<00:01:37.450> we<00:01:37.720> go<00:01:37.869> along

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
I hope to sort that out as we go along

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.230 
I hope to sort that out as we go along
and<00:01:38.380> having<00:01:39.280> given<00:01:39.490> a

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.240 

it's<00:01:44.240> partial

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.960 

and<00:01:47.730> you<00:01:47.940> down

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
and you down

00:01:49.970 --> 00:03:17.600 
and you down
continue<00:01:50.800> to<00:01:51.800> sit<00:01:52.640> without<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:55.420> positions

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.680 

it's<00:03:18.540> much<00:03:18.780> better<00:03:19.020> to<00:03:19.230> be<00:03:19.260> working<00:03:19.710> with<00:03:20.690> web

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
it's much better to be working with web

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.830 
it's much better to be working with web
soil<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.460> since<00:03:23.460> we're<00:03:23.700> settling<00:03:24.060> down<00:03:24.270> much

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
soil and since we're settling down much

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.950 
soil and since we're settling down much
better<00:03:25.140> than<00:03:25.700> it<00:03:26.700> was<00:03:26.910> with<00:03:27.090> dry<00:03:27.330> so<00:03:27.630> I<00:03:27.660> list

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
better than it was with dry so I list

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.310 
better than it was with dry so I list
the<00:03:28.200> tap<00:03:29.010> boots<00:03:29.280> which<00:03:29.490> are<00:03:29.640> causing<00:03:30.290> get<00:03:31.290> a

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
the tap boots which are causing get a

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.080 
the tap boots which are causing get a
bit<00:03:31.500> heavy<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.400> didn't<00:03:32.640> want<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.850> remove

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
bit heavy and I didn't want to remove

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.610 
bit heavy and I didn't want to remove
them

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.520 

going<00:03:37.310> from<00:03:37.489> a<00:03:37.519> seat<00:03:37.819> pray<00:03:38.180> into<00:03:38.390> a<00:03:38.629> really

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
going from a seat pray into a really

00:03:39.530 --> 00:04:51.550 
going from a seat pray into a really
shadow<00:03:39.860> pot<00:03:40.220> that's<00:03:40.700> really<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.180> problem

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.950

it<00:05:34.240> looks<00:05:34.510> like<00:05:34.690> I've<00:05:34.900> ended<00:05:35.140> up<00:05:35.260> with<00:05:35.320> small

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
it looks like I've ended up with small

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.370 
it looks like I've ended up with small
fries<00:05:36.070> on<00:05:36.250> this<00:05:36.460> side<00:05:36.730> and<00:05:36.970> the<00:05:37.150> as<00:05:37.840> it<00:05:38.110> comes

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
fries on this side and the as it comes

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.180 
fries on this side and the as it comes
from<00:05:38.590> this<00:05:39.250> side<00:05:39.550> is<00:05:39.880> all<00:05:40.060> the<00:05:40.210> larger<00:05:40.570> ones

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
from this side is all the larger ones

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.760 
from this side is all the larger ones
then<00:05:42.190> start<00:05:42.970> off<00:05:43.210> as<00:05:43.630> a<00:05:43.810> plan<00:05:44.050> as<00:05:44.260> such<00:05:44.530> but

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
then start off as a plan as such but

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.440 
then start off as a plan as such but
that's<00:05:45.040> how<00:05:45.220> it's<00:05:45.430> worked<00:05:45.640> out<00:05:45.910> and<00:05:48.450> these

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
that's how it's worked out and these

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.080 
that's how it's worked out and these
