00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:09.219 
okay so here's all the pieces of the gun

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.820 
okay so here's all the pieces of the gun
this<00:00:10.219> was<00:00:10.430> uh<00:00:10.460> basically<00:00:11.389> the<00:00:11.650> the<00:00:12.650> main

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
this was uh basically the the main

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.859 
this was uh basically the the main
section<00:00:13.309> which<00:00:13.430> was<00:00:13.580> taken<00:00:13.850> apart<00:00:13.940> everything

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:14.869 
section which was taken apart everything

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.900 
section which was taken apart everything
is<00:00:15.080> basically<00:00:15.680> screwed<00:00:16.039> from<00:00:16.190> one<00:00:16.400> side<00:00:16.670> into

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
is basically screwed from one side into

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.380 
is basically screwed from one side into
the<00:00:17.029> other<00:00:17.410> the<00:00:18.410> only<00:00:18.619> thing<00:00:18.800> it<00:00:18.920> was<00:00:19.390> looped

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
the other the only thing it was looped

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.270 
the other the only thing it was looped
together<00:00:20.750> which<00:00:21.080> is<00:00:21.200> kind<00:00:21.380> of<00:00:21.470> a<00:00:21.590> kind<00:00:22.010> of<00:00:22.070> sad

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.280 
together which is kind of a kind of sad

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.680 
together which is kind of a kind of sad
is<00:00:22.490> the<00:00:23.450> back<00:00:23.630> of<00:00:23.840> the<00:00:23.930> butt<00:00:24.740> here<00:00:25.540> so<00:00:26.540> that

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:26.690 
is the back of the butt here so that

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.520 
is the back of the butt here so that
pieces<00:00:26.960> actually<00:00:27.550> slipped<00:00:28.550> on<00:00:28.760> and<00:00:29.380> glued<00:00:30.380> in

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.530 
pieces actually slipped on and glued in

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.860 
pieces actually slipped on and glued in
place<00:00:30.560> so<00:00:31.100> I<00:00:31.310> actually<00:00:31.610> had<00:00:31.880> to<00:00:32.059> break<00:00:32.599> it<00:00:32.750> here

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
place so I actually had to break it here

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.720 
place so I actually had to break it here
to<00:00:32.960> get<00:00:33.079> it<00:00:33.170> apart<00:00:33.430> other<00:00:34.430> than<00:00:34.640> that

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
to get it apart other than that

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.720 
to get it apart other than that
everything<00:00:35.030> is<00:00:35.149> screws<00:00:37.480> this<00:00:38.480> is<00:00:38.660> the

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
everything is screws this is the

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:49.420 
everything is screws this is the
magazine<00:00:45.430> this<00:00:46.430> part<00:00:46.790> here<00:00:47.180> is<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:48.130> nose<00:00:49.130> of

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
magazine this part here is the nose of

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.220 
magazine this part here is the nose of
the<00:00:49.520> gun<00:00:50.770> it<00:00:51.770> goes<00:00:51.950> like<00:00:52.399> this

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
the gun it goes like this

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.250 
the gun it goes like this
so<00:00:54.230> that's<00:00:54.410> basically<00:00:54.800> this<00:00:54.980> piece<00:00:55.250> here<00:00:55.579> and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
so that's basically this piece here and

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.729 
so that's basically this piece here and
inside<00:00:57.260> here<00:00:58.510> there's<00:00:59.510> two<00:00:59.750> contacts<00:01:00.230> up<00:01:00.469> here

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
inside here there's two contacts up here

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.119 
inside here there's two contacts up here
and<00:01:01.340> there's<00:01:02.239> two<00:01:02.300> motors<00:01:02.719> one<00:01:03.620> spins<00:01:03.920> this

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
and there's two motors one spins this

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.030 
and there's two motors one spins this
guy<00:01:04.570> one<00:01:05.570> spins<00:01:05.899> the<00:01:06.020> other<00:01:06.140> guy<00:01:06.320> there<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:06.979> you

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
guy one spins the other guy there so you

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.620 
guy one spins the other guy there so you
can<00:01:07.159> see<00:01:07.340> one<00:01:07.490> motor<00:01:07.700> in<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:07.939> back<00:01:07.969> one<00:01:08.420> motor

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
can see one motor in the back one motor

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:18.399 
can see one motor in the back one motor
up<00:01:08.810> top<00:01:09.020> here<00:01:09.259> and<00:01:17.020> here's<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.259> other

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
up top here and here's the other

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.580 
up top here and here's the other
mechanical<00:01:19.340> part<00:01:19.609> which<00:01:19.819> is<00:01:19.850> this<00:01:20.409> so<00:01:21.409> there's

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
mechanical part which is this so there's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.539 
mechanical part which is this so there's
a<00:01:21.649> motor<00:01:21.889> right<00:01:22.759> here<00:01:23.590> which<00:01:24.590> has<00:01:24.829> a<00:01:24.859> little

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
a motor right here which has a little

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.249 
a motor right here which has a little
gear<00:01:25.729> box<00:01:25.969> and<00:01:26.270> underneath<00:01:26.899> you<00:01:27.079> can<00:01:27.229> see

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
gear box and underneath you can see

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.209 
gear box and underneath you can see
there's<00:01:27.740> a<00:01:27.829> little<00:01:28.009> small<00:01:28.549> mechanism<00:01:29.029> and<00:01:30.219> you

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
there's a little small mechanism and you

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:32.469 
there's a little small mechanism and you
won't<00:01:31.369> be<00:01:31.459> able<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.609> see<00:01:31.729> this<00:01:31.850> on<00:01:31.999> camera<00:01:32.420> I

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
won't be able to see this on camera I

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.279 
won't be able to see this on camera I
don't<00:01:32.569> think<00:01:33.549> but<00:01:34.549> inside<00:01:35.029> here<00:01:35.479> there's<00:01:36.079> two

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
don't think but inside here there's two

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.269 
don't think but inside here there's two
little<00:01:36.560> micro<00:01:36.829> switches<00:01:38.859> and<00:01:39.859> those<00:01:39.979> micro

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:40.279 
little micro switches and those micro

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:43.809 
little micro switches and those micro
switches<00:01:40.490> are<00:01:41.380> activated<00:01:42.380> when<00:01:42.529> you<00:01:43.459> pull<00:01:43.700> the

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
switches are activated when you pull the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.419 
switches are activated when you pull the
trigger<00:01:43.849> back<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.920> there's<00:01:45.920> two<00:01:46.069> things<00:01:46.099> that

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
trigger back and there's two things that

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:54.639 
trigger back and there's two things that
happen<00:01:52.060> this<00:01:53.060> little<00:01:53.450> notch<00:01:53.659> here<00:01:54.020> actually

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
happen this little notch here actually

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.769 
happen this little notch here actually
rides<00:01:54.979> back<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:55.549> forth<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:58.359> rides<00:01:59.359> in<00:01:59.630> these

00:01:59.769 --> 00:01:59.779 
rides back and forth and rides in these

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:03.729 
rides back and forth and rides in these
notches<00:02:00.249> which<00:02:01.249> basically<00:02:02.619> ratchet<00:02:03.619> this

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:03.739 
notches which basically ratchet this

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:09.279 
notches which basically ratchet this
forward<00:02:04.189> every<00:02:04.489> time<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:04.819> moves<00:02:07.690> and<00:02:08.690> then

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
forward every time it moves and then

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.979 
forward every time it moves and then
there's<00:02:09.440> this<00:02:09.590> little<00:02:09.739> piston<00:02:10.489> here<00:02:10.989> which

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
there's this little piston here which

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.839 
there's this little piston here which
actually<00:02:12.470> punches<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:14.150> next<00:02:14.680> dart<00:02:15.680> out

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
actually punches the next dart out

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.920 
actually punches the next dart out
and<00:02:17.689> then<00:02:18.379> of<00:02:18.499> course<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:19.540> dart<00:02:20.540> gets

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
and then of course that dart gets

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.619 
and then of course that dart gets
punched<00:02:21.260> into<00:02:21.530> this<00:02:21.709> little<00:02:21.920> chamber<00:02:22.129> here

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
punched into this little chamber here

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.059 
punched into this little chamber here
which<00:02:23.629> gets<00:02:23.900> caught<00:02:24.109> by<00:02:24.260> these<00:02:24.319> wheels<00:02:24.650> and

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
which gets caught by these wheels and

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.649 
which gets caught by these wheels and
that's<00:02:25.400> what's<00:02:25.639> it<00:02:25.849> makes<00:02:25.999> it<00:02:26.120> fly<00:02:26.299> out<00:02:28.629> okay<00:02:29.629> I

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
that's what's it makes it fly out okay I

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.920 
that's what's it makes it fly out okay I
got<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:29.959> batteries<00:02:30.290> in<00:02:30.469> here<00:02:30.499> so<00:02:31.749> this<00:02:32.749> thing

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
got the batteries in here so this thing

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.690 
got the batteries in here so this thing
is<00:02:33.019> actually<00:02:33.200> held<00:02:33.560> together<00:02:33.739> by<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.159> the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
is actually held together by the the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.699 
is actually held together by the the
other<00:02:34.819> piece<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:35.299> it's<00:02:35.450> kind<00:02:35.689> of<00:02:35.750> its<00:02:36.500> kind<00:02:36.560> of

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
other piece so it's kind of its kind of

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.140 
other piece so it's kind of its kind of
really<00:02:36.799> flimsy<00:02:37.099> here<00:02:37.400> with<00:02:37.519> only<00:02:37.670> one<00:02:37.879> piece

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
really flimsy here with only one piece

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.509 
really flimsy here with only one piece
but<00:02:38.450> you'll<00:02:38.750> see<00:02:38.930> if<00:02:39.049> I<00:02:39.139> pull<00:02:39.379> this<00:02:39.530> well

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
but you'll see if I pull this well

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.839 
but you'll see if I pull this well
actually<00:02:40.719> it'll<00:02:41.719> energize<00:02:42.400> this<00:02:43.400> here<00:02:43.700> when<00:02:43.819> I

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
actually it'll energize this here when I

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.629 
actually it'll energize this here when I
pull<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.209> halfway<00:02:44.769> it's<00:02:45.769> hitting<00:02:46.219> one<00:02:46.459> of<00:02:46.579> the

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:46.639 
pull it halfway it's hitting one of the
