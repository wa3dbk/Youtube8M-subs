00:00:49.294 --> 00:00:54.800
 What is that? What is Diversity? What is this? What are these white things? What is this? 

00:00:54.883 --> 00:00:59.222
 My eyes are deceived, I dream dreaming, wake up Jack, maybe mislead! 

00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:07.648
 What is this? Something went wrong! What is this? What are these songs? What is this? 

00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:14.405
 Tiny creatures are laughing, have a good mood for everyone. Did my mind go? 

00:01:14.488 --> 00:01:15.739
 What is this? 

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:20.328
 Kids throw snowballs, not heads, 

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:23.415
 I make toys and I don't see carcasses. 

00:01:23.498 --> 00:01:26.836
 There is ice on every window, though I don't think I can see it well. 

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:32.508
 My bones warm up, it's internal warmth. 

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:38.515
 They decorate everything. A kiss? Just come inside! So inspired! 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:43.270
 Listen to a fairy tale, chestnuts are baked on fire. What is this? 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.778
 I see a little tree inside, bizarre! Why wood, why? 

00:01:50.862 --> 00:01:54.450
 Why do they put things on and why do small lamps? 

00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:58.954
 Everyone smiles. Do I see it well? It's all a pleasure. I can say? 

00:01:59.038 --> 00:02:02.459
 Maybe you woke up in me? 

00:02:03.793 --> 00:02:08.882
 And now, the little ones fell asleep, and look, there are no fears, 

00:02:08.965 --> 00:02:14.055
 no vampires to scare you. Just padded cozy, 

00:02:14.222 --> 00:02:17.892
 the security of their dreams. 

00:02:20.394 --> 00:02:21.897
 What is this? 

00:02:23.565 --> 00:02:26.318
 There are no monsters anywhere, no nightmares. 

00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:29.321
 And what about them? It feels good everywhere. 

00:02:29.404 --> 00:02:32.075
 Soft music in the air instead of screams 

00:02:32.158 --> 00:02:37.413
 cakes and cakes are scented everywhere. 

00:02:37.497 --> 00:02:43.087
 What I see is what I hear so great, so loud, so wonderful. 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.508
 It employs the emptiness in me, just flattering experiences. 

00:02:47.591 --> 00:02:50.178
 I want you! 

00:02:50.262 --> 00:02:56.184
 I need to know what this place I found! I need to know what it is!
