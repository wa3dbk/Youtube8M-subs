00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
up to software I put on four devices and

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.490 
up to software I put on four devices and
there<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:30.760> no<00:02:30.880> problem<00:02:31.210> with<00:02:31.570> it<00:02:31.600> still<00:02:32.290> works

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.150 
there is no problem with it still works
flawlessly<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:34.630> like<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.080> said<00:02:35.140> that's<00:02:35.950> just

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
flawlessly and like I said that's just

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.670 
flawlessly and like I said that's just
one<00:02:36.400> idea<00:02:36.520> that<00:02:36.760> I<00:02:36.910> had<00:02:37.020> when<00:02:38.020> I<00:02:38.080> figure<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.560> out

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
one idea that I had when I figure it out

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.020 
one idea that I had when I figure it out
that<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.010> could<00:02:39.160> put<00:02:39.310> more<00:02:39.520> than<00:02:39.640> one<00:02:39.700> device

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
that you could put more than one device

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.290 
that you could put more than one device
in<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.560> could<00:02:42.040> actually<00:02:42.070> also<00:02:42.610> record

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
in it and you could actually also record

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.910 
in it and you could actually also record
