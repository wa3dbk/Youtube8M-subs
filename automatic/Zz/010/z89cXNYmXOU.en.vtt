00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 today I would like to talk about the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.020
 cocacola talk about the 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.010
 curiosities of this refreshment that has 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.929
 fact that since 1882 is one of 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.049
 the most important soft drinks and 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.940
 known worldwide I have here 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.180
 as you can see a container of cocacola 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.480
 a two-liter bottle but there are 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.430
 as you well know all kinds of formats 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.810
 one liter bottles liter bottles and 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.090
 half canisters of 33 centiliters let's say 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.460
 that all types of formats exist 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.610
 for an industry that is growing 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.610
 cocacola's fortune is estimated in 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.500
 many billions of dollars per 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.510
 so we are not talking about a 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.960
 normal company we are talking about a 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.329
 of the largest companies in the world the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.300
 moment in which it was created was never thought 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.600
 that was going to have that success basically 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.879
 because it was created for therapeutic purposes 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.100
 was created to calm the pains of 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.860
 head and to calm the nausea 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.869
 let's say it fixed the stomach thing 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.000
 that today because they also do 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.070
 he also does it if you are ever a 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.650
 little scrambled stomach and take is a 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.649
 little bit of cocacola, the safest thing is that 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.210
 they take off and dizziness equal if you are 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.790
 dizzy by anything and you take 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.490
 sugar the sugar that cocacola has 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.670
 then dizziness disappears automatically 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.840
 but hey today we will talk about 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.659
 what were their true origins 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.590
 because apparently the cocacola until the 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:38.319
 1903 year approximately when someone 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.020
 I was going to a bar to ask for coke 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.509
 I went to the bar and said give me a coke in 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.720
 time to say give me a cocacola said 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.190
 give me a drug 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:54.090
 because he said to people between the year 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.990
 1882 and 1902 1903 when they went to a bar to 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.560
 ask and cocacola 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.620
 give me a drug, basically because 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.070
 he was carrying cocaine in his 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.720
 origin the tail mouth was carrying cocaine 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.200
 specifically about 8 milligrams per 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.620
 container quantity that is very very scarce 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.740
 but that still is appreciable is 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.900
 curious that the drink will start with casualties 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.660
 dose of cocaine doses that were 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.500
 withdrawn from the market more or less by the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.270
 1903 year around more or less and from 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.450
 hence the cocacola has been a 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.740
 product that has been evolving have 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.310
 been changing some of the 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.830
 ingredients but always keeping 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.990
 let's say the basic composition and makes a 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.380
 time is supposedly revealed the 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.200
 original formula of cocacola but the 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.080
 cocacola company has said that this 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.640
 it is not the original formula notwithstanding the 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.640
 I will read just in case 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:02.220
 let's go there the recipe is the following 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:07.640
 fluid extract of coca 3 drag plus acid 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:12.750
 citric 3 ounces caffeine one ounce sugar 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:15.870
 30 that is about 15 grams water 25 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:20.820
 gallons lime juice 2 pints and a 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:24.190
 quarter vanilla one ounce candy 1.5 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:27.430
 ounces or more for the color 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.430
 and the secret taste supposedly 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.370
 get mixed 8 ounces of alcohol 20 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.100
 drops of orange oil 30 drops of 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.790
 lemon oil 10 drops of oil 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:43.830
 nutmeg 5 drops of coriander 10 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.420
 drops of neroli and 10 drops of cinnamon 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.480
 supposedly you have to leave all these 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:53.940
 ingredients rest about 24 hours and already 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.940
 you would have the original cocacola 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.769
 the truth is that in its origin more or 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.920
 less for the year was for the year 1886 not 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:07.190
 by 82 actually but it was already 82 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.860
 started the idea with a mixture of leaves 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.599
 of coca and seeds of cola nut are 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.060
 he wanted to create a remedy that relieved 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.260
 headache and nausea not like ya 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.230
 I said 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.020
 and from here then the recipe 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.300
 was extended internationally 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.210
 company was sold again and again every 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.310
 time to more money until then today 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.800
 which has more than 20 billion 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.270
 dollars about 23 billion dollars 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.310
 it is a barbarity 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.140
 one of the largest companies in the 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.030
 world that generate more benefits and 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.880
 in addition to an extremely 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.100
 simple basically generates benefits to 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.800
 through the addiction of beverages 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.140
 sugary I'm not going to talk 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.180
 about the benefits and consequences 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.100
 of cocacola that I'll do in another 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.570
 video there is enough to tell 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.000
 but good what is clear is that a 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:03.190
 today especially in america the 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.190
 cocacola is consumed too
