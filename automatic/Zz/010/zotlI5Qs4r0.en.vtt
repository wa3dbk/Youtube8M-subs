00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.400
 we continue to please our friends 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.559
 of your scott that this time I 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.599
 asked looks with circular skirts the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.639
 which favor all types of bodies 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.639
 how rich we are not going to see these options 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.529
 this is the first ideal option for 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.290
 use during the afternoon I'm choosing 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.700
 light colors so you can see that also 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.610
 we can use prince this is very 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.469
 summery a skirt that starts at the 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.390
 waist and little by little he opens the 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:34.920
 cut is American almost reaches the ankle 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.700
 He needs a little bit to get to 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.040
 ankle 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.490
 this cut favors a lot makes us 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.500
 even see more higher but not what 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.660
 they create although I get very down the skirt 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.950
 this special cut is very good 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.650
 because it's not exactly below the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.780
 knee but a lot much more down is 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.370
 drained and fixed they have none 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.900
 lan anything because that will make 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.700
 increase and what we are looking for is that 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.770
 favor all kinds of bodies that 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.320
 hide if we have big hip thighs 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.110
 wide any little thing is for lava 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.820
 disguise in a perfect way top 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.159
 I could have used a more elegant touch 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.229
 something lycra but the truth is that to me 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.670
 I like to contrast and look for options 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.710
 also fun and why 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.240
 a shirt this shirt has 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.360
 transparency I could have used it with 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.650
 a corset of the colors that you see below 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.540
 in the skirt but the truth is that I wanted 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.840
 put something on me not to make it look very 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.570
 subtle the shoes I love because 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.570
 they have the truth of the basic color the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.119
 Nude is like having black shoes 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.799
 same function they decide they combine you 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.479
 with all these have termination in 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.030
 tip could have used sandal and it 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.369
 I also saw some colorful earrings 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.590
 I love these talents because they are going to 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.539
 highlight on those feminine touches that 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.090
 we need that they go in game with the 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.640
 lipstick that we are also and a bag 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.670
 hand because not tiny in one color 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.310
 cream color that also presents us in 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.170
 the skirt this color is clarito ideal 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.530
 to contrast and it looks great with 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.530
 this look 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.890
 Y 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.300
 now I am going to present you one more option 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.550
 wintry we are going to wear a skirt this 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.390
 type suite is a much more fabric 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.130
 hot ideal for cold weather the cut 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.010
 again it 's at the waist 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.560
 obviously long you can use it 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.980
 a little bit shorter, even a miniskirt 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.080
 of this style it looks divine also this 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.910
 kind of skirts and short out and out 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.490
 this fabric would look amazing with some 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.190
 means to me I would very much like that option 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.860
 I put on a somewhat warmer sweater is 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.270
 a pretty thin sweater is with a collar 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.010
 round you can choose a 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.860
 Neck sees monkey also would 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.709
 the color may have been black white 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.360
 cream color or until pink stick these 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.220
 colors look divine contrasting with 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.709
 this shade of gray 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.989
 the shoes I chose to be open 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.670
 if they are fixed they are not so revealing they are 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.560
 open but they are still casual and 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.959
 also adoc for any kind of 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.050
 weather they have enough laces out there 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.420
 the design is very nice and does not break with what 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.660
 who has the look 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.270
 as an accessory a large necklace has 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.160
 little details in pearls and rhinestones 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.770
 obviously respects this tonality that is 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.470
 white black and gray these are the 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.020
 colors that we present a bag 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.550
 this bag is also tiny I chose 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.590
 that they were black they could have used 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.660
 a medium bag these bags that 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.370
 they also look like envelopes they look amazing 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.530
 with these looks but if you have to look 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.640
 something petit something tiny so that 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.640
 keep the elegant 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.140
 This option I love is very flirtatious 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.120
 ideal to use also during the night 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.740
 If you do not want to wear high shoes, 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.740
 nothing happens let's start with the skirt 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.590
 it is a skirt of tÃºria I love it because 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.120
 It opens completely has many layers 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.610
 of tulle we will see them in different 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.220
 colors and height there are up to the floor 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.049
 about the most elegant in weddings above 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.630
 the knee but I like it because it's 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.440
 just below the knee reminds me of 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.390
 this gray era fascinates me this 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.250
 skirt cut also as we said 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.560
 favors the majority of bodies to 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.070
 almost almost everyone so it 's an option 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.830
 ideal the top now look for some lace 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.080
 to contrast is a very subtle lace 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.970
 it does not look so much, it's not pronounced 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.190
 neckline then we can use it the 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.680
 transparency looks divine they could use 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.540
 the black underwear so that 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.580
 it would look even more me you something color 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.250
 nude I do not want it to look but also 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.990
 could be good option the shoes are 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.700
 flash so they see that not always 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.310
 we have to go in heels nadas to all 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.830
 sides is still seeing very cute girl and 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.409
 they have applications are like between 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.749
 rockers and him 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.429
 I like them very much you can use another 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:06.860
 open shoe those that seem to be worth 

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:09.949
 ballerinas those ballet shoes be 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.479
 in divine a necklace to doc also to the 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.029
 colors that we are seeing present 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:16.610
 we see out there white we see silver and 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:18.619
 we see black is a discreet necklace is not 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.019
 so big and finally a bag 

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:21.709
 here if we are going to put spark color and 

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:24.559
 fun 

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:26.509
 the size is perfect ideal for charging 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:28.719
 also during the night and put everything 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.719
 indispensable 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.639
 and to top it off now let's close with 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.800
 a casual look at the beginning always 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.880
 I put the casuals this time I left it for 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.910
 the end so that they see that also 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.950
 can enjoy a circular skirt 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.590
 printed cut-out not stamped of some 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.480
 striking neon color if you want to 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.900
 knitted stripes whatever you want 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.880
 I found this floral is also a bit 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.130
 more winter or at night we could 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.590
 also use it at night for the short of 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.120
 the skirt and the colors that it already has 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.380
 you know that the cut I upload it up here 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.850
 you would like to put a little 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.370
 below it's fine but the ideal is 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.639
 here to serve this cut to 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.979
 disguise everything else a crop top that 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.290
 it could be a turtle neck of a 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:27.840
 shoulder of two will stretch titos this is 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:30.020
 crossed like in an x I really like that 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.639
 you only see a little abdomen 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.580
 you can use a little 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:37.470
 little shirt with a lace shirt 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.030
 any any texture you see 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.919
 amazing as long as it's ready 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.210
 it could also be white and it would be a 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.280
 ideal option 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.069
 shoes i'm wearing sandals 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.139
 beautiful in golden color to contrast 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:51.599
 so that it is something of brightness 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.949
 these are gladiator type ah I love 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:54.780
 you can use the ones you have in 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:57.150
 house and the striking colors they have 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:00.060
 are the best a little touch in the hand 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.590
 in the arm that is this bracelet that is 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.569
 see that they were many but not only 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.430
 it's one you can put it up down 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:07.889
 that moves or that does not move me I the 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.229
 I left fixed and finally a casual bag 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:12.060
 if they are fixed it has neither stamping nor 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:14.699
 has nothing I can put the indispensable 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.199
 the color is black what contrasts and 

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:19.070
 a little touch of coffee that can not be seen 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:19.070
 not bad at all 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.860
