kind of a tall person but you don't want
to<00:00:57.059> get<00:00:57.180> tangled<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.809> also<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.500> some

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
to get tangled up and also we have some

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.610 
to get tangled up and also we have some
other<00:00:59.149> interchangeable<00:01:00.149> buds<00:01:00.420> here<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
other interchangeable buds here that

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.860 
other interchangeable buds here that
help<00:01:01.829> fit<00:01:02.070> different<00:01:02.670> ear<00:01:02.820> size<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.300> well<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870

a<00:01:04.080> little<00:01:04.229> clip<00:01:04.680> there<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.040> well<00:01:06.290> already<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
a little clip there as well already and

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.640 
a little clip there as well already and
so<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.610> think<00:01:08.820> other<00:01:09.270> than<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.689> well<00:01:10.200> before<00:01:10.439> I

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
so I think other than that well before I

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.080 
so I think other than that well before I
pull<00:01:10.830> those<00:01:10.979> out<00:01:11.159> let's<00:01:11.340> look<00:01:11.460> what's<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.790> here

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
pull those out let's look what's in here

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.070 
pull those out let's look what's in here
first<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.720> all<00:01:14.090> I'm<00:01:15.090> hitting<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> camera<00:01:15.990> and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
first of all I'm hitting the camera and

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.859 
first of all I'm hitting the camera and
stuff<00:01:16.320> I'll<00:01:16.860> get<00:01:17.159> some<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.670> lot<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.540> paperwork

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
stuff I'll get some a lot of paperwork

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.179 
stuff I'll get some a lot of paperwork
here<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.140> guess<00:01:19.320> we've<00:01:19.470> got<00:01:19.590> some<00:01:19.710> instruction

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
here I guess we've got some instruction

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.980 
here I guess we've got some instruction
manuals<00:01:20.580> here<00:01:20.820> some<00:01:21.299> stuff<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:21.689> can<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.810> don't

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
manuals here some stuff we can I don't

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.630 
manuals here some stuff we can I don't
worry<00:01:22.140> about<00:01:22.290> all<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.439> stuff<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.070> let's<00:01:23.549> get

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
worry about all that stuff but let's get

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.570 
worry about all that stuff but let's get
to<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.909> star<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.390> show<00:01:24.420> here<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.580> power

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
to the star of the show here the power

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.030 
to the star of the show here the power
beats<00:01:26.939> themself<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:31.380> if<00:01:31.500> i<00:01:31.619> can<00:01:31.680> get<00:01:32.009> this

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
beats themself and if i can get this

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.420 
beats themself and if i can get this
doggone<00:01:32.670> thing<00:01:32.729> through<00:01:33.210> here<00:01:33.450> alrighty<00:01:37.430> okay

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
doggone thing through here alrighty okay

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.980 
doggone thing through here alrighty okay
so<00:01:38.490> here<00:01:38.820> are<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.909> power<00:01:39.210> beats<00:01:39.479> themselves

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
so here are the power beats themselves

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.200 
so here are the power beats themselves
here<00:01:40.220> getting<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.280> earhook<00:01:41.610> design<00:01:42.000> just

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
here getting the earhook design just

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.210
