00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.010
 Hello dear friends with you very much 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:21.070
 quite a while did not let them such issues 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.009
 but today I just recently 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.339
 I got some idea I would like to share with 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.330
 you 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:30.009
 some kind of round that helped me not one 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.259
 once and in principle i think what is 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.600
 the round can be realized even in 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.430
 present five to five battle between two 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.270
 professional teams and me 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.920
 it seems that this tactical preparation 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.350
 maybe it will turn out well in pubs it so 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.309
 exactly if you play 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:51.039
 the truth is not himself but at least plays with you 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.800
 one or better two of your teammates 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:57.519
 well for a start what is needed to 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.149
 implement this workpiece 1 2 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:04.420
 Kalashnikova could you a couple of flash 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.700
 and a sniper means asking a sniper ask 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.490
 snipers cover you up and become 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.860
 control the mida that is usually 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.000
 standard sniper should be watching 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.430
 gate this gap as soon as someone leaves 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.130
 in this area instantly kill him you 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.439
 same as the main player and principle from you 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.180
 the whole point of this round does not depend 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:32.020
 must immediately jump run just with 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.090
 device in hand or with a flash drive throw 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.439
 here is such a flash further switch 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.750
 It puts all intersect 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.860
 throw smok while this smok flies right away 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.329
 go out and run b attack here 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.500
 it all depends on your individual 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:50.530
 action since firstly it can be 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.780
 man in the window or on constructions or 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.600
 do exit the gate if there is a small 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.060
 time can also movie yourself a flash drive if 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.009
 you threw this flash drive did not meet the goats 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.640
 determining resistance in principle 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.799
 the round is already yours and it is taken from left over 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.130
 India ticks have already settled the situation there 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.510
 littering a plan check these positions dal 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.180
 how can yours fit you 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.760
 teammates firstly if you for example and 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.950
 criticism 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.959
 bandai with you, you can not jump very well 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.209
 with someone with one of your teammates then 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.579
 there is a in n controls 2a kashnikov 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.060
 jumped into this dark ran into the center 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:28.010
 the other two players so far go with 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.110
 bomb under p and can in principle 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.980
 throw such a flash drive there 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.129
 another flash drive and wait for the main point 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.609
 this round you have to go through what's the logic in 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:43.970
 what essence i explain the essence and logic means 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:46.310
 all players playing for example 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.670
 strengthen middle extremely rarely mostly 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.250
 yes what is the default of us remains on the map 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.650
 dust2 is three players go for length 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.109
 go to the length under some of their grenades 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.090
 and accept flash suction there to sculpt 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.359
 takes throw hayushki then only 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.139
 departs and then after 15-20 seconds 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.680
 round 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.940
 one of the chinese players goes medal and 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.579
 controls this area 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.370
 during this time you already long ago 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.590
 here could pass the ashes to pinch it with 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.500
 two sides all the more so this 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.959
 round can also still ride if you 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.959
 Before this, very often strain the length 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.180
 noob round saliva you can also find in 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.269
 these video guides video guides that i 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.910
 already I recorded a long time here at 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.400
 this round is possible 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:39.650
 play through the middle and in principle this 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.530
 tactic you get well and again you 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.239
 ask why spread in betlanda 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.040
 the beginning of round b, the plient is scattered in 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.230
 beginning of the round well, and he is scattered 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.269
 not much notice not much to 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.579
 the players on the b plate are by no means 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.109
 asked to squish there quickly 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.230
 other players which length 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:04:02.000
 b the pant is scattered to 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:04.310
 the player who goes mushroom who in 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.530
 principle plays chl singing as possible 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.510
 longer as long as possible stayed with the main 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.120
 a player on b plate, that is, he is there 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.919
 from threw flash drive first dahl singing 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.319
 throws away usually davis don't waste it in 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:17.840
 then you can throw a bucket there 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.970
 somehow be rejected principle then 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.520
 from here start looking at the gate if he 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.550
 watching the gates here is really something 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.030
 In fact, the chances of 50 to 50 it all depends on 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.460
 how good 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.139
 he plays in a pair of drains notices the middle 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.760
 he usually ask for a flash drive and bursts 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.280
 here everything depends on you how 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.470
 you will play some Mincu you that is 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.990
 Do I need to throw this flash drive or not? 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.150
 if you see that no one even 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.490
 didn't notice you maybe worth a try 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.820
 just go under the flash drive of your teammate 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.889
 again 2 which throws and from here 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.630
 maybe raised worth playing but again 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.840
 what is the most important element here 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.360
 1 checks this area on the device 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.100
 throws smog this smog still may not 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.530
 explode because in such cases 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.120
 need to take risks and this risk will 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.430
 justified believe me for example 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.870
 seventy percent or even at 80 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.120
 percent of this round 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.030
 you no one this could well yes relish and not 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.310
 will kill and the time that you win these 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.370
 two three seconds they can be key 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.740
 and fundamental well the main goal 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.780
 clear it is a clamp without two sides with you 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:26.570
 Arseny was hsien simulator to new 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.570
 meeting put your fingers up happy
