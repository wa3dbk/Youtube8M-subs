00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.440
You might think there was a simple answer
to this. After all, we know how to say what

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.660
most things are for: like this or that.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.730
People flock to museums like never before
so they must have their motives but when it

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.060
comes to art people get strangely afraid to
ask too directly what it might all be for

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.249
because, well, everyone except you might know
the answer already.

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:31.949
It's perhaps obvious, it's perhaps too complicated.
The result is an awkward silence and a lot of confusion.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.750
But maybe it shouldn't be that hard to say
what art is for. Maybe we can have a go at

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.690
ascribing certain rather clear purposes to
art.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.310
Here's five things that art might be able
to do for us.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.420
It's an obvious but striking fact that the
most popular works of art in the world show

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.680
pretty things: happy people, flowers in spring,
blue skies.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.940
This is the top selling post card in the world
from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.340
This enthusiasm for prettiness worries
serious types a lot.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.320
They wonder: 'have people forgotten what life
is really like?'

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:11.380
But that seems a misplaced worry. We need
pretty things close to us not because we're

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.600
in danger of forgetting the bad stuff but
because terrible problems weigh so heavily

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.520
on us that we're in danger of slipping into
despair and depression.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.060
That's why prettiness matters: it's an emblem
of hope, which is an achievement. Prettiness:

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.759
those flowers and blue skies and kids in meadows
is hope bottled and preserved, waiting for

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.159
us when we need it.

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.259
The world often requires us to put on a cheerful
facade but beneath the surface there's a lot

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.099
of sadness and regret that we can't express
from fear of seeming weird or a loser.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.980
One thing art can do is reassure us of the
normality of pain. It can be sad with and for us.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.180
Some of the world's greatest works of art
have been loved for their capacity to make

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.329
the pain that's inside all of us more publicly
visible and available.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.080
Like putting on a sad piece of music, sombre
works of art don't have to depress us, rather

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.510
they can give us the welcome feeling that
pain is part of the human condition.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.319
Art fights the false optimism of commercial
society. It's there to remind us with dignity

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.159
that every good life has extraordinary amounts
of confusion, suffering, loneliness and distress

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:28.480
within it. And that therefore, we should never
aggravate sadness by feeling we must be freakish

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.400
simply for experiencing it quite a lot.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.520
All of us are a little unbalanced in some
way. We're too intellectual or too emotional,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.599
too masculine or too feminine, too calm or
too excitable.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.680
The art we love is frequently something we're
drawn to because it compensates us for what

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.330
we lack. It counterbalances us.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.050
When we're moved by a work of art, it may
be because it contains concentrated doses

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.459
of qualities we need more of in our lives.
Perhaps it's full of the serenity we admire

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.220
but don't have enough of, perhaps it's got
the tenderness we long for but that our jobs

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.260
and relationships are currently lacking. Or
perhaps it's suffused with the pain and drama

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.489
we've had to stifle but want to get in touch
with.

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.870
Sometimes a whole society falls in love with
a certain style in art because it's trying

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.459
to rebalance itself: like France in the late
18th century that wanted David as a corrective

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.799
to its decadence or Britain in the 19th century
that looked to the pre-Raphaelites to counter

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.199
the effects of brutal industrialisation.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.660
The art a country or a person calls 'beautiful'
gives you vital clues as to what's missing in them.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.000
It's in the power of art to help us feel more
rounded, more balanced and more sane.

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.769
The media is constantly giving us hints about
what's glamorous and important. Art also tells

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.650
us about what's glamorous and important but,
fortunately, given that you weren't invited

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.670
again to the Oscars this year, it usually
picks on some very different things.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.920
Albrecht Durer makes grass look glamorous,
John Constable draws our attention to the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.590
skies, van Gogh reminds us that oranges are
worth paying attention to, Marcel Duchamp

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.879
challenges us again to look at the seemingly
mundane.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.609
These artists aren't falsely glamorising things
that are better ignored, they're justly teasing

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.990
out a value that's been neglected by a world
with a deeply distorted and unfair sense of

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.310
what truly matters.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.320
Art returns glamour to it's rightful place,
highlighting what's genuinely worth appreciating.

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.531
Nothing seems further from good art than propaganda,
the sort encouraging you to fight or what

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.091
government to support.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.520
But one way to think about art is that it
is a sort of propaganda in the sense of a

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.860
tool that motivates and energises you for
a cause, only it's propaganda on behalf of

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.960
some of the most important and nicest emotions
and attitudes in the world, which it uses

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.930
its skills to make newly appealing and accessible.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.640
It might be propaganda about the simple life
or about the need to broaden one's horizons,

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.669
or about a more playful, tender approach to
life. It's a force that stands up for the

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:19.080
best sides of human nature and gives them
a platform and an authority in a noisy, distracted world.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.599
For too long art has attracted a little too
much reverence and mystique for its own good.

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:30.460
In its presence we're like someone meeting
a very famous person, we get stiff and lose

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.970
our spontaneity. We should relax around it
as we already do with music and learn to use

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.950
it for what it's really meant for:

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.170
as a constant source of support and encouragement
for our better selves.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.479
It's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard,
the likes of Russell Brand come along and

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:53.039
saying something so damn ignorant is absolutely
spoon-feeding it to them.
