going to take you through a couple

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.070 
going to take you through a couple
segments<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.519> rollers<00:00:11.849> there's<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.509> few<00:00:12.719> two

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
segments of rollers there's a few two

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.060 
segments of rollers there's a few two
different<00:00:13.380> sections<00:00:13.530> we're<00:00:13.769> going<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.950> go

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
different sections we're going to go

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.799 
different sections we're going to go
through<00:00:14.309> each<00:00:14.549> one<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.269> them<00:00:15.389> have<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> turn

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
through each one of them have a turn

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.140 
through each one of them have a turn
entering<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.410> turned<00:00:16.619> exiting<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.699> yeah

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
entering and it turned exiting and yeah

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.400 
entering and it turned exiting and yeah
as<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.510> go<00:00:18.600> through<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:18.869> I'll<00:00:19.020> talk<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.320> your

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
as we go through this I'll talk to your

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.240 
as we go through this I'll talk to your
way<00:00:19.500> through<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:20.810> roars<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:21.990> tracks<00:00:22.260> are<00:00:22.470> all

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
way through it roars on tracks are all

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.880 
way through it roars on tracks are all
different<00:00:23.490> types<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.090> styles<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.539> rollers

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
different types and styles of rollers

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.320 
different types and styles of rollers
they're<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.460> different<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.000> fact<00:00:27.210> that

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
they're so so different in the fact that

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.150 
they're so so different in the fact that
the<00:00:27.660> way<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.869> come<00:00:28.140> into<00:00:28.320> them<00:00:28.500> we<00:00:28.650> exit<00:00:29.070> them

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
the way you come into them we exit them

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.040 
the way you come into them we exit them
there's<00:00:29.880> three<00:00:30.390> or<00:00:30.480> four<00:00:30.510> ways<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:30.960> get

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
there's three or four ways you can get

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.120 
there's three or four ways you can get
through<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.349> can<00:00:31.470> double<00:00:31.800> through<00:00:31.980> them

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
through and you can double through them

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.200 
through and you can double through them
you<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.460> triple<00:00:32.700> through<00:00:32.940> them<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.180> can

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
you can triple through them you can

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.240 
you can triple through them you can
hammer<00:00:34.079> through<00:00:34.440> them<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.710> can<00:00:34.739> manual

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
hammer through them you can manual

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.470 
hammer through them you can manual
through<00:00:35.430> them<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.670> wheel<00:00:35.850> tap<00:00:36.149> through<00:00:36.390> them

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
through them you wheel tap through them

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.569 
through them you wheel tap through them
so<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.050> all<00:00:37.200> depends<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.680> your<00:00:37.980> entrance<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
so it all depends on your entrance and

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.940 
so it all depends on your entrance and
your<00:00:38.670> exit<00:00:39.059> at<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.180> turn<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.840> rollers<00:00:40.649> here<00:00:40.800> at

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
your exit at the turn so rollers here at

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.069 
your exit at the turn so rollers here at
Paul<00:00:41.190> today<00:00:41.520> there's<00:00:42.000> not<00:00:42.360> very<00:00:42.390> many<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.899> them

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
Paul today there's not very many of them

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.779 
Paul today there's not very many of them
but<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.469> very<00:00:43.680> critical<00:00:43.920> how<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.340> will<00:00:44.670> get

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
but it's very critical how you will get

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.130 
but it's very critical how you will get
through<00:00:45.030> them<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.390> sense<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.719> there's<00:00:46.020> an

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
through them the sense that there's an

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.080 
through them the sense that there's an
inside<00:00:46.500> line<00:00:46.710> an<00:00:46.860> outside<00:00:47.219> line<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.969> it's

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
inside line an outside line and it's

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.760 
inside line an outside line and it's
drinking<00:00:48.450> up<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.690> segment<00:00:49.079> trip<00:00:49.289> point<00:00:49.620> A<00:00:49.739> to

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
drinking up that segment trip point A to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.500 
drinking up that segment trip point A to
point<00:00:49.890> B<00:00:50.160> if<00:00:50.489> that's<00:00:50.670> possible<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.390> can

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
point B if that's possible so you can

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.130 
point B if that's possible so you can
have<00:00:51.629> momentum<00:00:52.020> all<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> way<00:00:52.469> through<00:00:54.140> this

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
have momentum all the way through this

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.540 
have momentum all the way through this
first<00:00:55.379> section<00:00:55.590> here<00:00:55.829> at<00:00:55.920> Paul<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.280> dirt<00:00:56.430> at

first section here at Paul the dirt at

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.099 
first section here at Paul the dirt at
Paul<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.910> kind<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.210> an<00:00:57.329> anomaly<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.809> itself

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
Paul is kind of an anomaly in itself

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.380 
Paul is kind of an anomaly in itself
it's<00:00:58.350> very<00:00:58.410> look<00:00:59.070> very<00:00:59.280> tacky<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.820> very<00:01:00.030> very

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
it's very look very tacky and very very

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.420 
it's very look very tacky and very very
welcoming<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.170> quite<00:01:01.829> slippery<00:01:02.190> and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
welcoming but it's quite slippery and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.579 
welcoming but it's quite slippery and
you<00:01:02.789> know<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.300> go<00:01:03.420> through<00:01:03.660> them<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:04.049> tend<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
you know as I go through them I tend to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.050 
you know as I go through them I tend to
lose<00:01:04.769> traction<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.369> know<00:01:05.489> exiting<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
lose traction you know exiting the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.429 
lose traction you know exiting the
inside<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.570> turn<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.020> don't<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.320> to

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
inside of the turn so you don't have to

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.080 
inside of the turn so you don't have to
do<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.710> make<00:01:08.159> sure<00:01:08.189> I've<00:01:08.430> plenty<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.850> pressure

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
do is make sure I've plenty of pressure

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.390 
do is make sure I've plenty of pressure
on<00:01:09.240> my<00:01:09.390> outside<00:01:09.570> foot<00:01:09.990> why<00:01:10.350> when<00:01:10.830> I'm<00:01:10.920> exiting

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
on my outside foot why when I'm exiting

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.120 
on my outside foot why when I'm exiting
turn<00:01:11.610> as<00:01:12.090> I'm<00:01:12.360> entering<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.780> turn<00:01:12.990> I'm<00:01:13.530> making

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
turn as I'm entering the turn I'm making

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.590 
turn as I'm entering the turn I'm making
sure<00:01:14.189> I'm<00:01:14.250> very<00:01:14.460> light<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> front<00:01:15.299> brake

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
sure I'm very light on the front brake

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.080 
sure I'm very light on the front brake
so<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.810> don't<00:01:15.960> cut<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.350> front<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.650> your

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
so I don't cut that front of your

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.730 
so I don't cut that front of your
biggest<00:01:17.780> things<00:01:17.960> that<00:01:17.990> goes<00:01:18.170> down<00:01:18.320> roller

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
biggest things that goes down roller

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.590 
biggest things that goes down roller
just<00:01:19.009> especially<00:01:19.759> when<00:01:19.880> there's<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.090> turn<00:01:20.329> is

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
just especially when there's a turn is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.929 
just especially when there's a turn is
guys<00:01:21.079> them<00:01:21.289> to<00:01:21.380> swap<00:01:21.649> out<00:01:21.890> and<00:01:22.399> they<00:01:22.549> let<00:01:22.759> off

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
guys them to swap out and they let off

have enough Drive to get double in or
carry<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.650> bunch<00:03:13.800> momentum<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:14.280> what<00:03:14.400> I've<00:03:14.490> done

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.340 
carry a bunch momentum so what I've done
is<00:03:14.760> like<00:03:14.850> get<00:03:15.060> my<00:03:15.180> head<00:03:15.330> over<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.540> bars<00:03:15.780> finger
