00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.049
 Hello everyone, today we make the recipe 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.900
 salt 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:19.480
 I especially think an appetizer is 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.960
 can define an appetizer from 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:28.029
 dimensions realized from what 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.309
 as the notes and that is the bundles with 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.920
 zucchini and trainer nothing of the rustic 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:35.590
 very simple cheese with zucchini 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.180
 speed do if you want to see how there 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.180
 I will do attested driving almost ra 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.989
 you need a roll of puff pastry 1 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:56.309
 with net to give up and the same in the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.489
 subtleties and a courgette first 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.140
 what we grate the courgette with 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.579
 mandolin so that they come of 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.579
 very thin slices 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:14.450
 I spent the puff pastry we are a little 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.100
 ruined because it's hot is a mess 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.890
 to handle the pastry then 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.289
 if a little if a little unfortunate try well 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.119
 the same so then the call grows 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.460
 all the blinds and various things come 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:32.869
 covered 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.869
 now let's cut it in half 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:41.580
 so as to create shapes so as to 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.370
 have the part under the above part for 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.820
 then make the bundle of the parts in 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.820
 even number 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:15.880
 now on the right side so seen 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:20.930
 in short we are going to put the zucchini 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.670
 put this hot even 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.300
 small part could leave her attached 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.300
 because the other 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.439
 you see flights also fundamentally to use 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.890
 the molds to make a good like 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.890
 arrive 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:52.800
 and above the zucchini we go to put the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.800
 cheese was pieces 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.990
 then take the part where I put it 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.140
 utility in the filling and we want to put 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.940
 above , the part with the ban 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.540
 if you don't want to get promised 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.370
 attacked try to detach me like him 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.170
 I said if they churn out a little the same 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.820
 on the other hand they are rustic of the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.960
 fifteen-year-old dumplings an import 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:27.420
 crush the edges and continue in 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:33.150
 this way thread will have to close you 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:39.350
 monsters but gottini until they come off 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.350
 fights are all attacked 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.980
 here are our bundles I know that 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.510
 they are not beautiful and I told them that 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.940
 the pastry and truly melts 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.040
 summer though once in 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.440
 bottom then grow and come that is not 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.080
 they see all these imperfections 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.599
 now if you want to spread us pass 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.250
 over a little slammed again if you want 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.690
 make them shinier they will put back 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.510
 simply so in the oven 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.170
 the courgette is fine also the goal is not 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.340
 enough the game 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.840
 nothing now we put in the oven 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:21.200
 preheated to around 190 degrees 190 200 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.100
 for about twenty minutes of 25 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.100
 time that dora 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.370
 here they are with the readings are beautiful but 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.490
 they're good I pointed hours 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.450
 the cheese slices also with the asiago e sono 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.490
 just very good, very tasty I hope 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:54.380
 of the sitting recipe and creates again 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:56.810
 and precisely that is nothing recommended 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.970
 as usual, I refer you to the next 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.970
 read don't kiss hello 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.960
 but once it's in the oven 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.960
 we can dispute
