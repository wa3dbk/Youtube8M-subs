 problems with the use of the

 information and secure 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.650
 Heitz aspects can be found here on the link 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.180
 from the apple website that actually 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.709
 The innovations as I said only small 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.030
 improvements actually the biggest 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.879
 was improving 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.980
 only what I'm surprised there are none 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.959
 improvement on the asx maps 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.730
 there google has in combination with 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:37.110
 tomtom in essex itself develops but 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.989
 there you have also in the factory there were many 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.739
 problems for example the eiffel tower was 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.140
 fallen 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.569
 some roads were not right 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.880
 displayed there were problems 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.640
 I am surprised that they are not here 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.829
 were improved and I'm surprised that 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.019
 no further has been added 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.470
 However, this is rumored to exist 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.780
 that in the maps app now berliner the 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.180
 So the whole city of Berlin works 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.950
 it was previously compatible parts 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.750
 berlins what I actually think quite 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.480
 Well 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.269
 Let's see what awaits us in 16.1 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.069
 then really things with the map 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.629
 we can improve the whole 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.510
 load and install 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:22.769
 just keep on accepting the more 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.359
 and that's how it's said 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.010
 did not spend a lot of space 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.260
 It's about two minutes here 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.420
 is really fast and you have 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.280
