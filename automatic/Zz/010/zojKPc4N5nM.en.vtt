00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.030 
an amazing time before yeah
I'd<00:01:31.420> imagine<00:01:31.960> I<00:01:32.079> mean<00:01:32.229> if<00:01:32.320> they've<00:01:32.470> gone<00:01:32.770> this

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
I'd imagine I mean if they've gone this

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.940 
I'd imagine I mean if they've gone this
far<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.520> tax<00:01:33.939> people<00:01:34.210> for<00:01:34.390> farts<00:01:35.049> and<00:01:35.259> waste

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
far to tax people for farts and waste

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.370 
far to tax people for farts and waste
time<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.579> money<00:01:36.729> doing<00:01:36.970> that<00:01:37.090> I<00:01:37.540> wouldn't<00:01:38.320> be

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
time and money doing that I wouldn't be

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.899 
time and money doing that I wouldn't be
surprised<00:01:38.710> if<00:01:38.740> they<00:01:38.950> were<00:01:38.979> else<00:01:39.159> here's<00:01:39.790> the

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
surprised if they were else here's the

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.819 
surprised if they were else here's the
thing<00:01:40.119> that<00:01:40.329> if<00:01:40.540> the<00:01:40.720> farting<00:01:41.200> is<00:01:41.409> really

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
thing that if the farting is really

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.950 
thing that if the farting is really
affecting<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.460> meetings<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.450> maybe<00:01:43.750> the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
affecting the meetings and maybe the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.289 
affecting the meetings and maybe the
performance<00:01:44.560> surely<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.520> Denver<00:01:45.820> Broncos<00:01:45.850> is

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
performance surely the Denver Broncos is

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:47.819 
performance surely the Denver Broncos is
partly<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:46.689> blame<00:01:46.719> because<00:01:47.200> it's<00:01:47.469> obviously

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
partly to blame because it's obviously

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.889 
partly to blame because it's obviously
due<00:01:48.009> to<00:01:48.040> dire<00:01:48.399> and<00:01:48.729> these<00:01:48.909> big<00:01:49.299> professional
