going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.079> matter<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.379> time<00:01:01.469> until

potent new cards are and we might even

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.359

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
to what hearthstone does because it's

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
talking besides me right now when's the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.270 
talking besides me right now when's the
last<00:02:34.080> time<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.470> heard<00:02:34.620> someone<00:02:35.040> talking

last time you heard someone talking

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.360 
last time you heard someone talking
about<00:02:35.670> scrolls<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.950> that's<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.160> thing

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
about scrolls and that's the thing

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.280 
about scrolls and that's the thing
that's<00:02:38.580> that's<00:02:38.880> that's<00:02:39.150> why<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.810> think<00:02:39.990> it

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
that's that's that's why I think it

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.630 
that's that's that's why I think it
might<00:02:40.380> be<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.560> problem<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:41.100> even<00:02:41.370> though<00:02:41.490> it's

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
might be a problem that even though it's

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.500 
might be a problem that even though it's
a<00:02:41.730> low<00:02:41.940> barrier<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.540> entry<00:02:42.660> only<00:02:43.500> five<00:02:43.860> bucks

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
a low barrier of entry only five bucks

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.400 
a low barrier of entry only five bucks
maybe<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.690> should<00:02:45.840> have<00:02:45.930> been<00:02:45.990> free<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.320> play

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
maybe it should have been free to play

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.480 
maybe it should have been free to play
maybe<00:02:46.680> they<00:02:46.860> should<00:02:46.980> have<00:02:47.070> chosen<00:02:47.280> a

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
maybe they should have chosen a

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.699 
maybe they should have chosen a
different<00:02:47.610> model<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.209> if<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:48.750> maybe<00:02:49.410> more

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
different model and if so maybe more

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.890 
different model and if so maybe more
people<00:02:49.890> would<00:02:50.100> be<00:02:50.250> talking<00:02:50.730> about<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:51.090> cuz<00:02:51.720> I

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
people would be talking about it cuz I

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.880 
people would be talking about it cuz I
didn't<00:02:52.230> think<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.470> was<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.620> bad<00:02:53.040> game<00:02:53.400> but<00:02:53.850> I

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
didn't think it was a bad game but I

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.949 
didn't think it was a bad game but I
don't<00:02:55.890> know<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.220> don't<00:02:56.490> know<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:57.330> last<00:02:57.630> up<00:02:57.840> a

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
heavily for about a week but then I got

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.570 
heavily for about a week but then I got
kind<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.470> bored<00:03:22.650> because<00:03:22.890> besides<00:03:23.220> the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
kind of bored because besides the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.150 
kind of bored because besides the
building<00:03:24.000> which<00:03:24.269> by<00:03:24.720> itself<00:03:25.080> was<00:03:25.380> great<00:03:25.650> there

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
building which by itself was great there

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.580 
building which by itself was great there
wasn't<00:03:26.519> much<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.700> do<00:03:27.090> now<00:03:27.600> they<00:03:27.810> since<00:03:28.140> added

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
wasn't much to do now they since added

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.860 
wasn't much to do now they since added
combat<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.730> talked<00:03:30.269> about<00:03:30.390> this<00:03:30.660> in<00:03:30.720> the

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
combat and I talked about this in the

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.290 
combat and I talked about this in the
force<00:03:31.170> feed<00:03:31.440> some<00:03:32.400> time<00:03:32.670> ago<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:32.970> few<00:03:33.239> months

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
force feed some time ago a few months

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.970 
force feed some time ago a few months
ago<00:03:33.660> how<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.019> was<00:03:34.140> going<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.320> go<00:03:34.470> back<00:03:34.650> in<00:03:34.860> and

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
ago how I was going to go back in and

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.090 
ago how I was going to go back in and
check<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.190> out<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:36.209> did<00:03:36.540> but<00:03:37.100> unfortunately

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
check it out and I did but unfortunately

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.699 
check it out and I did but unfortunately
just<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.540> gameplay<00:03:39.540> like<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.930> movement<00:03:40.590> and

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
just the gameplay like the movement and

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.830 
just the gameplay like the movement and
the<00:03:40.800> combat<00:03:41.400> itself<00:03:41.700> didn't<00:03:42.150> feel<00:03:42.390> very<00:03:42.420> good

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
the combat itself didn't feel very good

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.350 
the combat itself didn't feel very good
so<00:03:43.320> this<00:03:43.769> is<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:43.950> game<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.400> am<00:03:44.700> continuously

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
so this is a game that I am continuously

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.390 
so this is a game that I am continuously
keeping<00:03:45.840> tabs<00:03:46.140> on<00:03:46.410> partially<00:03:47.100> because<00:03:47.220> I

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
keeping tabs on partially because I

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.620 
keeping tabs on partially because I
think<00:03:47.549> it's<00:03:47.850> interesting<00:03:48.120> what<00:03:48.480> they're

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
think it's interesting what they're

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.360 
think it's interesting what they're
doing<00:03:48.870> with<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:49.170> but<00:03:49.560> also<00:03:49.709> because<00:03:49.950> i<00:03:50.130> am

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
doing with it but also because i am

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.390 
doing with it but also because i am
anticipated<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.360> sort<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.080> follow<00:03:52.830> up<00:03:53.130> to

around<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.090> world<00:04:25.300> and<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.720> feeling<00:04:26.050> of

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
around the world and the feeling of

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.460 
around the world and the feeling of
combat<00:04:26.740> just<00:04:27.460> doesn't<00:04:27.760> feel<00:04:28.060> very<00:04:28.470> impactful

a<00:04:29.530> similar<00:04:29.980> problem<00:04:30.250> that<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:30.520> had<00:04:30.760> with<00:04:31.150> say

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
a similar problem that I had with say

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.330 
a similar problem that I had with say
for<00:04:31.600> example<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:32.080> Elder<00:04:32.320> Scrolls<00:04:32.350> online<00:04:32.740> it

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
for example the Elder Scrolls online it

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.430 
for example the Elder Scrolls online it
just<00:04:33.550> doesn't<00:04:34.150> feel<00:04:34.240> weighty<00:04:34.630> and<00:04:34.900> heavy<00:04:35.170> and

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
just doesn't feel weighty and heavy and

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.530 
just doesn't feel weighty and heavy and
and<00:04:35.860> that's<00:04:35.980> something<00:04:36.280> that<00:04:36.460> I<00:04:36.760> hope<00:04:37.240> gets

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
and that's something that I hope gets

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.150
