00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.710 
it was really good it was lots of fun i
must<00:00:16.100> admit<00:00:16.400> and<00:00:16.640> it<00:00:17.060> wasn't<00:00:17.240> quite<00:00:17.480> as

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
must admit and it wasn't quite as

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.840 
must admit and it wasn't quite as
expecting<00:00:18.380> it<00:00:18.470> to<00:00:18.590> be<00:00:18.619> but<00:00:18.920> it<00:00:19.070> was<00:00:19.220> that<00:00:19.430> it's

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
expecting it to be but it was that it's

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.310 
expecting it to be but it was that it's
actually<00:00:20.029> really<00:00:20.300> quite<00:00:20.570> hard<00:00:20.810> getting<00:00:21.170> in

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
actually really quite hard getting in

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.050 
actually really quite hard getting in
there<00:00:21.500> and<00:00:21.650> using<00:00:22.189> the<00:00:22.279> different<00:00:22.430> things<00:00:22.760> the

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
there and using the different things the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.750 
there and using the different things the
resistance<00:00:23.540> in<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:23.689> water<00:00:23.750> being<00:00:24.439> cool

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.329 

break

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:29.339 
break

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.950 
break
it<00:00:30.339> was<00:00:30.429> really<00:00:30.579> fun<00:00:30.699> and<00:00:30.880> I<00:00:31.089> think<00:00:31.119> I<00:00:31.720> can

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
it was really fun and I think I can

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.630 
it was really fun and I think I can
totally<00:00:32.140> clearly<00:00:32.529> up<00:00:32.649> the<00:00:32.890> attraction<00:00:33.309> to<00:00:33.489> it

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
totally clearly up the attraction to it

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.639 
totally clearly up the attraction to it
wise<00:00:33.850> it<00:00:34.000> will<00:00:34.090> go<00:00:34.270> and<00:00:34.449> enjoy<00:00:34.600> it<00:00:34.930> at<00:00:35.379> the<00:00:35.469> same

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
wise it will go and enjoy it at the same

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.310 
wise it will go and enjoy it at the same
time<00:00:35.860> you're<00:00:36.070> doing<00:00:36.280> a<00:00:36.340> lot<00:00:36.460> of<00:00:36.690> activities<00:00:37.690> so

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
time you're doing a lot of activities so

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.500 
time you're doing a lot of activities so
the<00:00:38.590> Hydra<00:00:38.920> discs<00:00:39.250> were<00:00:39.430> really<00:00:39.670> good<00:00:39.879> they

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
the Hydra discs were really good they

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.569 
the Hydra discs were really good they
worked<00:00:40.719> really<00:00:41.079> hard<00:00:41.230> under<00:00:41.620> water<00:00:41.890> they<00:00:42.519> were

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
worked really hard under water they were

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.729 
worked really hard under water they were
really<00:00:43.059> good<00:00:43.180> really<00:00:43.989> easy<00:00:44.230> to<00:00:44.379> use<00:00:44.410> the

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
really good really easy to use the

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.170 
really good really easy to use the
deeper<00:00:45.070> you<00:00:45.160> went<00:00:45.309> underwater<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:45.879> harder

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
deeper you went underwater the harder

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.610 
deeper you went underwater the harder
they<00:00:46.300> were<00:00:46.360> and<00:00:46.750> they<00:00:46.839> really<00:00:47.230> really<00:00:47.379> worked

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
they were and they really really worked

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.649 
they were and they really really worked
a<00:00:47.769> rough<00:00:47.920> body<00:00:48.159> and<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:49.000> kickboard<00:00:49.420> is

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:49.659 
a rough body and the kickboard is

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:51.270 
a rough body and the kickboard is
brilliant<00:00:50.140> because<00:00:50.260> it's<00:00:50.559> really<00:00:50.829> and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
brilliant because it's really and

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.069 
brilliant because it's really and
emphasizes<00:00:51.970> one<00:00:52.149> part<00:00:52.390> of<00:00:52.449> your<00:00:52.540> body<00:00:52.600> so<00:00:52.930> this

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
emphasizes one part of your body so this

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.049 
emphasizes one part of your body so this
really<00:00:53.350> works<00:00:53.649> on<00:00:53.890> just<00:00:54.100> your<00:00:54.220> legs<00:00:54.399> while<00:00:55.000> you

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
really works on just your legs while you

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.250 
really works on just your legs while you
give<00:00:55.210> your<00:00:55.300> arms<00:00:55.449> a<00:00:55.629> little<00:00:55.659> bit<00:00:55.960> of<00:00:55.989> a<00:00:56.079> rest

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
give your arms a little bit of a rest

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.080 
give your arms a little bit of a rest
from<00:00:56.500> Louisville<00:00:57.339> the<00:00:57.460> other

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
from Louisville the other

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.580 
from Louisville the other
so<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.570> great<00:00:58.780> thing<00:00:58.810> about<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.350> Act<00:00:59.470> the

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
so the great thing about the Act the

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.930 
so the great thing about the Act the
dumbbells<00:00:59.950> is<00:01:00.100> that<00:01:00.250> they're<00:01:00.430> a<00:01:00.580> little<00:01:00.790> bit

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
dumbbells is that they're a little bit

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.000 
dumbbells is that they're a little bit
opposite<00:01:01.330> to<00:01:01.450> what<00:01:01.570> you<00:01:01.810> use<00:01:02.020> on<00:01:02.140> land<00:01:02.410> so<00:01:02.740> you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
opposite to what you use on land so you

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.200 
opposite to what you use on land so you
want<00:01:03.190> them<00:01:03.310> to<00:01:03.430> go<00:01:03.550> deeper<00:01:03.820> in<00:01:03.970> the<00:01:04.059> water

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
want them to go deeper in the water

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.420 
want them to go deeper in the water
because<00:01:04.629> they<00:01:04.870> try<00:01:05.080> and<00:01:05.110> flow<00:01:05.410> so<00:01:05.980> you<00:01:06.070> work<00:01:06.280> in

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
because they try and flow so you work in

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.740 
because they try and flow so you work in
sort<00:01:06.610> of<00:01:06.640> different<00:01:06.850> muscles<00:01:07.390> but<00:01:07.630> it's

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
sort of different muscles but it's

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.330 
sort of different muscles but it's
really<00:01:07.930> good<00:01:08.170> it's<00:01:08.680> like<00:01:08.770> resistance

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
really good it's like resistance

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.670 
really good it's like resistance
training<00:01:09.670> as<00:01:09.880> well<00:01:09.910> and<00:01:10.540> again<00:01:10.660> sort<00:01:11.110> of<00:01:11.200> the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
training as well and again sort of the

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.020 
training as well and again sort of the
deeper<00:01:12.010> you<00:01:12.100> go<00:01:12.250> in<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.400> water<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.820> hard

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
deeper you go in the water the hard

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.210 
deeper you go in the water the hard
things<00:01:13.300> are<00:01:13.510> so<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.470> mini<00:01:14.619> kick<00:01:14.860> board<00:01:15.070> is

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
things are so the mini kick board is

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.980 
things are so the mini kick board is
very<00:01:15.490> similar<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.060> big<00:01:16.300> kick<00:01:16.479> board<00:01:16.750> it

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
very similar to the big kick board it

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.660 
very similar to the big kick board it
really<00:01:17.260> works<00:01:17.440> your<00:01:17.680> lower<00:01:17.710> body<00:01:18.010> and<00:01:18.400> it's<00:01:18.610> a

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
really works your lower body and it's a

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.400 
really works your lower body and it's a
bit<00:01:18.850> harder<00:01:19.210> because<00:01:19.360> it's<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.690> lot<00:01:19.810> smaller<00:01:19.990> so

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
bit harder because it's a lot smaller so

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.050 
bit harder because it's a lot smaller so
you<00:01:20.470> have<00:01:20.650> to<00:01:20.770> try<00:01:20.979> and<00:01:21.100> float<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.490> lot<00:01:21.640> more<00:01:21.850> on

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
you have to try and float a lot more on

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.300 
you have to try and float a lot more on
it<00:01:22.210> but<00:01:22.630> it's<00:01:23.020> a<00:01:23.440> really<00:01:23.650> good<00:01:23.830> way<00:01:23.979> to<00:01:24.040> work

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
it but it's a really good way to work

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.070 
it but it's a really good way to work
your<00:01:24.490> legs<00:01:24.580> so<00:01:25.270> these<00:01:25.390> are<00:01:25.450> active<00:01:25.840> left

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
your legs so these are active left

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.970 
your legs so these are active left
they're<00:01:26.410> brilliant<00:01:26.619> for<00:01:27.100> assistance

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
they're brilliant for assistance

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.190 
they're brilliant for assistance
they're<00:01:28.700> very<00:01:28.850> similar<00:01:29.060> to<00:01:29.300> paddles<00:01:29.780> which<00:01:29.990> i

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
they're very similar to paddles which i

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.810 
they're very similar to paddles which i
think<00:01:30.320> i<00:01:30.620> might<00:01:30.770> take<00:01:31.070> home<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.490> use<00:01:31.610> one<00:01:31.790> of

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
think i might take home and use one of

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.160 
think i might take home and use one of
my<00:01:31.970> training<00:01:32.270> sessions<00:01:32.690> back<00:01:32.840> at<00:01:32.990> home

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
my training sessions back at home

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.900 
my training sessions back at home
they're<00:01:33.710> really<00:01:33.830> good<00:01:34.070> for<00:01:34.220> resistance<00:01:34.700> and

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
they're really good for resistance and

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.000 
they're really good for resistance and
an<00:01:35.120> upper<00:01:35.360> body<00:01:35.540> work<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:36.110> great<00:01:36.410> the<00:01:36.560> technique

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
an upper body work a great the technique

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.630 
an upper body work a great the technique
it's<00:01:37.640> just<00:01:37.790> a<00:01:37.880> lil<00:01:38.000> bit<00:01:38.120> more

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it's just a lil bit more

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.640 
it's just a lil bit more
so<00:01:39.120> this<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.690> Aqua<00:01:39.930> belt<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.380> really
