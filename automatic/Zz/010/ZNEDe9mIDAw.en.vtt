00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
Welcome friends of analog entertainment and welcome to the Spielwiese in Berlin Friedrichshain

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.020
to the Hunter &amp; Cron Board Game Club!

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.040
Camel Up sends us into the desert, where we witness the craziest Camel race of all time.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.360
Camels will stack on each other and whole pyramids will stand on their heads.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.880
Success or defeat are separated only by a very thin layer of sand

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.320
Multiply or squander your hard earned Egyptian pounds in a game of "Camel Up".

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.120
Hello, I'm Melissa from the channel "Breeding Unicorns".

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.520
I am Borja and you might know me from the Youtube Channel "Doktor Allwissend".

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.520
Borja: I need a little action here.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.520
Borja: So I hop on top of the green one.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.520
Melissa: My strategy for today ..

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.091
Borja: First slowing down the two professionals and then I'm going to take care of Melissa.

00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:44.291
Melissa: Make a lot of money. But I don't know how.

00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:45.411
Borja: But Melissa...

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.900
Melissa: Maybe I try to learn from the doctor.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.080
Melissa: I stand by my garbage-camel. Team BSR!

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.020
Cron: I earn one pound, because the blue camel has satisfied his thirst at my oasis..

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.560
Hunter: You could bet on Green.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.040
Melissa. I don't even listen to you.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.840
Cron: I believe in the white Camel. It could now move White a three.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.980
Then moves Orange and then who is first? White!

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.960
Everything I have on White. My house, my pyramid.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.940
A game with animals against Hunter? Let's be serious.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.360
Hunter: The green camel always wins.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.580
Cron: I just own him in this.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.000
Borja: But a three comes rarely.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.020
Cron: Every third time only.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.020
Cron: Ohh now comes the 3! That's unreal.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.900
Hunter: No! Melissa: On top of the Green!

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.360
Melissa: Things running smoothly for me.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.000
Cron: This has worked out a lot better now.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.640
Borja: I bet on yellow.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.360
Cron: Still nobody rolled the dice?

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.340
Melissa: I bet on green.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.480
Cron: Camel Up on quite a high level, if no one rolls the dice any more. Then it gets really interesting.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.860
Cron: You wont be the last. I'll make that happen.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.960
Hunter: Unbelievable. Melissa: No! Cron: I get one coin.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.620
Melissa: The Yellow is on steroids, you can't fool me.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.760
Cron: Please Camel-God... Melissa: Noooooo!

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.980
Cron: Now... a one!

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.580
Borja: Everything is still possible.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.300
Cron: Hunter is out of this game. The duel is between me and Melissa.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.220
Hunter: I believe in green...
