persistent<00:04:15.770> and<00:04:16.040> also<00:04:16.340> wish<00:04:16.489> you<00:04:16.610> could<00:04:16.730> just

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
persistent and also wish you could just

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.670 
persistent and also wish you could just
take<00:04:17.060> off<00:04:17.270> like<00:04:17.480> for<00:04:18.050> instance<00:04:18.170> if<00:04:18.530> you're

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
take off like for instance if you're

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.070 
take off like for instance if you're
just<00:04:19.330> if<00:04:20.330> you're<00:04:20.450> just<00:04:20.570> in<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.780> water<00:04:20.989> right

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
just if you're just in the water right

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.530 
just if you're just in the water right
now<00:04:21.260> like<00:04:22.010> I<00:04:22.160> am<00:04:22.280> now<00:04:22.310> I<00:04:22.670> can't<00:04:23.000> just<00:04:23.180> take<00:04:23.360> off

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
now like I am now I can't just take off

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.960 
now like I am now I can't just take off
flying<00:04:23.840> from<00:04:24.140> the<00:04:24.230> water<00:04:24.440> I<00:04:24.710> have<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.730> grapple

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
flying from the water I have to grapple

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.300 
flying from the water I have to grapple
something<00:04:26.540> I<00:04:26.570> can't<00:04:26.750> just<00:04:26.900> take<00:04:27.080> off<00:04:27.320> which<00:04:28.160> I

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
something I can't just take off which I

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.350 
something I can't just take off which I
think<00:04:28.550> would<00:04:28.610> be<00:04:28.730> pretty<00:04:28.880> amazing<00:04:29.500> so<00:04:31.360> to

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
think would be pretty amazing so to

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.330 
think would be pretty amazing so to
finish<00:04:32.570> our<00:04:32.900> lag<00:04:33.350> test<00:04:33.800> that's<00:04:34.010> actually

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
finish our lag test that's actually

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.700 
finish our lag test that's actually
doing<00:04:34.520> really<00:04:34.550> well<00:04:35.090> I<00:04:35.420> thought<00:04:36.290> we<00:04:36.470> might

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
doing really well I thought we might

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.470 
doing really well I thought we might
cause<00:04:37.070> some<00:04:37.780> chaos<00:04:39.160> somewhere<00:04:40.160> so<00:04:41.120> what<00:04:41.300> not

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
cause some chaos somewhere so what not

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.140 
cause some chaos somewhere so what not
more<00:04:41.780> to<00:04:41.930> fly<00:04:42.290> over<00:04:42.320> into<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:42.950> city<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.520> my

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
more to fly over into the city and my

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.270 
more to fly over into the city and my
matrix<00:04:44.570> style<00:04:45.670> come<00:04:46.670> down<00:04:46.880> here<00:04:48.040> let's<00:04:49.040> call

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
matrix style come down here let's call

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.410 
matrix style come down here let's call
some<00:04:49.460> have<00:04:49.640> it<00:04:49.790> look<00:04:49.910> at<00:04:50.000> this<00:04:50.060> pretty<00:04:50.300> little

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
some have it look at this pretty little

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.710 
some have it look at this pretty little
bird<00:04:51.430> this<00:04:52.430> bird's<00:04:52.730> awesome<00:04:53.240> a<00:04:53.330> check<00:04:53.540> out<00:04:53.630> my

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
bird this bird's awesome a check out my

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.110 
bird this bird's awesome a check out my
joke<00:04:53.930> gun<00:04:54.200> kills<00:04:54.830> people<00:04:55.130> one<00:04:55.340> hit<00:04:55.550> this<00:04:55.820> bird

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
joke gun kills people one hit this bird

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.770 
joke gun kills people one hit this bird
it<00:04:56.780> is<00:04:56.960> nothing<00:04:57.320> compared<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:57.980> my<00:04:58.100> Joker<00:04:58.370> gun

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
it is nothing compared to my Joker gun

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.970 
it is nothing compared to my Joker gun
okay<00:04:59.780> maybe<00:04:59.990> it<00:05:00.140> is<00:05:00.290> but<00:05:00.680> it's<00:05:00.830> nothing

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
okay maybe it is but it's nothing

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.490 
okay maybe it is but it's nothing
compared<00:05:01.250> to<00:05:01.310> my<00:05:01.400> rockets<00:05:02.200> now<00:05:03.200> with<00:05:03.410> these

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
compared to my rockets now with these

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.050 
compared to my rockets now with these
rockets<00:05:04.070> this<00:05:04.310> is<00:05:04.460> where<00:05:04.700> it's<00:05:04.820> going<00:05:04.970> to

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
rockets this is where it's going to

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.550 
rockets this is where it's going to
start<00:05:05.330> slowing<00:05:05.600> down<00:05:05.840> it's<00:05:06.140> going<00:05:06.260> to<00:05:06.350> start

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
start slowing down it's going to start

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.500 
start slowing down it's going to start
dropping<00:05:07.010> frame<00:05:07.250> rate<00:05:07.490> but<00:05:08.060> it's<00:05:08.270> going<00:05:08.450> to

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
dropping frame rate but it's going to

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.110 
dropping frame rate but it's going to
drop<00:05:08.690> between<00:05:08.930> 30<00:05:09.500> and<00:05:09.620> 50<00:05:09.920> right<00:05:10.760> now<00:05:10.940> it's

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
drop between 30 and 50 right now it's

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.750 
drop between 30 and 50 right now it's
been<00:05:11.360> even<00:05:11.600> 50<00:05:12.140> and<00:05:12.350> let's<00:05:13.070> see<00:05:13.250> if<00:05:13.280> we<00:05:13.490> can<00:05:13.640> get

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
been even 50 and let's see if we can get

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.810 
been even 50 and let's see if we can get
the<00:05:13.940> drop<00:05:13.970> down<00:05:14.510> past<00:05:14.900> 30<00:05:15.550> okay<00:05:16.550> well<00:05:16.730> I'm

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
the drop down past 30 okay well I'm

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.320 
the drop down past 30 okay well I'm
aiming<00:05:17.120> for<00:05:17.380> 40<00:05:18.400> 30<00:05:19.400> I<00:05:19.550> supposed<00:05:19.910> to<00:05:20.030> find<00:05:20.180> get

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
aiming for 40 30 I supposed to find get

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.540 
aiming for 40 30 I supposed to find get
it<00:05:20.420> under<00:05:20.690> 30

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
it under 30

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.820 
it under 30
and<00:05:22.180> what's<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:22.960> worst<00:05:23.140> I<00:05:23.320> can<00:05:23.380> get<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.620> frame

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
and what's the worst I can get the frame

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.870 
and what's the worst I can get the frame
rate<00:05:28.560> around<00:05:29.560> 15<00:05:30.160> is<00:05:30.370> the<00:05:30.490> worst<00:05:30.670> I<00:05:30.820> can

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
rate around 15 is the worst I can

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.120 
rate around 15 is the worst I can
possibly<00:05:31.240> get<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.450> frame<00:05:31.660> rate<00:05:31.920> but<00:05:32.920> then<00:05:33.040> I

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
possibly get the frame rate but then I

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.090 
possibly get the frame rate but then I
stopped<00:05:33.400> shooting<00:05:34.530> everything<00:05:35.530> calms<00:05:36.010> down

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
stopped shooting everything calms down

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.880 
stopped shooting everything calms down
frame<00:05:36.730> rate<00:05:36.940> goes<00:05:37.120> back<00:05:37.360> to<00:05:37.510> 30<00:05:37.780> then<00:05:38.200> back<00:05:38.710> at

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
frame rate goes back to 30 then back at

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.740 
frame rate goes back to 30 then back at
50<00:05:39.600> so<00:05:40.830> you<00:05:41.830> can<00:05:42.040> definitely<00:05:42.370> over<00:05:43.300> run<00:05:43.510> it<00:05:43.540> I

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
50 so you can definitely over run it I

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.020 
50 so you can definitely over run it I
mean<00:05:44.290> I'm<00:05:44.740> sure<00:05:44.770> if<00:05:45.070> i<00:05:45.190> put<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:45.490> settings<00:05:45.820> down

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
mean I'm sure if i put the settings down

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.880 
mean I'm sure if i put the settings down
to<00:05:46.390> make<00:05:46.570> this<00:05:46.720> not<00:05:46.900> look<00:05:47.110> as<00:05:47.290> good<00:05:47.470> because

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
to make this not look as good because

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.040 
to make this not look as good because
it's<00:05:48.430> at<00:05:48.580> very<00:05:48.850> high<00:05:48.970> settings<00:05:49.510> right<00:05:49.690> now<00:05:49.810> i

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
it's at very high settings right now i

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.840 
it's at very high settings right now i
think<00:05:50.200> it's<00:05:50.500> up<00:05:50.680> the<00:05:50.830> highest<00:05:51.130> you<00:05:51.160> can<00:05:51.250> do<00:05:51.580> and

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
think it's up the highest you can do and

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.940 
think it's up the highest you can do and
if<00:05:52.510> i<00:05:52.600> drop<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:53.020> settings<00:05:53.380> down<00:05:53.590> that<00:05:53.860> i'm

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
if i drop the settings down that i'm

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.060 
if i drop the settings down that i'm
sure<00:05:54.220> it<00:05:54.520> would<00:05:54.670> run<00:05:55.000> the<00:05:55.150> 50<00:05:55.480> all<00:05:55.660> the<00:05:55.810> way<00:05:56.070> but

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
sure it would run the 50 all the way but

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.470 
sure it would run the 50 all the way but
that's<00:05:57.280> only<00:05:57.430> a<00:05:57.550> little<00:05:57.700> bit<00:05:57.880> of<00:05:57.970> lag<00:05:58.150> I'm<00:05:58.360> not

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 
that's only a little bit of lag I'm not

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.240 
that's only a little bit of lag I'm not
blowing<00:05:58.660> a<00:05:58.810> lot<00:05:58.900> of<00:05:59.050> stuff<00:05:59.260> up<00:05:59.440> I'm<00:05:59.620> having<00:05:59.920> fun

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
blowing a lot of stuff up I'm having fun

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.310 
blowing a lot of stuff up I'm having fun
flying<00:06:00.790> around<00:06:01.210> and<00:06:01.510> shooting<00:06:01.870> people<00:06:02.290> with

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
flying around and shooting people with

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.860 
flying around and shooting people with
my<00:06:02.530> pistol<00:06:02.770> and<00:06:03.220> I'm<00:06:03.340> you<00:06:04.060> know<00:06:04.240> it's<00:06:04.390> still<00:06:04.630> I

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
my pistol and I'm you know it's still I

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.120 
my pistol and I'm you know it's still I
don't<00:06:05.020> think<00:06:05.200> it's<00:06:05.290> too<00:06:05.440> bad<00:06:05.590> at<00:06:05.770> all<00:06:05.860> we're
