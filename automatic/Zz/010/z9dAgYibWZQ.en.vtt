you<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.220> use<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.430> with<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> handgun<00:01:39.600> or<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.350> also

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
you can use it with a handgun or it also

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.440 
you can use it with a handgun or it also
helps<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:40.890> anti-roll<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.060> that's<00:01:42.210> what<00:01:42.360> this

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
helps with anti-roll so that's what this

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.200 
helps with anti-roll so that's what this
is<00:01:42.509> for<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.439> then<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> charging

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
is for and then you have the charging

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.660 
is for and then you have the charging
cable<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.140> charge<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.439> off<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> USB<00:01:47.399> if

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
cable so this charge is off of USB if

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.520 
cable so this charge is off of USB if
you're<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.000> me<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.390> probably<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.930> about<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
you're like me you probably have about a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.050 
you're like me you probably have about a
million<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> little<00:01:50.280> adapters<00:01:50.759> where<00:01:51.000> you

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
million of the little adapters where you

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.210 
million of the little adapters where you
can<00:01:51.180> take<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.869> make<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.860> where<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.159> can

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
can take this and make it where you can

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.310 
can take this and make it where you can
charge<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.759> your<00:01:53.880> car<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.360> your<00:01:54.509> home<00:01:54.689> but

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
charge it in your car in your home but

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.630 
charge it in your car in your home but
if<00:01:55.439> not<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.829> get<00:01:56.009> them<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.250> eBay<00:01:56.610> and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
if not you can get them on eBay and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.370 
if not you can get them on eBay and

you only want to use this with

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.480 
you only want to use this with
rechargeable<00:02:17.319> batteries<00:02:17.770> I<00:02:17.980> know<00:02:18.310> that

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
rechargeable batteries I know that

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.070 
rechargeable batteries I know that
sounds<00:02:18.790> obvious<00:02:18.910> but<00:02:19.180> we<00:02:19.420> get<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.690> question

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
sounds obvious but we get that question

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.840 
sounds obvious but we get that question
a<00:02:20.140> lot<00:02:20.170> with<00:02:20.440> these<00:02:20.560> kind<00:02:20.770> of<00:02:20.800> lights<00:02:21.010> don't

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
a lot with these kind of lights don't

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.900 
a lot with these kind of lights don't
try<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.209> recharge<00:02:22.980> cr123<00:02:23.980> because<00:02:24.610> this<00:02:24.760> will

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
try to recharge cr123 because this will

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.940 
try to recharge cr123 because this will
take<00:02:25.120> cr123<00:02:26.080> is<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:26.230> will<00:02:26.319> take<00:02:26.470> two<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.680> them

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
take cr123 is it will take two of them

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.979 
take cr123 is it will take two of them
but<00:02:27.520> it's<00:02:28.390> meant<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.810> be<00:02:28.840> used<00:02:29.200> with<00:02:29.530> an<00:02:29.800> 18<00:02:30.280> 650

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
but it's meant to be used with an 18 650

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.809 
but it's meant to be used with an 18 650
so<00:02:31.989> that<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.410> point<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:33.190> charging

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
so that is the point of the charging

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.570 
so that is the point of the charging
cable<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.660> does<00:02:34.840> not<00:02:34.989> come<00:02:35.170> with<00:02:35.319> a<00:02:35.350> battery

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
cable it does not come with a battery

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.790 
cable it does not come with a battery
but<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.819> does<00:02:37.000> take<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.300> single<00:02:37.690> 18<00:02:38.050> 650<00:02:38.410> so

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
but it does take a single 18 650 so

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.900 
but it does take a single 18 650 so
we're<00:02:38.920> going<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.100> go<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.280> take<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.550> tail<00:02:39.730> cap

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
we're going to go and take the tail cap

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.880 
we're going to go and take the tail cap
off<00:02:40.120> actually<00:02:40.989> we<00:02:41.080> are<00:02:41.200> going<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.500> show<00:02:41.709> it<00:02:41.830> to

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
off actually we are going to show it to

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.390 
off actually we are going to show it to
you<00:02:42.130> in<00:02:42.580> greater<00:02:42.940> detail<00:02:43.390> first<00:02:44.100> just<00:02:45.100> you<00:02:45.250> can

like this size it's not going to be

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.630 
like this size it's not going to be
great<00:03:05.440> just<00:03:05.650> because<00:03:05.830> of<00:03:06.069> the<00:03:06.160> size<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.580> the

great just because of the size of the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.400 
great just because of the size of the
LED<00:03:07.030> but<00:03:07.630> it's<00:03:07.840> not<00:03:07.959> going<00:03:08.050> to<00:03:08.140> be<00:03:08.230> too<00:03:08.380> bad

tail<00:03:13.330> cap<00:03:13.569> halfway<00:03:13.900> screwed<00:03:14.140> off<00:03:14.260> but<00:03:14.830> there's

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
tail cap halfway screwed off but there's

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.640 
tail cap halfway screwed off but there's
the<00:03:15.640> switch<00:03:15.850> on<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.090> end<00:03:16.330> with<00:03:17.019> their<00:03:17.200> logo<00:03:17.500> on

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
the switch on the end with their logo on

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.740 
the switch on the end with their logo on
it<00:03:17.799> stainless<00:03:18.610> steel<00:03:18.790> on<00:03:18.970> both<00:03:19.180> ends<00:03:19.450> so<00:03:19.600> it

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
it stainless steel on both ends so it

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.289 
it stainless steel on both ends so it
helps<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.019> protect<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.709> light<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:22.150> if<00:03:22.209> you

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
helps to protect the light so if you

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.569 
helps to protect the light so if you
drop<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.720> those<00:03:23.200> are<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.380> two<00:03:23.560> points<00:03:23.950> most

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
drop it those are the two points most

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.940 
drop it those are the two points most
likely<00:03:24.850> to<00:03:25.120> hit<00:03:25.299> and<00:03:25.600> it's<00:03:26.470> good<00:03:26.590> not<00:03:26.709> going<00:03:26.890> to

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
likely to hit and it's good not going to

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.650 
likely to hit and it's good not going to
damage<00:03:27.130> your<00:03:27.400> light<00:03:27.549> as<00:03:27.760> much<00:03:27.970> as<00:03:28.239> if<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.570> was

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
damage your light as much as if it was

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.569 
damage your light as much as if it was
just<00:03:28.690> barreling<00:03:29.019> them<00:03:29.470> or<00:03:30.010> even<00:03:30.100> anodized

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
just barreling them or even anodized

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:31.800 
just barreling them or even anodized
aluminum<00:03:31.060> because<00:03:31.180> aluminum's<00:03:31.630> it's

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
aluminum because aluminum's it's

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.530 
aluminum because aluminum's it's
relatively<00:03:32.470> soft<00:03:32.799> metal<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:34.090> gets<00:03:34.269> dented

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
relatively soft metal and it gets dented

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.910 
relatively soft metal and it gets dented
up<00:03:34.750> if<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:34.989> drop<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.320> on<00:03:35.410> concrete<00:03:35.739> or

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
up if you drop it on concrete or

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.590 
up if you drop it on concrete or
something<00:03:36.160> like<00:03:36.250> that<00:03:36.310> so<00:03:37.000> stainless<00:03:37.390> steel

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
something like that so stainless steel

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.620 
something like that so stainless steel
it's<00:03:37.870> going<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.049> help<00:03:38.170> protect<00:03:38.380> everything

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
it's going to help protect everything

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.699 
it's going to help protect everything
turn<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.780> around<00:03:40.870> just<00:03:41.170> you<00:03:41.380> can<00:03:41.500> see<00:03:41.620> the

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
turn it around just you can see the

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.890 
turn it around just you can see the
different<00:03:41.980> parts<00:03:42.390> all<00:03:43.390> right<00:03:43.540> let's<00:03:43.690> going<00:03:43.840> to

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
different parts all right let's going to

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.979 
different parts all right let's going to
take<00:03:44.019> a<00:03:44.079> battery<00:03:44.410> in<00:03:44.500> here<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:46.510> since<00:03:46.750> this<00:03:46.810> is

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
take a battery in here and since this is

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.449 
take a battery in here and since this is
a<00:03:47.019> rechargeable<00:03:47.230> light<00:03:47.769> you<00:03:47.920> can<00:03:48.160> charge

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
a rechargeable light you can charge

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.430 
a rechargeable light you can charge
directly<00:03:48.760> off<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.180> light<00:03:49.420> itself<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:49.989> of

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
directly off the light itself I of

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.470 
directly off the light itself I of
course<00:03:50.500> recommend<00:03:51.190> putting<00:03:51.519> in<00:03:51.670> 18<00:03:51.940> 650<00:03:52.239> in

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
course recommend putting in 18 650 in

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.180 
course recommend putting in 18 650 in
there<00:03:52.660> because<00:03:53.200> you<00:03:53.350> get<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.560> full<00:03:53.739> benefits

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
there because you get the full benefits

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.099 
there because you get the full benefits
to<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.340> light<00:03:54.549> not<00:03:55.060> only<00:03:55.209> that<00:03:55.299> your<00:03:55.690> overall

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
to the light not only that your overall

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.569 
to the light not only that your overall
operating<00:03:56.560> cost<00:03:56.859> is<00:03:57.010> going<00:03:57.070> to<00:03:57.160> be<00:03:57.250> a<00:03:57.340> lot

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
operating cost is going to be a lot

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.030 
operating cost is going to be a lot
lower<00:03:57.760> because<00:03:58.600> keeping<00:03:59.019> on<00:03:59.200> if<00:03:59.680> you<00:03:59.769> keep<00:03:59.920> on

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
lower because keeping on if you keep on

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.360 
lower because keeping on if you keep on
replacing<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.880> cr123<00:04:01.630> s<00:04:01.690> in<00:04:01.840> here<00:04:02.220> it's<00:04:03.220> going

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
replacing the cr123 s in here it's going

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.190 
replacing the cr123 s in here it's going
to<00:04:03.430> cost<00:04:03.910> you<00:04:04.090> a<00:04:04.150> lot<00:04:04.269> in<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:04.480> long<00:04:04.600> run<00:04:04.630> if

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
to cost you a lot in the long run if

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.870 
to cost you a lot in the long run if
you're<00:04:05.650> using<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:05.980> light<00:04:06.160> a<00:04:06.190> lot<00:04:06.370> replacing

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
you're using the light a lot replacing

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.390 
you're using the light a lot replacing
the<00:04:06.940> batteries<00:04:07.269> a<00:04:07.299> lot<00:04:07.890> unless<00:04:08.890> you're<00:04:09.160> course

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
the batteries a lot unless you're course

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.130 
the batteries a lot unless you're course
your<00:04:09.640> military<00:04:10.090> or<00:04:10.299> law<00:04:10.329> enforcement<00:04:10.450> where

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
your military or law enforcement where

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.140 
your military or law enforcement where
they<00:04:11.290> just<00:04:11.470> throw<00:04:11.859> CL<00:04:12.190> 1<00:04:12.340> 2<00:04:12.459> 3<00:04:12.489> is<00:04:12.700> at<00:04:12.850> you<00:04:12.970> for

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
they just throw CL 1 2 3 is at you for

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.690 
they just throw CL 1 2 3 is at you for
free<00:04:13.329> all<00:04:13.450> day<00:04:13.600> long<00:04:13.980> then<00:04:14.980> I<00:04:15.040> suppose<00:04:15.400> there's

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
free all day long then I suppose there's

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.759 
free all day long then I suppose there's
not<00:04:16.150> much<00:04:16.299> of<00:04:16.450> a<00:04:16.479> case<00:04:16.660> for<00:04:16.900> using<00:04:17.109> in<00:04:17.200> 18<00:04:17.440> 650

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
not much of a case for using in 18 650

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.860 
not much of a case for using in 18 650
alright<00:04:18.669> so<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.000> interface<00:04:19.329> on<00:04:19.539> this<00:04:19.660> guy<00:04:19.810> is

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
alright so the interface on this guy is

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.390 
alright so the interface on this guy is
going<00:04:20.019> to<00:04:20.109> be<00:04:20.229> a<00:04:20.260> little<00:04:20.410> bit<00:04:20.530> different<00:04:20.979> than

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
going to be a little bit different than

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.310 
going to be a little bit different than
what<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.669> saw<00:04:21.880> on<00:04:21.909> the<00:04:22.090> ts20<00:04:22.810> although<00:04:23.229> you

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
what you saw on the ts20 although you

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.320 
what you saw on the ts20 although you
can<00:04:23.470> see<00:04:23.820> physically<00:04:24.820> they're<00:04:25.060> pretty<00:04:25.270> much

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
can see physically they're pretty much

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.670 
can see physically they're pretty much
the<00:04:25.450> same<00:04:25.720> light<00:04:25.990> other<00:04:26.260> than

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
the same light other than

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.480 
the same light other than
the<00:04:27.039> switch<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:27.639> the<00:04:27.940> charging<00:04:28.300> port<00:04:29.490> but

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
the switch and the charging port but

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.830 
the switch and the charging port but
instead<00:04:30.729> of<00:04:30.850> having<00:04:30.970> that<00:04:31.090> side<00:04:31.330> switch<00:04:31.630> you

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
instead of having that side switch you

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.270 
instead of having that side switch you
only<00:04:31.960> have<00:04:32.139> the<00:04:32.259> rear<00:04:32.410> switch<00:04:32.710> so<00:04:32.889> everything

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
only have the rear switch so everything

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.499 
only have the rear switch so everything
is<00:04:33.400> controlled<00:04:33.669> through<00:04:33.820> this<00:04:34.030> rear<00:04:34.270> switch

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:34.509 
is controlled through this rear switch

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.450 
is controlled through this rear switch
so<00:04:35.169> lightly<00:04:35.380> press<00:04:35.710> it<00:04:35.889> and<00:04:36.039> you<00:04:36.340> get

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
so lightly press it and you get

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.969 
so lightly press it and you get
momentary<00:04:36.940> activation<00:04:37.600> as<00:04:38.440> long<00:04:38.650> as<00:04:38.680> you<00:04:38.860> do

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
momentary activation as long as you do

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.129 
momentary activation as long as you do
that<00:04:39.009> relatively<00:04:39.610> slowly<00:04:40.030> it's<00:04:40.750> not<00:04:40.900> going<00:04:41.020> to

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
that relatively slowly it's not going to

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.610 
that relatively slowly it's not going to
switch<00:04:41.289> modes<00:04:41.530> on<00:04:41.740> you<00:04:41.889> do<00:04:42.520> it<00:04:42.639> quickly<00:04:42.850> and

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
switch modes on you do it quickly and

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.450 
switch modes on you do it quickly and
they'll<00:04:44.620> switch<00:04:44.830> between<00:04:44.979> the<00:04:45.250> three

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
they'll switch between the three

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.920 
they'll switch between the three
different<00:04:45.580> modes<00:04:45.880> so<00:04:46.630> you<00:04:46.690> have<00:04:46.780> two

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
different modes so you have two

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.230 
different modes so you have two
different<00:04:47.080> outputs<00:04:47.620> and<00:04:47.860> stroke<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:48.970> it<00:04:49.060> does

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
different outputs and stroke and it does

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.050 
different outputs and stroke and it does
have<00:04:49.419> a<00:04:49.449> memory<00:04:49.870> for<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.590> two<00:04:50.770> outputs<00:04:51.220> so

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
have a memory for the two outputs so

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.779 
have a memory for the two outputs so
like<00:04:52.240> if<00:04:52.270> we<00:04:52.570> quickly<00:04:53.199> switch<00:04:53.530> between<00:04:53.669> we<00:04:54.669> get

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
like if we quickly switch between we get

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.040 
like if we quickly switch between we get
it<00:04:54.880> into<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:55.180> low<00:04:56.610> it's<00:04:57.610> going<00:04:57.789> to<00:04:57.850> keep<00:04:58.060> that

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
it into the low it's going to keep that

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.719 
it into the low it's going to keep that
one<00:04:59.199> in<00:04:59.229> the<00:04:59.410> memory<00:04:59.710> so<00:05:00.130> every<00:05:00.310> time<00:05:00.340> you<00:05:00.580> turn

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
one in the memory so every time you turn

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.339 
one in the memory so every time you turn
it<00:05:00.910> on<00:05:01.030> as<00:05:01.300> long<00:05:01.810> as<00:05:01.900> you're<00:05:01.990> not<00:05:02.080> quickly

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
it on as long as you're not quickly

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.200 
it on as long as you're not quickly
pressing<00:05:02.770> that<00:05:02.860> switch<00:05:03.130> is<00:05:03.400> going<00:05:03.849> to<00:05:03.910> go<00:05:04.030> into

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
pressing that switch is going to go into

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.060 
pressing that switch is going to go into
low<00:05:04.419> of<00:05:04.870> course<00:05:05.050> press<00:05:05.380> it<00:05:05.530> all<00:05:05.590> the<00:05:05.650> way<00:05:05.830> for

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
low of course press it all the way for

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.689 
low of course press it all the way for
constant<00:05:06.460> on<00:05:06.550> and<00:05:08.130> then<00:05:09.130> we're<00:05:09.370> getting<00:05:09.460> into

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
constant on and then we're getting into

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.490 
constant on and then we're getting into
the<00:05:09.789> strobe<00:05:10.060> will<00:05:10.240> quick<00:05:10.419> just<00:05:10.630> show<00:05:10.870> you<00:05:10.930> that

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
the strobe will quick just show you that

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.999 
the strobe will quick just show you that
the<00:05:11.770> strobe<00:05:12.210> does<00:05:13.210> not<00:05:13.389> have<00:05:13.509> a<00:05:13.539> memory<00:05:13.949> so<00:05:14.949> if

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
the strobe does not have a memory so if

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.770 
the strobe does not have a memory so if
you<00:05:15.099> have<00:05:15.250> in<00:05:15.340> a<00:05:15.400> strobe<00:05:15.699> it's<00:05:16.360> going<00:05:16.509> to<00:05:16.570> go

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
you have in a strobe it's going to go

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.499 
you have in a strobe it's going to go
into<00:05:17.050> your<00:05:17.320> high<00:05:17.500> output<00:05:17.740> after<00:05:18.580> that<00:05:18.699> the

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
into your high output after that the

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:20.730 
into your high output after that the
next<00:05:19.539> time<00:05:19.750> you<00:05:19.930> turn<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.199> on<00:05:20.259> it<00:05:20.320> doesn't<00:05:20.470> have

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
next time you turn it on it doesn't have

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.320 
next time you turn it on it doesn't have
a<00:05:20.770> memory<00:05:21.070> for<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:21.310> stroke<00:05:21.550> so<00:05:22.030> you<00:05:22.120> need<00:05:22.270> to

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
a memory for the stroke so you need to

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.760 
a memory for the stroke so you need to
cycle<00:05:22.539> through<00:05:22.690> again<00:05:23.080> if<00:05:23.229> you<00:05:23.320> wanted<00:05:23.560> to<00:05:23.650> get

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
cycle through again if you wanted to get

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.999 
cycle through again if you wanted to get
to<00:05:23.889> this<00:05:23.979> probe<00:05:25.349> alright<00:05:26.349> so<00:05:26.530> that<00:05:26.560> is<00:05:26.710> the

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
to this probe alright so that is the

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:28.920 
to this probe alright so that is the

it<00:06:12.759> up<00:06:12.849> to<00:06:13.090> the<00:06:13.270> high<00:06:13.389> when<00:06:13.659> you<00:06:13.750> need<00:06:13.900> it<00:06:14.050> which

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
it up to the high when you need it which

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.939 
it up to the high when you need it which
is<00:06:14.830> fantastic<00:06:14.979> for<00:06:15.550> distance<00:06:16.500> you<00:06:17.500> see<00:06:17.680> out<00:06:17.830> at

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
is fantastic for distance you see out at

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.520 
is fantastic for distance you see out at
100<00:06:18.280> feet<00:06:18.460> does<00:06:18.789> extremely<00:06:19.090> well<00:06:19.330> and<00:06:19.840> as<00:06:20.349> well

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
100 feet does extremely well and as well

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.320 
100 feet does extremely well and as well
so<00:06:20.680> you<00:06:20.740> show<00:06:21.070> you<00:06:21.130> in<00:06:21.400> just<00:06:21.430> a<00:06:21.669> second<00:06:21.970> it<00:06:22.150> does

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
so you show you in just a second it does

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.110 
so you show you in just a second it does
further<00:06:23.020> than<00:06:23.199> that<00:06:23.380> absolutely<00:06:23.919> no<00:06:24.009> problem

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
further than that absolutely no problem

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.390 
further than that absolutely no problem
so<00:06:26.110> let's<00:06:26.290> go<00:06:26.440> and<00:06:26.590> try<00:06:26.680> it<00:06:26.740> along<00:06:26.979> to<00:06:27.070> distance

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
so let's go and try it along to distance

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.320 
so let's go and try it along to distance
will<00:06:27.580> show<00:06:27.729> you<00:06:27.790> how<00:06:27.880> it<00:06:28.030> does<00:06:30.000> all<00:06:31.000> right<00:06:31.180> we

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
will show you how it does all right we

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.180 
will show you how it does all right we
have<00:06:31.449> the<00:06:31.600> TR<00:06:31.900> 20<00:06:32.290> and<00:06:32.470> some<00:06:32.620> more<00:06:32.740> distance<00:06:32.919> to

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
have the TR 20 and some more distance to

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.250 
have the TR 20 and some more distance to
work<00:06:33.340> with<00:06:33.550> still<00:06:34.180> have<00:06:34.270> the<00:06:34.389> 40<00:06:34.690> maglite<00:06:35.110> so

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
work with still have the 40 maglite so

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.450 
work with still have the 40 maglite so
we're<00:06:35.350> going<00:06:35.440> to<00:06:35.530> try<00:06:35.620> that<00:06:35.830> out<00:06:35.860> first<00:06:36.220> and

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
we're going to try that out first and

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.159 
we're going to try that out first and
then<00:06:36.850> we'll<00:06:36.940> try<00:06:37.120> out<00:06:37.210> the<00:06:37.300> tr20<00:06:40.169> chimney

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:41.169 
then we'll try out the tr20 chimney

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:43.530 
then we'll try out the tr20 chimney
about<00:06:41.500> 25<00:06:41.919> yards<00:06:42.130> away<00:06:42.389> trees<00:06:43.389> in<00:06:43.510> my

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.540 
about 25 yards away trees in my

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.860 
about 25 yards away trees in my
neighbors<00:06:43.900> yards<00:06:44.490> neighbor's<00:06:45.490> yard<00:06:45.840> about<00:06:46.840> a

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
neighbors yards neighbor's yard about a

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.950 
neighbors yards neighbor's yard about a
hundred<00:06:47.020> yards<00:06:47.290> to<00:06:47.470> the<00:06:47.560> top<00:06:47.710> of<00:06:47.740> them<00:06:48.960> let's

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
hundred yards to the top of them let's

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.409 
hundred yards to the top of them let's
try<00:06:50.080> out<00:06:50.260> the<00:06:50.350> TR<00:06:50.620> 20<00:06:50.949> so<00:06:51.729> you<00:06:51.880> can<00:06:52.000> notice<00:06:52.150> the

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419 
try out the TR 20 so you can notice the

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.060 
try out the TR 20 so you can notice the
big<00:06:52.600> difference<00:06:52.930> between<00:06:53.020> the<00:06:53.320> two<00:06:53.470> the

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070 
big difference between the two the

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.890 
big difference between the two the
chimney<00:06:54.820> obviously<00:06:55.240> lit<00:06:55.389> up<00:06:55.479> really<00:06:55.720> really

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
chimney obviously lit up really really

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.750 
chimney obviously lit up really really
well<00:06:55.990> and<00:06:56.380> the<00:06:56.620> trees<00:06:56.889> in<00:06:57.220> my<00:06:57.280> neighbor's<00:06:57.729> yard

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:57.760 
well and the trees in my neighbor's yard

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.330 
well and the trees in my neighbor's yard
lit<00:06:58.240> up<00:06:58.360> extremely<00:06:58.690> well<00:06:58.900> even<00:06:59.470> out<00:06:59.590> hundred

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340 
lit up extremely well even out hundred

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.760 
lit up extremely well even out hundred
yards<00:07:00.610> to<00:07:00.669> the<00:07:00.760> top<00:07:00.940> of<00:07:00.970> them<00:07:04.350> not<00:07:05.350> too<00:07:05.500> bad<00:07:05.650> at

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770
