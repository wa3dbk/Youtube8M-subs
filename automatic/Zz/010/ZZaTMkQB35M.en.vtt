00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.330
 February 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.090
 set to blacklist 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.090
 search

 a great game 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.960
 the BZ so bad it was not a bit forgetful she says the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.960
 at position six players further lightened 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.039
 so far only recently 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.039

 to 3 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.459
 but our costs should not be used 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:25.970
 they have 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.970
 around 300,000 vibrations of black humor 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.099
 Euro

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.879
 in order 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.869
 maybe there is some patience and luck is not right 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.869

 Stuttgart it really was never the heart 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:19.759

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:23.779
 or edit individual molecules split or we will put them in one 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:27.329
