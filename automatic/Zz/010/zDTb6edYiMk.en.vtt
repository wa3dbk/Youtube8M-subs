00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
for bagels cakes breads so what I'm

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.039 
for bagels cakes breads so what I'm
doing<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.549> I'm<00:01:27.000> testing<00:01:27.450> all<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
doing is I'm testing all of the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.330 
doing is I'm testing all of the
different<00:01:28.380> weeks<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:28.950> out<00:01:29.310> there

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
different weeks that we have out there

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.969 
different weeks that we have out there
to<00:01:29.610> use<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.210> I'm<00:01:30.689> trying<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.020> figure<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.320> what

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
to use and I'm trying to figure out what

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.730 
to use and I'm trying to figure out what
flours<00:01:32.430> those<00:01:32.790> are<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.869> work<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.530> best

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
flours those are going to work the best

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.179 
flours those are going to work the best
step<00:01:35.299> we<00:01:36.299> test<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.020> strength<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.860> stretch

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
step we test for is strength and stretch

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.749 
step we test for is strength and stretch
of<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:39.659> dough<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.250> this<00:01:41.250> machine<00:01:41.430> right<00:01:41.700> here

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
of the dough and this machine right here

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.340 
of the dough and this machine right here
that<00:01:42.030> we<00:01:42.090> use<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.509> basically<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.320> fancy

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
that we use is basically just a fancy

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.219 
that we use is basically just a fancy
bread<00:01:43.860> machine<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.600> make<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> dough<00:01:45.840> out<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.049> it

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
bread machine I make a dough out of it

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.990 
bread machine I make a dough out of it
and<00:01:46.409> then<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> get<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.220> blow<00:01:47.340> bubbles<00:01:47.549> with<00:01:47.729> it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
and then I get to blow bubbles with it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.859 
and then I get to blow bubbles with it
to<00:01:48.740> see<00:01:49.740> how<00:01:49.920> well<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.340> stretches<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:51.000> always

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
to see how well it stretches I always

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.359 
to see how well it stretches I always
like<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.110> take<00:01:52.259> things<00:01:52.470> apart<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.979> fix<00:01:53.159> things

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
like to take things apart and fix things

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.179 
like to take things apart and fix things
so<00:01:53.840> one<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.049> one<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.560> my<00:01:55.680> favorite<00:01:56.040> parts
