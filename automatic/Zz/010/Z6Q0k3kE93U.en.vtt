PLUM JAM WITH CHOCOLATE

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.989
Hello! 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:21.529
Today we will fill up thrift-box of the chocolate recipes - prepare chocolate jam.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.800
It is called "Plum in chocolate."

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.300
We need: plum, sugar, cocoa and cinnamon.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.100
You can add a clove or vanilla.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.950
Take a solid species of plum, for example, Hungarian plum. You can take unripe plum.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:53.980
Extract the seeds and put in a saucepan.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:04.970
Per 1 kg of plums we take 700 grams of sugar, 4 tablespoons cocoa powder and cinnamon stick.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:14.950
I add  the half of the sugar to plum. Plum must give juice.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:25.870
Leave for 7 hours.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.600
Plum gave a lot of juice.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:41.150
Add 4 tablespoons of cocoa powder.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:58.110
Gently stir.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.580
Add the remaining sugar.

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:25.859
Once again stir.

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:37.669
Add the cinnamon stick or vanilla.

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:49.489
Put the saucepan on the stove and cover with lid of a pressure cooker.

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:59.579
We put on the highest heat.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:06.999
Wait the red button will lift up during the cooking process. Do not open.

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:16.489
Reduce heat to low and wait untill the Thermocontrol indicator will be in the middle of green section.

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.789
Thermocontrol indicator is in the middle of green section. Turning off the heat.

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:28.059
We are waiting when the red button lift down.

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:35.059
Press the red button to unlock. Now you can open the lid.

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:42.619
Our jam is ready.

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:49.619
We remove the cinnamon stick.

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:58.489
Pour the jam into sterilized jars.

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.269
This jam can be perfectly used instead of cream for cake.

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.519
And you can just eat it with biscuits and tea.

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.719
Bon appetit!

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:29.700
