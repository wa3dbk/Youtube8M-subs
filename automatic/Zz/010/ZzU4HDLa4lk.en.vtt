00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.080
 magistrate's Court 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.000
 why the browser looks like this 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 like this 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:16.839
 and tabbed folders 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.750
 at the same time there is an hour we connect through 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.750
 meetings in their area 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.330
 the default selection when opening a browser 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.300
 no how to connect 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.850
 here's the line it's not about gold 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 loading 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.870
 respectively, while the file page is not 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.900
 booted up 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.900
 nothing to do with her buttons can be comfortable 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.570
 you see 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.700
 well first discrete 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.730
 hits on several points 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.230
 Well, that is actually a difference from 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.280
 there is no previous browser by itself 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.280
 no 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.080
 let's do it again 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.510
 I want to show you 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.820
 what he started will happen to 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.480
 the very beginning that is, fortunately information 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.150
 not taken 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.560
 the unit is again Georgia 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.170
 here after a draw with u generally goes enough 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.170
 close friend 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.220
 but on the highlight page 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.730
 whole image 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.730
 Turkey available through the menu 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.799
 here in our case why three deputies 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:23.559
 let's get a look 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:28.649
 export 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:33.229
 not fast 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:49.149
 this is a miniature movement 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.989
 history looks like text links 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.789
 but Russian something 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.979
 installation monty in general that is 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:17.189
 actions are just writing something 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.189
 or 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.059
 we do it 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:26.519
 was starting 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.519
 P 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:33.589
 us so it goes 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.819
 apparently Yandex Tula Yandex top 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:48.729
 We will see 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.779
 who happens to the cards 

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:07.529
 mobile version 

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:14.119
 Yakutsk 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.479
 opens incorrectly
