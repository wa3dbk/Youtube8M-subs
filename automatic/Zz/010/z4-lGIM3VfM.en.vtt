you'll this is a regular this is a 21
what<00:00:14.160> you're<00:00:14.280> going<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.429> find<00:00:14.610> out<00:00:14.820> they're

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
what you're going to find out they're

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.410 
what you're going to find out they're
not<00:00:15.360> really<00:00:15.780> real<00:00:16.619> different<00:00:17.190> there's<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.119> few

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
not really real different there's a few

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.800 
not really real different there's a few
obvious<00:00:18.660> differences<00:00:19.520> and<00:00:20.570> most<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.689> guys

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
obvious differences and most you guys

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.210 
obvious differences and most you guys
probably<00:00:22.050> already<00:00:22.260> know<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.010> is

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
probably already know this but this is

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.250 
probably already know this but this is
for<00:00:23.250> some<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.699> people<00:00:24.029> who<00:00:24.210> who<00:00:24.960> still

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
for some of the people who who still

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.480 
for some of the people who who still
might<00:00:25.560> not<00:00:25.769> know<00:00:26.449> the<00:00:27.449> regular<00:00:27.990> here<00:00:28.490> has

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
might not know the regular here has

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.470 
might not know the regular here has
these<00:00:29.730> ridges<00:00:30.679> kind<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.920> jimping<00:00:32.480> kind

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
these ridges kind of like jimping kind

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.150 
these ridges kind of like jimping kind
of<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> back<00:00:39.260> so<00:00:40.260> that's<00:00:40.350> like<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
of on the back so that's like the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.959 
of on the back so that's like the
easiest<00:00:42.050> giveaway<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.469> these<00:00:44.430> ridges<00:00:44.820> on

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
easiest giveaway is these ridges on

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.420 
easiest giveaway is these ridges on
regulars<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.879> 21<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:50.129> could<00:00:50.250> see

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
regulars and on the 21 you could see

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.250 
regulars and on the 21 you could see
there's<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.090> smooth<00:00:51.360> transition<00:00:51.840> all<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
there's just a smooth transition all the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.340 
there's just a smooth transition all the
way<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:53.210> okay<00:00:54.239> another<00:00:54.750> difference<00:00:55.260> that

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
way up okay another difference that

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.220 
way up okay another difference that
isn't<00:00:56.510> real<00:00:57.510> huge<00:00:58.820> but<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.000> there<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.989> cut

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
isn't real huge but is there is this cut

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.620 
isn't real huge but is there is this cut
out<00:01:01.699> for<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> thumb<00:01:03.030> stud<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:06.390> only

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
out for the thumb stud and the only

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.780 
out for the thumb stud and the only
difference<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.260> really<00:01:07.799> makes<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.250> use<00:01:08.490> is

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
difference that really makes in use is

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.020 
difference that really makes in use is
when<00:01:09.090> you're<00:01:09.210> using<00:01:09.420> gloves<00:01:10.430> at<00:01:11.430> least<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.850> me

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
when you're using gloves at least for me

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.330 
when you're using gloves at least for me
when<00:01:12.990> I'm<00:01:13.110> using<00:01:13.260> gloves<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.799> can<00:01:14.010> get<00:01:14.159> right

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
when I'm using gloves I can get right

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.320 
when I'm using gloves I can get right

back with some Roman numerals and also

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.830 
back with some Roman numerals and also
this<00:01:55.259> area<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.460> see<00:01:56.490> how<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:56.850> 21<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.509> raked

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
this area you see how this 21 is raked

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.250 
this area you see how this 21 is raked
back<00:01:58.729> it's<00:01:59.729> kind<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.149> cut<00:02:00.329> at<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.600> angle<00:02:00.840> here

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.749 

can't<00:02:06.260> get<00:02:06.380> a<00:02:06.409> focus<00:02:06.799> on<00:02:06.979> that<00:02:08.679> so<00:02:09.679> all<00:02:10.160> this<00:02:10.369> is

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
can't get a focus on that so all this is

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.370 
can't get a focus on that so all this is
not<00:02:11.480> found<00:02:11.810> on<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.200> classics<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:15.080> can<00:02:15.230> see

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
not found on the classics you can see

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.440 
not found on the classics you can see
how<00:02:15.500> they<00:02:15.650> finished<00:02:15.980> out<00:02:16.130> this<00:02:16.340> back<00:02:19.450> can't

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
how they finished out this back can't

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.870 
how they finished out this back can't
get<00:02:20.569> it<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.780> focus<00:02:21.020> there<00:02:21.410> we<00:02:21.530> go<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:22.730> see

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
get it to focus there we go so you see

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.900 
get it to focus there we go so you see
how<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.239> kind<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.510> round<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.910> classics

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
how this is kind of round the classics

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.850 
how this is kind of round the classics
are<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.180> same<00:02:26.390> way<00:02:26.569> on<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.870> front<00:02:27.170> they're

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
are the same way on the front they're

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.790 
are the same way on the front they're
just<00:02:28.040> kind<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.340> round<00:02:28.630> where<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.720> 21<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.380> kind

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
just kind of round where the 21 is kind

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.540 
just kind of round where the 21 is kind
of<00:02:30.890> laid<00:02:31.069> back<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:33.770> it's<00:02:33.950> difference<00:02:34.220> between

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
of laid back so it's difference between

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.300 
of laid back so it's difference between
classic<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:35.720> 21<00:02:36.170> basically<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.920> same<00:02:37.070> knife

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
classic and 21 basically the same knife

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.449 
classic and 21 basically the same knife
they<00:02:37.700> feel<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.090> same<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.810> shape<00:02:39.080> is<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.320> same

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.930 

just<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.610> few<00:02:43.940> subtle<00:02:44.209> differences<00:02:44.810> the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
just a few subtle differences the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.430 
just a few subtle differences the
classics<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.480> one<00:02:47.600> that<00:02:47.750> have<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.170> Roman

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
classics the one that have the Roman

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.870 
classics the one that have the Roman
numerals<00:02:48.800> in<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.070> classic<00:02:49.519> written<00:02:49.700> on<00:02:49.790> the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
numerals in the classic written on the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.199 
numerals in the classic written on the
back

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
back

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.180 
back
they<00:02:50.690> are<00:02:50.900> discontinued<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.989> so<00:02:54.769> is<00:02:54.980> their

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
they are discontinued and so is their

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.500 
they are discontinued and so is their
regular<00:02:55.640> as<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:57.260> regular<00:02:58.070> production<00:02:58.510> they

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
regular as a regular production they

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.059 
regular as a regular production they
still<00:02:59.810> produce<00:02:59.989> this<00:03:00.500> knife<00:03:00.860> in<00:03:01.450> this<00:03:02.450> frame

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
still produce this knife in this frame

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.210 
still produce this knife in this frame
but<00:03:04.069> only<00:03:04.280> in<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:05.000> annual<00:03:05.600> additions<00:03:06.100> so<00:03:07.100> the

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
but only in the annual additions so the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.050 
but only in the annual additions so the
ones<00:03:07.489> that<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:07.910> see<00:03:08.209> with<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.140> inlaid<00:03:10.060> wood

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
ones that you see with the inlaid wood

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.310 
ones that you see with the inlaid wood
and<00:03:13.000> mammoth<00:03:14.000> ivory<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:14.690> stuff<00:03:14.900> like<00:03:15.049> that

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
and mammoth ivory and stuff like that

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.449 
and mammoth ivory and stuff like that
and<00:03:16.209> they<00:03:17.209> usually<00:03:17.390> have<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.750> date<00:03:18.049> right<00:03:18.950> here

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
and they usually have a date right here

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.490 
and they usually have a date right here
looks<00:03:19.970> like<00:03:20.079> 2007<00:03:21.079> 2009<00:03:21.829> whatever<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:23.500> that's

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
looks like 2007 2009 whatever and that's

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.470 
looks like 2007 2009 whatever and that's
a<00:03:24.620> regular<00:03:24.769> frame<00:03:27.940> and<00:03:28.940> then<00:03:29.090> one<00:03:29.299> more

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
a regular frame and then one more

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.060 
a regular frame and then one more
difference<00:03:29.660> before<00:03:30.140> we<00:03:30.260> go<00:03:30.380> today<00:03:30.739> the

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
difference before we go today the

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.470 
difference before we go today the
difference<00:03:34.070> in<00:03:34.190> blade<00:03:34.400> shape<00:03:34.670> you<00:03:35.120> can<00:03:35.239> see

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
difference in blade shape you can see

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.069 
difference in blade shape you can see
the<00:03:35.950> top-20<00:03:36.950> one<00:03:37.180> has<00:03:38.180> a<00:03:38.450> more<00:03:38.690> needle-like

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
the top-20 one has a more needle-like

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:44.680 
the top-20 one has a more needle-like
blade<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:43.430> again<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:44.000> difference<00:03:44.360> is<00:03:44.510> not

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
blade and again the difference is not

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.990 
blade and again the difference is not
huge<00:03:45.049> but<00:03:45.110> it's<00:03:45.440> there<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:46.549> you<00:03:46.609> can<00:03:46.730> kind<00:03:46.940> of

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
huge but it's there so you can kind of

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.720 
huge but it's there so you can kind of
see<00:03:47.150> how<00:03:47.239> this<00:03:47.450> comes<00:03:47.840> to<00:03:48.019> a<00:03:48.049> point<00:03:48.350> or<00:03:49.250> this<00:03:49.579> is

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
see how this comes to a point or this is

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.750 
see how this comes to a point or this is
kind<00:03:49.970> of<00:03:50.090> bullnose<00:03:50.950> and<00:03:51.950> you<00:03:52.340> can<00:03:52.519> see<00:03:52.700> how

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
kind of bullnose and you can see how

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.690 
kind of bullnose and you can see how
this<00:03:53.000> spine<00:03:53.540> comes<00:03:53.930> straight<00:03:54.350> down<00:03:54.410> and<00:03:54.950> this

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
this spine comes straight down and this

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.410 
this spine comes straight down and this
comes<00:03:55.970> straight<00:03:56.030> down<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.720> then<00:03:57.260> drops<00:03:58.420> so

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
comes straight down and then drops so

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.009 
comes straight down and then drops so
it's<00:03:59.570> kind<00:03:59.780> of<00:03:59.870> an<00:03:59.989> arc<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:02.510> you<00:04:02.660> can<00:04:02.810> see<00:04:02.959> how

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
it's kind of an arc and you can see how

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.289 
it's kind of an arc and you can see how
it<00:04:03.079> has<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.260> little<00:04:03.380> more<00:04:03.859> belly<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:04.549> again<00:04:05.090> not

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
it has a little more belly and again not

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.590 
it has a little more belly and again not
much<00:04:05.510> but<00:04:05.840> it's<00:04:06.019> all<00:04:06.230> right<00:04:07.130> here<00:04:07.480> first<00:04:08.480> is

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
much but it's all right here first is

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.590 
much but it's all right here first is
this<00:04:08.750> one

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.900 

so<00:04:12.650> what<00:04:13.650> do<00:04:13.800> I<00:04:14.040> like<00:04:14.280> better

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
so what do I like better

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.789 
so what do I like better
I<00:04:14.940> like<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.810> 21<00:04:16.109> better<00:04:17.000> and<00:04:18.000> only<00:04:18.750> because<00:04:19.260> it

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
I like the 21 better and only because it

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.650 
I like the 21 better and only because it
seems<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.370> be<00:04:20.549> more<00:04:20.730> user<00:04:21.000> friendly<00:04:21.150> when

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
seems to be more user friendly when

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.720 
seems to be more user friendly when
you're<00:04:21.780> wearing<00:04:22.049> gloves<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.590> now<00:04:23.370> that<00:04:23.580> we're

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
you're wearing gloves and now that we're

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.550 
you're wearing gloves and now that we're
getting<00:04:23.910> up<00:04:24.090> into<00:04:24.330> winter<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:24.870> stuff<00:04:25.260> again

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
getting up into winter and stuff again

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.960 
getting up into winter and stuff again
coming<00:04:25.950> up<00:04:26.160> I<00:04:27.139> really<00:04:28.139> appreciate<00:04:28.500> that

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
coming up I really appreciate that

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.379 
coming up I really appreciate that
because<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:30.240> might<00:04:30.389> be<00:04:32.090> outside<00:04:33.090> or<00:04:33.240> whatever

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
because I might be outside or whatever

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.690 
because I might be outside or whatever
wearing<00:04:33.750> gloves<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.139> this<00:04:34.980> is<00:04:35.100> very<00:04:35.340> easy<00:04:35.550> to

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
wearing gloves and this is very easy to

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.560 
wearing gloves and this is very easy to
open<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.270> close<00:04:36.330> with<00:04:37.020> thick<00:04:37.770> gloves<00:04:38.070> home

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
open and close with thick gloves home

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.060 
open and close with thick gloves home
and<00:04:39.570> it's<00:04:39.750> not<00:04:39.900> like<00:04:40.050> you<00:04:40.200> can't<00:04:40.530> open<00:04:40.950> these

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
and it's not like you can't open these

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.180 
and it's not like you can't open these
but<00:04:41.700> you<00:04:41.790> can<00:04:41.940> see<00:04:42.120> there's<00:04:42.330> not<00:04:42.630> a<00:04:43.010> whole<00:04:44.010> lot

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
but you can see there's not a whole lot

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.560 
but you can see there's not a whole lot
of<00:04:44.220> space<00:04:44.550> for<00:04:44.910> your<00:04:45.030> thumb<00:04:46.790> now<00:04:47.790> it<00:04:48.000> is<00:04:48.180> shaped

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
of space for your thumb now it is shaped

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.659 
of space for your thumb now it is shaped
see<00:04:49.050> how<00:04:49.110> it's<00:04:49.230> kind<00:04:49.410> of<00:04:49.470> longer<00:04:49.830> here<00:04:50.070> so<00:04:50.520> your

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
see how it's kind of longer here so your

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.760 
see how it's kind of longer here so your
thumb<00:04:51.050> you<00:04:52.050> see<00:04:52.200> how<00:04:52.290> it's<00:04:52.380> cut<00:04:52.530> out<00:04:52.560> like

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
thumb you see how it's cut out like

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.730 
thumb you see how it's cut out like
perfect<00:04:53.220> for<00:04:53.370> your<00:04:53.430> thumb<00:04:57.440> so<00:04:58.440> it<00:04:58.470> does<00:04:58.710> work

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
perfect for your thumb so it does work

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.030 
perfect for your thumb so it does work
but<00:04:59.370> when<00:04:59.520> you<00:04:59.610> have<00:04:59.760> thick<00:05:00.000> gloves<00:05:00.270> on<00:05:00.480> um<00:05:01.040> it

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
but when you have thick gloves on um it

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.060 
but when you have thick gloves on um it
just<00:05:02.250> kind<00:05:02.460> of<00:05:02.550> wants<00:05:02.790> to<00:05:03.110> to<00:05:04.110> miss<00:05:04.320> a<00:05:07.010> lot<00:05:08.010> of

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
just kind of wants to to miss a lot of
