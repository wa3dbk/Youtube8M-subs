totally different than the one today I

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.150 
totally different than the one today I

remember when I had Barbies back in the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.470 
remember when I had Barbies back in the
90s<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:28.690> Barbie's<00:02:29.080> body<00:02:29.530> on<00:02:30.040> top<00:02:30.670> especially

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
90s the Barbie's body on top especially

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.540 
90s the Barbie's body on top especially
was<00:02:31.690> different<00:02:32.050> she<00:02:32.200> had<00:02:32.349> a<00:02:32.380> thicker<00:02:32.739> ribcage

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
was different she had a thicker ribcage

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
torso and even in her legs I think and

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.089 
torso and even in her legs I think and
now<00:02:39.459> they<00:02:40.180> they<00:02:40.569> even<00:02:40.840> said<00:02:41.170> Mattel<00:02:41.739> came<00:02:41.980> out

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
now they they even said Mattel came out

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.589 
now they they even said Mattel came out
and<00:02:42.250> said<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:42.459> they<00:02:42.819> were<00:02:42.880> making<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.330> Barbie

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
and said that they were making a Barbie

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.600 
and said that they were making a Barbie
that<00:02:43.690> looked<00:02:43.900> more<00:02:44.200> realistic<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.099> they

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
that looked more realistic and they

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.490 
that looked more realistic and they
absolutely<00:02:46.480> failed<00:02:46.720> in<00:02:46.900> my<00:02:47.019> opinion<00:02:47.380> they

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
absolutely failed in my opinion they

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.960 
absolutely failed in my opinion they
just<00:02:47.680> made<00:02:47.799> her<00:02:47.920> skinnier<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.400> that's<00:02:48.670> all

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
just made her skinnier and that's all

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.970 
just made her skinnier and that's all
they<00:02:49.180> did<00:02:49.390> for<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.720> comparison<00:02:50.200> between<00:02:50.680> the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
they did for a comparison between the

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.430 
they did for a comparison between the
first<00:02:51.400> Barbie<00:02:51.790> ever<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.269> 90s<00:02:52.660> Barbie<00:02:52.930> which<00:02:53.140> I

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
first Barbie ever the 90s Barbie which I

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.050 
first Barbie ever the 90s Barbie which I
actually<00:02:53.769> think<00:02:54.040> was<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.400> best<00:02:54.579> of<00:02:54.760> all<00:02:54.940> of

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
actually think was the best of all of

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.440 
actually think was the best of all of
the<00:02:55.239> Barbies<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.220> today's<00:02:57.220> Barbie<00:02:57.700> I'll<00:02:58.090> show

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
the Barbies and today's Barbie I'll show

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.940 
the Barbies and today's Barbie I'll show
you<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.660> comparison<00:02:58.959> they<00:02:59.260> look<00:02:59.380> completely

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
you the comparison they look completely

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:31.490 
you the comparison they look completely
different<00:03:00.549> from<00:03:00.880> each<00:03:01.060> other

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.580 

I<00:03:31.560> think<00:03:32.100> our<00:03:32.220> standards<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:33.380> how<00:03:34.380> women

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
I think our standards of how women

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.500 
I think our standards of how women
should<00:03:34.740> look<00:03:34.950> have<00:03:35.400> gotten<00:03:35.700> even<00:03:35.880> worse<00:03:36.150> and

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
should look have gotten even worse and

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.020 
should look have gotten even worse and
we<00:03:37.020> can<00:03:37.140> see<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.590> in<00:03:37.800> today's<00:03:38.160> Barbie<00:03:38.760> so

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
we can see that in today's Barbie so

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.760 
we can see that in today's Barbie so
that's<00:03:39.180> why<00:03:39.300> I'm<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:39.780> happy<00:03:40.020> that<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.440> artist

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
that's why I'm so happy that the artist

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.180 
that's why I'm so happy that the artist
created<00:03:41.190> this<00:03:41.400> realistic<00:03:42.360> Barbie<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.050> I<00:03:43.980> just
