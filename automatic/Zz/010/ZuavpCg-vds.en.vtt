see ya hey guys Matt Gold's in here and
we're<00:00:13.259> trying<00:00:13.920> out<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.429> mod<00:00:15.299> for<00:00:15.740> Sonic

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
we're trying out a mod for Sonic

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.590 
we're trying out a mod for Sonic
Generations<00:00:17.570> um<00:00:19.880> interesting<00:00:20.880> mod<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.240> didn't

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
Generations um interesting mod I didn't

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.689 
Generations um interesting mod I didn't
really<00:00:21.869> even<00:00:22.260> think<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:22.920> Sonic<00:00:23.640> Generations

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
really even think that Sonic Generations

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.640 
really even think that Sonic Generations
would<00:00:24.330> be<00:00:24.449> modded<00:00:24.869> but<00:00:24.990> then<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.109> looked<00:00:25.500> online

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
would be modded but then I looked online

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.870 
would be modded but then I looked online
because<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.039> figured<00:00:26.310> hey<00:00:26.460> what<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.699> hell

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
because I figured hey what the hell

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.000 
because I figured hey what the hell
maybe<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.269> will<00:00:27.449> be<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.869> then<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.470> checked<00:00:28.769> and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
maybe it will be and then I checked and

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.769 
maybe it will be and then I checked and
then<00:00:29.189> sure<00:00:29.400> enough<00:00:29.609> it's<00:00:29.820> like<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.119> we're

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
then sure enough it's like a we're

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.340 
then sure enough it's like a we're
modding<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.520> happened<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.350> yeah

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
modding the and it happened so yeah

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.440 
modding the and it happened so yeah
as<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.680> can<00:00:34.710> see<00:00:34.829> here<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.640> mod<00:00:35.940> allows<00:00:36.210> us

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
as you can see here this mod allows us

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.319 
as you can see here this mod allows us
to<00:00:36.570> play<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> shadow<00:00:37.200> actually<00:00:38.100> hold<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.399> there

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
to play a shadow actually hold on there

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.380 
to play a shadow actually hold on there
we<00:00:39.480> go<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:43.040> don't<00:00:44.040> want<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.700> trust<00:00:45.030> him<00:00:45.239> with

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
we go I don't want to trust him with

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.729 
we go I don't want to trust him with
classic<00:00:45.870> games<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.530> feel<00:00:46.710> like

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
classic games like so I feel like

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.130 
classic games like so I feel like
that'll<00:00:47.129> screw<00:00:47.430> up<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:48.270> let's<00:00:48.480> let's<00:00:48.930> try

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
that'll screw up but let's let's try

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.729 
that'll screw up but let's let's try
this<00:00:49.200> out<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.649> see<00:00:49.800> how<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.010> works

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.860 

play<00:00:53.699> staged<00:00:56.180> this<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> first<00:00:57.660> time

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
play staged this is the first time

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.450 
play staged this is the first time
trying<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.680> hopefully<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.219> doesn't

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
trying this so hopefully this doesn't

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.570 
trying this so hopefully this doesn't
screw<00:00:59.789> up

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.310 

but<00:01:04.580> from<00:01:05.030> what<00:01:05.180> I<00:01:05.210> can<00:01:05.270> see<00:01:05.450> the<00:01:05.870> character

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
but from what I can see the character

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.760 
but from what I can see the character
anime<00:01:06.650> ah<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:08.630> character<00:01:08.990> animation<00:01:09.500> seems

game<00:01:45.850> that<00:01:46.060> I<00:01:46.150> thought<00:01:46.450> there<00:01:46.690> would<00:01:46.930> be

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
game that I thought there would be

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.150 
game that I thought there would be
because<00:01:48.070> I<00:01:48.280> looked<00:01:48.490> online<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:50.010> there<00:01:51.010> are

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
because I looked online and there are

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.640 
because I looked online and there are
people<00:01:51.310> who<00:01:51.670> are<00:01:51.850> I<00:01:52.180> saw<00:01:52.750> one<00:01:53.020> mod<00:01:53.200> where<00:01:53.470> one

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
people who are I saw one mod where one

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.130 
people who are I saw one mod where one
guy's<00:01:53.830> recreating<00:01:54.520> Sonic<00:01:55.090> Generations<00:01:55.140> I

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
guy's recreating Sonic Generations I

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.960 
guy's recreating Sonic Generations I
mean<00:01:56.710> not<00:01:56.890> sound<00:01:57.250> generations<00:01:57.790> but

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
mean not sound generations but

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.870 
mean not sound generations but
recreating<00:01:58.510> Sonic<00:01:59.080> Unleashed<00:01:59.229> in<00:01:59.880> Sonic

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
recreating Sonic Unleashed in Sonic

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.450 
recreating Sonic Unleashed in Sonic
Generations<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.990> think<00:02:02.770> that's<00:02:02.920> ridiculous

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
Generations I think that's ridiculous

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.749 
Generations I think that's ridiculous
but<00:02:03.910> I<00:02:04.210> mean<00:02:04.990> usually<00:02:05.140> I<00:02:05.350> don't<00:02:05.530> care<00:02:06.430> much<00:02:06.700> for

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
but I mean usually I don't care much for

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.810 
but I mean usually I don't care much for
mods<00:02:07.750> that<00:02:07.900> just<00:02:08.140> swap<00:02:08.410> out<00:02:08.649> character<00:02:09.220> models

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
mods that just swap out character models

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.840 
mods that just swap out character models
and<00:02:10.060> stuff<00:02:10.360> like<00:02:10.600> that<00:02:10.840> but<00:02:11.740> shadows<00:02:12.670> my

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
and stuff like that but shadows my

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.810 
and stuff like that but shadows my
favorite<00:02:13.290> character<00:02:14.290> in<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.500> Sonic<00:02:14.920> verse<00:02:15.130> so

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
favorite character in the Sonic verse so

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.479 
favorite character in the Sonic verse so
I<00:02:15.880> figured<00:02:16.300> it'd<00:02:17.080> be<00:02:17.380> cool<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.800> see<00:02:18.190> his

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
I figured it'd be cool to see his

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.960 
I figured it'd be cool to see his
animation<00:02:19.180> here<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:21.580> show<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.760> quick

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
animation here and just show a quick

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.300 
animation here and just show a quick
level<00:02:22.390> with<00:02:22.510> him<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:22.930> this<00:02:23.500> mod<00:02:23.680> isn't<00:02:23.920> done

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
level with him and this mod isn't done

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.550 
level with him and this mod isn't done
yet<00:02:24.340> okay<00:02:24.730> apparently<00:02:25.330> there's<00:02:25.720> more<00:02:25.810> stuff
