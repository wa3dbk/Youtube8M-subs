00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.380
 such 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:31.690
 Yes Yes 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:34.570
 entertaining to say that we take pictures 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:38.010
 but for him we were also like the 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.010
 doubt first time that something does 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.460
 it's a very big emotional value that does not 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.870
 I know if I'm going to be pregnant again 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.850
 again my life then are photos that 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.410
 I hope you join me and make me relive 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.120
 all being period that has 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.739
 meaning pregnancy in fact more 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.480
 important that someday we're going to 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.550
 be able to share with a monster child 6 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.650
 show the look of conduct in the water 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.880
 of the mom and maybe it will not be returned to 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.880
 recreate one of these photos 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.910
 for me 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.340
 in addition to the process also that the 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.340
 lemon to tear is an ease 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:44.560
 and one of the largest possible 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.420
 the most artistic kingdom that is within 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.360
 your risk computer that they made 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.970
 and more 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.830
 clearly I do not have like with 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.430
 undress me 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:08.259
 and give me what I can do here 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:16.140
 what you can talk about loneliness very 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:19.270
 important when we have that can 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.310
 photographed that you do not have to like 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.310
 because before that, pregnancy 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.629
 for the family 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.240
 very fun and banking as well 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:45.680
 actively the social family pictures 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.050
 some units 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.840
 it is very interesting pointed 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.840
 not only this I know it is the photo 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.080
 of the moment 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.280
 like any the nice moments that 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.770
 we are passing girls 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.770
 they do not really want 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.900
 all right 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.900
 they 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.270
 and what it was like to take out the guatita and also in 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.430
 a very special moment of my life for 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.380
 leave it graphed with a professional who 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.870
 so that the entire final project and that 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.860
 that positive me happy and content 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.340
 with the result the photos 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.340
 spectacular 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.030
 my name is pedro moya concept of the 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.819
 advertising is good photographic no 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.709
 does everything you go from events to 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.269
 photography of products photography 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.560
 study of people 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.319
 you make a photograph that has a 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.549
 different standard and that difference for 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.849
 women for moms is very 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.980
 special there are people who come very 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.090
 open to study 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.709
 I put your hand and that's what you 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.620
 you want and another you say look look at that 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.329
 this kind of photography I do not like 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.040
 then you inside that space that 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:17.250
 they give you to work you try 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.590
 innovate and create different things that 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.480
 be amazing for them 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.970
 but more than looking good I think the 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.040
 people want a photo that reflects what 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.520
 they see themselves and as much as possible 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.229
 overcome me here it can be done and there it is 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.970
 first all everything at work 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.530
 that is done in study the lighting and 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.020
 then everything that helps in the retouching 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.949
 digital 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.090
 photography has a special magic 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.210
 some say he has the ability to 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.340
 have death but that ability to 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.319
 suddenly to capture the essence of things 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.539
 especially from people when you give 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:53.979
 realize that you get something amazing 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.979
 the photograph is 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.520
 an image of life
