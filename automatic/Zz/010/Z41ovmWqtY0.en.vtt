that<00:02:42.689> was<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.159> first<00:02:44.159> method<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:46.769> second<00:02:52.489> so

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
that was a first method the second so

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.750 
that was a first method the second so
yeah<00:02:53.640> that's<00:02:54.209> pretty<00:02:54.269> much<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:55.430> it's<00:02:56.430> probably

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
yeah that's pretty much it it's probably
