hellacious knocking coming from under
the<00:01:19.380> engine<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.860> was<00:01:20.189> really<00:01:20.460> nervous<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:20.939> let

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
the engine I was really nervous so I let

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.429 
the engine I was really nervous so I let
it<00:01:21.270> sit<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.630> couple<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.900> seconds<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
it sit for a couple of seconds in the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.530 
it sit for a couple of seconds in the
Walmart<00:01:22.920> parking<00:01:22.950> lot<00:01:23.310> starter<00:01:24.180> back<00:01:24.360> up

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
Walmart parking lot starter back up

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.999 
Walmart parking lot starter back up
again<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.990> sounded<00:01:25.380> almost<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.890> if

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
again and it sounded almost as if

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.070 
again and it sounded almost as if
someone<00:01:26.220> was<00:01:26.400> taking<00:01:26.759> tinfoil<00:01:27.240> anything

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
someone was taking tinfoil anything

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.740 
someone was taking tinfoil anything
above<00:01:28.290> 2,000<00:01:28.799> rpms<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.490> crunking<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.600> like

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
above 2,000 rpms and crunking it like

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.050 
above 2,000 rpms and crunking it like
this<00:01:30.960> underneath<00:01:31.409> my<00:01:31.740> engine<00:01:32.369> block<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.939> was

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
this underneath my engine block so I was

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.609 
this underneath my engine block so I was
really<00:01:33.450> really<00:01:33.630> nervous<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.290> know<00:01:34.530> I'm

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
really really nervous so you know I'm

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.679 
really really nervous so you know I'm
going<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.950> 65<00:01:35.430> miles<00:01:35.670> an<00:01:35.790> hour<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
going like 65 miles an hour the the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.090 
going like 65 miles an hour the the
noise<00:01:36.810> starts<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> decrease<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.560> little<00:01:37.829> bit<00:01:37.920> by

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
noise starts to decrease a little bit by

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.620 
noise starts to decrease a little bit by
the<00:01:38.159> time<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.369> get<00:01:38.610> home<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.299> that

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
the time I get home it's just that

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.780 
the time I get home it's just that
ordinary<00:01:40.320> belt<00:01:40.890> line<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.430> thought<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
ordinary belt line so I thought the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.340 
ordinary belt line so I thought the
problem<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.210> fix<00:01:42.420> itself<00:01:42.750> I'd<00:01:42.930> go<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.200> edit

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
problem that fix itself I'd go and edit

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.260 
problem that fix itself I'd go and edit
the<00:01:43.560> video<00:01:43.829> throw<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.670> YouTube<00:01:45.060> and

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the video throw it up on YouTube and

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.120 
the video throw it up on YouTube and
come<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.479> find<00:01:45.509> out<00:01:45.780> evidently<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.740> might<00:01:46.979> have

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
come to find out evidently I might have

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.620 
come to find out evidently I might have
thrown<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.490> rod<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.090> don't<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.390> know<00:01:48.509> what

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
thrown a rod I don't really know what

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.240 
thrown a rod I don't really know what
that<00:01:48.659> means<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.229> some<00:01:49.439> people<00:01:49.680> commented<00:01:50.130> to

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
that means but some people commented to

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.889 
that means but some people commented to
me<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.700> gotta<00:01:51.000> come<00:01:51.180> up<00:01:51.299> with<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.450> solution<00:01:51.570> to

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
me so I gotta come up with a solution to

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.480 
me so I gotta come up with a solution to
fix<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> heat<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.070> all<00:01:53.310> that

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
fix that but in the heat of all that

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.460 
fix that but in the heat of all that
deliberation<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.420> kind<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.930> had<00:01:55.079> an<00:01:55.200> epiphany

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
deliberation I kind of had an epiphany

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.630 
deliberation I kind of had an epiphany
why<00:01:55.890> would<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.070> start<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.460> fix<00:01:56.670> my<00:01:56.820> van<00:01:57.060> when<00:01:57.390> I

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
why would I start to fix my van when I

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.000 
why would I start to fix my van when I
on<00:01:57.850> upgrading<00:01:58.360> everything<00:01:59.260> anyways<00:01:59.560> so<00:01:59.979> a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
on upgrading everything anyways so a

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.830 
on upgrading everything anyways so a
peach<00:02:00.280> is<00:02:00.430> kind<00:02:00.610> of<00:02:00.670> a<00:02:00.760> burden<00:02:01.030> on<00:02:01.210> me<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.600> start

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
peach is kind of a burden on me to start

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.380 
peach is kind of a burden on me to start
focusing<00:02:02.050> on<00:02:02.440> my<00:02:02.620> energy<00:02:02.950> on<00:02:03.159> fixing<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.180> van

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
focusing on my energy on fixing the van

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.020 
focusing on my energy on fixing the van
when<00:02:05.050> really<00:02:05.380> my<00:02:05.800> prerogative<00:02:06.430> is<00:02:06.550> to<00:02:06.670> totally

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
when really my prerogative is to totally

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.120 
when really my prerogative is to totally
get<00:02:07.150> away<00:02:07.420> from<00:02:07.479> that<00:02:07.810> completely<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:08.950> just

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
get away from that completely so I just

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.770 
get away from that completely so I just
started<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.429> think<00:02:09.610> even<00:02:09.940> more<00:02:10.119> days<00:02:10.450> turned

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
started to think even more days turned

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.180 
started to think even more days turned
into<00:02:10.840> nights<00:02:10.959> nights<00:02:11.410> turn<00:02:11.680> in<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.860> morning

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
into nights nights turn in the morning

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.530 
into nights nights turn in the morning
and<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.459> just<00:02:12.640> started<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:12.940> think<00:02:13.000> about<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.450> all

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
and I just started to think about it all

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.120 
and I just started to think about it all
the<00:02:13.660> time<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:14.080> as<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.380> right<00:02:14.530> now<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.920> have<00:02:15.100> a

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
the time so as of right now I have a

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.800 
the time so as of right now I have a
whole<00:02:15.370> brand-new<00:02:15.850> plan<00:02:16.180> for<00:02:16.420> my<00:02:16.510> system

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
whole brand-new plan for my system

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.660 
whole brand-new plan for my system
update<00:02:17.140> for<00:02:17.350> next<00:02:17.590> year<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:17.980> it's<00:02:18.130> not<00:02:18.370> going

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
update for next year and it's not going

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.520
