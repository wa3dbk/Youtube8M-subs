00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:06.880 
a glue joint is a great alternative

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.619 
a glue joint is a great alternative
anywhere<00:00:07.880> you<00:00:08.090> would<00:00:08.210> have<00:00:08.360> made<00:00:08.600> a

glue joint bit creates a reversible glue

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.420 
glue joint bit creates a reversible glue
joint<00:00:25.880> meaning<00:00:26.600> you'll<00:00:26.900> only<00:00:27.440> use<00:00:27.800> one<00:00:28.130> router

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
joint meaning you'll only use one router

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
the height of the bit and the fence

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.680 
the height of the bit and the fence
using<00:00:41.659> this<00:00:41.809> block<00:00:42.819> first<00:00:43.819> we<00:00:44.059> set<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.479> height

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
using this block first we set the height

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.840 
using this block first we set the height
of<00:00:44.839> the<00:00:44.989> router<00:00:45.199> bit<00:00:45.559> and<00:00:45.739> then<00:00:46.399> we<00:00:46.579> set<00:00:46.819> the

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
of the router bit and then we set the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.750 
of the router bit and then we set the
fence<00:00:47.269> to<00:00:47.569> place<00:00:47.839> simply<00:00:48.829> slide<00:00:49.129> the<00:00:49.399> setup

block into the router bit till it's a
snug<00:00:52.339> fit<00:00:52.370> and<00:00:52.760> then<00:00:53.059> set<00:00:53.359> your<00:00:53.510> fence<00:00:53.809> to<00:00:54.139> it

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.989 

because<00:00:57.649> this<00:00:57.889> router<00:00:58.190> bit<00:00:58.460> creates<00:00:58.819> a

because this router bit creates a

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:01.389 
because this router bit creates a
reversible<00:00:59.629> joint<00:00:59.929> you<00:01:00.559> will<00:01:00.589> be<00:01:00.799> running<00:01:01.159> one

reversible joint you will be running one

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.210 
reversible joint you will be running one

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
make the joint interlock so remember to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.270 
make the joint interlock so remember to
mark<00:01:06.440> your<00:01:06.620> boards<00:01:06.979> properly<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.890> height<00:01:10.100> of
