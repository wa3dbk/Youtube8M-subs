 advanced modpack to patch 092 as 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.260
 it says boy said boy did 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.010
 yesterday on stream I promised you that today 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.470
 will be advanced 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.869
 and here it is and so what is in it 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.830
 included well firstly classic mods 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.550
 reindeer 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.439
 and an improved sight x25 two mod which 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.470
 you already know for a long time and which for a long time 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.170
 wait but besides this guys there is a whole 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.239
 a bunch of new mods are the first of the new mods 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.010
 this is a server sight that you so 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.020
 long ago asked earlier if you set 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.510
 modified server target 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.820
 it was impossible to turn on now 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.570
 you just have two on the screen 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.270
 sight 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.000
 client and server understandably 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.800
 the server will be forever late but 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.900
 this will allow you more accurately 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.970
 Aim and allow you to level 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.490
 different shots of the projectile somewhere in the side 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.650
 not at all where you were aiming at 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.439
 very useful thing following 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.750
 all incredibly useful thing is 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.700
 improved armor penetration indicator 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.259
 what is he like 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.119
 whichever aim you are on 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.729
 choose for example the sight of jova sight 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.649
 for a factory or deluxo sight you will have 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.579
 or a marker that displays in red 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.679
 green yellow 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.420
 penetration of enemy armor or even the same 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.009
 the most marker but with numbers 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.140
 now you see guys like me 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.119
 I use a deluxo sight I see what 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.249
 starting and kv-5 armor i can punch a 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.079
 which we can not drive on different 

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:36.270
 areas of armor and depending on 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.429
 slope from the location of the tank to us 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.090
 of which there is the thickness of armor we 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:44.639
 completely different numbers then 200 to 300 to 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.770
 400 this guys is a very useful thing for 

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:48.450
 beginners and for already in principle experienced 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.130
 players she allows you to target 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.939
 enemies and shoot precisely those parts 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.520
 enemy armor 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.380
 who are the least booked and yet this 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.299
 mod can be used as a tutorial for 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.889
 penetration of enemy armor that is if you 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.469
 know bad enemy booking 

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:02.789
 tank set yourself this mod and start 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.889
 study enemies from afar 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.289
 Well, along the way, earning experience breaking through 

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:09.479
 them and getting warrior medals next 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.490
 new mod is sisi he's on i stats from 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.740
 fashion and 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.790
 from several different options to any 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.860
 taste and color 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.630
 if you don't like our old dried 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.550
 statistics can try some 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.300
 of these new options is another 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.190
 useful little thing 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.870
 that's what's on the boot loading screen instead 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.940
 tips you can put yourself 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.220
 information about your chase times like 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.140
 it says a trifle but it's also nice here 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.090
 there was a mod that turns off the flash 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.910
 red light when hit by your 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.460
 tank on one side a little bit in battle 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.530
 diminish tragedy and epic 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.520
 but on the other hand these red flashes 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.620
 will not you on the battlefield 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.450
 disorient and it says you will 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.520
 it's easier to aim and more steadfast 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.140
 tolerate enemy hits also 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.850
 us modpaki appeared which 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.800
 allows you not to include the handbrake in 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.540
 sniper mode when playing on Fri 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.250
 that is, you play on podtasov 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.900
 turn on the Persian mode and there was 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.130
 Such a function that you can not mouse 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.810
 lead right and left 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.300
 beyond the corners of the horizontal guidance 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.950
 This mod disables this chip and you 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.140
 can easily move the mouse in 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.150
 sniper sights on fri sau and no 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.920
 the problems you have with this is not as we 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.990
 added a small mod which disables 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.670
 the scroll inertia in arcade mode is 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.400
 when for example you are in arcade mode 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.070
 gave or brought the camera to the tank 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.960
 earlier if you remember before patch 08 11 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.490
 all this was done and abruptly after that 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.530
 the developers decided to fix it and 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.600
 now it is done smoothly that is to whom 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.760
 likes to like it sharply at once 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.190
 zoom in and who likes to zoom in smoothly 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.620
 and another very useful mod which 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.050
 I personally will definitely put it 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.820
 previous combat results informer 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.250
 chat in passing in battle 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.290
 that is, you played some kind of fight but 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.900
 late died and you don't want to wait for him 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.090
 ending you go to the hangar go in 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.800
 another fight play that fight old 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.660
 ends and of course you are interested in 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.850
 This won or not and here is specifically 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.530
 for this situation this informer is made 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.510
 which is right in the chat of the current battle 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.000
 shows you these results very 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.340
 convenient and very useful in every way 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.010
 I recommend the last 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.340
 Modica is a small zoom indicator is 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.130
 you have x8 x16 in sight 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.380
 or x25 he guys are embedded in those 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.320
 sights in which he was not originally 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.140
 such a trifle but again it will be convenient to 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.239
