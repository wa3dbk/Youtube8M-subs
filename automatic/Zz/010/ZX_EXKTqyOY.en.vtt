mod is different in that instead of

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.619 
mod is different in that instead of
using<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.629> ENB<00:00:51.899> series<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.649> uses<00:00:53.010> sweetfx

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
using the ENB series it uses sweetfx

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.150 
using the ENB series it uses sweetfx
that's<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.809> similar<00:00:55.199> tool<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.649> also<00:00:55.800> allows

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
that's a similar tool that also allows

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.590 
that's a similar tool that also allows
you<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.399> apply<00:00:56.579> additional<00:00:56.879> effects<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.480> your

you to apply additional effects to your

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.810 
you to apply additional effects to your
game<00:00:57.840> but<00:00:58.289> as<00:00:58.410> we<00:00:58.559> understand<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> suite<00:00:59.550> FX

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
game but as we understand it suite FX

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.880 
game but as we understand it suite FX
can't<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:00.329> much<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.690> ENB<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.739> also

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
can't do as much as ENB but it's also

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.619 
can't do as much as ENB but it's also
not<00:01:02.160> as<00:01:02.280> graphically<00:01:02.760> intensive<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.480> it's

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
not as graphically intensive so it's

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.359 
not as graphically intensive so it's
great<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.989> wider<00:01:04.229> variety<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.769> players<00:01:05.010> you

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
great for a wider variety of players you

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.609 
great for a wider variety of players you
can<00:01:06.030> see<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> effect<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.810> has<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:06.990> screen<00:01:07.409> now

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
can see the effect it has on screen now

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.350 
can see the effect it has on screen now
and<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.130> really<00:01:08.310> does<00:01:08.549> look<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:08.760> several<00:01:09.270> of

certain things the ENB series can do so

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
to make them look better so if we were

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.630 
to make them look better so if we were

you'll<00:02:08.970> be<00:02:09.090> able<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.390> quite<00:02:09.569> clearly<00:02:09.840> see<00:02:10.050> the

you'll be able to quite clearly see the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.440 
you'll be able to quite clearly see the
difference<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.550> can't<00:02:12.000> believe<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:12.390> not

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
difference but I can't believe it's not

a<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.840> B<00:02:12.959> was<00:02:13.140> created<00:02:13.560> for

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
a and B was created for

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.530 
a and B was created for
one<00:02:14.040> that's<00:02:14.220> having<00:02:14.490> trouble<00:02:14.790> running<00:02:14.910> EMPs

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
one that's having trouble running EMPs

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.940 
one that's having trouble running EMPs
and<00:02:15.840> for<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.170> we<00:02:16.260> think<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.560> does<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.709> great

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
and for that we think it does a great

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.100 
and for that we think it does a great
job<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.730> really<00:02:18.270> does<00:02:18.450> look<00:02:18.599> like<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.810> lot<00:02:18.989> of

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
job it really does look like a lot of

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.870 
job it really does look like a lot of
the<00:02:19.260> other<00:02:19.380> popular<00:02:19.800> presets<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.700> if<00:02:20.760> you're

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
the other popular presets so if you're

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.160 
the other popular presets so if you're
running<00:02:21.030> on<00:02:21.209> an<00:02:21.300> older<00:02:21.569> machine<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:22.080> have

given up on ever using graphic enhancing

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.490 
given up on ever using graphic enhancing
mods<00:02:24.090> then<00:02:24.660> we<00:02:24.750> think<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:24.989> should<00:02:25.020> definitely

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
mods then we think you should definitely

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.890 
mods then we think you should definitely
give<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.739> one<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.980> go<00:02:26.510> installing<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.599> mod<00:02:27.720> is

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
give this one a go installing the mod is

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.630 
give this one a go installing the mod is
easy<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.380> it's<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.650> simple<00:02:28.950> case<00:02:29.099> of<00:02:29.130> dragging

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
easy and it's a simple case of dragging

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.160 
easy and it's a simple case of dragging
the<00:02:29.760> entire<00:02:29.790> folder<00:02:30.510> into<00:02:30.690> your<00:02:30.720> Skyrim

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
the entire folder into your Skyrim

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.260 
the entire folder into your Skyrim
directory<00:02:31.680> you'll<00:02:32.400> also<00:02:32.580> have<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.819> make<00:02:33.060> sure

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
directory you'll also have to make sure

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.880 
directory you'll also have to make sure
to<00:02:33.480> turn<00:02:33.660> your<00:02:33.780> anti-aliasing<00:02:34.470> off<00:02:34.620> from<00:02:34.800> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
to turn your anti-aliasing off from the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.680 
to turn your anti-aliasing off from the
Skyrim<00:02:35.220> launcher<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.760> then<00:02:35.880> once<00:02:36.090> in-game<00:02:36.450> if

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
Skyrim launcher and then once in-game if

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.270 
Skyrim launcher and then once in-game if
you<00:02:36.840> decided<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.319> use<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.590> recommended<00:02:38.040> mods

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
you decided to use the recommended mods

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.070 
you decided to use the recommended mods
you<00:02:38.790> also<00:02:39.000> have<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.300> tweak<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.630> imaginator

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
you also have to tweak the imaginator

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.590 
you also have to tweak the imaginator
settings<00:02:40.530> but<00:02:41.489> overall<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.060> entire<00:02:42.150> process

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
settings but overall the entire process

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.240 
settings but overall the entire process
takes<00:02:42.959> no<00:02:43.140> longer<00:02:43.410> than<00:02:43.530> five<00:02:43.739> minutes

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
takes no longer than five minutes

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.009 
takes no longer than five minutes
so<00:02:45.000> if<00:02:45.090> you're<00:02:45.239> interested<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.840> month

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
so if you're interested in the month

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.270 
so if you're interested in the month
then<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.230> can<00:02:46.350> find<00:02:46.530> absolutely<00:02:47.010> everything

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
then you can find absolutely everything

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.220 
then you can find absolutely everything
you<00:02:47.400> need<00:02:47.610> down<00:02:47.790> below<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.269> as<00:02:48.720> always<00:02:48.870> be

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
you need down below and as always be
