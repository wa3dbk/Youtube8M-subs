formation<00:04:05.109> sub<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.410> know<00:04:05.500> something<00:04:05.799> in<00:04:05.920> your

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
formation sub you know something in your

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.009 
formation sub you know something in your
first<00:04:06.220> guy<00:04:06.340> with<00:04:06.489> your<00:04:06.609> last<00:04:06.790> guy<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.269> but<00:04:07.989> I

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
first guy with your last guy and but I

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.720 
first guy with your last guy and but I
thought<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.769> guy<00:04:09.099> that<00:04:09.130> was<00:04:09.400> booting

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
thought the the guy that was booting

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.879 
thought the the guy that was booting
could<00:04:09.849> only<00:04:09.970> do<00:04:10.120> on<00:04:10.239> offense<00:04:10.419> but<00:04:10.959> I<00:04:11.019> guess<00:04:11.290> he

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
could only do on offense but I guess he

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.140 
could only do on offense but I guess he
could<00:04:12.040> do<00:04:12.130> on<00:04:12.250> defense<00:04:12.400> too<00:04:12.730> because<00:04:12.970> I<00:04:13.030> still

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
could do on defense too because I still

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.360 
could do on defense too because I still
ended<00:04:13.329> up<00:04:13.419> what<00:04:13.599> this<00:04:13.750> guy<00:04:13.959> did<00:04:14.889> to<00:04:14.950> me<00:04:15.160> I'm<00:04:15.250> not
