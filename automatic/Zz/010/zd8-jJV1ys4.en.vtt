today today I'm gonna do a very short
review<00:00:12.170> on<00:00:12.379> the<00:00:13.599> inverter<00:00:14.599> that<00:00:14.869> we<00:00:15.020> carry<00:00:15.260> in

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
review on the inverter that we carry in

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.050 
review on the inverter that we carry in
solid<00:00:16.789> hama<00:00:17.150> under<00:00:17.900> SE<00:00:18.140> origins<00:00:18.590> we<00:00:19.189> carry<00:00:19.760> two

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
solid hama under SE origins we carry two

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.310 
solid hama under SE origins we carry two
kinds<00:00:20.570> of<00:00:20.720> better<00:00:21.340> one<00:00:22.340> is<00:00:22.609> the<00:00:22.930> pure<00:00:23.930> sine

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
kinds of better one is the pure sine

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.010 
kinds of better one is the pure sine
wave<00:00:24.350> inverter<00:00:24.800> and<00:00:25.280> the<00:00:25.940> other<00:00:26.240> one<00:00:26.449> is<00:00:26.690> the

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
wave inverter and the other one is the

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.880 
wave inverter and the other one is the
week<00:00:27.619> row<00:00:27.860> with<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:29.140> modified<00:00:30.140> sine<00:00:30.380> wave<00:00:30.619> or

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
week row with the modified sine wave or

metallic blue or in a magnetic blue
color<00:00:44.929> okay<00:00:46.149> pure<00:00:47.149> sine<00:00:47.449> wave<00:00:47.479> we<00:00:48.350> will<00:00:48.530> make

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
color okay pure sine wave we will make

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:49.809 
color okay pure sine wave we will make
it<00:00:48.829> into<00:00:49.039> a<00:00:49.069> black<00:00:49.280> color

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:49.819 
it into a black color

it into a black color
okay<00:00:50.210> back<00:00:50.420> black<00:00:50.749> casing<00:00:50.960> okay<00:00:51.949> but<00:00:52.819> me<00:00:52.909> I

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
okay back black casing okay but me I

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.340 
okay back black casing okay but me I
will<00:00:53.179> spend<00:00:53.539> some<00:00:53.629> time<00:00:53.989> talking<00:00:54.829> about<00:00:56.350> but

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
will spend some time talking about but

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
will spend some time talking about but
okay

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
okay

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.259 
okay
um<00:00:58.870> in<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.019> days<00:01:00.260> in<00:01:00.559> a<00:01:00.679> row<00:01:01.179> especially<00:01:02.179> the

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
um in the days in a row especially the

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.079 
um in the days in a row especially the
off-grid<00:01:02.479> inverter<00:01:02.979> has<00:01:03.979> been<00:01:04.220> around<00:01:04.519> more

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
off-grid inverter has been around more

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.050 
off-grid inverter has been around more
than<00:01:05.269> a<00:01:05.299> few<00:01:05.600> decades<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.729> has<00:01:07.729> it<00:01:07.880> been

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
than a few decades and has it been

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.480 
than a few decades and has it been
around<00:01:08.270> for<00:01:08.780> for<00:01:08.960> quite<00:01:09.080> some<00:01:09.229> time<00:01:09.350> but<00:01:10.190> of

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
around for for quite some time but of

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.240 
around for for quite some time but of
course<00:01:10.700> those<00:01:11.150> days<00:01:11.390> but<00:01:11.860> what<00:01:12.860> I<00:01:12.890> always<00:01:13.010> say

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
course those days but what I always say

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.750 
course those days but what I always say
that<00:01:14.230> a<00:01:15.230> very<00:01:15.620> huge<00:01:15.890> percentage<00:01:16.460> is<00:01:16.700> not

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
that a very huge percentage is not

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.110 
that a very huge percentage is not
useful<00:01:17.350> solar<00:01:18.350> during<00:01:18.920> that<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.730> whole<00:01:19.880> time

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
useful solar during that the whole time

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.420 
useful solar during that the whole time
they<00:01:20.990> just<00:01:21.020> use<00:01:21.440> it<00:01:21.620> for<00:01:21.650> a<00:01:21.830> remote<00:01:22.280> area

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
they just use it for a remote area

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.480 
they just use it for a remote area
whereby<00:01:23.000> they<00:01:23.900> do<00:01:24.560> not<00:01:24.710> have<00:01:24.830> a<00:01:24.860> power<00:01:25.100> source

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
whereby they do not have a power source

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.450 
whereby they do not have a power source
they<00:01:26.180> use<00:01:26.360> a<00:01:26.390> battery<00:01:26.690> and<00:01:27.460> inverters

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
they use a battery and inverters

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.990 
they use a battery and inverters
connected<00:01:29.120> to<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:29.780> battery<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.280> you<00:01:31.280> know<00:01:31.790> he

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
connected to the battery and you know he

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.150 
connected to the battery and you know he
can<00:01:32.300> power<00:01:32.680> to<00:01:33.680> 40<00:01:34.040> or<00:01:34.340> under<00:01:34.880> tens<00:01:36.160> VBAC

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160

can power to 40 or under tens VBAC
devices<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:38.890> that<00:01:39.890> was<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:41.270> old<00:01:41.690> traditional

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
devices and that was the old traditional

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.940 
devices and that was the old traditional
kind<00:01:42.710> of<00:01:42.800> inverter<00:01:43.670> okay<00:01:44.000> for<00:01:44.870> us<00:01:45.020> in<00:01:45.290> solar

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
kind of inverter okay for us in solar

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.010 
kind of inverter okay for us in solar
power<00:01:46.160> ma

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
power ma

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.440

we<00:01:48.020> need<00:01:48.260> an<00:01:48.440> inverter<00:01:48.770> that<00:01:49.130> is<00:01:49.580> a<00:01:49.610> very<00:01:50.060> high

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
we need an inverter that is a very high

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.250 
we need an inverter that is a very high
efficiency

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
efficiency

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.430 
efficiency
okay<00:01:51.650> consume<00:01:52.580> a<00:01:52.700> very<00:01:53.120> little<00:01:53.540> power<00:01:53.690> so<00:01:54.230> that

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
okay consume a very little power so that

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.070 
okay consume a very little power so that
we<00:01:55.070> can<00:01:55.280> save<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.730> energy<00:01:55.970> all<00:01:56.690> right<00:01:56.870> and

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
we can save the energy all right and

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.100 
we can save the energy all right and
then<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.500> inverter<00:01:57.830> must<00:01:58.340> be<00:01:58.580> able<00:01:58.760> to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
then the inverter must be able to

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.160 
then the inverter must be able to
work<00:01:59.260> together<00:02:00.220> with<00:02:00.840> solar<00:02:01.840> charge

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
work together with solar charge

charge controller and it will give you
an<00:02:38.560> error<00:02:39.070> system<00:02:39.370> he<00:02:40.140> better

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
an error system he better

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.220 
an error system he better
alright<00:02:41.890> because<00:02:42.220> of<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.580> solar<00:02:43.540> power<00:02:43.930> also

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
alright because of that solar power also

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.710 
alright because of that solar power also
we<00:02:44.470> design<00:02:44.800> system<00:02:45.220> make<00:02:46.030> sure<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.480> David

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
we design system make sure that David

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.860 
we design system make sure that David
would<00:02:47.530> not<00:02:47.800> interfere<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:49.300> solar<00:02:49.780> charge

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
would not interfere the solar charge

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.360 
would not interfere the solar charge
controller<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:51.040> solar<00:02:51.340> charge

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
controller and the solar charge

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.630 
controller and the solar charge
controller<00:02:51.940> will<00:02:52.300> not<00:02:52.630> interfere<00:02:53.560> ze<00:02:53.950> but<00:02:54.190> all

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
controller will not interfere ze but all

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.870 
controller will not interfere ze but all
right<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:55.560> where's<00:02:56.560> Emma<00:02:56.920> -<00:02:57.100> controller<00:02:57.610> and

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
right so where's Emma - controller and

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.330 
right so where's Emma - controller and
the<00:02:58.510> paid<00:02:58.720> adjust<00:02:59.140> controller<00:02:59.470> they<00:03:00.070> all<00:03:00.190> work

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
the paid adjust controller they all work

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.190 
the paid adjust controller they all work
very<00:03:00.610> well<00:03:00.990> with<00:03:01.990> the<00:03:02.380> Teti<00:03:02.980> but<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.640> we<00:03:03.910> have

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
very well with the Teti but that we have

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.979 
very well with the Teti but that we have
under<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.380> solar<00:03:05.920> power<00:03:06.070> category<00:03:06.700> okay<00:03:07.540> I'm

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
under the solar power category okay I'm

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.199 
under the solar power category okay I'm
just<00:03:08.230> going<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.440> spend<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:09.160> racial<00:03:09.790> review<00:03:10.090> on

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
just going to spend a racial review on

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.900 
just going to spend a racial review on
this<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.720> just<00:03:11.050> go<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.410> few<00:03:11.530> point<00:03:12.070> about

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
this and just go to a few point about

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.500 
this and just go to a few point about
why<00:03:13.690> our<00:03:13.989> butter<00:03:14.380> is<00:03:15.060> different<00:03:16.060> from<00:03:16.209> other

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
why our butter is different from other

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.900 
why our butter is different from other
decide<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.380> point<00:03:17.650> is<00:03:17.830> not<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.010> mention<00:03:18.580> all

different from from the other ok our

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.190 
different from from the other ok our
invitation<00:04:01.640> e<00:04:01.730> is<00:04:02.390> not<00:04:02.599> using<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:02.989> all

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
invitation e is not using the all

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.589 
invitation e is not using the all
traditional<00:04:03.739> kind<00:04:04.040> of<00:04:04.280> transistor<00:04:05.209> or

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
Toby to 240 or 24v 2 to 4 DB AC we don't

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.880 
Toby to 240 or 24v 2 to 4 DB AC we don't
use<00:04:14.510> that<00:04:14.720> because<00:04:14.840> if<00:04:15.079> you<00:04:15.140> use<00:04:15.290> that<00:04:15.500> that

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
use that because if you use that that

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.590 
use that because if you use that that
kind<00:04:16.130> of<00:04:16.160> technology<00:04:16.519> of<00:04:16.820> transformer<00:04:17.359> you

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
kind of technology of transformer you

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.379 
kind of technology of transformer you
will<00:04:17.720> find<00:04:17.930> out<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.260> efficiency<00:04:19.060> will<00:04:20.060> not

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
will find out the efficiency will not

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.590 
will find out the efficiency will not
reach<00:04:20.810> more<00:04:21.320> than<00:04:21.380> 80%<00:04:22.160> alright<00:04:22.729> so<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:23.300> will

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
reach more than 80% alright so you will

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.950 
reach more than 80% alright so you will
have<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.810> 20%<00:04:24.530> of<00:04:24.620> power<00:04:25.490> loss<00:04:25.760> what<00:04:26.360> we<00:04:26.539> do<00:04:26.720> is

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
have a 20% of power loss what we do is

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.540 
have a 20% of power loss what we do is
here<00:04:27.260> we<00:04:27.590> use<00:04:27.800> a<00:04:27.830> very<00:04:28.220> advanced<00:04:28.760> more<00:04:29.479> fat

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
here we use a very advanced more fat

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.170 
here we use a very advanced more fat
transistor<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:32.360> set<00:04:32.870> up<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.860> D<00:04:34.789> voltage

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
transistor to set up the the D voltage

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.719 
transistor to set up the the D voltage
okay<00:04:35.479> so<00:04:36.110> we<00:04:36.289> have<00:04:36.440> we<00:04:36.740> are<00:04:36.830> using<00:04:37.010> a<00:04:37.250> two<00:04:37.490> stage

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
okay so we have we are using a two stage

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:38.950 
okay so we have we are using a two stage
okay

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
okay

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.370 
okay

okay and because of user advanced
warfare<00:04:53.620> transistor<00:04:54.940> we<00:04:55.940> can<00:04:56.479> achieve

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
warfare transistor we can achieve

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.440 
warfare transistor we can achieve
efficiency<00:04:57.919> more<00:04:58.160> than<00:04:58.460> 90<00:04:58.880> percent<00:04:59.000> all

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
efficiency more than 90 percent all

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:05.080 
efficiency more than 90 percent all
right<00:04:59.660> certain<00:05:00.380> of<00:05:00.530> our<00:05:01.510> large<00:05:02.510> scale<00:05:03.340> in<00:05:04.340> the

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
right certain of our large scale in the

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.320 
right certain of our large scale in the
inverter<00:05:05.360> was<00:05:05.630> over<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:06.010> 2001<00:05:07.010> or<00:05:07.280> 2001<00:05:08.000> they

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
inverter was over the 2001 or 2001 they

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.290 
inverter was over the 2001 or 2001 they
can<00:05:08.539> even<00:05:08.810> achieve<00:05:09.050> even<00:05:09.590> see<00:05:10.010> more<00:05:10.250> than<00:05:10.430> 95%

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
can even achieve even see more than 95%

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.360 
can even achieve even see more than 95%
all<00:05:11.720> right<00:05:11.870> so<00:05:12.050> then<00:05:12.199> you<00:05:12.229> only<00:05:12.410> have<00:05:12.500> five<00:05:13.039> to

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
all right so then you only have five to

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.040 
all right so then you only have five to
ten<00:05:13.580> percent<00:05:13.760> power<00:05:14.240> loss<00:05:14.570> okay

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
ten percent power loss okay

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.870 
ten percent power loss okay
this<00:05:15.410> is<00:05:15.560> one<00:05:15.770> of<00:05:15.889> the<00:05:16.010> events<00:05:16.669> especially

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
this is one of the events especially

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.350 
this is one of the events especially
designed<00:05:17.720> for<00:05:18.050> solar<00:05:18.320> system<00:05:19.280> and<00:05:19.639> the<00:05:20.030> second

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
designed for solar system and the second

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.600 
designed for solar system and the second
thing<00:05:20.539> that<00:05:20.599> we<00:05:20.990> talk<00:05:21.320> about<00:05:21.500> is<00:05:21.860> actually<00:05:22.130> our

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
thing that we talk about is actually our

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.790 
thing that we talk about is actually our
ventilation<00:05:23.419> fan<00:05:23.599> okay

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
ventilation fan okay

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.210 
ventilation fan okay
you<00:05:25.130> look<00:05:25.340> at<00:05:25.490> the<00:05:25.580> matter

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
you look at the matter

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.340 
you look at the matter
always<00:05:27.910> have<00:05:28.030> a<00:05:28.060> ventilation<00:05:28.570> fan<00:05:28.720> ruining

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
always have a ventilation fan ruining

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.380 
always have a ventilation fan ruining
some<00:05:30.270> not<00:05:31.380> like<00:05:32.380> this<00:05:32.530> or<00:05:32.710> they<00:05:32.860> have<00:05:32.950> two

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
some not like this or they have two

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.580 
some not like this or they have two
ventilation<00:05:34.390> fans<00:05:34.660> okay

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
ventilation fans okay

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.780 
ventilation fans okay
you<00:05:35.920> notice<00:05:36.340> the<00:05:36.610> traditional<00:05:37.270> or<00:05:37.480> some<00:05:38.200> other

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
you notice the traditional or some other

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.240 
you notice the traditional or some other
inverter<00:05:39.790> when<00:05:40.450> you<00:05:40.630> just<00:05:40.840> plug<00:05:41.110> in<00:05:41.290> the<00:05:41.620> power

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
inverter when you just plug in the power

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.880 
inverter when you just plug in the power
source<00:05:42.610> library<00:05:43.210> the<00:05:44.080> fellow<00:05:44.290> just<00:05:44.620> along

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
source library the fellow just along

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:50.150 
source library the fellow just along
okay<00:05:45.600> you're<00:05:46.600> finally<00:05:46.870> to<00:05:47.620> ventilate<00:05:48.160> the<00:05:49.090> fan

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
okay you're finally to ventilate the fan

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.350 
okay you're finally to ventilate the fan
actually<00:05:51.160> costs<00:05:51.550> quite<00:05:52.270> a<00:05:53.160> number<00:05:54.160> of<00:05:54.580> power

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
actually costs quite a number of power

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.570 
actually costs quite a number of power
consumption<00:05:55.780> yeah<00:05:56.200> so<00:05:56.800> again<00:05:57.550> they<00:05:59.190> the<00:06:00.190> event

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
consumption yeah so again they the event

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.390 
consumption yeah so again they the event
also<00:06:00.970> costs<00:06:01.660> energy<00:06:02.320> and<00:06:02.770> of<00:06:03.190> course

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
also costs energy and of course

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.640 
also costs energy and of course
automation<00:06:03.910> your<00:06:04.120> your<00:06:04.330> own<00:06:04.510> usage<00:06:04.930> of<00:06:05.080> energy

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
automation your your own usage of energy

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.470 
automation your your own usage of energy
and<00:06:06.190> the<00:06:06.970> fan<00:06:07.210> need<00:06:07.930> to<00:06:08.050> keep<00:06:08.380> this<00:06:08.560> guy<00:06:08.770> cool

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
and the fan need to keep this guy cool

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:15.840 
and the fan need to keep this guy cool
that<00:06:10.480> consume<00:06:11.170> energy<00:06:12.040> as<00:06:12.370> well<00:06:12.580> so<00:06:13.090> if<00:06:14.640> in<00:06:15.640> the

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
that consume energy as well so if in the

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.330 
that consume energy as well so if in the
end<00:06:15.900> you'll<00:06:16.900> find<00:06:17.200> out<00:06:17.350> a<00:06:17.500> lot<00:06:17.710> of<00:06:17.770> traditional

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
end you'll find out a lot of traditional

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.030 
end you'll find out a lot of traditional
kind<00:06:18.520> of<00:06:18.640> in<00:06:18.760> later<00:06:18.940> they<00:06:19.360> will<00:06:19.660> cause<00:06:20.140> you

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
kind of in later they will cause you

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.640 
kind of in later they will cause you
know<00:06:21.160> that<00:06:21.520> efficient<00:06:22.030> because<00:06:22.120> the<00:06:23.050> fan<00:06:23.350> of

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
know that efficient because the fan of

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.120 
know that efficient because the fan of
this<00:06:23.800> you<00:06:24.790> know<00:06:24.910> just<00:06:25.270> keep<00:06:25.630> the<00:06:25.750> Deepu<00:06:26.169> the

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 
this you know just keep the Deepu the

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.790 
this you know just keep the Deepu the
energy<00:06:27.430> lost<00:06:27.730> to<00:06:27.970> them<00:06:28.360> to<00:06:28.660> the<00:06:28.780> fan<00:06:28.990> for<00:06:29.620> our

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
energy lost to them to the fan for our

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.590 
energy lost to them to the fan for our
inverter<00:06:30.190> actually<00:06:30.640> we<00:06:30.850> designed<00:06:31.270> it<00:06:31.450> with

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
inverter actually we designed it with

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.280 
inverter actually we designed it with
the<00:06:32.350> fan<00:06:32.890> will<00:06:33.460> not<00:06:33.820> turn<00:06:34.150> on<00:06:34.390> the<00:06:35.080> fellow

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 
the fan will not turn on the fellow

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.620 
the fan will not turn on the fellow
already<00:06:35.950> turned<00:06:36.250> on<00:06:36.400> when<00:06:37.180> the<00:06:37.600> temperature

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
already turned on when the temperature

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.360 
already turned on when the temperature
of<00:06:38.380> the<00:06:39.100> inverter<00:06:39.610> is<00:06:40.090> more<00:06:40.720> than<00:06:40.930> 60<00:06:41.560> C<00:06:41.830> all

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
of the inverter is more than 60 C all

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.540 
of the inverter is more than 60 C all
right

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
right

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.080 
right
60s<00:06:43.240> then<00:06:43.990> the<00:06:44.200> fan<00:06:44.440> will<00:06:44.680> only<00:06:44.919> turn<00:06:45.460> on<00:06:45.669> and

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
60s then the fan will only turn on and

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.440 
60s then the fan will only turn on and
the<00:06:46.960> fellow<00:06:47.140> start<00:06:47.470> cooling<00:06:47.850> when<00:06:48.850> the

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450 
the fellow start cooling when the

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.990 
the fellow start cooling when the
temperature<00:06:49.900> drops<00:06:50.320> below<00:06:50.440> 60<00:06:50.740> C<00:06:51.370> the<00:06:51.820> fan

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
temperature drops below 60 C the fan

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.740 
temperature drops below 60 C the fan
water<00:06:52.240> not<00:06:52.510> so<00:06:52.810> by<00:06:53.020> doing<00:06:53.260> so<00:06:53.470> will<00:06:54.220> save<00:06:54.490> the

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
water not so by doing so will save the

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.540 
water not so by doing so will save the
energy<00:06:55.750> okay<00:06:56.530> so<00:06:56.590> the<00:06:56.830> you<00:06:56.979> know<00:06:57.010> your<00:06:57.220> battery

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
energy okay so the you know your battery

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.690 
energy okay so the you know your battery
or<00:06:57.820> your<00:06:58.000> solar<00:06:58.270> system<00:06:58.450> will<00:06:58.810> not<00:06:58.960> be<00:06:59.050> change

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700 
or your solar system will not be change

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.750 
or your solar system will not be change
too<00:07:00.700> fast<00:07:00.729> okay<00:07:01.560> another<00:07:02.560> thing<00:07:02.680> is<00:07:02.979> that<00:07:03.010> we

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.760 
too fast okay another thing is that we

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.810 
too fast okay another thing is that we
care<00:07:04.060> a<00:07:04.300> lot<00:07:04.330> of<00:07:04.570> tension<00:07:05.350> on<00:07:05.710> the<00:07:06.160> cooling

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820 
care a lot of tension on the cooling

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.570 
care a lot of tension on the cooling
system<00:07:07.210> of<00:07:07.390> our<00:07:07.630> inverter<00:07:08.140> beside<00:07:08.710> the<00:07:08.979> active

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:09.580 
system of our inverter beside the active

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.060 
system of our inverter beside the active
cooling<00:07:09.850> system<00:07:10.360> by<00:07:10.510> fan<00:07:10.900> by<00:07:11.260> ventilation<00:07:11.860> fan

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070 
cooling system by fan by ventilation fan

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.260 
cooling system by fan by ventilation fan
we<00:07:12.700> also<00:07:13.110> do<00:07:14.110> a<00:07:14.140> design<00:07:14.610> putting<00:07:15.610> a<00:07:15.790> lot<00:07:16.030> of

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
we also do a design putting a lot of

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.409 
we also do a design putting a lot of
people<00:07:16.930> sick<00:07:17.169> inside<00:07:18.100> inverter<00:07:18.640> okay

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:19.419 
people sick inside inverter okay

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:22.129 
people sick inside inverter okay
by<00:07:19.840> doing<00:07:19.900> so

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:22.139 
by doing so
