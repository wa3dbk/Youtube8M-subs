00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.489
 James Cameron returns to speak images 

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.660
 of the robots of transformers and me and 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:08.160
 after making a new movie 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.160
 welcome to jl vision 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.050
 Y 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.420
 and it's Cameron talks about the whole saga of 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.470
 terminator and like the movies of 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.320
 carefully, they did not like it 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.560
 very much the truth said I'm not a big fan of 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.560
 the movies 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.980
 I did not do the second one until I had a 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.019
 idea as big as that of the first and 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.759
 had to do with the moral complexity of 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.739
 the story and with asking the audience 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.620
 that at the end of the movie he will cry for 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.120
 a terminator I do not think the ten the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.670
 fourth movie fulfilled those 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.769
 expectations I have never seen much 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.120
 chronicles of sarah connor so I have not 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.519
 I had the opportunity to get hooked 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.809
 as passing the television series I hope 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.399
 that the new movies that are being 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.350
 doing right now with arnold 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.030
 schwarzenegger be good so 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.979
 seen far away they seem to be very 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.629
 fine and then the big question that has 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.000
 always emerged in the fan phenomenon that 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.030
 was who would win in a fight that 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.920
 face in the queen of the aliens a 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.290
 na'vi and one of 800 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.509
 point 800 with a plasma rifle 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.240
 it would end with all the only thing that would have 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.970
 what to do is wait in the queen and do 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.330
 that the na'vi was unleashed if the three are 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.180
 unarmed the queen would gain nap the 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.490
 Queen would win 800 because the 800 will 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.890
 would start a term to the queen so 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.680
 that would dissolve the frame and the cyborg would 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.039
 would now turn off a na'vi mounted on a 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.850
 ix mode and once mounted on a tan 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.440
 shut off it would be another story during 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.700
 a time also came the rumors 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.340
 about what was going to do a second 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.780
 part of risky lies and james 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.700
 cameron has also responded to that 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.679
 question we abandoned the draft 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.929
 risky lies 2 after 11-s 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.549
 because we thought that a comedy about 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.459
 fundamentalist terrorists was no longer 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.049
 funny and we never take it back also 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:57.890
 they asked what movie is your whim 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.240
 guilty favorite and said 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.549
 probably the first one is good 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.730
 key I just love that 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.000
 movie 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.320
 you have to defend a guilty whim and 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.790
 they also asked him about the movie 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.070
 prometheus that is run by a 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.050
 His friend also want good because 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.450
 it has to do with the years that always 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.430
 has had 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.290
 I think it's an interesting movie you 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.920
 makes you think and is very well assembled 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.920
 visually but it does not have much logic 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.480
 but and I'm glad it was done 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.819
 liked more than the previous two 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.310
 sequels of alien 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.129
 and then they asked him the question 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.530
 of the million that if you have ever wanted 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:42.160
 make another movie of someone 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.990
 and said I had the idea of ​​doing someone 5 and 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.870
 at a certain moment I was going to write it 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.480
 produce and ride was going to direct it 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.490
 we talk about it during a lunch and 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.400
 we agreed but in the end 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:57.069
 happened nothing force harassment or someone versus 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.800
 data and said I would not recommend 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.690
 you're going to ruin the sauce it 's like 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.030
 universal makes drácula versus the 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.760
 werewolf and then lost interest 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.050
 in making another air movie and I do not think 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.570
 have nothing to offer in the 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.190
 prometheus sequels are a thousand but 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.440
 none of this was the important thing what 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.600
 important is what happens with avatar what 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.400
 happens with those sequels that say they're going 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.080
 to make three sequels even that a 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.670
 it may be a prequel, there is still nothing 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.170
 clear of avatar sequels and by 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.380
 that James Cameron has answered us 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.720
 end a little something to have something of 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.700
 idea the second the third and the fourth 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.800
 film will be enrolled at the same time 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.019
 We are in the preproduction phase and 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.640
 also designing creatures landscapes and 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.340
 characters that will appear in the three 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.050
 ribbons 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.629
 and the scripts will be ready in a few 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.519
 six weeks the hardest thing right now 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.500
 is to cut incredible things so that the 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.900
 movies have an affordable duration 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.819
 and to finish some time ago came the 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.260
 arnold rumor that was going to 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.069
 appear in the avatar sequels already 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.739
 that as well 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.409
 they also leave many of their movies for the 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.329
 people already released the rumor and runs like 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.129
 gunpowder but it's already change has 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.950
 in charge of denying it 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.689
 manoli I have not talked about it and neither 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.630
 I see no role in the scripts that is 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.220
 suitable for the subway 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.510
 also michael bay they have made a 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.850
 interview and talked about the saga 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.470
 transformers and has confirmed us something 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.660
 that we already suspected this fourth part 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.640
 is the beginning of a new trilogy is 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.980
 a kind of new transformations we did 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.350
 three films a first trilogy and 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.270
 now we bet on the next I do not know 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.750
 still if I will direct the next two 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.670
 but that's what we're going to do 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.400
 the era of description is the first 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.050
 movie of a new trilogy also 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.720
 I talk about the live tsja that in this 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.030
 movie will not appear we finish well it's 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.690
 a great guy but we needed to change 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.000
 the history 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.130
 nobody was fired we both thought what 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.710
 himself he wanted to make three movies and 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.570
 It was when I called Mark World because we 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.910
 we had a great time doing pain and 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.950
 money and here we have our ways 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.660
 that we will see in transformers the era of 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.880
 extinction the first of all is like the 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.460
 optimus prime then we have the 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.890
 banderville that I think does not change much 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.130
 then automotive that looks like a 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.890
 kind of samurai the dino voices then 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.660
 that looks like a kind of triceratops 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.180
 bald troll that will surely be the most 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.380
 bad about this movie green blog if you go 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.180
 to make a movie with dinosaurs not 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.500
 forget to put in a day to use SLR 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.500
 the good ones like this 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:26.009
 to take a layer like that to a layer 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:28.589
 autobot hawn this will be like the look of the 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.389
 group dinos voices I did not think it was 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.309
 put velociraptor in the movie 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.379
 but this and the whole pint of being a 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:36.029
 velociraptor I hope there is more than one 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:38.550
 that there are like three or four and go there 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:41.550
 included love down that looks pretty 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.439
 normalito is expensive that I do not even know what 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.199
 which is like a kind of spinosaurus 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:49.589
 typical as in some parts but who 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:51.419
 you know skeptical in extinguishes that we have 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:53.909
 many dinosaurs but also many 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:55.740
 normal robberies like before and finally 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:58.740
 streiff that is the weirdest of all 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.089
 I do not know if it's a hippogriff eagle one of 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.569
 these dinosaurs that flew from the 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:02.569
 films 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.300
 or I miss this but 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.070
 sure that's a bit of a bastard 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.360
 sport like now we have no advantages 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.639
 that none 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.349
 good kevin smith it looks like he was still 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.199
 postponing the movie to believe stress 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:20.020
 because he was less involved in the production 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:22.150
 of tusk and just signed someone very 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.879
 important neither more nor less than johnny 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.349
 depp although I really wanted to see 33 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:28.599
 I begin to have enough interest in the 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:31.469
 movie tour especially now that they have 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:31.469
 signed to johnny depp 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:38.069
 for hands movie days subscribe to the 

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:38.069
 channel and cheer up the day
