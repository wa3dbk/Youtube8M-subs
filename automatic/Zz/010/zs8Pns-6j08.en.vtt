00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.120
 based on the previous ones of all this 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.430
 catalog is from the month of april 5 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.430
 dollars plus the marvel that is 125 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.440
 max or ours but everything that comes out 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.120
 are two months behind schedule, so what 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.949
 He left in April he will leave until May 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.690
 until June it will come out as in the end it is 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.100
 more or less so if they want it 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.540
 buy your thumb or you can not 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.800

 too the ironman and explained how it is 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.820
 probable and this is the marvel one so 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.030
 that I recommend them is a small 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.460
