that much more aggressive and the
quality<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.309> great<00:00:32.809> now<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:33.989> terms<00:00:34.230> of

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
quality is great now in terms of

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.990 
quality is great now in terms of
lighting<00:00:34.620> they<00:00:35.070> come<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:35.489> stock<00:00:35.760> halogen

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
lighting they come with stock halogen

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.479 
lighting they come with stock halogen
bulbs<00:00:36.750> which<00:00:37.020> one<00:00:37.620> coupled<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> smoked

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
bulbs which one coupled with the smoked

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.369 
bulbs which one coupled with the smoked
lens<00:00:38.820> makes<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.390> some<00:00:39.540> pretty<00:00:39.570> dim

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
lens makes for some pretty dim

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.799 
lens makes for some pretty dim
headlights<00:00:41.129> much<00:00:41.969> dimmer<00:00:42.239> than<00:00:42.450> stock

headlights much dimmer than stock
because<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.100> bought<00:00:44.340> an<00:00:44.520> HID<00:00:44.910> kit

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
because of this I bought an HID kit

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.869 
because of this I bought an HID kit
separately<00:00:45.809> from<00:00:45.989> DDM<00:00:46.559> tuning<00:00:47.070> now<00:00:47.700> if<00:00:47.789> you

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
separately from DDM tuning now if you

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.190 
separately from DDM tuning now if you
want<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.149> do<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.329> same<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:48.780> make<00:00:48.989> sure<00:00:49.170> that

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
want to do the same just make sure that

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.610 
want to do the same just make sure that
the<00:00:49.410> bulbs<00:00:49.739> are<00:00:49.829> h9s<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.730> 35<00:00:51.270> watts<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.989> know

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the bulbs are h9s and 35 watts I know

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.900 
the bulbs are h9s and 35 watts I know
there's<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> bunch<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.190> rumors<00:00:53.430> going<00:00:53.610> around

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
there's a bunch of rumors going around

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.389 
there's a bunch of rumors going around
online<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.780> they'll<00:00:55.559> melt<00:00:55.800> your<00:00:56.010> housing

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
online that they'll melt your housing

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.670 
online that they'll melt your housing
and<00:00:56.550> stuff<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.120> definitely<00:00:57.660> not<00:00:58.230> true

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
and stuff like that definitely not true

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.010 
and stuff like that definitely not true
but<00:00:59.280> even<00:00:59.430> with<00:00:59.820> these<00:00:59.910> HIDs<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.600> lights<00:01:00.809> are

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
but even with these HIDs the lights are

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.750 
but even with these HIDs the lights are
hardly<00:01:01.379> any<00:01:01.649> brighter<00:01:02.160> than<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> stock

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
hardly any brighter than the stock

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.630 
hardly any brighter than the stock
halogens<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.480> because<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.650> bulbs<00:01:04.920> are<00:01:05.100> more

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
halogens and because the bulbs are more

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.039 
halogens and because the bulbs are more
to<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.909> center<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> car<00:01:06.630> than<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
to the center of the car than on the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.300 
to the center of the car than on the
stock<00:01:07.350> headlights<00:01:07.770> where<00:01:07.950> they<00:01:08.040> were<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
stock headlights where they were on the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.969 
stock headlights where they were on the
outside<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.510> width<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.960> coverage<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.530> also<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
outside the width of coverage is also a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.890 
outside the width of coverage is also a
bit<00:01:11.310> less<00:01:11.670> now<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.420> definitely

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
bit less now this is definitely

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.719 
bit less now this is definitely
noticeable<00:01:13.290> when<00:01:13.979> you're<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.369> around<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
noticeable when you're going around a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.420 
noticeable when you're going around a
blind<00:01:15.030> corner<00:01:15.299> something<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.430> also

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
blind corner something like that also

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.700 
blind corner something like that also
the<00:01:17.820> high<00:01:17.939> beams<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.659> work<00:01:18.930> well<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.439> all<00:01:19.590> that

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
the high beams do work well but all that

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.109 
the high beams do work well but all that
happens<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.610> shutter<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
happens is that the shutter of the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.940 
happens is that the shutter of the
projector<00:01:21.600> opens<00:01:21.990> up<00:01:22.170> altering<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> beam

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
projector opens up altering the beam

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.859 
projector opens up altering the beam
pattern<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.640> basically<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.479> scattering

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
pattern and basically just scattering

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.200 
pattern and basically just scattering
the<00:01:25.049> light<00:01:25.200> around<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.619> bit<00:01:25.799> more<00:01:26.210> now

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the light around a bit more now

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.969 
the light around a bit more now
installation<00:01:27.810> wasn't<00:01:28.170> too<00:01:28.320> difficult<00:01:28.530> but<00:01:28.950> I

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
installation wasn't too difficult but I

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.770 
installation wasn't too difficult but I
did<00:01:29.280> need<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> lift<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.000> car<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.570> could

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
did need to lift the car so that I could

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.899 
did need to lift the car so that I could
remove<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.259> front<00:01:31.530> bumper<00:01:31.829> without<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
remove the front bumper without the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.850 
remove the front bumper without the
proper<00:01:33.270> tools<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.810> took<00:01:33.990> me<00:01:34.140> about<00:01:34.470> seven

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
proper tools it took me about seven

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.800 
proper tools it took me about seven
hours<00:01:35.189> from<00:01:35.460> start<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.880> finish<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.659> that's

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
hours from start to finish and that's

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.210 
hours from start to finish and that's
just<00:01:37.020> with<00:01:37.200> some<00:01:37.380> simple<00:01:37.680> wrenches<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
just with some simple wrenches and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.100 
just with some simple wrenches and
whatnot<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.180> with<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.420> right<00:01:39.600> tools<00:01:39.900> it

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
whatnot but with the right tools it

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.050 
whatnot but with the right tools it
should<00:01:40.380> take<00:01:40.590> maybe<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.979> whole<00:01:41.220> afternoon<00:01:41.670> if

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
should take maybe a whole afternoon if

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.880 
should take maybe a whole afternoon if
that<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:43.020> lights<00:01:43.229> didn't<00:01:43.560> need<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.770> be

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
that and the lights didn't need to be

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.889 
that and the lights didn't need to be
adjusted<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.790> lot<00:01:45.240> they<00:01:45.420> were<00:01:45.479> basically

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
adjusted up a lot they were basically

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.350 
adjusted up a lot they were basically
pointed<00:01:46.350> right<00:01:46.470> down<00:01:46.680> at<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.829> ground<00:01:47.360> now

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
pointed right down at the ground now

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.819 
pointed right down at the ground now
what<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.509> don't<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.899> about<00:01:48.960> these<00:01:49.290> lights<00:01:49.590> is

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
what I don't like about these lights is

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.010 
what I don't like about these lights is
out<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> halo<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.610> accent<00:01:51.030> LEDs<00:01:51.450> which<00:01:51.750> look

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
out the halo and accent LEDs which look

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.499 
out the halo and accent LEDs which look
awesome<00:01:52.290> are<00:01:53.040> only<00:01:53.340> designed<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:54.030> turn<00:01:54.270> on

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
awesome are only designed to turn on

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.940 
awesome are only designed to turn on
with<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> parking<00:01:55.259> lights<00:01:55.470> or<00:01:55.710> when<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
with the parking lights or when the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.370 
with the parking lights or when the
headlights<00:01:56.130> are<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.450> they<00:01:57.570> don't<00:01:57.869> act<00:01:58.140> as

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
headlights are on so they don't act as

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.770 
headlights are on so they don't act as
daytime<00:01:58.860> running<00:01:59.189> lights<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.420> all<00:02:00.600> has

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
daytime running lights so this all has

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.810 
daytime running lights so this all has
to<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.110> with<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> way<00:02:01.500> they're<00:02:01.710> wired<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.700> what

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
to do with the way they're wired so what

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.069 
to do with the way they're wired so what
I<00:02:02.850> did<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.149> get<00:02:03.270> around<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.659> was<00:02:03.840> connected

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
I did to get around this was connected

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.380 
I did to get around this was connected
to<00:02:04.290> red<00:02:04.560> power<00:02:04.890> wire<00:02:05.040> for<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.670> accent<00:02:06.180> lights

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.510

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
using some extra cable and then ran that

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.070 
using some extra cable and then ran that
to<00:02:11.069> fuse<00:02:11.310> 39<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.180> fuse
