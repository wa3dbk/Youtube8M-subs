down to a hundredth of a second they're
currently<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.360> fifth<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.900> second<00:00:16.289> how

precisely<00:00:17.070> do<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.430> think<00:00:17.640> races<00:00:18.000> should<00:00:18.029> be

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
precisely do you think races should be

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.960 
precisely do you think races should be
recorded<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:19.430> think<00:00:20.430> it's<00:00:20.520> good<00:00:20.670> where<00:00:20.850> it's

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
recorded I think it's good where it's

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.820 
recorded I think it's good where it's
out<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.150> fifth<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.630> second<00:00:22.020> but<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.170> mean<00:00:22.380> any

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
out of fifth of a second but I mean any

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.400 
out of fifth of a second but I mean any
information<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.460> helps<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.880> betters

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
information that helps the betters

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.960 
information that helps the betters
they're<00:00:25.410> what<00:00:25.560> keep<00:00:25.590> us<00:00:25.830> going<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.400> if<00:00:26.820> that's

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
they're what keep us going so if that's

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.169 
they're what keep us going so if that's
what<00:00:27.330> they<00:00:27.449> want<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.900> well<00:00:28.050> then<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.130> it

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
what they want and well then so be it

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.700 
what they want and well then so be it
well<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.630> don't<00:00:30.960> know<00:00:31.230> if<00:00:31.380> that's<00:00:31.529> going<00:00:31.650> to

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
well I don't know if that's going to

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.350 
well I don't know if that's going to
make<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.920> big<00:00:32.099> difference<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.759> people<00:00:33.180> betting

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
make a big difference in people betting

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.870 
make a big difference in people betting
on<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> hundreds<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.410> second<00:00:34.829> oh<00:00:35.040> it's

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
on to a hundreds of a second oh it's

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.270 
on to a hundreds of a second oh it's
pretty<00:00:36.239> good<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.510> way<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.630> was<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.410> if<00:00:37.950> it

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
pretty good the way it was but if it

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.889 
pretty good the way it was but if it
gets<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.489> little<00:00:38.640> more<00:00:38.850> technical<00:00:39.090> with<00:00:39.600> all

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
gets a little more technical with all

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.319 
gets a little more technical with all
the<00:00:40.110> internet<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.860> iPads<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.090> everything

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
the internet and iPads and everything

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.479 
the internet and iPads and everything
it'll<00:00:42.480> probably<00:00:42.660> help<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.020> bit<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.200> guess<00:00:43.320> I'm<00:00:44.309> I

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
it'll probably help a bit I guess I'm I

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.740 
it'll probably help a bit I guess I'm I
don't<00:00:44.640> know<00:00:44.700> if<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:44.850> need<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.059> go<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.300> far<00:00:45.329> but

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
don't know if we need to go that far but

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.610 
don't know if we need to go that far but
I<00:00:46.879> don't<00:00:47.879> mind<00:00:48.000> fist<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.539> second<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.500> know

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
I don't mind fist of a second I you know

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.410 
I don't mind fist of a second I you know
if<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.920> want<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.280> technol<00:00:50.700> tense<00:00:51.000> maybe

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
if you want to get technol tense maybe

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.720 
if you want to get technol tense maybe
would<00:00:51.780> be<00:00:51.899> enough<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:53.129> know<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.460> don't

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
would be enough you know what I don't

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.100 
would be enough you know what I don't
really<00:00:53.850> think<00:00:54.059> time<00:00:54.300> matters<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.750> think<00:00:54.960> it's

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
really think time matters I think it's

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.209 
really think time matters I think it's
more<00:00:55.260> important<00:00:55.590> who<00:00:55.649> crosses<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.190> finish

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
more important who crosses the finish

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.240 
more important who crosses the finish
line<00:00:56.520> first<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.329> mean<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.469> could<00:00:58.710> win<00:00:58.890> every

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
line first I mean if I could win every

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.250 
line first I mean if I could win every
single<00:00:59.280> race<00:00:59.789> in<00:01:00.239> two<00:01:00.510> minutes<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.960> would<00:01:01.020> be

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
single race in two minutes I would be

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.060 
single race in two minutes I would be
thrilled<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:02.359> I<00:01:03.359> guess<00:01:03.680> time<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.920> something

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
thrilled but I guess time is something

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.070 
thrilled but I guess time is something
that's<00:01:05.309> tangible<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:06.270> people<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.049> use

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
that's tangible that people like to use

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.620 
that's tangible that people like to use
to<00:01:07.619> compare<00:01:08.010> horses<00:01:08.549> even<00:01:08.880> though<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.270> don't

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
to compare horses even though I don't

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.780 
to compare horses even though I don't
necessarily<00:01:10.350> agree<00:01:10.920> with<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.610> should

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
necessarily agree with that you should

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.359 
necessarily agree with that you should
always<00:01:11.909> compare<00:01:12.330> horses<00:01:12.720> either<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.799> i<00:01:14.070> don't

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
always compare horses either but i don't

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.690 
always compare horses either but i don't
i<00:01:14.610> think<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.509> way<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.990> now<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.650> good<00:01:17.490> enough

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
i think the way it is now is good enough

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.570 
i think the way it is now is good enough
for<00:01:17.970> me<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.570> think<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.680> fifths<00:01:20.159> way<00:01:20.310> they<00:01:20.460> are

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
for me I think in fifths way they are

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.520 
for me I think in fifths way they are
maybe<00:01:20.820> even<00:01:21.030> tense<00:01:21.330> at<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.570> most<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.049> i'm

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
maybe even tense at the most but i'm

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.190 
maybe even tense at the most but i'm
pretty<00:01:22.710> happy<00:01:22.890> its<00:01:23.159> way<00:01:23.250> there<00:01:23.420> i<00:01:24.420> think<00:01:25.020> we

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
pretty happy its way there i think we

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.120 
pretty happy its way there i think we
went<00:01:25.380> through<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> few<00:01:26.100> years<00:01:26.130> ago<00:01:26.430> here

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
went through that a few years ago here

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.469 
went through that a few years ago here
i'm<00:01:29.130> not<00:01:29.310> sure<00:01:29.460> if<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.850> hundredth<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.360> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
i'm not sure if it was a hundredth of a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.060 
i'm not sure if it was a hundredth of a
second<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:30.990> was<00:01:31.110> tenths<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.650> second<00:01:32.040> i

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
second but it was tenths of a second i

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.300 
second but it was tenths of a second i
believe

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
believe

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.190 
believe
and<00:01:33.399> I<00:01:33.790> don't<00:01:34.210> find<00:01:34.600> it<00:01:34.780> made<00:01:34.960> much<00:01:35.170> difference

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
and I don't find it made much difference

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.929 
and I don't find it made much difference
I<00:01:35.860> think<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.780> way<00:01:37.930> it's<00:01:38.590> set<00:01:38.740> up<00:01:38.799> now<00:01:38.920> with<00:01:39.369> one

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
I think the way it's set up now with one

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.819 
I think the way it's set up now with one
length<00:01:40.210> for<00:01:40.540> each<00:01:40.659> fifth<00:01:40.990> makes<00:01:41.530> a<00:01:41.649> lot<00:01:41.799> of

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
length for each fifth makes a lot of

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.770 
length for each fifth makes a lot of
sense<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.460> it's<00:01:43.210> easier<00:01:43.570> for<00:01:43.600> the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
sense and it's easier for the

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.080 
sense and it's easier for the
handicapper<00:01:44.409> I<00:01:44.439> think<00:01:44.710> you're<00:01:44.829> just

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
handicapper I think you're just

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.630 
handicapper I think you're just
basically<00:01:46.090> complicating<00:01:47.049> things<00:01:47.079> I<00:01:47.640> think

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
basically complicating things I think

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.550 
basically complicating things I think
that's<00:01:48.789> a<00:01:48.939> little<00:01:49.060> bit<00:01:49.439> over<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.530> top

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
that's a little bit over the top

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.260 
that's a little bit over the top
probably<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.549> way<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:51.789> is<00:01:51.880> right<00:01:52.060> now<00:01:52.119> the

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
probably the way it is right now the

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.359 
probably the way it is right now the
timing<00:01:52.780> is<00:01:52.869> very<00:01:52.899> very<00:01:53.259> good<00:01:53.530> i<00:01:53.560> think<00:01:53.740> i<00:01:54.130> think

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
timing is very very good i think i think

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.770 
timing is very very good i think i think
that's<00:01:54.640> over<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:54.970> top<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:55.420> they<00:01:55.539> really

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
that's over the top and they really

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.899 
that's over the top and they really
don't<00:01:55.810> need<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.200> do<00:01:56.409> that<00:01:56.439> but<00:01:56.920> whatever<00:01:57.549> makes

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
don't need to do that but whatever makes

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.359 
don't need to do that but whatever makes
the<00:01:58.030> better<00:01:58.179> is<00:01:58.299> happy<00:01:58.570> I<00:01:58.600> guess<00:01:58.869> I<00:01:59.250> think<00:02:00.250> the

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
the better is happy I guess I think the

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.580 
the better is happy I guess I think the
fifth<00:02:00.610> of<00:02:00.759> a<00:02:00.820> second<00:02:01.240> is<00:02:01.299> good<00:02:01.450> enough<00:02:01.689> I<00:02:01.990> like

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
fifth of a second is good enough I like

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.350 
fifth of a second is good enough I like
the<00:02:02.740> way<00:02:02.829> it<00:02:02.950> is<00:02:02.979> right<00:02:03.220> now<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.729> know<00:02:03.820> they<00:02:04.179> go

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
the way it is right now you know they go

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.180 
the way it is right now you know they go
like<00:02:04.960> you<00:02:05.049> said<00:02:05.229> fist<00:02:05.470> of<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.649> second<00:02:06.039> and

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
like you said fist of a second and

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.770 
like you said fist of a second and
everybody<00:02:06.759> kind<00:02:06.909> of<00:02:07.030> knows<00:02:07.149> what<00:02:07.360> that<00:02:07.390> is<00:02:07.630> so

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
everybody kind of knows what that is so

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.660 
everybody kind of knows what that is so
I<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:08.049> like<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.380> way<00:02:08.470> it<00:02:08.590> is<00:02:08.679> right<00:02:08.799> now<00:02:08.890> I<00:02:09.250> I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
I I like the way it is right now I I

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.640 
I I like the way it is right now I I
think<00:02:10.209> that's<00:02:10.330> unnecessary<00:02:10.630> I'm<00:02:11.200> fine<00:02:11.440> with<00:02:11.590> a

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
think that's unnecessary I'm fine with a

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.500 
think that's unnecessary I'm fine with a
fifth<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.100> second<00:02:12.489> I<00:02:12.549> think<00:02:12.610> it's<00:02:12.940> some<00:02:13.209> I

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
fifth of a second I think it's some I

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.660 
fifth of a second I think it's some I
think<00:02:14.410> that's<00:02:14.590> just<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.980> little<00:02:15.190> bit<00:02:15.280> overboard

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
think that's just a little bit overboard

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.460 
think that's just a little bit overboard
and<00:02:15.819> in<00:02:15.940> my<00:02:16.060> thing<00:02:16.299> and<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:16.569> it's<00:02:16.959> not

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
and in my thing and it's it's not

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.320 
and in my thing and it's it's not
necessary<00:02:18.099> uh<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:20.500> don't<00:02:21.430> really<00:02:21.849> it<00:02:22.120> doesn't

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
necessary uh I don't really it doesn't

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.100 
necessary uh I don't really it doesn't
really<00:02:22.540> matter<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.989> me<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:24.810> think<00:02:25.810> once<00:02:25.959> we<00:02:26.019> all

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
really matter to me I think once we all

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.289 
really matter to me I think once we all
tried<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.650> for<00:02:26.799> a<00:02:26.860> while<00:02:27.069> and<00:02:27.459> they<00:02:28.000> kind<00:02:28.180> of

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
tried it for a while and they kind of

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.520 
tried it for a while and they kind of
gave<00:02:28.450> up<00:02:28.510> on<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:30.000> uh<00:02:31.000> I'm<00:02:31.870> not<00:02:32.110> sure<00:02:32.170> on<00:02:32.500> that

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
gave up on that uh I'm not sure on that

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.009 
gave up on that uh I'm not sure on that
I<00:02:32.980> think<00:02:33.580> fifth<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:33.970> seconds<00:02:34.360> close<00:02:34.510> enough<00:02:34.870> I

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
I think fifth the seconds close enough I

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:35.970 
I think fifth the seconds close enough I
don't<00:02:35.200> really<00:02:35.290> think<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.560> matters<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.860> whole

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
don't really think it matters a whole

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.240 
don't really think it matters a whole
lot<00:02:36.329> i'm<00:02:37.329> satisfied<00:02:38.140> with<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.799> way<00:02:38.920> it's<00:02:39.040> time

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
lot i'm satisfied with the way it's time

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.039 
lot i'm satisfied with the way it's time
now<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.489> don't<00:02:39.820> see<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.030> think<00:02:40.660> there's<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.870> lot

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
now I don't see I think there's a lot

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.599 
now I don't see I think there's a lot
more<00:02:41.079> important<00:02:41.650> things<00:02:41.829> there<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.340> change

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
more important things there the change

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.729 
more important things there the change
in<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.850> times<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:43.359> races<00:02:43.750> yeah<00:02:44.410> obviously

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
in the times of the races yeah obviously

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.460 
in the times of the races yeah obviously
it<00:02:45.010> will<00:02:45.880> make<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.150> big<00:02:46.269> difference<00:02:46.420> for<00:02:46.870> the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
it will make a big difference for the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.830 
it will make a big difference for the
records<00:02:48.459> being<00:02:48.670> broken<00:02:48.760> stuff<00:02:49.299> i<00:02:49.420> guess<00:02:49.600> but<00:02:49.780> i

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
records being broken stuff i guess but i

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.009 
records being broken stuff i guess but i
do<00:02:50.590> i<00:02:50.680> like<00:02:50.950> fifth<00:02:51.459> of<00:02:51.609> seconds<00:02:52.030> is<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.239> or<00:02:52.870> the

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
do i like fifth of seconds is it or the

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.599 
do i like fifth of seconds is it or the
fifths<00:02:53.319> there<00:02:53.470> i<00:02:53.500> like<00:02:53.799> them<00:02:53.980> pretty<00:02:54.190> good<00:02:54.370> so

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
fifths there i like them pretty good so

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.130 
fifths there i like them pretty good so
they'll<00:02:55.359> take<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.540> while<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.840> get<00:02:55.900> on<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.109> the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
they'll take a while to get on to the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.739 
they'll take a while to get on to the
other<00:02:56.290> ones<00:02:56.470> i<00:02:56.560> think
