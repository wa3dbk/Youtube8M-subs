00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.460
 and how about jazz friends andrei flowers 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.589
 as they have been and so good in this 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:12.049
 We are going to teach you with the s4 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:15.799
 mini on occasion of 91 95 l update it 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:19.130
 to lollipop and then in this case to this 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:22.640
 which is the 4 of my restart sister 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:26.539
 from the factory and to see what is 7 and 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:30.230
 91 95 from here I teach them and how they see 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:33.590
 it has android 4.4 points 2 and then what 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.020
 we removed we installed the huermur so 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.600
 we go 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.290
 restart the recovery mode and right now 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.290
 came back 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.239
 and sorry for making the video like that but 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.730
 when I was recording there was a lot 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.559
 up and I would not be very naive 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.120
 so to enter and enter mode 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.140
 of recovery let's press the key 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.000
 of home power and volume up and to 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.899
 same time and we're going to wait for 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.789
 start in the recovery mode and here I am 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.450
 It worked a little bit but I'm going to go back to 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:09.180
 do 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.509
 and well before we continue, I'm going to 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.110
 clarify that all the gti files and 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.780
 91 95 are compatible with the termination 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.210
 l so for the cycle to be rounds 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.869
 or something like that first let's make a 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.380
 wave datafactory fraser with 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.869
 we select with the volume buttons 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.869
 and the home and then a web cache 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.649
 partition and in the end let's go to 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.649
 advanced 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.030
 of cache and since that's already going to 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.759
 install and select it in this case 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.560
 I have it in the esb and coal that is the 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:54.319
 micro sd we are going to install it and we 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.110
 appear the folders we will look in 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.900
 this case is the folder and install 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.400
 first the earth 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.400
 we put that yes 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.830
 and here we are going to wait for 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.410
 start installing as it takes a 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.170
 little bit so now go back 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.390
 well we have just installed it takes as 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.080
 one minute and let's put through where 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.480
 are the glasses we are going to go to the folder 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.630
 and we look for them and we install ourselves 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.580
 way and let's wait for them to finish 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.950
 install this is takes a little bit 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.750
 more so do not worry 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.410
 let's wait good already finished 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.840
 and we are going to return they kill us of bach already 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.110
 install revolving eastern av 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.030
 and here we put the back key to 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.960
 let nothing happen and let's wait for 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.300
 restart 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:54.170
 and as above it has a legend that says 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.960
 be guaranty kernel something like that said not me 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.420
 agreement is because it is no longer the same 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.990
 card so as they see and change the 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.450
 imation volcano that is from that animal and 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:09.110
 let's wait here 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.150
 and then reigns in what we are asking 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.980
 subscribe to the channel as I already 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.300

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:20.180

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.239
 subscribers and every time we grow 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.569
 more thanks to your support and everything since without 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.510
 your support we would not be anything us and I 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.040
 can you contact us on facebook on twitter 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.970

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.769
 videos 4 pm s5 s4 good 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.250
 in the account are built because what 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.580
 I broke up 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.520
 also the right now the 4 axis mini and then 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.240
 several teams that come out maybe the 16th 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.850
 We do not know but we will wait as you see 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.280
 already start 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.520
 and we're going to wait until the 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.440
 applications and here I take a little bit 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.260
 I was worried about six minutes 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.740
 but do not worry because there are several 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.910
 applications and if they are a bit slow 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:12.240
 I do not know why but then here at the end 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.650
 as better faster and here I am going to 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.650
 leave for them to see how indus 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.460
 I tell them I 'm going to leave it here so that 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.520
 see how it starts so they see that no 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.250
 the plagiarism of the video or anything like that 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.729
 so you can let us wait for missing 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.729
 an app 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.640
 and they are already starting to applications 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.100
 and this rom is said today in team mode 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.760
 It is very stable and put lollipop 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.580
 obviously and it looks great since I 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.090
 they like it more than they leave it and it's already started 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.030
 let's put our language 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.280
 in this case Spanish and there it locked 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.270
 little bit but it was because the first 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.630
 times to accommodate the files and so 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.380
 so let's put the network and right now 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.380
 we come back 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.930
 they see that already hot clear is of more 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.940
 so let's connect and right now 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.720
 come back let's put all our 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.820
 data and now back 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.350
 and we're going to start 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.890
 so that they will already change the 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:31.130
 animations there is taking so long in 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.440
 load but I tell them it 's the first time and 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.560
 we already received the emails and here brought 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.820
 launchers recommends that google not 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.500
 boats 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:45.350
 and we always so as we go 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.170
 Let's see 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.300
 and wait for recent applications and 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.270
 the bar as something should not cost us 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.280
 a lot and also list and to see that 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.250
 is the lipo we go as always about the 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.650
 device and as you see has already been 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.610
 updated to lollipop in this case 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.610
 5.1.1 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.220
 and how is it in the way matters 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.770
 all the updates like this has to 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.020
 worry about here is the dragon of 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.470
 applications the camera in this case 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:19.910
 full of sanctions but then there is no 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.910
 a lot to ask 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.870
 what else can you teach them 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.050
 and here is the loc screen that also 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:32.900
 many we have to love 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:36.979
 those animations beautiful animations that 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.870
 we like them and as I tell them the truth 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:42.250
 I prefer this so if you do 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:46.930
 the video subscribe comments give it like and 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.930
