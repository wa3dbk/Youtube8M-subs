00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.930
 and good hello to all 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.130
 today we find ourselves for this 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.290
 new strategic favorite a little 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.910
 special devoted to oopa unleashed yes 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.260
 we will not talk about them or not normal because 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.090
 this thing is useless we will talk 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.240
 from them or not unleash the master of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.650
 dimensions and space time there this 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.789
 pokemon of a little bit a dia the guy 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.860
 is a pale who at the same time is a 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.140
 little short chelou then this type pokémon 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.640
 was holding dropsy so already it's a guy 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.410
 who offensively and not too badly 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.809
 unfortunately defensively it's a 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.460
 not very weak, but he has a lot 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.500
 of rather interesting statistics these 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.239
 basic stats are pretty correct very 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.510
 correct offensively even a speed 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.550
 of 80 can be pretty cool it happens 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.250
 to overtake until ithrane crowd speed 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.230
 he reaches 284 maximum speedo so 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.579
 it's not too bad here it's 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.649
 yahia little nothings stone frankly 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.110
 there's worse and his attac stats are 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.550
 much bigger shit and 160 to 170 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.160
 it's way too much in both 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.740
 stadium attack blow show on 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.990
 this sheet we will talk about 2.7 so we 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.930
 going to talk about this set has it there you 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.759
 see on the screen so c-17 mix is so 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.800
 basically I thought, well, we're going 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.840
 start with something like this because 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.729
 that it is true that we have no return 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.470
 on this pokemon not a lot of people 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.209
 speaks in 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.649
 to make sets on it is enough 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.569
 complicated considering we can play when custom 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.340
 games / showdown so I thought 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.979
 will leave on its so quite a thing mix 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.300
 then help 252 attack because I 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.759
 thought it was the smallest 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.160
 for there to be more power on 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.599
 his speed signature attack 236 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.330
 it is to overtake until ithrane 

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:44.009
 crowd speed and 20 da tax is it's 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.060
 for the rest is provided that he is 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.220
 unique is all the ubs is a little 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.899
 attacked and nature in a hurry that's how 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.030
 his defense is ridiculous as much 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.580
 lower it even more it will serve us 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.899
 not anyway the orbi object that I 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.300
 find the most interesting object on 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.860
 this pokemon given that as it mx 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.349
 is already the time of life and the best 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.880
 object for crisis objects could 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:04.810
 to be interesting about him but there for the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.209
 shot I preferred during life 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.540
 with 280 speed it is enough 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.150
 fast for break some pokémons of 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.700
 the un who are who are very present and 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.019
 So here we go, we have to attack 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.459
 perspective fury so I caught myself 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.290
 all his name in French I'm sorry 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.970
 I could not find it 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.170
 I could have looked a little better I 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.819
 know but hey it's a little bit 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.230
 feigning brief hyperspace fury in 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.040
 English who in his signature attack 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.500
 dark type without power 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.930
 explore what so there to touch who 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.670
 catch up with some steels especially 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.680
 this is the combat bow combo that is 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.099
 always so shit and do derbal in 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.900
 grass 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.849
 why no grass was for especially 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.519
 so he ecosphere I preferred the 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.010
 pcaa carnot derby to hip hop dan a 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.870
 fool life so that's pretty good so 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.959
 that at wimbledon it allows you to type 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.750
 some bulky water from the style to the barrel 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.920
 of the Hanafi star style to what waters 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.630
 that's the kind of thing is any 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.000
 way not in pros volume that is small pot 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.739
 that he is not afraid of no grass will 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.390
 oil anyway joint break 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.890
 space fury so that's it's not 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.180
 really problem and sorting canon in 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.650
 last move simply because 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.959
 iphone tricks physical attacks of 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.120
 little poisons and that it is perfect for 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.560
 farting the ferries because yes the ferries that 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.540
 we shit his record and especially the 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.280
 combat bow combo that is way too much 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.670
 smoked so this is basically this set and mx 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.660
 help 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.010
 it's interesting enough because this 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.630
 who hands over touched a lot of 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.840
 world he really has a type coverage 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.099
 to his excellent tremendous power 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.780
 either axp his attack are just 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.489
 colossal so it really helps 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.950
 to make big potatoes with this pokémon 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.079
 exploit force from what you're doing 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.299
 muscular role 85% it seems to me you 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.609
 the layers a ferry anyway and do not 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.440
 grass little ko 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.419
 hyponnen so that's really really 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.840
 stylish so that's it so it's a little 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.790
 set 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.799
 in the beginning I was gone on that and then I 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.730
 discovered something even better I 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.049
 want to say unfortunately there is 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.790
 not his signature attack that's why 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.560
 that it had been followed for yeah that's 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.150
 some years I played or not without 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.190
 his signature attack is not hype 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.209
 anyway but hey we do not care we're 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.849
 there to make the strain is not 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.560
 to play hit hype this is the 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.110
 second set that I had thought knows 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.870
 simply full attack spe 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.609
 nasty pelota so exploit machination 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.630
 dark free forces and sai shock then 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.430
 to explain a little bit the 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.260
 this machination or just there 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.590
 to boost the tax p2 or not that is 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.410
 already colossal 170 more during life that 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.960
 gives even more power to explore 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.030
 obscure for the combat bow combo and 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.510
 unfortunately for the ferry by 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.580
 example if the key men queues stop 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.230
 arias and all that kind of pokemon I'm 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.630
 I'm told that's a shame I wanted 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.400
 well put him some sort of canon in move 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.700
 but I told myself he's good he learns that 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.040
 it shocks me it's stable and more 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.620
 allows us this allows in addition to +22 to 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.960
 hk to the lucky man so I said good 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.210
 well, we're going to go on that so I know 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.980
 really not if it's the best thing 6 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.440
 and 1 the one that will really be used 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.210
 to small or not but as I go 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.919
 I am told we will make suspicions I 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.240
 frozen was testing in castle games you will see 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.270
 matches like I told you and 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.700
 frankly this set really pleased me 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.870
 machination three attacks this country whose 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.130
 one that relies on the physical 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.660
 plus it allows not from the 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.210
 lowering the defense through nature 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.490
 shy so I thought good why 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.960
 not so more we can increase the 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.880
 defense of it or not and withstand a few 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.160
 price attacks on the physical I got 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.560
 says oh never know why not that can 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.660
 always be stylish so here I am 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.270
 party on these two sets the first mix 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.169
 help and the second full attack this 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.419
 pelota penalty 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.520
 so I'm not I have not tried this 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.830
 physical crowd because good I have not 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.630
 found some pretty cool stuff because 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.560
 good one thing that can see there the 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.780
 attacks that must be touched the types 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.270
 sitting had fire point he had run for 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.070
 break in combat attack there are some 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.600
 pokemon who suddenly full physical does not 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.160
 then could no longer touched whose cube 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.150
 red I told myself yeah it's not 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.310
 it's not that crazy 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.850
 the mix helps and the flat tax peace are 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.800
 really nice so that's okay listen I 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.830
 leave you on these two little ones 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.650
 wholesale plugs to summarize I can say 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.810
 that or not really going to be a pokemon 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.570
 who will be able this tie-break enormously 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.400
 he will be very present I think at the top 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.070
 a pole and not to the hype at the beginning so 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.160
 necessarily it will be played everywhere but 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.780
 will see if he will stay at the will not pass or 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.610
 he says who will go to the mores I 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.830
 am not sure honestly i'm not 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.080
 sure because they will certainly it is very 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.020
 powerful but really has a 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.729
 cardboard defense and a speed that 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.800
 allow to stay correct that's it 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:35.419
 not a speed without facilities do not 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.919
 would it be that at speed sambath already 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.570
 he was already starting a little bit too much 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:41.120
 smoked the thing but that's okay 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.160
 it's just right I find it 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.690
 is really really good and hautmont 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.260
 pressure we'll see it's just that 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.539
 suspicions 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.530
 I think he will stay with him in 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:50.360
 the top 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.910
 him in any case really stylish like 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.810
 pokemon very very powerful and so that's it 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.860
 August break and I leave you on this 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.300
 only in comments 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.160
 what do you think of this pokemon of 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.690
 how will you play it there is 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.039
 really actually what's good with this 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.500
 podium this can really play in 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:04.849
 full of this word already in my pocket
