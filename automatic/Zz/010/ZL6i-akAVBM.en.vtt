00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.309
 epic that shakes the whole screen 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.350
 wherever you are on the map of all the 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.300
 map of the gta you tremble here as I am 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.360

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.149
 they are dancing duster is worth and always 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.730
 it happens even if you are in another point you go to 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.050
 keep watching how the screen is 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.750
 rumbling now what listening is with 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.210
 sounds in other videos that I record 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.010
 and at the end of the video I'm going to put a 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.500
 piece where I put the command in the 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.260
 live table and you hear how 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.680

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.310
 sniper varied with the sniper and here 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.170
