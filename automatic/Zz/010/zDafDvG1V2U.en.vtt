00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.660
 video with iphoneitalia.com seems 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.160
 yesterday is in fact maybe it was yesterday 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.620
 publication compared to when I am 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.130
 recording video related to 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.650
 jailbreak of ios 8.1 points 38.2 and 8.3 in 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.029
 this video after ios release 8.4 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.560
 and apple music 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.500
 let's see how to execute the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.840
 it 8.4 untethered jailbreak up 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.460
 iphone ipad and ipod touch the day 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.289
 this system version thanks to 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.289
 time jailbreak tool 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.649
 hello guys and well found in this 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.269
 new video from iphoneitalia.com 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.039
 I'm under the brain like I was telling you 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.730
 today I will explain how to perform the 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:54.280
 ios 8.4 jailbreak on iphone you can 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.250
 see here below on the right that note 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.769
 or the software version 8.4 bill 12h 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.140
 143 and therefore it means that I have 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.640
 ivers 8.4 for all purposes installed 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.770
 on this device 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.180
 the first thing to do is once again 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.920
 connect to our text guide 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.720
 seconds of the point you find 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.310
 linked in description and then 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.149
 download from this page from the section 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.509
 needed the taiji file the break 2.2 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.490
 for only windows since the moment does not exist 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.780
 still for mac but hopefully shortly that 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.190
 arrive quickly 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.569
 at this point we just have to 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.100
 connect our device to the 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.630
 computer if we haven't already 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.729
 we press on authorizes when it comes 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.080
 requested after a few seconds of the route 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.100
 the program will recognize ours 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.840
 device of our version 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.509
 software as usual we have des 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.159
 cydia tips is 3k assistance we deactivate 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.720
 the latter because we won't need it so much 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.819
 and it will be an application in Chinese language 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.379
 before pressing on start make sure 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.140
 to have deactivated if we have not done so 

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:49.539
 let 's do the code block from 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.940
 code settings and find mine 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.660
 iphone from icloud settings find the 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.429
 my iphone 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.470
 once done this we press on 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.849
 jailbreak and we are ready to start the 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.950
 procedure the procedure could 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:01.989
 stop on percentages like the 20 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.090
 blood 40 percent but leave again 

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:05.440
 immediately after so don't be afraid and 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.520
 all normal 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.349
 I had to speed up the operation 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.450
 not to bore you with a video too 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.760
 long but consider that in 5 10 minutes 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.310
 maximum you should be able to complete 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.420
 operation on your device 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.190
 you get 20 percent like you are 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.140
 seeing the iphone it will restart for the 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.360
 first time and this will be one of the revenues 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.680
 meanwhile longer but above all 20 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.629
 percent is one of the percentages that 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.370
 will stay on screen longer as I have 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.150
 said before don't worry it's all 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.500
 normal 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.390
 probably as happened to me during 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.519
 the jailbreak operation will open 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.019
 itunes several times if you want left by 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.220
 open otherwise close it is not there 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.319
 no difference 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.760
 well albeit slowly we are almost at 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.099
 the end of this the all blacks we are all 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.319
 80 percent 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.239
 now at 90 and shortly yes yes 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.090
 will restart for the last time before 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.260
 wake up with cydia inside vi 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.520
 remember that this phase totally 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.080
 automatic so you don't have to 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.940
 in order to do nothing I advise you not to 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.460
 touch your iphone during this 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.260
 operation very well we are at 99 for 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.600
 one hundred iPhone is about to restart for 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.370
 last time and after this restart 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.620
 as I told you we will have cydia installed 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.210
 we will actually see the jailbreak is 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.100
 been completed now confirms it 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.170
 the program we can also want 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.390
 therefore closing time will be necessary 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.250
 given a last reboot because you have to 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.520
 upload all essential packages 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.960
 do the first operations and then become 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.330
 however one hundred percent active as 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.280
 see here in the home or already cydia then 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.560
 now I go to open see the 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.180
 signa content at this time 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.280
 just before the last of 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.990
 start and then we will complete the 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.730
 jailbreak procedure of captain error 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.290
 you can this archive make the full state 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.750
 don't worry, your album is not full 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.460
 but it is only a temporary error 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.230
 because cydia files must must 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.310
 in short, to be installed therefore it comes 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.590
 returned this error 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.600
 finished the long reboot at least for me 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.430
 in this case I take again 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.840
 the home screen of our iphone 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.300
 this time we will find cydia 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.860
 fully functional that will have to 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.660
 clearly follow just the last one 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.700
 package refresh to allow then 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.950
 to download them to the stable to start 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.150
 in short, change your iphone 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.950
 once this is done you will find yourself 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.450
 precisely this screen with all the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.250
 packages from the list of packages and 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.260
 default repository you can add 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.760
 others you can install to remove 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.350
 packages you can start in short 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.410
 customize your iphone 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.299
 updated to ios 8.4 with jailbreak 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.650
 This time I show again 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.299
 once in short the version 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.370
 software is the one I just have 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.740
 quoted and above all you see there is apple 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.200
 music active in the music application e 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.180
 we know that 8.4 in the version of ios 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.700
 which enables this functionality first 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.730
 so there was no boys this was the 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.820
 jailbreak of ios 8.4 performed on iphone 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.840
 with tide jailbreak tool 2.2 if there is 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.460
 liked this video let a 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.320
 comment I like I am Andrea Cervone 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.010
 and in the skies we hear the next video 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.010
 Hi everyone
