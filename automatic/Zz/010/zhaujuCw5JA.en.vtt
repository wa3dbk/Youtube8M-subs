not<00:00:30.859> only<00:00:30.890> provides<00:00:31.279> full<00:00:31.730> protection<00:00:32.119> so

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
not only provides full protection so

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.160 
not only provides full protection so
it's<00:00:33.190> rock<00:00:34.190> solid<00:00:34.460> but<00:00:35.120> also<00:00:35.300> charges<00:00:35.960> your

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
so I'm definitely don't need to worry

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.080 
so I'm definitely don't need to worry
about<00:01:15.530> you<00:01:16.039> know<00:01:16.100> running<00:01:16.429> out<00:01:16.609> your<00:01:16.820> battery

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090

about you know running out your battery
don't<00:01:17.299> have<00:01:17.390> to<00:01:17.479> worry<00:01:17.630> about<00:01:17.749> that<00:01:17.840> anymore

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
don't have to worry about that anymore

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.810 
don't have to worry about that anymore
of<00:01:18.499> this<00:01:18.679> type<00:01:18.890> of<00:01:18.920> case<00:01:19.899> and<00:01:21.249> I<00:01:22.249> mean<00:01:22.609> it's

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
of this type of case and I mean it's

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.739 
of this type of case and I mean it's
pretty<00:01:22.969> good<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:23.719> I<00:01:23.749> got<00:01:23.960> about<00:01:24.340> two<00:01:25.479> two<00:01:26.479> bars

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:26.749 
pretty good so I got about two two bars

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:29.499 
pretty good so I got about two two bars
left<00:01:26.929> that<00:01:27.920> probably<00:01:28.280> could<00:01:28.520> last<00:01:29.060> me<00:01:29.240> another

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
left that probably could last me another

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.809 
left that probably could last me another
day<00:01:29.719> actually<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:30.920> I<00:01:31.100> got<00:01:31.280> about<00:01:31.399> two<00:01:31.579> bars

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
day actually so I got about two bars

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.340 
day actually so I got about two bars
left<00:01:31.969> but<00:01:32.299> I'm<00:01:32.359> go<00:01:32.509> ahead<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:32.749> plug<00:01:32.990> it<00:01:33.140> up<00:01:33.200> to

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
left but I'm go ahead and plug it up to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.590 
left but I'm go ahead and plug it up to
the<00:01:33.409> wall<00:01:33.590> in<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.799> way<00:01:34.060> but<00:01:35.060> this<00:01:35.210> thing<00:01:35.390> could

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
the wall in a way but this thing could

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.149 
the wall in a way but this thing could
probably<00:01:35.840> ask<00:01:36.109> me<00:01:36.289> another<00:01:36.439> day<00:01:36.679> so<00:01:36.740> that's<00:01:37.100> a

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
probably ask me another day so that's a

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.950 
probably ask me another day so that's a
good<00:01:37.280> thing<00:01:37.340> now<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.119> case<00:01:38.359> like<00:01:38.539> I<00:01:38.630> said<00:01:38.810> it

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
good thing now the case like I said it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.510 
good thing now the case like I said it

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
now one thing it does have some holes

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.940 
now one thing it does have some holes
here<00:01:55.249> at<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.429> bottom<00:01:55.579> for<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:55.939> speakers<00:01:56.420> and

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
here at the bottom for the speakers and

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.199 
here at the bottom for the speakers and
it<00:01:57.950> definitely<00:01:58.159> helps<00:01:58.609> the<00:01:58.729> speakers<00:01:59.030> again

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
it definitely helps the speakers again

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:00.849 
it definitely helps the speakers again
it's<00:01:59.509> not<00:01:59.630> as<00:01:59.780> loud<00:01:59.990> as<00:02:00.200> what<00:02:00.469> it<00:02:00.619> would<00:02:00.829> be

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
it's not as loud as what it would be

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:01.899 
it's not as loud as what it would be
without<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.429> case<00:02:01.579> but<00:02:01.759> that's

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
without the case but that's

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.179 
without the case but that's
understandable<00:02:02.499> but<00:02:03.499> the<00:02:03.590> speaker's<00:02:03.889> word<00:02:04.069> a

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
understandable but the speaker's word a

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.370 
understandable but the speaker's word a
lot<00:02:04.280> enough<00:02:04.609> to<00:02:04.819> if<00:02:05.179> you<00:02:05.359> needed<00:02:05.659> to<00:02:05.689> use<00:02:05.990> it<00:02:06.170> as

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
lot enough to if you needed to use it as

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.449 
lot enough to if you needed to use it as
a<00:02:06.439> speaker<00:02:06.709> phone<00:02:06.950> or<00:02:07.100> something<00:02:07.189> like<00:02:07.399> that

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459

you could other than that man it's

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.600 
you could other than that man it's
pretty<00:02:11.930> good<00:02:12.080> case<00:02:12.290> i<00:02:12.620> definitely<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.280> my<00:02:13.370> top

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610

case<00:02:13.850> and

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
case and

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.610 
case and
is<00:02:14.180> going<00:02:14.299> to<00:02:14.360> be<00:02:14.450> my<00:02:14.599> top<00:02:14.810> case<00:02:15.049> probably<00:02:15.319> for

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
is going to be my top case probably for

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.680 
is going to be my top case probably for
a<00:02:15.680> while<00:02:15.860> here<00:02:16.159> not<00:02:16.790> only<00:02:16.909> does<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.150> has<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.390> good

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
a while here not only does it has a good

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.180 
a while here not only does it has a good
protection<00:02:18.019> but<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.500> provides<00:02:18.799> a<00:02:18.920> battery

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
protection but it provides a battery

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.920 
protection but it provides a battery
life<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:19.549> definitely<00:02:19.730> lives<00:02:20.090> up<00:02:20.239> to<00:02:20.299> Dublin

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
life so it definitely lives up to Dublin

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.720

in<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.110> battery<00:02:21.440> life<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:22.400> recommend

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
in the battery life and I recommend

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.520 
in the battery life and I recommend
anybody<00:02:23.030> out<00:02:23.269> there<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.599> can<00:02:23.840> afford<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.409> it
