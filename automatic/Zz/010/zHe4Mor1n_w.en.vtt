compact<00:01:23.750> for<00:01:24.230> a<00:01:24.260> 16<00:01:25.220> 18<00:01:26.210> 21<00:01:26.750> lens<00:01:27.230> all<00:01:27.560> in<00:01:27.770> one

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
compact for a 16 18 21 lens all in one

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.450 
compact for a 16 18 21 lens all in one
it's<00:01:29.090> at<00:01:29.360> f/4<00:01:30.110> so<00:01:30.380> it's<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:30.530> little<00:01:30.650> slow<00:01:31.100> it's

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
it's at f/4 so it's a little slow it's

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.160 
it's at f/4 so it's a little slow it's
not<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.700> 2.8<00:01:32.510> or<00:01:32.960> 1.4<00:01:33.860> it<00:01:34.040> starts<00:01:34.340> at<00:01:34.460> f/4<00:01:35.170> you

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
not a 2.8 or 1.4 it starts at f/4 you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.530 
not a 2.8 or 1.4 it starts at f/4 you
can<00:01:36.290> stop<00:01:36.530> down<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.890> f-22<00:01:37.670> but<00:01:38.090> most<00:01:38.270> of<00:01:38.390> my

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
can stop down the f-22 but most of my

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.720 
can stop down the f-22 but most of my
shooting<00:01:38.960> has<00:01:39.170> been<00:01:39.200> at<00:01:39.560> f/4<00:01:39.980> through<00:01:40.280> f/8

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
shooting has been at f/4 through f/8

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.440 
shooting has been at f/4 through f/8
because<00:01:41.630> I<00:01:41.720> find<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.230> performance<00:01:43.210> has<00:01:44.210> just

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
because I find the performance has just

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.380 
because I find the performance has just
been<00:01:44.630> terrific<00:01:44.810> even<00:01:45.320> wide<00:01:45.590> open<00:01:45.909> it<00:01:46.909> seems<00:01:47.240> to

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
been terrific even wide open it seems to

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.020 
been terrific even wide open it seems to
sharpen<00:01:47.810> up<00:01:47.930> a<00:01:48.020> bit<00:01:48.200> by<00:01:48.380> f56<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.580> them<00:01:49.670> f/8

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
sharpen up a bit by f56 and them f/8

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.649 
sharpen up a bit by f56 and them f/8
especially<00:01:50.659> but<00:01:51.290> it's<00:01:51.409> a<00:01:51.470> great<00:01:51.800> lens<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:53.450> one

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
especially but it's a great lens the one

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.080 
especially but it's a great lens the one
cool<00:01:53.960> thing<00:01:54.490> well<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:55.550> don't<00:01:55.730> know<00:01:55.820> some<00:01:56.060> people

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
cool thing well I don't know some people

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.640 
cool thing well I don't know some people
don't<00:01:56.480> consider<00:01:56.780> it<00:01:57.140> cool<00:01:57.730> but<00:01:59.380> your<00:02:00.380> frame

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
don't consider it cool but your frame

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.980 
don't consider it cool but your frame
lines<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:01.100> an<00:02:01.190> EM<00:02:01.340> camera<00:02:01.790> don't<00:02:02.000> go<00:02:02.150> to<00:02:02.210> 16<00:02:02.810> or

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
lines in an EM camera don't go to 16 or

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.980 
lines in an EM camera don't go to 16 or
18<00:02:03.380> or<00:02:03.680> 21<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:04.909> what<00:02:05.150> you<00:02:05.270> need<00:02:05.510> is<00:02:05.720> like<00:02:05.930> a

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
created a universal viewfinder that

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.719 
created a universal viewfinder that
attaches<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.440> top<00:02:09.470> of<00:02:09.860> your<00:02:09.979> camera<00:02:10.280> and

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
attaches to the top of your camera and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.390 
attaches to the top of your camera and
people<00:02:11.599> refer<00:02:12.049> to<00:02:12.230> this<00:02:12.379> as<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.650> Franken

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
people refer to this as the Franken

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.220 
people refer to this as the Franken
finder<00:02:13.879> because<00:02:14.030> it's<00:02:14.499> huge

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
finder because it's huge

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.070 
finder because it's huge
let's<00:02:16.590> set<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:16.800> next<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.370> Len<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.959> mean<00:02:18.959> it's

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
let's set it next to the Len I mean it's

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.160 
let's set it next to the Len I mean it's
almost<00:02:19.200> as<00:02:19.380> big<00:02:19.530> as<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.860> lens<00:02:20.660> but<00:02:21.660> what's

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
almost as big as the lens but what's

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.920 
almost as big as the lens but what's
very<00:02:22.380> cool<00:02:22.680> about<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.099> is<00:02:23.660> say<00:02:24.660> you're

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
shooting at 16 you just set the lens to

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.710 
shooting at 16 you just set the lens to
16<00:02:29.700> if<00:02:30.599> you<00:02:30.720> want<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.959> set<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.260> 18<00:02:31.770> 18<00:02:32.610> 21<00:02:33.300> and

16 if you want to set it to 18 18 21 and

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.390

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
then you get the correct lines through

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.520 
then you get the correct lines through
the<00:02:38.489> viewfinder<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:39.530> can't<00:02:40.530> see<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.890> here<00:02:41.160> but

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
the viewfinder I can't see it here but

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.949 
the viewfinder I can't see it here but
it<00:02:43.530> works<00:02:43.830> very<00:02:44.010> well<00:02:44.340> works<00:02:45.239> very<00:02:45.599> well<00:02:45.720> and

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
it works very well works very well and

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.660 
it works very well works very well and
you<00:02:46.080> can<00:02:46.200> even<00:02:46.319> set<00:02:46.560> your<00:02:46.650> distance<00:02:47.190> how<00:02:47.610> far

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670

you are from your subject with that

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.500 
you are from your subject with that
little<00:02:49.800> dial<00:02:50.010> now<00:02:50.819> I<00:02:50.880> got<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.150> tell<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.420> the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
little dial now I got to tell you the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.720 
little dial now I got to tell you the
viewfinder<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:52.170> actually<00:02:52.620> pretty<00:02:53.069> nice

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
viewfinder is actually pretty nice

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.270 
viewfinder is actually pretty nice
it<00:02:53.819> does<00:02:54.030> have<00:02:54.209> some<00:02:54.269> barrel<00:02:54.750> distortion<00:02:55.280> when

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
it does have some barrel distortion when

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.130 
it does have some barrel distortion when
you<00:02:56.400> have<00:02:56.549> it<00:02:56.670> at<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.910> 16<00:02:57.360> millimeter<00:02:57.600> but

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
you have it at the 16 millimeter but

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.740 
you have it at the 16 millimeter but
other<00:02:58.470> than<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.220> find<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.910> must<00:03:00.360> have

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
other than that I find it a must have

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.690 
other than that I find it a must have
with<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:01.290> lens<00:03:01.620> because<00:03:02.250> there's<00:03:02.400> no<00:03:02.549> way

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
with this lens because there's no way

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.809 
with this lens because there's no way
you<00:03:02.760> could<00:03:02.970> frame<00:03:03.209> accurately<00:03:03.930> without<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.819> so

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
you could frame accurately without it so

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.449 
you could frame accurately without it so
I<00:03:05.850> highly<00:03:06.750> recommend<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:07.410> beast<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:08.340> a

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459
