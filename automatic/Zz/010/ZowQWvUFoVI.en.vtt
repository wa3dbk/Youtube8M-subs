 the rich uses Apple's voice not 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.469
 it matters that samba is good to say 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.489
 same tape is better than the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:59.010

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.799
 nintendo remember that comes with a console 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.640
 comes with the deluxe version of the console 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:31.710
 here we have the source of the game that is 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.790
 big sucker and the source is nothing 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 Special 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.840
 the voter is similar to the connector 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.549
 im not sure if it's the same but 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.939
 definitely does not look like 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.590
 here we have another part from our source 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.130
 we have one more part of the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.720
 source 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.780
 a two part source manual hint 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.149
 of game instructions with a business 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.469

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:05.670
 here we have a hdmi cable from 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.149
 nintendo is an hdmi cable with the name of the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.000
 nintendo written beauty is an hdmi cable 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.970
 normal even here a stand 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.570
 neighbors to some 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.360
 the pieces of the game do not know exactly which 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.260
 still here we have another other support 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.650
 Wow 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.830
 and here we have the sensor bar 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.500
 just like normal oe 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.090
 I can not see the connector to it 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.950
 it's just the way it looks 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.380
 You can see here is just like the 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.780
 normal oe connector 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.390
 besides we have here another one 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.510
 support plus support I do not know 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.110
 Why are we going to find out after beauty? 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.890
 we finish the first box is the box more 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.250
 but bland 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:56.700
 let us now for here matter to box 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:59.940
 tray with the console with the console with 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.940
 everything else 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.080
 here we will see that the one with whom you ask me 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:13.959
 first how are you going to see chirac that 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:16.209
 Nice face. Look, look. Ready. Look at. 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.350
 Face is expensive, it's too big, it 's too much. 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.130
 great deal 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.590
 he is extremely comfortable is a 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.290
 little heavy but it 's not not so heavy 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.230
 so it seems to be more or less 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.910
 that I would say the same weight a little more 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.550
 heavy with the xbox engine but not 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.370
 A lot of time is amazing here. 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.190
 behind it has two has four buttons one 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.799

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.600
 kitten right left url a button 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.730

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.560
 has a business that also 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.880
 besides that in the front you have both 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.610
 directional that the two analog 171 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.970

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.530
 recently launched the nintendo tv is 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.239

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.610
 tv by the hair the wii game pad 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:13.030
 which is cool and I do not know how much 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:16.150
 going to be going to be popular but it was 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.250
 released is one of the possibilities of the game 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.840
 pad and what prevents cool as well 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.479
 have one of the things you can do with 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.630
 he is putting a GPS and going out on the street with 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.430
 He does not know who's going out on the street with 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.560
 a business one hindrance that size 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.920
 with gps but always an option 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.250

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:52.210
 little longer than the Roxanne and he 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.300

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.610
