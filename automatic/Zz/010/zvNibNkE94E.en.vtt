their patient presents a formula is

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.400 
their patient presents a formula is
constructed<00:00:44.330> basically<00:00:44.840> with<00:00:45.019> what's<00:00:45.290> called

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
constructed basically with what's called

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.549 
constructed basically with what's called
a<00:00:45.559> module<00:00:46.040> these<00:00:47.000> for<00:00:47.390> herbs<00:00:47.690> consider<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.470> be

a basic module of herbs and they're used

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.520 
a basic module of herbs and they're used
in<00:00:51.650> hundreds<00:00:52.220> of<00:00:52.370> formulas<00:00:52.879> these<00:00:53.239> four<00:00:53.540> so

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
in hundreds of formulas these four so

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.600 
in hundreds of formulas these four so
these<00:00:54.650> are<00:00:54.710> sort<00:00:55.070> of<00:00:55.129> like<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.400> building

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
these are sort of like the building

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.130 
these are sort of like the building
blocks<00:00:55.970> this<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:56.360> it<00:00:56.480> like<00:00:56.600> a<00:00:56.629> building<00:00:57.019> block

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
blocks this is it like a building block

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.959 
blocks this is it like a building block
and<00:00:57.559> that<00:00:57.590> they're<00:00:57.980> called<00:00:58.219> for<00:00:58.489> gentlemen

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
and that they're called for gentlemen

because<00:00:59.390> there<00:00:59.540> are<00:00:59.660> four<00:00:59.899> really<00:01:00.350> elegant

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
because there are four really elegant

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.130 
because there are four really elegant
herbs<00:01:01.010> they<00:01:01.790> work<00:01:02.059> in<00:01:02.270> synergy<00:01:02.540> with<00:01:02.930> each

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
herbs they work in synergy with each

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.520 
herbs they work in synergy with each
other<00:01:03.379> to<00:01:04.309> create<00:01:05.180> a<00:01:05.420> situation<00:01:05.750> where<00:01:06.350> you

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
other to create a situation where you

and as you add and subtract different
kinds<00:01:16.369> of<00:01:16.460> herbs<00:01:16.759> you<00:01:17.330> will<00:01:17.479> build<00:01:17.690> different

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
kinds of herbs you will build different

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.260 
kinds of herbs you will build different
names<00:01:18.560> for<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.890> formula<00:01:19.369> these<00:01:19.550> are<00:01:19.729> actual

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
names for the formula these are actual

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.300 
names for the formula these are actual
plants<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.110> they<00:01:21.320> have<00:01:21.470> been<00:01:21.590> dried<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.100> cut

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
plants and they have been dried and cut

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.850 
plants and they have been dried and cut
up<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:23.300> would<00:01:23.539> take<00:01:23.720> portions<00:01:24.440> of<00:01:24.560> each

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
up so you would take portions of each

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.410 
up so you would take portions of each
one<00:01:25.160> of<00:01:25.190> these<00:01:25.369> herbs<00:01:25.640> will<00:01:26.000> put<00:01:26.149> them<00:01:26.270> in<00:01:26.360> a

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
one of these herbs will put them in a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.570 
one of these herbs will put them in a
bag<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.200> send<00:01:27.440> it<00:01:27.530> home<00:01:27.680> with<00:01:27.979> you<00:01:28.100> and

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
bag and you send it home with you and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.580 
bag and you send it home with you and
you've<00:01:29.179> done<00:01:29.209> this<00:01:29.479> before<00:01:29.539> you<00:01:30.140> even<00:01:30.289> in<00:01:30.530> a

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
you've done this before you even in a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.160 
you've done this before you even in a
clay<00:01:30.800> pot<00:01:30.830> yeah<00:01:31.429> pour<00:01:32.119> water<00:01:32.360> into<00:01:32.660> it<00:01:32.959> yeah

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
clay pot yeah pour water into it yeah

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.199 
clay pot yeah pour water into it yeah
usually<00:01:33.410> to<00:01:33.770> cover<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.190> herbs<00:01:34.399> and<00:01:34.640> then<00:01:35.119> you

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
usually to cover the herbs and then you

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:37.270 
usually to cover the herbs and then you
boil<00:01:35.479> it<00:01:35.599> for<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.810> period<00:01:36.020> of<00:01:36.140> time<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:37.069> whole

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
boil it for a period of time the whole

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.940 
boil it for a period of time the whole
room<00:01:37.880> it's<00:01:38.209> a<00:01:38.330> process<00:01:38.660> it's<00:01:39.200> a<00:01:39.319> really<00:01:39.619> long

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
room it's a process it's a really long

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.219 
room it's a process it's a really long
process<00:01:40.610> but<00:01:40.910> there's<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.330> new<00:01:41.599> way<00:01:41.810> there's

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
process but there's a new way there's

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.320 
process but there's a new way there's
sort<00:01:42.470> of<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.830> modern<00:01:43.369> version<00:01:43.399> of<00:01:43.940> doing<00:01:44.209> this

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
sort of the modern version of doing this

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.330 
sort of the modern version of doing this
tell<00:01:44.660> me<00:01:44.750> tell<00:01:45.229> me<00:01:45.259> about<00:01:45.380> I<00:01:45.740> guess<00:01:46.009> it<00:01:46.190> would

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
tell me tell me about I guess it would

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.850 
tell me tell me about I guess it would
be<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.610> powder<00:01:47.000> or<00:01:47.360> tablets<00:01:48.110> or<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.289> teacher<00:01:48.470> a

good intentions to do it I'm one of them

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.430 
good intentions to do it I'm one of them
I've<00:01:56.209> tried<00:01:56.420> doing<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:56.989> it<00:01:57.050> just<00:01:57.229> takes

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
I've tried doing and it just takes

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.820 
I've tried doing and it just takes
really<00:01:57.709> a<00:01:57.739> long<00:01:57.979> time<00:01:58.220> so<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:58.970> I<00:01:59.780> prefer<00:02:00.560> using

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
really a long time so I I prefer using

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.680 
really a long time so I I prefer using
the<00:02:01.069> powders<00:02:01.489> and<00:02:01.520> really<00:02:01.970> what<00:02:02.119> a<00:02:02.149> powder<00:02:02.390> is

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
the powders and really what a powder is

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.979 
the powders and really what a powder is
is<00:02:02.899> you've<00:02:03.050> taken<00:02:03.289> all<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.619> these<00:02:03.920> herbs<00:02:04.310> and

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:04.989 
is you've taken all of these herbs and

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:08.350 
is you've taken all of these herbs and
grind<00:02:05.989> them<00:02:06.140> up<00:02:06.380> pulverize<00:02:07.250> them<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.729> they're

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
grind them up pulverize them and they're

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.600 
grind them up pulverize them and they're
it's<00:02:08.599> weighed<00:02:08.869> out<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.530> there's<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.369> certain

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
it's weighed out and there's a certain

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.000 
it's weighed out and there's a certain
amount<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.209> would<00:02:11.360> use<00:02:11.599> in<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:12.010> special

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
amount that you would use in a special

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.470 
amount that you would use in a special
spoon<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.610> put<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:13.940> spoon<00:02:14.120> into<00:02:14.330> the

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
spoon you put the spoon into the

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.600 
spoon you put the spoon into the
spoonful<00:02:15.200> into<00:02:15.470> hot<00:02:15.620> water<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.459> would

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
spoonful into hot water and you would

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.250 
spoonful into hot water and you would
drink<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.910> powder<00:02:17.120> now<00:02:17.480> some<00:02:17.750> people<00:02:17.900> don't

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
drink the powder now some people don't

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.520 
drink the powder now some people don't
want<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.590> use<00:02:18.680> powders<00:02:19.130> so<00:02:19.400> we<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:19.880> give

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
want to use powders so we just give

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.780 
want to use powders so we just give
tablets<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.830> they're<00:02:22.010> pretty<00:02:22.340> easy<00:02:22.400> to

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
tablets and they're pretty easy to

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.589 
tablets and they're pretty easy to
digest<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:24.110> do<00:02:24.319> want<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.620> eat<00:02:24.800> them<00:02:25.360> take<00:02:26.360> them

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
digest you do want to eat them take them

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.530 
digest you do want to eat them take them
with<00:02:27.099> room<00:02:28.099> temperature<00:02:28.310> water<00:02:28.610> doesn't<00:02:29.390> have

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
with room temperature water doesn't have

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.420 
with room temperature water doesn't have
to<00:02:29.660> be<00:02:29.870> hot<00:02:30.020> water<00:02:30.260> we<00:02:30.620> don't<00:02:30.709> really<00:02:30.860> use<00:02:31.129> cold

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
to be hot water we don't really use cold

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.370 
to be hot water we don't really use cold
water<00:02:31.520> in<00:02:31.819> China

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
water in China

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.760 
water in China
it<00:02:33.010> creates<00:02:33.550> more<00:02:33.820> of<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:34.000> constriction

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
it creates more of a constriction

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.320 
it creates more of a constriction
especially<00:02:35.770> in<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.190> in<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.430> digestion<00:02:36.850> the

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
especially in the in the digestion the

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.910 
especially in the in the digestion the
cold<00:02:37.540> tighten<00:02:37.990> this<00:02:38.080> whole<00:02:38.350> thing's<00:02:38.680> us

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
cold tighten this whole thing's us

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.630 
cold tighten this whole thing's us
exactly<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.210> actually<00:02:40.420> would<00:02:40.690> cool<00:02:40.960> down

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
exactly so you actually would cool down

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.550 
exactly so you actually would cool down
faster<00:02:42.640> by<00:02:42.760> drinking<00:02:43.150> room<00:02:44.050> temperature

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
faster by drinking room temperature

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.070 
faster by drinking room temperature
water<00:02:44.590> then<00:02:45.310> because<00:02:46.120> your<00:02:46.240> body<00:02:46.420> has<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.840> heat

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
water then because your body has to heat

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.650 
water then because your body has to heat
up<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.530> cold<00:02:47.800> water<00:02:48.070> in<00:02:48.250> order<00:02:48.520> to<00:02:48.790> process<00:02:49.270> it

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
up the cold water in order to process it

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.770 
up the cold water in order to process it
so<00:02:49.930> you're<00:02:50.140> actually<00:02:50.350> creating<00:02:50.830> more<00:02:51.190> heat<00:02:51.910> be

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
so you're actually creating more heat be

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.330 
so you're actually creating more heat be
on<00:02:52.870> your<00:02:52.990> body<00:02:53.200> by<00:02:53.470> drinking<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:53.860> cold<00:02:54.100> water

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
on your body by drinking the cold water

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.600 
on your body by drinking the cold water
actually<00:02:55.030> yeah<00:02:55.210> that's<00:02:55.480> right<00:02:55.660> ah<00:02:56.040> she<00:02:57.040> liked

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
actually yeah that's right ah she liked

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.380 
actually yeah that's right ah she liked

upper<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.930> guys<00:03:05.140> heard<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.650> here<00:03:05.980> no<00:03:06.400> more<00:03:06.850> ice

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
upper you guys heard it here no more ice

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.320 
upper you guys heard it here no more ice
water<00:03:08.310> room<00:03:09.310> temperature<00:03:09.340> water<00:03:09.880> if<00:03:10.240> you

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
water room temperature water if you

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.240 
water room temperature water if you
can't<00:03:10.360> what<00:03:11.020> is<00:03:11.140> tincture<00:03:11.710> meeting<00:03:12.070> sure

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
can't what is tincture meeting sure

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.730 
can't what is tincture meeting sure
means<00:03:12.460> that<00:03:12.640> it's<00:03:12.790> been<00:03:12.970> prepared<00:03:13.480> and

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
means that it's been prepared and

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.880 
means that it's been prepared and
distilled<00:03:14.740> in<00:03:15.010> alcohol<00:03:15.960> okay<00:03:16.960> and<00:03:17.470> so<00:03:17.740> it's

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
distilled in alcohol okay and so it's

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.520 
distilled in alcohol okay and so it's
very<00:03:18.160> it's<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.820> much<00:03:19.000> more<00:03:19.240> concentrated<00:03:19.900> form

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
very it's a much more concentrated form

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.100 
very it's a much more concentrated form
so<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.070> don't<00:03:21.250> use<00:03:21.490> a<00:03:21.520> few<00:03:21.820> drops<00:03:22.150> tell<00:03:22.960> us<00:03:23.080> a

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
so you don't use a few drops tell us a

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.440 
so you don't use a few drops tell us a
little<00:03:23.140> bit<00:03:23.410> about<00:03:23.590> Chi<00:03:23.920> well<00:03:24.910> Chi<00:03:25.150> is<00:03:25.300> the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
little bit about Chi well Chi is the

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.090 
little bit about Chi well Chi is the
energy<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:25.900> flows<00:03:26.140> through<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.590> body<00:03:26.620> and

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
energy that flows through the body and

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.800 
energy that flows through the body and
the<00:03:27.190> way<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.430> like<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:27.940> describe<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.510> there

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
the way I like to describe it there

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.840 
the way I like to describe it there
they're<00:03:29.110> like<00:03:29.290> pathways<00:03:29.860> or<00:03:29.890> rivers<00:03:30.520> or

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
they're like pathways or rivers or

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.460 
they're like pathways or rivers or

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
to be checking three different levels

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.990 
to be checking three different levels
and<00:05:02.350> I<00:05:02.770> want<00:05:03.009> to<00:05:03.100> go<00:05:03.190> very<00:05:03.430> lightly<00:05:03.729> at<00:05:03.970> first

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
and I'm going to press a little bit more

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.210 
and I'm going to press a little bit more
deeply<00:05:06.820> to<00:05:06.850> check<00:05:07.660> the<00:05:07.810> second<00:05:08.229> level<00:05:08.380> there

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
deeply to check the second level there

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.420 
deeply to check the second level there
are<00:05:09.370> three<00:05:09.610> pulses<00:05:09.850> on<00:05:10.150> each<00:05:10.300> wrist<00:05:11.310> so<00:05:12.310> you're

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
are three pulses on each wrist so you're

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.219 
are three pulses on each wrist so you're
actually<00:05:12.639> fit<00:05:13.030> when<00:05:13.180> you<00:05:13.300> say<00:05:13.479> pulse<00:05:13.780> you<00:05:14.020> mean

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
actually fit when you say pulse you mean

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.770 
actually fit when you say pulse you mean
a<00:05:14.500> pulse<00:05:14.830> on<00:05:15.039> the<00:05:15.070> blood<00:05:15.370> moving<00:05:15.880> through<00:05:16.330> also

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
a pulse on the blood moving through also

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.260 
a pulse on the blood moving through also
the<00:05:16.900> bloke<00:05:17.139> but<00:05:17.620> it's<00:05:17.770> moving<00:05:17.979> through<00:05:18.490> in

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
the bloke but it's moving through in

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.640 
the bloke but it's moving through in
this<00:05:19.570> area<00:05:20.020> I'm<00:05:20.979> checking<00:05:21.400> three<00:05:21.789> different

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
this area I'm checking three different

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.400 
this area I'm checking three different
organs<00:05:23.650> so<00:05:24.430> this<00:05:24.759> would<00:05:24.940> be<00:05:24.970> heart<00:05:25.330> liver<00:05:26.139> and

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
organs so this would be heart liver and

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.219 
organs so this would be heart liver and
convenient<00:05:27.160> I'm<00:05:27.699> interesting<00:05:28.690> I'm<00:05:28.990> also

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
convenient I'm interesting I'm also

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.650 
convenient I'm interesting I'm also
checking<00:05:29.410> for<00:05:29.919> the<00:05:29.979> level<00:05:30.460> and<00:05:30.669> the<00:05:31.120> quality

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
checking for the level and the quality

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.570 
checking for the level and the quality
so<00:05:32.320> it's<00:05:32.500> kind<00:05:32.740> of<00:05:32.770> like<00:05:32.919> I'm<00:05:33.099> checking<00:05:33.370> to

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
so it's kind of like I'm checking to
