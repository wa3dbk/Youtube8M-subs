the<00:00:00.510> blue<00:00:00.810> scale<00:00:01.199> today<00:00:01.500> you<00:00:02.429> know<00:00:02.520> what<00:00:02.669> a

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
the blue scale today you know what a

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.690 
the blue scale today you know what a
regular<00:00:03.060> major<00:00:03.270> scale<00:00:03.720> is<00:00:03.750> we<00:00:04.200> all<00:00:04.319> grow<00:00:04.740> if<00:00:05.490> we

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
regular major scale is we all grow if we

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.130 
regular major scale is we all grow if we
took<00:00:05.879> piano<00:00:06.150> lessons<00:00:06.299> we<00:00:06.720> all<00:00:06.839> grew<00:00:07.109> up

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
took piano lessons we all grew up

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.339 
took piano lessons we all grew up
playing<00:00:07.379> them<00:00:08.240> and<00:00:09.240> most<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.750> us<00:00:09.870> eat<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.230> them

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 
playing them and most of us eat of them

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.870 
playing them and most of us eat of them
but<00:00:13.349> there's<00:00:13.590> 12<00:00:13.920> major<00:00:14.130> scales<00:00:14.549> because

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
but there's 12 major scales because

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.279 
but there's 12 major scales because
there's<00:00:15.059> 12<00:00:15.299> different<00:00:15.540> places<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:16.139> can

the latter it's a ladder of notes that

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.210 
the latter it's a ladder of notes that
runs<00:00:23.220> from<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.460> root<00:00:24.170> up<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.470> octave<00:00:25.920> note

runs from the root up to the octave note

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.580 
runs from the root up to the octave note
and<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:27.060> does<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.570> series<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.930> half<00:00:28.260> steps

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
and it does it in a series of half steps

blue<00:00:39.300> scale<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.260> plus<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.719> flat<00:00:42.719> third

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
blue scale is that plus the flat third

the flat fifth and the flat 7 sometimes

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.299 
the flat fifth and the flat 7 sometimes
if<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.489> see<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.820> blue<00:00:47.940> scale<00:00:48.270> printed<00:00:48.809> out<00:00:49.309> it

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
if you see the blue scale printed out it

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.220 
if you see the blue scale printed out it
won't<00:00:50.760> include<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.420> regular<00:00:51.780> third<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
won't include the regular third of the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.680 
won't include the regular third of the
river<00:00:52.530> faith<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> regular<00:00:53.399> seventh<00:00:53.850> but

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
river faith of the regular seventh but

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.720 
river faith of the regular seventh but
that's<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.020> mistake<00:00:55.199> because<00:00:55.559> jazz<00:00:56.160> musicians

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
that's a mistake because jazz musicians

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.139 
that's a mistake because jazz musicians
improvisation<00:00:57.350> people<00:00:58.370> improvise<00:00:59.370> they<00:01:00.000> use

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
improvisation people improvise they use

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.090 
improvisation people improvise they use
those<00:01:00.359> all<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.690> time<00:01:00.719> because<00:01:01.590> what<00:01:01.949> we're

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
those all the time because what we're

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.570 
those all the time because what we're
really<00:01:02.309> reaching<00:01:02.760> for<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.359> crack<00:01:03.629> between

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
really reaching for is the crack between

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.340 
really reaching for is the crack between
the<00:01:05.580> third<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> flatter<00:01:06.390> because<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the third and the flatter because in the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.500 
the third and the flatter because in the
blues<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.830> know<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.520> sad<00:01:08.850> feeling

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
blues you know you have that sad feeling

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.910 
blues you know you have that sad feeling
that<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.780> only<00:01:09.900> reach<00:01:10.260> by<00:01:11.180> trying<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.320> buy<00:01:13.320> by

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
that you only reach by trying to buy by

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.440 
that you only reach by trying to buy by
reaching<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.549> crack<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.180> can<00:01:15.330> do

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
reaching for that crack and you can do

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.670 
reaching for that crack and you can do
it<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.630> your<00:01:15.750> voice<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.590> on

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
it in your voice if you do it on

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.740 
it in your voice if you do it on
trombone<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.850> piano<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.570> play

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
trombone but on a piano you have to play

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.130 
trombone but on a piano you have to play
that<00:01:18.990> or<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.619> or<00:01:19.729> both<00:01:20.729> at<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> same<00:01:21.299> time<00:01:21.540> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
that or that or both at the same time to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.050 
that or that or both at the same time to
combine<00:01:22.560> them<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.549> blank<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
combine them like that like I blank the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.300 
combine them like that like I blank the
flat<00:01:24.659> third<00:01:24.960> there<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.470> major<00:01:25.710> third<00:01:26.100> there

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
flat third there the major third there

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.140 
flat third there the major third there
then

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
then

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
then
gives<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.170> blue<00:01:28.440> sea<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.540> in<00:01:30.540> any<00:01:30.690> case<00:01:30.810> let

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
gives that blue sea so in any case let

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.600 
gives that blue sea so in any case let
me<00:01:31.260> play<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.560> blues<00:01:31.710> scale<00:01:31.860> now<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.490> would

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
me play the blues scale now that would

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.420 
me play the blues scale now that would

let's do that in the scale of fu the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.020 
let's do that in the scale of fu the
scale<00:01:49.980> of<00:01:50.010> bed<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:53.030> and

scale of bed is like that and it is and

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.050 
scale of bed is like that and it is and
I<00:01:54.330> would<00:01:54.510> also<00:01:54.540> add<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.290> flat<00:01:56.040> 3rd<00:01:56.400> which<00:01:56.760> is<00:01:56.910> a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
I would also add the flat 3rd which is a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.590 
I would also add the flat 3rd which is a
flat<00:01:57.590> flat<00:01:58.590> fat<00:01:59.070> which<00:01:59.400> is<00:01:59.430> C<00:01:59.820> flat<00:02:00.060> looks<00:02:00.450> like

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
flat flat fat which is C flat looks like
