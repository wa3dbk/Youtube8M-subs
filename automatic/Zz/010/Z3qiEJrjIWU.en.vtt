there<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.800> just<00:00:41.610> briefly<00:00:41.940> want<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.300> explain

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
there I just briefly want to explain

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.990 
there I just briefly want to explain
some<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.170> technology<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> benefits

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
some of the technology and the benefits

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.720 
some of the technology and the benefits
that<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.570> Phoenix<00:00:45.899> lights<00:00:45.989> offer<00:00:46.550> now<00:00:47.550> one<00:00:47.699> of

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
that the Phoenix lights offer now one of

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.069 
that the Phoenix lights offer now one of
the<00:00:47.879> first<00:00:48.120> things<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.449> they've<00:00:48.629> done<00:00:48.660> is

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
the first things that they've done is

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.720 
the first things that they've done is
they<00:00:49.230> use<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> top-quality<00:00:50.249> Cree<00:00:51.120> X<00:00:51.420> lamp<00:00:51.929> or

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
they use a top-quality Cree X lamp or

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.299 
they use a top-quality Cree X lamp or
xm-l<00:00:53.730> LEDs<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.749> these<00:00:55.350> give<00:00:55.589> the<00:00:55.739> flashlights

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
xm-l LEDs and these give the flashlights

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.450 
xm-l LEDs and these give the flashlights
the<00:00:56.550> highest<00:00:56.999> efficiency<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.050> very<00:00:58.649> high<00:00:58.890> LED

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the highest efficiency and very high LED

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.189 
the highest efficiency and very high LED
lifespan<00:00:59.999> so<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.359> basically<00:01:00.510> means<00:01:01.050> you're

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
lifespan so that basically means you're

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.020 
lifespan so that basically means you're
going<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.409> a<00:01:01.589> bright<00:01:01.949> light<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.519> yet<00:01:02.850> it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
going to have a bright light and yet it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.030 
going to have a bright light and yet it
will<00:01:03.149> last<00:01:03.359> longer<00:01:03.780> than<00:01:03.929> other<00:01:04.290> conventional

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
will last longer than other conventional

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.149 
will last longer than other conventional
LED<00:01:05.580> lights<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.150> not<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.080> mention<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.740> LED

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
LED lights and not to mention the LED

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.370 
LED lights and not to mention the LED
itself<00:01:08.580> will<00:01:08.940> last<00:01:09.150> longer<00:01:09.540> than<00:01:09.720> many<00:01:10.020> others

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
itself will last longer than many others

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.310 
itself will last longer than many others
they<00:01:11.250> also<00:01:11.460> use<00:01:11.880> heat<00:01:12.300> sinks<00:01:12.690> to<00:01:12.960> make<00:01:13.110> sure

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
they also use heat sinks to make sure

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.310 
they also use heat sinks to make sure
that<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> LEDs<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.460> not<00:01:14.729> overheat<00:01:15.320> which

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that the LEDs do not overheat which

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.970 
that the LEDs do not overheat which
again<00:01:16.620> adds<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> lifespan<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.120> LED

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
again adds to the lifespan of the LED

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.500 
again adds to the lifespan of the LED
another<00:01:19.980> thing<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.370> Phoenix<00:01:20.760> strives<00:01:21.180> for

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
another thing that Phoenix strives for

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.710 
another thing that Phoenix strives for
is<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:22.170> produce<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.710> perfect<00:01:23.340> mix<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.820> throw<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
is to produce a perfect mix of throw and

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.770 
is to produce a perfect mix of throw and
spill<00:01:25.230> so<00:01:25.980> the<00:01:26.130> throw<00:01:26.370> being<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.970> center<00:01:27.450> beam

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
spill so the throw being the center beam

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.200 
spill so the throw being the center beam
or<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.650> focal<00:01:29.070> point<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.700> light<00:01:29.910> and<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
or the focal point of the light and the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.960 
or the focal point of the light and the
spill<00:01:30.870> being<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.830> light<00:01:32.040> that's<00:01:32.250> cast<00:01:32.580> off<00:01:32.820> to

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
spill being the light that's cast off to

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.130 
spill being the light that's cast off to
the<00:01:33.090> side<00:01:33.300> now<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.510> need<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> little<00:01:33.930> bit<00:01:34.110> of

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the side now you need a little bit of

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.560 
the side now you need a little bit of
both<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.980> you<00:01:35.160> can<00:01:35.280> see<00:01:35.490> around<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.000> edges<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
both so you can see around the edges and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.720 
both so you can see around the edges and
also<00:01:36.900> focus<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.560> areas<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.490> want<00:01:38.670> to

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
also focus on areas that you want to

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.190 
also focus on areas that you want to
focus<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.120> near<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.540> center<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.870> the<00:01:40.020> light

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
focus on near the center of the light

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.980 
focus on near the center of the light
Phoenix<00:01:41.190> also<00:01:41.610> implements<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.600> they<00:01:42.750> call<00:01:42.960> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
Phoenix also implements what they call a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.410 
Phoenix also implements what they call a
constant<00:01:43.770> current<00:01:44.130> regulation<00:01:44.910> circuit

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
constant current regulation circuit

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.990 
constant current regulation circuit
which<00:01:46.110> gives<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> flashlight<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.250> continuous

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
which gives the flashlight a continuous

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.850 
which gives the flashlight a continuous
brightness<00:01:48.510> over<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.170> lifespan<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
brightness over the lifespan of the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.800 
brightness over the lifespan of the
battery<00:01:50.310> now<00:01:50.940> what<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.180> may<00:01:51.210> notice<00:01:51.660> with

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
battery now what you may notice with

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.510 
battery now what you may notice with
other<00:01:51.960> flashlights<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.770> they'll<00:01:52.950> seem<00:01:53.190> really

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
other flashlights is they'll seem really

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.160 
other flashlights is they'll seem really
bright<00:01:53.790> when<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.300> first<00:01:54.540> put<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> batteries

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
bright when you first put the batteries

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.680 
bright when you first put the batteries
in<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.830> then<00:01:55.980> they'll<00:01:56.160> slowly<00:01:56.550> dim<00:01:57.090> over<00:01:57.450> time

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
in but then they'll slowly dim over time

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.900 
in but then they'll slowly dim over time
with<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> constant<00:01:59.010> current<00:01:59.340> regulation

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
with the constant current regulation

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.230 
with the constant current regulation
circuit<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.050> drastically<00:02:01.710> reduced<00:02:02.240> they

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
circuit that is drastically reduced they

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.780 
circuit that is drastically reduced they
also<00:02:03.420> use<00:02:03.720> ultra<00:02:04.290> clear<00:02:04.790> scratch-resistant

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
also use ultra clear scratch-resistant

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.730
