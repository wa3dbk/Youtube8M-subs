00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.249
 animal Kingdom 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.249
 men still have instincts 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.230
 and preserve their animal habits 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.700
 like that 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.010
 single payroll 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.010
 just for not taking care of something walking 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.990
 if the same animals huddle without seeing species in cold weather 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.920

 the men 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.090
 He still has needs and is hungry and hungry 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.770
 and keep their habits as perverse as that 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.220
 the Amazon 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.220
 just for fear of getting stuck 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.070
 if you will be plant they are called in the other they are entangled with each other leaves are evicted 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.490
 because man is called in the shadows 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.490
 having so much love in the open 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.610
 but this is man 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.360
 they always fear 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.130
 when he is a boy he fears the darkness 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.580
 sleep with the door open and a star lamp 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.360
 when he is young, he fears getting stuck 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.780
 that his legs do not respond and he stays in the same place 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.990
 forever 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.520
 and he's always looking for eternal love 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.410
 when he finds him, they fear him 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.650
 so he looks for it again 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.620
 when he is old he fears that death 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.720
 it is when love company plead and live eternally 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.190
 anyway 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.190
 this is the man bardem to Lima 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.470

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.610
 two
