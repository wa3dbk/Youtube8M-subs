I'm<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.140> interested<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:26.820> place

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
I'm so interested in this one place

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.540 
I'm so interested in this one place
because<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.900> actually<00:00:28.050> land<00:00:28.500> there<00:00:28.800> and

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
because we can actually land there and

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.820 
because we can actually land there and
the<00:00:30.240> more<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.480> keep<00:00:30.810> investigate<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.590> place

it<00:00:32.040> looks<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.640> at<00:00:32.730> one<00:00:32.880> time<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.270> was

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
it looks like that at one time it was

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.200 
it looks like that at one time it was
very<00:00:33.600> earth-like

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
very earth-like

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.480 
very earth-like
from<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:35.990> day<00:00:36.140> he<00:00:36.380> heard<00:00:36.530> rumors<00:00:37.010> of<00:00:37.040> a<00:00:37.250> face

sure<00:00:47.510> enough<00:00:47.570> found<00:00:48.530> this<00:00:48.680> photo<00:00:48.980> that<00:00:49.190> was

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
sure enough found this photo that was

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.630 
sure enough found this photo that was
labeled<00:00:49.520> head<00:00:50.000> H<00:00:50.450> EA<00:00:50.720> D<00:00:50.900> and<00:00:51.379> sure<00:00:52.220> enough<00:00:52.250> when

labeled head H EA D and sure enough when

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.979 
labeled head H EA D and sure enough when
I<00:00:52.700> looked<00:00:52.910> at<00:00:53.059> it<00:00:53.180> did<00:00:53.360> look<00:00:53.450> like<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:53.750> face

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
I looked at it did look like the face

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.100 
I looked at it did look like the face
that's<00:00:54.620> what<00:00:54.830> I<00:00:54.860> became<00:00:55.190> interested<00:00:55.460> okay<00:00:56.420> now

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
that's what I became interested okay now

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.900 
that's what I became interested okay now
I've<00:00:57.260> seen<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.650> picture<00:00:57.949> myself<00:00:58.340> give<00:00:58.640> me<00:00:58.790> the

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
I've seen the picture myself give me the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.420 
I've seen the picture myself give me the
data<00:00:59.059> it<00:00:59.960> looked<00:01:00.170> like<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:00.350> face<00:01:00.650> to<00:01:00.980> me

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
data it looked like a face to me

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.180 
data it looked like a face to me
I<00:01:01.460> mean<00:01:01.970> if<00:01:02.210> it<00:01:02.420> looks<00:01:02.629> like<00:01:02.809> a<00:01:02.840> face<00:01:03.170> maybe<00:01:03.980> it

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
I mean if it looks like a face maybe it

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.480 
I mean if it looks like a face maybe it
is<00:01:04.309> a<00:01:04.339> face<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:05.020> if<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:06.200> is<00:01:06.320> a<00:01:06.350> face<00:01:06.710> what<00:01:07.250> put

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
is a face and if it is a face what put

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.760 
is a face and if it is a face what put
it<00:01:07.520> there<00:01:07.820> who<00:01:08.420> put<00:01:08.720> it<00:01:08.810> there<00:01:08.840> what<00:01:09.410> did<00:01:09.619> it

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
it there who put it there what did it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.590 
it there who put it there what did it
was<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.670> natural

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
was it natural

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.109 
was it natural
it<00:01:11.899> wasn't<00:01:12.229> is<00:01:12.410> it<00:01:12.590> a<00:01:12.619> it<00:01:13.130> was<00:01:13.310> at<00:01:13.460> such<00:01:13.670> a<00:01:13.820> quirk

and<00:01:34.940> I<00:01:35.090> just<00:01:35.420> had<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.750> know<00:01:35.920> so<00:01:36.920> that's<00:01:37.070> when<00:01:37.399> I

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
and I just had to know so that's when I

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.850 
and I just had to know so that's when I
began<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:37.940> go<00:01:38.210> after<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:38.660> scientific<00:01:39.320> data<00:01:39.470> is

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
began to go after the scientific data is

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.340 
began to go after the scientific data is
it's<00:01:40.220> a<00:01:40.340> large<00:01:40.549> object<00:01:40.880> it's<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.540> it's<00:01:42.049> an

it's a large object it's a it's an

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.620 
it's a large object it's a it's an
undeniably<00:01:43.130> very<00:01:43.460> large<00:01:43.700> it's<00:01:43.970> a<00:01:44.090> mile<00:01:44.330> across

undeniably very large it's a mile across
we've<00:01:45.320> designed<00:01:46.750> some<00:01:47.750> computer<00:01:48.200> programs<00:01:48.710> to

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
we've designed some computer programs to

I replace some of the pixels in the very

we<00:02:25.830> have<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.340> much<00:02:26.519> evidence<00:02:26.819> that<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.330> is

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
we have so much evidence that this is

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.660 
we have so much evidence that this is
not<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.720> natural<00:02:28.170> formation<00:02:28.200> we<00:02:29.069> found<00:02:29.370> teeth

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
not a natural formation we found teeth

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.180 
not a natural formation we found teeth
in<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.120> mouth<00:02:30.299> area<00:02:30.629> we<00:02:31.349> found<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.739> hair<00:02:31.950> line

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
in the mouth area we found a hair line

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.979 
in the mouth area we found a hair line
that<00:02:32.430> goes<00:02:32.580> all<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.760> way<00:02:32.879> around<00:02:33.269> we<00:02:33.959> found

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
that goes all the way around we found

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.830 
that goes all the way around we found
symmetry<00:02:34.769> of<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.220> object<00:02:35.640> all<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.690> these
