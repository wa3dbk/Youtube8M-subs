there imagine if you bought three four

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.940 
there imagine if you bought three four
five<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:40.020> them<00:01:40.140> if<00:01:40.259> you've<00:01:40.380> got<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> coins

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
five of them if you've got the coins

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.620 
five of them if you've got the coins
then<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.549> make<00:01:41.670> himself<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.090> decent<00:01:42.479> profit

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
then you make himself a decent profit

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.530 
then you make himself a decent profit
and<00:01:43.020> he<00:01:43.110> wasn't<00:01:43.290> impacts<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.310> long<00:01:44.549> ago<00:01:44.850> now

I should have done boiling for 17 and a

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.880 
I should have done boiling for 17 and a
half<00:02:17.160> K<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.819> he's<00:02:18.599> now<00:02:18.840> gone<00:02:19.019> down<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.440> 12<00:02:19.680> k

to buy them for nine to five thousand
five<00:02:53.940> hundred<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.630> there<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.840> go<00:02:55.019> that's

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
five hundred and there you go that's

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.620 
five hundred and there you go that's
already<00:02:55.530> 35<00:02:56.099> k<00:02:56.549> profit<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.299> think<00:02:57.540> his

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
already 35 k profit and I think his

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.300 
already 35 k profit and I think his
price<00:02:57.870> will<00:02:58.079> continue<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.709> go<00:02:58.860> up<00:02:58.890> when<00:02:59.160> he's

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
price will continue to go up when he's

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.009 
price will continue to go up when he's
no<00:02:59.459> longer<00:02:59.640> impact<00:03:00.150> simply<00:03:00.510> because<00:03:00.780> there's

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
no longer impact simply because there's

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.690 
no longer impact simply because there's
not<00:03:01.170> many<00:03:01.349> of<00:03:01.650> him<00:03:02.099> around<00:03:02.430> at<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.670> moment

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
not many of him around at the moment

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.400 
not many of him around at the moment
even<00:03:03.420> when<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.569> was<00:03:03.750> trying<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.989> get<00:03:04.110> hold<00:03:04.260> of

10250 pretty close to discard and now

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.200 
10250 pretty close to discard and now
he's<00:04:24.539> 11<00:04:24.930> 750<00:04:25.590> as<00:04:25.680> less<00:04:25.860> by<00:04:26.099> now<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:26.760> could

he's 11 750 as less by now so could

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.700 
he's 11 750 as less by now so could
made<00:04:27.449> like<00:04:27.630> one<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:27.870> a<00:04:27.930> half<00:04:27.960> K<00:04:28.259> on<00:04:28.410> him<00:04:28.530> but

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710

again he's not one that I would
recommend<00:04:30.120> investing<00:04:30.479> because<00:04:30.900> it's<00:04:31.169> simply

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
recommend investing because it's simply

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.469

the<00:04:31.650> demand<00:04:32.069> will<00:04:32.280> be<00:04:32.460> or<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.880> supply<00:04:33.240> will<00:04:33.449> be

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
the demand will be or the supply will be

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.420 
the demand will be or the supply will be
too<00:04:33.720> high<00:04:33.900> rather<00:04:34.229> than<00:04:34.410> a<00:04:34.500> demand<00:04:34.860> so<00:04:35.310> we've

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
too high rather than a demand so we've

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.400 
too high rather than a demand so we've
got<00:04:35.580> to<00:04:35.699> bear<00:04:35.880> in<00:04:35.910> mind<00:04:36.030> is<00:04:36.389> is<00:04:36.660> that<00:04:36.870> this<00:04:37.349> is

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
got to bear in mind is is that this is

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.409 
got to bear in mind is is that this is
not<00:04:37.740> a<00:04:37.770> quick<00:04:38.099> turnaround<00:04:38.460> profit<00:04:39.090> method

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419
