00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
pushing the CPU are going to perform

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.630 
pushing the CPU are going to perform
fifty<00:03:09.450> percent<00:03:09.690> better<00:03:10.020> with<00:03:10.950> DirectX<00:03:11.490> 12

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
fifty percent better with DirectX 12

fifty percent better with DirectX 12
verse<00:03:12.000> directx<00:03:12.570> 11<00:03:12.990> so<00:03:13.140> I'm<00:03:13.230> really<00:03:13.350> looking

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
verse directx 11 so I'm really looking

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.470 
verse directx 11 so I'm really looking
forward<00:03:13.740> to<00:03:14.070> that<00:03:14.130> in<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.610> future<00:03:14.790> games<00:03:15.240> that

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
forward to that in the future games that

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.050 
forward to that in the future games that
support<00:03:15.660> more<00:03:16.560> CPU<00:03:17.040> intensive<00:03:17.220> games<00:03:17.760> that

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
support more CPU intensive games that

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.990 
support more CPU intensive games that
can<00:03:18.240> use<00:03:18.690> DirectX<00:03:19.200> 12<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.770> push<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.310> xbox<00:03:20.730> and

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
can use DirectX 12 to push the xbox and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.430 
can use DirectX 12 to push the xbox and
push<00:03:21.210> PC<00:03:21.690> gaming<00:03:21.990> even<00:03:22.800> further<00:03:24.200> so<00:03:25.200> if<00:03:25.320> you're

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.430 
the first game right now that we know of
that<00:03:43.920> will<00:03:44.040> be<00:03:44.130> supporting<00:03:44.670> DirectX<00:03:45.300> 12<00:03:45.540> so

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
that will be supporting DirectX 12 so

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.930 
that will be supporting DirectX 12 so
that's<00:03:46.620> pretty<00:03:47.010> cool<00:03:47.220> since<00:03:47.580> it's<00:03:47.700> going<00:03:47.880> to

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
that's pretty cool since it's going to

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.540 
that's pretty cool since it's going to
be<00:03:48.000> running<00:03:48.150> on<00:03:48.300> Unreal<00:03:48.720> Engine<00:03:48.960> 4<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.890> also

their<00:03:54.540> engine<00:03:54.960> so<00:03:55.560> that's<00:03:55.710> me<00:03:55.830> good<00:03:56.070> to<00:03:56.250> see

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
their engine so that's me good to see

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.180 
their engine so that's me good to see
more<00:03:56.610> games<00:03:56.820> supporting<00:03:57.450> Direct<00:03:57.810> X<00:03:57.990> 12
