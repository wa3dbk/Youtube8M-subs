00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.110 

in<00:00:01.079> this<00:00:01.979> presentation<00:00:02.220> good<00:00:02.790> look<00:00:03.000> at

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
in this presentation good look at

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.869 
in this presentation good look at
hexadecimal<00:00:03.870> numbers<00:00:04.290> and<00:00:04.529> how<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.130> convert

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
hexadecimal numbers and how to convert

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.860 
hexadecimal numbers and how to convert
decimal<00:00:06.629> fractions<00:00:07.109> into<00:00:07.560> hexadecimal<00:00:08.309> form

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
decimal fractions into hexadecimal form

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.930 
decimal fractions into hexadecimal form
so<00:00:09.870> what<00:00:10.349> we're<00:00:10.469> going<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.679> do<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:11.099> convert<00:00:11.759> the

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
so what we're going to do is convert the

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.610 
so what we're going to do is convert the
following<00:00:12.269> decimal<00:00:12.599> number<00:00:12.840> at<00:00:12.960> hexadecimal

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
following decimal number at hexadecimal

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.760 
following decimal number at hexadecimal
form<00:00:13.889> now<00:00:14.190> point<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.790> eight<00:00:15.330> 125<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:16.680> we're

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
form now point a to eight 125 so we're

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.519 
form now point a to eight 125 so we're
going<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.949> convert<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:18.230> you<00:00:19.230> just<00:00:19.410> might

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
going to convert that you just might

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.070 
going to convert that you just might
notice<00:00:19.859> there<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.400> paired<00:00:21.300> from<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.869> 0

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
notice there that it paired from the 0

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.529 
notice there that it paired from the 0
it<00:00:22.439> has<00:00:22.680> six<00:00:23.250> decimal<00:00:23.519> places<00:00:25.070> so<00:00:26.300> here's<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
it has six decimal places so here's the

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.179 
it has six decimal places so here's the
steps<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:27.930> go<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> take<00:00:28.349> first<00:00:28.710> off<00:00:28.890> we're

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
steps we go to take first off we're

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.640 
steps we go to take first off we're
going<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.369> multiply<00:00:29.670> our<00:00:29.939> number<00:00:30.240> by<00:00:30.390> 16<00:00:30.929> then

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
going to multiply our number by 16 then

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.840 
going to multiply our number by 16 then
we're<00:00:31.800> going<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> break<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.309> up<00:00:32.489> into<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
we're going to break this up into the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.810 
we're going to break this up into the
integer<00:00:33.390> part<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.050> fractional<00:00:34.500> part

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
integer part and the fractional part

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.860 
integer part and the fractional part
we're<00:00:35.820> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> determine<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.570> hexadecimal

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
we're going to determine the hexadecimal

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.319 
we're going to determine the hexadecimal
equivalent<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.129> integer<00:00:38.550> part<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.059> with

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
equivalent of the integer part and with

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.639 
equivalent of the integer part and with
the<00:00:39.420> fractional<00:00:39.870> part<00:00:40.170> we're<00:00:40.469> going<00:00:40.590> to

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
the fractional part we're going to

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.590 
the fractional part we're going to
return<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.010> step<00:00:41.250> one<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.120> these<00:00:42.239> four<00:00:42.510> steps

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
return to step one so these four steps

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.020 
return to step one so these four steps
are<00:00:42.930> going<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.110> follow<00:00:43.290> for<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:44.219> while<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.820> that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
are going to follow for a while and that

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.180 
are going to follow for a while and that
will<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.329> able<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.660> sort<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.170> determine<00:00:46.860> our

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
will be able to sort of determine our

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.880 
will be able to sort of determine our
answer<00:00:47.850> once<00:00:48.539> we've<00:00:48.719> followed<00:00:49.350> these<00:00:49.620> four

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
answer once we've followed these four

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.639 
answer once we've followed these four
steps<00:00:50.420> but<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.719> that's<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> whole

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
steps but that that's not the whole

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.920 
steps but that that's not the whole
story<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.969> best<00:00:54.210> done<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.629> sort<00:00:54.870> of

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
story this is best done with a sort of

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.420 
story this is best done with a sort of
little<00:00:55.020> table<00:00:55.649> like<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.420> so<00:00:57.770> these<00:00:58.770> columns

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
little table like this so these columns

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.430 
little table like this so these columns
sort<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.789> more<00:00:59.940> or<00:01:00.000> less<00:01:00.120> correspond<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.140> those

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
sort of more or less correspond to those

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.490 
sort of more or less correspond to those
four<00:01:01.770> steps<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.960> I'm<00:01:03.960> going<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> sort<00:01:04.409> of

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
four steps and I'm going to sort of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.530 
four steps and I'm going to sort of
explain<00:01:04.830> how<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> use<00:01:05.519> those<00:01:05.790> four<00:01:06.060> steps<00:01:06.330> and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
explain how to use those four steps and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.910 
explain how to use those four steps and
then<00:01:06.659> how<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.869> get<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.229> answer<00:01:07.320> from<00:01:07.680> those

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
then how to get your answer from those

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.359 
then how to get your answer from those
so<00:01:08.820> first<00:01:09.210> off<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:09.630> our<00:01:10.320> number<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
so first off we have our number here and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.030 
so first off we have our number here and
this<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.659> hexadecimal<00:01:13.320> know<00:01:13.710> what<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> mean

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
this is the hexadecimal know what I mean

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.410 
this is the hexadecimal know what I mean
by<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.700> number<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:15.119> want<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
by that is the number we want the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.660 
by that is the number we want the
hexadecimal<00:01:15.799> fr<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:19.049> what<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:20.040> are<00:01:20.369> going

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
hexadecimal fr and so what we are going

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.999 
hexadecimal fr and so what we are going
to<00:01:20.790> do<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:22.700> multiply<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.060> by<00:01:24.119> 16<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.860> get

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
to do is multiply that by 16 so we get

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.969 
to do is multiply that by 16 so we get
13.25<00:01:27.259> now<00:01:28.259> we're<00:01:28.380> going<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> break<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.920> up

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
13.25 now we're going to break that up

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.429 
13.25 now we're going to break that up
into<00:01:29.250> an<00:01:29.610> integer<00:01:29.880> part<00:01:30.350> which<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.380> 13<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
into an integer part which is 13 and

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.600 
into an integer part which is 13 and
we're<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.710> find<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.310> hexadecimal

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
we're going to find the hexadecimal

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.569 
we're going to find the hexadecimal
equivalent<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.900> d<00:01:40.579> next

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
equivalent of that and that is d next

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.550 
equivalent of that and that is d next
we're<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.880> look<00:01:41.970> at<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.720> fractional

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
we're going to look at the fractional

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.980 
we're going to look at the fractional
part<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.509> 13.25<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.369> 0.25<00:01:47.750> ok<00:01:48.750> that's

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
part of 13.25 and that is 0.25 ok that's

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.920 
part of 13.25 and that is 0.25 ok that's
the<00:01:49.110> fractional<00:01:49.530> part<00:01:49.799> there<00:01:50.420> ok<00:01:51.420> moving<00:01:51.720> on

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
the fractional part there ok moving on

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.440 
the fractional part there ok moving on
so<00:01:52.920> what<00:01:53.189> we're<00:01:53.280> going<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.460> do<00:01:53.549> now<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:54.030> with

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
so what we're going to do now is with

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.109 
so what we're going to do now is with
this<00:01:54.570> fractional<00:01:55.170> part<00:01:55.470> bring<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.040> back<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.729> a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
this fractional part bring it back to a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.510 
this fractional part bring it back to a
step<00:01:58.110> one<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.829> we're<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.130> start<00:01:59.310> all

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
step one so we're going to start all

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.459 
step one so we're going to start all
over<00:01:59.549> again<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.750> we're<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.170> start<00:02:01.200> all

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
over again so we're going to start all

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.760 
over again so we're going to start all
over<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:02.070> air<00:02:02.280> again<00:02:03.060> with<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:04.170> we<00:02:04.619> have

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
over the air again with this so we have

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.200 
over the air again with this so we have
this<00:02:04.920> number<00:02:05.130> here<00:02:05.399> now<00:02:05.670> i'm<00:02:05.939> going<00:02:06.149> to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
this number here now i'm going to

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.559 
this number here now i'm going to
multiply<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.750> by<00:02:06.810> 16<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.310> get<00:02:08.489> for<00:02:08.849> now

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
multiply that by 16 and we get for now

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.780 
multiply that by 16 and we get for now
the<00:02:09.629> integer<00:02:10.020> part<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.619> 4<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.370> 4

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
the integer part of 4 is 4

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.520 
the integer part of 4 is 4
the<00:02:12.849> decimal<00:02:13.269> equivalent<00:02:13.750> of<00:02:13.870> the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
the decimal equivalent of the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.069 
the decimal equivalent of the
hexadecimal<00:02:14.829> equivalent<00:02:15.189> of<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.780> decimal

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
hexadecimal equivalent of the decimal

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.619 
hexadecimal equivalent of the decimal
number<00:02:17.349> four<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:17.859> also<00:02:18.189> 4<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:19.209> fractional

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
number four is also 4 and the fractional

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.589 
number four is also 4 and the fractional
part<00:02:19.930> here<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.409> 0<00:02:21.090> okay<00:02:22.109> so<00:02:23.109> and<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:24.640> have<00:02:24.909> D<00:02:25.329> and

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
part here is 0 okay so and we have D and

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.319 
part here is 0 okay so and we have D and
four<00:02:25.930> here<00:02:26.409> so<00:02:26.950> let's<00:02:27.489> look<00:02:27.640> at<00:02:27.790> those<00:02:27.939> there

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
four here so let's look at those there

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:34.770 
four here so let's look at those there
that<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:31.829> going<00:02:32.829> from<00:02:33.040> top<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.340> bottom<00:02:33.780> those

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
that in going from top to bottom those

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.589 
that in going from top to bottom those
are<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.730> symbols<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:37.090> we<00:02:37.420> require<00:02:37.780> for<00:02:38.370> our

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
are the symbols that we require for our

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.720 
are the symbols that we require for our
hexadecimal<00:02:40.599> equivalent<00:02:40.659> and<00:02:41.639> just<00:02:42.639> to<00:02:42.700> be

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
hexadecimal equivalent and just to be

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.140 
hexadecimal equivalent and just to be
clear<00:02:43.030> we're<00:02:43.329> going<00:02:43.569> from<00:02:43.780> top<00:02:44.019> to<00:02:44.260> bottom<00:02:44.409> a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
clear we're going from top to bottom a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.399 
clear we're going from top to bottom a
with<00:02:46.150> some<00:02:46.359> algorithm<00:02:46.780> is<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.930> go<00:02:47.049> from<00:02:47.200> a

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
with some algorithm is to go from a

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.250 
with some algorithm is to go from a
start<00:02:48.280> at<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.489> bottom<00:02:48.609> and<00:02:48.819> work<00:02:49.060> up<00:02:49.269> not<00:02:50.049> with

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
start at the bottom and work up not with

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.830 
start at the bottom and work up not with
this<00:02:50.409> and<00:02:50.709> not<00:02:50.919> with<00:02:51.159> fractional<00:02:51.760> numbers<00:02:52.120> so

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
this and not with fractional numbers so

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.869 
this and not with fractional numbers so
the<00:02:53.260> answer<00:02:53.290> we're<00:02:53.799> looking<00:02:53.829> for<00:02:54.189> is<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:54.760> we

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
the answer we're looking for is so we

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.470 
the answer we're looking for is so we
have<00:02:55.030> D<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.510> four<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.650> answer<00:02:56.680> we<00:02:57.069> add<00:02:57.480> to

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
have D and four so the answer we add to

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.800 
have D and four so the answer we add to
what<00:02:58.629> we're<00:02:58.750> looking<00:02:58.989> for<00:02:59.040> in<00:03:00.540> hex<00:03:01.540> in

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
what we're looking for in hex in

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.580 
what we're looking for in hex in
hexadecimal<00:03:02.230> form<00:03:02.889> that<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:04.389> answer<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:04.810> zero

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
hexadecimal form that the answer is zero

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.059 
hexadecimal form that the answer is zero
point<00:03:05.919> d4<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.900> is<00:03:08.109> our<00:03:08.439> answer<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:09.010> you

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
point d4 and that is our answer so you

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.710 
point d4 and that is our answer so you
might<00:03:09.250> notice<00:03:09.459> that<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:09.849> that<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:10.239> actually

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
might notice that that that is actually

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.020 
might notice that that that is actually
represented<00:03:11.560> with<00:03:11.769> two<00:03:12.129> characters<00:03:12.669> rather

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
represented with two characters rather

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.329 
represented with two characters rather
than<00:03:13.239> six<00:03:13.569> and<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:15.400> ends<00:03:15.639> our<00:03:15.700> presentation
