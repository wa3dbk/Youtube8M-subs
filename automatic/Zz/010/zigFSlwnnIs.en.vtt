might<00:02:03.299> be<00:02:03.330> a<00:02:03.450> little<00:02:03.630> more<00:02:03.869> tricky<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.619> cut

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
might be a little more tricky so you cut

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.230 
might be a little more tricky so you cut
it<00:02:04.890> out<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.369> cut<00:02:05.549> around<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:06.090> and

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
then once you do that you can trace it

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.550 
then once you do that you can trace it
on<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> piece<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.090> paper<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.840> now<00:02:10.289> you've
