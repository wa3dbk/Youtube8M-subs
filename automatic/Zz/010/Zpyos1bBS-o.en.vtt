00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and you guys can see the three things

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.230 
and you guys can see the three things
that<00:01:34.079> are<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> notepad<00:01:34.860> file<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:36.030> two

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
that are in the notepad file is the two

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.630 
that are in the notepad file is the two
hot<00:01:36.750> keys<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.890> guys<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.220> use<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.520> make

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
hot keys that you guys can use to make

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.219 
hot keys that you guys can use to make
the<00:01:38.759> time<00:01:38.909> go<00:01:38.970> forward<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.540> backwards<00:01:39.930> and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the time go forward and backwards and

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.319 
the time go forward and backwards and
then<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.770> use<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.549> other<00:01:41.729> little<00:01:41.939> spot

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
then you can use the other little spot

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.999 
then you can use the other little spot
that's<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> bottom<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.500> believe<00:01:43.799> it

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
that's like at the bottom I believe it

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.969 
that's like at the bottom I believe it
has<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.880> speed<00:01:45.329> at<00:01:45.509> which<00:01:45.540> your<00:01:46.049> time<00:01:46.350> changes

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
has the speed at which your time changes

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.039 
has the speed at which your time changes
so<00:01:47.159> right<00:01:47.340> now<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:47.939> set<00:01:48.180> at<00:01:48.240> 1200

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
so right now I have it set at 1200

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.990 
so right now I have it set at 1200
that's<00:01:49.229> really<00:01:49.530> really<00:01:49.680> fast<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.430> default<00:01:50.640> is

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
that's really really fast the default is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.760 
that's really really fast the default is
like<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> hundred<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.259> guys<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.590> make<00:01:52.710> it

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
like a hundred and you guys can make it

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.410 
like a hundred and you guys can make it
less<00:01:53.009> than<00:01:53.189> 100<00:01:53.549> if<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.729> want<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.000> go<00:01:54.119> slower

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
less than 100 if you want to go slower

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.330 
less than 100 if you want to go slower
or<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.079> can<00:01:55.200> make<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.439> like<00:01:55.560> mine<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.950> habitat

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
or you can make it like mine and habitat

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.280 
or you can make it like mine and habitat
like<00:01:56.460> 1200<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.540> make<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.810> go<00:01:57.930> really<00:01:58.110> really

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
like 1200 to make it go really really

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.499 
like 1200 to make it go really really
fast<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.860> there's<00:01:59.460> also<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.759> command<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.420> you

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
fast and there's also a command for you

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.719 
fast and there's also a command for you
guys<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.930> reload<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> config<00:02:02.040> if<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.520> wish

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
guys to reload the config if you so wish

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.340 
guys to reload the config if you so wish
all<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.299> gotta<00:02:03.420> do<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:03.840> type<00:02:04.020> sky

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
all you gotta do is just type sky

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.810 
all you gotta do is just type sky
scroller<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.729> then<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.180> think<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:06.450> reload

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
scroller and then I think it's reload

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.419 
scroller and then I think it's reload
config<00:02:08.450> like<00:02:08.720> this<00:02:08.990> and<00:02:09.289> that<00:02:09.320> reloads<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
config like this and that reloads the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.010 
config like this and that reloads the
config<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.090> when<00:02:11.240> you<00:02:11.330> guys<00:02:11.480> change<00:02:11.780> all<00:02:11.930> the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
config so when you guys change all the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.360 
config so when you guys change all the
stuff<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.470> config<00:02:12.860> file<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.160> don't<00:02:13.280> have

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
stuff in the config file you don't have

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.560 
stuff in the config file you don't have
to<00:02:13.460> close<00:02:13.640> out<00:02:13.820> minecraft<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.360> do<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.450> lot<00:02:14.540> of

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
to close out minecraft and do a lot of

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.790 
to close out minecraft and do a lot of
stuff<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:14.930> can<00:02:14.960> just<00:02:15.170> type<00:02:15.320> in<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.530> command

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
stuff you can just type in the command

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.699 
stuff you can just type in the command
and<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.940> should<00:02:17.180> pretty<00:02:17.360> much<00:02:17.480> do<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:17.870> but

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
and that should pretty much do it but

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.470 
and that should pretty much do it but
it's<00:02:19.040> just<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.400> kind<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.730> simple<00:02:19.970> mod<00:02:20.240> if<00:02:20.390> you

like<00:02:46.459> big<00:02:46.730> mouths<00:02:46.970> though<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:47.390> i<00:02:47.420> thought<00:02:47.600> i

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
like big mouths though so i thought i

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.360 
like big mouths though so i thought i
would<00:02:47.870> do<00:02:47.959> kind<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.320> a<00:02:48.410> small<00:02:48.770> one<00:02:49.010> like<00:02:49.190> this

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
would do kind of a small one like this

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.250 
would do kind of a small one like this
that<00:02:49.550> doesn't<00:02:49.790> really<00:02:49.880> change<00:02:50.000> your<00:02:50.570> gameplay

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
that doesn't really change your gameplay

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.510 
that doesn't really change your gameplay
but<00:02:51.320> more<00:02:51.620> just<00:02:51.800> kind<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.100> how<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.280> guys

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
but more just kind of how you guys

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.990 
but more just kind of how you guys
experience<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.330> game<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:54.220> yeah<00:02:55.220> but<00:02:55.580> i<00:02:55.640> think

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
experience the game and yeah but i think

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.699 
experience the game and yeah but i think
i<00:02:56.150> think<00:02:56.180> that<00:02:56.390> pretty<00:02:56.660> much<00:02:56.750> does<00:02:57.050> it<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.380> know

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
i think that pretty much does it I know

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.440 
i think that pretty much does it I know
it's<00:02:57.950> not<00:02:58.070> too<00:02:58.250> big<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.550> a<00:02:58.640> mod<00:02:58.820> but<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.180> did

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
it's not too big of a mod but I did

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.699 
it's not too big of a mod but I did
think<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.750> would<00:02:59.870> be<00:02:59.959> helpful<00:03:00.170> for<00:03:00.380> those<00:03:00.560> of

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
think it would be helpful for those of

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.710 
think it would be helpful for those of
you<00:03:00.800> guys<00:03:00.950> who<00:03:01.010> like<00:03:01.459> mods<00:03:02.060> that<00:03:02.239> don't<00:03:02.480> really

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
you guys who like mods that don't really

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.780 
you guys who like mods that don't really
like<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.680> know<00:03:03.739> add<00:03:04.010> in<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.250> lot<00:03:04.430> of<00:03:04.550> stuff

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
like to you know add in a lot of stuff

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.699 
like to you know add in a lot of stuff
but<00:03:05.030> merely<00:03:05.750> just<00:03:06.050> change<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.380> small<00:03:06.590> little

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
but merely just change a small little

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.500 
but merely just change a small little
aspect<00:03:07.100> to<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.370> game<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.850> kind<00:03:08.209> of<00:03:08.269> give<00:03:08.420> you

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
aspect to the game to kind of give you

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.050 
aspect to the game to kind of give you
guys<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:08.720> different<00:03:09.230> way<00:03:09.410> of<00:03:09.440> doing<00:03:09.950> stuff<00:03:10.580> but

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
guys a different way of doing stuff but

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.009 
guys a different way of doing stuff but
I<00:03:11.090> think<00:03:11.360> that<00:03:11.390> pretty<00:03:11.630> much<00:03:11.720> does<00:03:11.959> it

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
I think that pretty much does it

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.870 
I think that pretty much does it
hopefully<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.620> guys<00:03:12.739> did<00:03:13.040> enjoy<00:03:13.130> it<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:13.640> like
