00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.930
 Hi, this is a video lesson from the institute. 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.590
 sollus 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.320
 we will address the beta blockers that is 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.500
 one of the anti-drug groups 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.420
 hypertensive 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.340
 be welcome beta-blockers 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.130
 are also known as blockers 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.890
 the energetic beta receptors 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.560
 main drugs of the group are themselves 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.990
 low that is the prototype of the group o 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.870
 atenolol the well-known drug 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.660
 fairly used pro method of the same 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.399
 form the bis or propofol 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.590
 onion mol Nebbiolo en UOL the taxol 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:46.300
 carvedilol labita lol 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.239
 nadol uol pin and thymus long 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.809
 let us now understand your mechanism of 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.520
 betablockers act by 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.129
 various mechanisms 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.510
 the main one is the decrease in 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.879
 cardiac output 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.759
 this is because they 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:08.090
 activation of beta 1 receptors in the heart 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.040
 which produces a cro effect in the tropics and in the 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.190
 tropic negative 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.740
 in other words the cro effect on 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.810
 negative tropic occurs due to 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.080
 of heart rate 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.720
 already the effect and in the negative tropic occurs 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.119
 by the decrease in the contraction force of the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.060
 heart muscle 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.540
 these added effects reduce the 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.009
 blood pressure and how to 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.259
 reduce the consumption of 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.780
 myocardial oxygen 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.700
 beyond these mechanisms the 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.970
 beta blockers can also 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.280
 reduce renin secretion and decrease 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.130
 the number of mines in the 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.610
 nerve synapses 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.000
 what are the main clinical uses 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.640
 of beta-blockers according to the 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.740
 clinical pharmacological foundations of 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.290
 medicines for everyday use 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.229
 these drugs have benefit 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.739
 defined when used in the acute 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.590
 infarction and heart failure , and 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.460
 arterial atrial fibrillation 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.720
 if 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:20.750
 only but attention 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.940
 several more recent studies suggest that 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.420
 the use of beta- blockers such as 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.170
 atenolol should not be done and the elderly and 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.020
 diabetics due to associated risks 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.120
 according to study results the 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.430
 betablockers showed lower 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.850
 effectiveness in preventing events 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.700
 cardiovascular diseases, especially accidents 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.860
 Induce cerebral vascular 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.740
 development and diabetes and 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.540
 less favorable metabolic profile in 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.540
 combination with diuretics 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.620
 still according to the fundamentals 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.380
 medicinal products 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.210
 of common use 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.570
 these drugs have benefit 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.940
 probable when used in glaucoma in the 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.060
 case of petab landlords in the form of 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.940
 eye drops for topical use also in 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.920
 prophylaxis of migraine in angina 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.360
 stable and in unstable angina 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.200
 Let's see now which are the main 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.040
 adverse reactions of beta-blockers in 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.690
 predisposed patients may occur 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.120
 bronchospasms that may occur due to 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.120
 loss of receptor selectivity 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.440
 Concrete heart beta 2 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.380
 pulmonary 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.720
 peripheral circulatory insufficiency 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.240
 may occur due to the effect and 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.350
 tropic and tropic of negative chrono 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:51.740
 beta blockers brady arrhythmias as well 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.140
 It is one of the most common adverse reactions and 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:58.460
 the masking of hypoglycemia in 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:01.100
 beta-blockers can be 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.160
 to mask symptoms of hypoglycemia as 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.140
 tachycardia and palpitations and therefore 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.890
 should be used with caution in 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.890
 diabetic patients 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.510
 one of the adverse reactions is 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.810
 related to his profile by 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.420
 solubility of beta-blockers or 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.150
 propranolol for example is a form with 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.130
 very clean filipe cua concentration 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.320
 achieved in 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.020
 therapeutic levels is sufficient to 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.080
 result in sedation and decreased 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.080
 libido 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.770
 To finish our lesson, let's go 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.130
 now check properties 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.800
 pharmacological subway creators this 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.320
 The table below presents the main 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.890
 Beta-blocker medicines are in 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.480
 first column after the dosing area 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.080
 in which they are used 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:56.110
 frequency of daily administration to 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.050
 my life in hours cardinal 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:05.470
 selectivity of these drugs and the effect 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:08.100
 vasodilator we have just studied some 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.660
 details about beta-blockers 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.470
 Thank you for your company and until 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.470
