00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.790
 but it is not a battlefield this sentence 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.350
 Are you sure about release from 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.760
 battlefield hotline heard many times 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.770
 or even thought of yourself 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.689
 In fact, that happens in the move 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.669
 latest battlefield off the beaten track 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.890
 usual settings if it is still 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:37.020
 a title battlefield deserves to be experienced 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:39.210
 you here are a lot different than you are 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.710
 soldier your contribution in the war 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.480
 you take care of one clearly 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.710
 smaller battlefield you slip in 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.269
 the role of a detective 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.609
 The story will be a bit in the process 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.500
 style of a cop series told from the tv 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.910
 you are one with your new partner 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.410
 hot thing on the track 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.120
 now increasing between the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.920
 fronts in a drug conspiracy 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.899
 Actually, the story is expected 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.760
 quite varied but the spark 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.019
 I do not want to skip over blame 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.149
 but it is less the 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.710
 narrative the quite successful 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.990
 characters or the authentic ones 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.700
 settings no the gameplay prevented 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.840
 that she dives into the story and 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.430
 let you be mesmerized by her 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.960
 it would certainly be wrong to say that 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.790
 gameplay is bad the individual 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.100
 elements work and are sometimes 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.420
 innovative instead of each of you 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.730
 met over the pile to shoot 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.830
 Can you think of it as a head 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.750
 heard your opponents arrest or even 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.760
 switch off with a taser without further ado 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.350
 for each opponent he turns off 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.910
 without killing him you get 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.620
 according to expert points 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.600
 but here is the first logical error 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.490
 instead of that, more possibilities 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.290
 get your opponents to police officer 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.300
 to do anja you get new ones 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.580
 deadly weapons and accessories for these 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.920
 now you are partly in the middle 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.870
 a hostile area like you 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.790
 game you recommend you take an opponent 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.220
 firm and one more 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.990
 and one more that means within 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.300
 shortest time anywhere on the floor 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.470
 Gangster handcuffed aside 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.000
 from the question of where the many 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.920
 it's come by handcuffs 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.330
 amazing that none of the criminals 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.470
 his colleagues come up with the idea 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.180
 to preserve loudly 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.250
 that's basically a good example 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.500
 for that battlefield hotline one 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.540
 real police everyday life before 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.849
 but again and again this fails 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.840
 also playful to offer so runs 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.340
 every level always at two 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.500
 behaving pattern beyond 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.629
 Either he shoots every opponent like 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.340
 he is used to it or rtl sat and 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.830
 tie up your enemies and feel at it 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.629
 somehow strange in between you become 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.370
 again and again the area stopped 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.170
 know a Himmelbild equal deduction 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.060
 and thus to gather information 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.220
 In the end, it will all be great 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.870
 Ideas that together create an intensive one 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.370
 could provide game experience 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.440
 but they work consistently 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.000
 misplaced at the end remains true 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.849
 good approach but no 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.500
 satisfactory implementation technically 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.010
 there is basically nothing to consider 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.959
 gripe 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.340
 the 60 pictures per second provide for 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.230
 noticeable liquid pictures 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.700
 the colors are crisp and except one 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.680
 couple of crisis lie between sequences 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.209
 mostly sharp but also in the 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.280
 Gameplay did not get special here 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.540
 Although both procedures are consistent 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.760
 the protagonist as well 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.019
 key figures were well implemented yet 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.280
 then apparently not enough anymore 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.690
 time for the statists 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.519
 These are not just right 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.530
 two-dimensional but repeat 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.940
 the faces often act star 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.099
 and free from emotions 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.150
 here, too, it might be one 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.060
 good idea 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.410
 maybe put on fewer opponents 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.590
 can the synchronization yes more 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.060
 to convince 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.709
 Again, the protagonists are in 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.540
 order yet you listen to the criminal 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.340
 it somehow feels wrong 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.350
 These sound like German gangsters 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.940
 and not American as you are 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.920
 but you are in miami that sounds like 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.579
 rather strange to offer again 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.579
 distorted picture 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.550
 Despite the sport , at least the 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.470
 score soundtrack 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.810
 the songs are all thematic 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:57.569
 into the game and are skilfully placed that 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.489
 but it is not a battlefield and here too 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.470
 skeptics are not wrong 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.250
 many characters have a unique language 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.140
 speak 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.629
 to leave the symbolism and the game modes 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.640
 Act intuitively and immediately 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.799
 the menu is no big puzzle 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.230
 Of course, the modes are particularly impressive 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.670
 which fits in with the topic 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.799
 to engage in activities 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.359
 Raids must be prevented money 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.160
 from one transporter to another 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.500
 be worn here and there too 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.760
 sometimes a hostage freed on the paper 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.500
 It all sounds very exciting and 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.540
 promises cinematic sequences 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.880
 but in the game itself, the processes remain 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.310
 the same as you from other modes 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.440
 already knows about running to a goal and 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.030
 hold this or hollow something of one 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.830
 point and bring it to another 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.510
 in between there is the usual shooting 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.699
 and most importantly, die 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.680
 but is the pace for battlefield sooner 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.630
 not typical untypical frustration 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.950
 then modifies a mode simple then 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.380
 but it does come out 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.120
 at hot wire will be different than at 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.889
 domination no stationary points 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.900
 taken and held but point 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.030
 in the form of cars which subsequently over 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.380
 the card will be driven this mode 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.610
 the chaos illustrates that despite 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.860
 existing goals multiplayer 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.030
 have a predominant her team in the 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.560
 you have pulled the same rope 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.900
 certainly a while fun with it and 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.700
 pleased by the equip of your agent 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.860
 but you alone usually count 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.660
 loser team 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.250
 apropos equipment this varies ever 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.260
 after which mode and on which 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.000
 So you want to play side 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.590
 For example, you have a certain weapon 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.460
 These do not automatically in every round 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.470
 available 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.360
 that will cause you to do much more 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.710
 have to spend time in the game before you 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.840
 you sufficiently improved 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.099
 a linear progress would have here 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.870
 safety not harmed 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.060
 for brand battlefield and shooter 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.010
 Cod usually moves the playing time 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.900
 between six and ten hours dependent 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.940
 of difficulty and above all 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.530
 how to turn off your opponents 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.300
 she wanted to know her surroundings 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.039
 prove to everyone that the game time 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.650
 also on the multiplayer part 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.060
 has eight game modes 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.010
 do you feel in the game well you will 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.810
 So get out a lot of playing time 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.240
 the campaign has only a limited one 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.390
 spielberg expensive procedure none 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.790
 has an influence on the further course 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.930
 the billing stable 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:05.900
 image repetition rate good ideas that 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.790
 unfortunately not consistently implemented 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.230
 spongy overall concept logical 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.560
 mistakes in the campaign and in the 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.480
 multiplayer battlefield hotline abounds 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.610
 especially the beginning of good ideas 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.060
 feels good and makes you want to 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.040
 more 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.500
 unfortunately, none of these ideas 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.600
 consistently implemented at the end remains one 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.730
 mixture of good ideas and classic 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.660
 They do not have that 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.660
 master others
