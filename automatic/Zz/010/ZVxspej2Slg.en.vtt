00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 windows 10 has appeared and already 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.390
 So every tenth person can use the system 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.370
 not be that bad or 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.769
 also with computer picture have many 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.480
 editors windows 10 already tested and 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.370
 both great features found 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.010
 Even things the microsoft was still 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:22.680
 So here's our tops and change 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:25.800
 flops to the annoyance of many users was missing 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.810
 classic start menu in windows 8 this 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.699
 now comes back with windows 10 it 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.679
 keeps the list form of windows 7 and 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.960
 also has some tile elements 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.730
 from windows 8 would be the classic 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.260
 presentation may even be all 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.910
 completely remove tiles 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.800
 Shutting down works similarly 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.670
 just like with windows 7 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.840
 desperate some windows 8 users 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.520
 first comes in the history 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.950
 to a nice animation if you want 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.780
 window maximizes how to zoom in 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.640
 The window does not matter 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.500
 older system versions work in the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.420
 comparison stale who the animation 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.219
 Of course, she does not like switching off 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.800
 But then there are many others 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.379
 give up on gimmicks like in 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.890
 windows 8.1 stuck in windows 10.2 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.600
 browser cache and the internet explorer 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.939
 it makes a good impression of the new 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.580
 developed and optically extremely simple 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.900
 He is quick to put web pages there and 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.790
 can use chrome in the javascript 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.710
 processing compete 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.810
 a full of mode is still missing the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.330
 but important functions are on board 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.310
 the internet explorer 11 is not 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.990
 longer the standard browser and in the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.579
 background moved but supports 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.920
 exclusively under windows 10 the 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.500
 acceleration technology http maybe 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.780
 two but honestly who uses the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.540
 Almost all innovations from 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.369
 windows vista 7 and 8 are in the new 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.740
 Windows in the background works 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.140
 basic protection windows defender the the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.390
 the virus is the main defense against the system 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.970
 also recognizes SSD hard drives correctly 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.500
 and adjusts itself optimally so 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.840
 that there is no unnecessary wear 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.610
 the drives come and also the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.619
 user account control is back 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.750
 they were intervening before system and 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.120
 thus prevented some 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.710
 action hello a computer 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.640
 Speech recognition has been around for a while 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.810
 vista in windows ten animals finally 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.820
 practical the speech is from cortina 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.710
 a microsoft account provided 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.200
 one dictates over a search field the 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.860
 taskbar program calls or that 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.320
 plan the appointment okay i open the app 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.090
 finances understand complex commands 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.530
 anna often does not come yet but it is 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.209
 probably that microsoft through 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.640
 further updates to apples siri 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.290
 excludes microsoft has too 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.970
 smaller left adopted around 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.739
 to deliver round total package 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.690
 wherever you look you can see 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.100
 revised program icons still 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.560
 for example, the simpler work 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.900
 libraries folders and elements of 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.610
 control panel the jump lists the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.590
 after a right click on taskbar 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.810
 symbols appear coming and more modern 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.090
 black optics also diverse system 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.920
 sounds like warning sounds have been updated 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.930
 for the safety of its users 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.390
 improve microsoft windows 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.160
 update installations to the obligation one 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.930
 Can not do unwanted updates 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.030
 deselect more at the predecessor system 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.630
 it was easy to tick off here 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.880
 remove 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.040
 the new automatic also forces users 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.660
 updates on how flawed are 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.580
 with simple means you can use the 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.650
 do not prevent installation and that 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.690
 should change microsoft very quickly 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.030
 many used the windows media center 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.070
 under windows vista and 7 no more 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.660
 but for fans of the function is its 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.890
 total loss in windows ten 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.320
 probably hard 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.570
 not included are the windows 7 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.269
 applications the dvd playback and the 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.370
 Color adjustment of the windows a giant flop 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.739
 You absolutely can not suppress that 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.540
 system collects data in the setting 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.860
 sap has many switches around it 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.320
 prevent collecting 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.910
 apps can but if you allow it to 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.700
 example on the notebook webcam too 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.290
 grab or not by many 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.540
 may be desirable that microsoft 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.790
 all done with katana search 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.920
 complete information and the 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.440
 Manufacturer knows what you asked for 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.750
 also has windows 10 at least 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.760
 on the paper unfortunately slower than that 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.920
 predecessor because in the lab has computer image 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.780
 checked how fast windows 10 in 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.299
 compared to seven and eight point one 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.400
 and stated it is actually a 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.010
 Little lama, for example, starting up 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.550
 takes a few seconds longer but if 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.460
 one 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.910
 ssd has installed this 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.990
 speed difference in everyday life 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.060
 barely noticeable 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.010
 but it is annoying anyway 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.140
 windows should actually be faster 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.030
 and not slower how is that 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.470
 with you the windows 10 actually uses 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.720
 already what features you like 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.020
 really good and what annoys us 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.020
