launcher the reason I have the m320 is
because<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.880> comes<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.180> handy<00:01:39.299> when<00:01:39.600> an<00:01:39.689> enemy

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
because it comes in handy when an enemy

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.749 
because it comes in handy when an enemy
is<00:01:40.079> camping<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.619> room<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.549> blow

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
out the wall behind him and take him out

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.020 
out the wall behind him and take him out
sure<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.979> causes<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> lot<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.640> noise<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:44.909> you

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
sure it causes a lot of noise but you

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.850 
sure it causes a lot of noise but you
can<00:01:45.180> then<00:01:45.329> zip<00:01:45.600> out<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> area<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.740> can

can then zip out of the area you can

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.620 
can then zip out of the area you can
then<00:01:46.979> come<00:01:47.159> back<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.430> about<00:01:47.549> 20<00:01:47.909> or<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.030> seconds

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
