when we get here your IT band says uh
honey<00:01:58.830> I'm<00:01:58.890> sorry<00:01:59.220> I<00:01:59.580> really<00:01:59.880> need<00:02:00.210> my<00:02:00.390> kneecap

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
because we know our knee doesn't go like

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.190 
because we know our knee doesn't go like
this<00:02:03.110> but<00:02:04.110> your<00:02:04.260> hip<00:02:04.410> can<00:02:04.620> go<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.130> so

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
this but your hip can go like that so

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.900 
this but your hip can go like that so
this<00:02:07.200> line<00:02:07.410> of<00:02:07.530> your<00:02:07.680> IT<00:02:07.770> band<00:02:07.950> might<00:02:08.760> be

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
this line of your IT band might be

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.810 
this line of your IT band might be
really<00:02:09.090> tighter<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:10.140> may<00:02:10.320> not<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.649> ready<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
really tighter just may not be ready and

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.630 
really tighter just may not be ready and
some<00:02:12.060> graph<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.540> all<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.690> way<00:02:12.840> all<00:02:13.380> right<00:02:13.640> sit

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
some graph it all the way all right sit

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.500 
some graph it all the way all right sit
on<00:02:14.670> down<00:02:16.070> now<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:17.280> we<00:02:17.370> kind<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.790> can

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
on down now that we kind of can

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.450 
on down now that we kind of can
understand<00:02:19.380> maybe<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.860> muscles<00:02:20.310> will

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
understand maybe the muscles will

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.400 
understand maybe the muscles will
memorize<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:21.240> we're<00:02:21.390> locking<00:02:21.720> our<00:02:22.020> pelvis

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
in so I'm not going to go into detail
