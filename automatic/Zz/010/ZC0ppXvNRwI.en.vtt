00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 very good at all I'm seeing guys and you 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.620
 I bring a lot of information about resident 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.420
 evil 6 since chacón has advanced apart 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.429
 his departure date has advanced in that 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.170
 is going to capture the game not as much 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.940
 people complained that just 5 was 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.220
 60 more in action than in terror and 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.800
 capcom has decided to recover a bit of 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.840
 his past what I mean with this and is 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.460
 that is not that they have repented of 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.949
 have that one more game of action than of 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.779
 terror but yes a lot of people have said 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.000
 we want you to receive again as they were 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.189
 1 and 2 in which they gave you more scares and 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.780
 well I'll tell you a little bit about this 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.160
 way we leave behind the solitude environment 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.840
 from Africa we return to a dominated environment 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.890
 by the shadows and 12 tenuous that we 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.140
 produce insecurity and unrest 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.489
 on the other hand also left side 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.500
 that feeling of playing what is not 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.510
 turning survival horror into a 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.010
 shooter we will return to those sensations of 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.379
 walk down a street or corridor at halfway 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.239
 light and shivering more so I could see 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.829
 that for what there really is already 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.420
 you know that to me for example games 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.680
 that are more psychological terror I 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.239
 they are more afraid to put a 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.030
 zombie or a ghost directly 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.530
 misfortune good here with decided the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.600
 segmentation of the first titles and 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.799
 of passage body with the user 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.119
 there are some images here that also 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.189
 the leave in the description and good will 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.110
 I tell the game is to please 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.540
 all in what way we have commented 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.759
 already already in some podcast is delivered is 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.500
 unskillful is divided into three parts the 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.570
 guided by the lion the pse kennedy and his 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.820
 companion elena harper another sitting by 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.409
 cris profile and his partner for snow and 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.149
 finally we find the jake müller and 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.470
 his partner every couple by 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.940
 star in his own story 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.590
 parallel to the others although in certain 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.750
 moments will intertwine to see it 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.690
 to see the characters interact 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.399
 with each other will have three stories 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.390
 that has revealed capcom we can 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.220
 choose in the order we want 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.259
 live them each one of them will have a 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.840
 duration somewhat lower than 3,005 but 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.490
 they, according to what I read here, will have 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.050
 in a vast the most oriented to the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.670
 action is no longer going to have more 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.530
 psychological fear and the other mix a 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.270
 little everything to see that I tell you here 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.800
 more in this way camps with invites the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.970
 faithful followers of the franchise and the 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.799
 lovers of the purest action to 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.659
 participate in this last installment half 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.159
 action half survival horror and for the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.709
 identity that you expect each other in 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.580
 evil 4 and keep your new image in 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:06.040
 view of the next delivery 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.890
 I'm sorry over here that the date of 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.780
 exit to see is 20 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.010
 it was November 20 but it has 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.900
 delayed to October 2 of this year 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.000
 They are so eager to teach us how 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.710
 we see it and good is going to be 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.090
 dominated by tension the zombies do not 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.530
 will be typical fools who 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.180
 they were there chasing you sometimes 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.100
 It is convenient that they are going to be more 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.290
 roll of forte acquires that as soon as 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.250
 they're going to keep running around and well 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.110
 that with also wants to have the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.580
 feeling that you intend to transmit 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.050
 is the terror of uncertainty 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.570
 knowing that at any time you can 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.490
 Something happens that we can not expect if 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.600
 We can not relax so guys 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.990
 truth is that I wait for this game 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.030
 pretty contrived so to speak since 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.140
 yes, it's true that the last one receives five 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.900
 in fact I'm doing with my cousin 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.360
 also play is roll plus process more 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.580
 action has almost no scares is a zombie 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.110
 in order that has nothing is what 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.120
 says that being in Africa that is all 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.500
 light and good the truth that I know already 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.810
 received is tiny because it also gives me 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.700
 fear the issue this to start in a 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.470
 all street full of cars burning 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.690
 zombies are a bit stupid but that 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.070
 I gave her fear at the time the 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.080
 typical scare that you got a bug 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.820
 through the window so things like that to me 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.510
 It scares me so I hope it impresses 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.360
 16 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.220
 but there is also this old one is 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.329
 unskillful lime like a shock I hope that 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.519
 you liked this news I am going to 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:21.040
 leave the corners of the game down here 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.900
 so you can see it more or less like bay and 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.030
 I will keep you informed of more things 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.349
 2006 so you know lake and favorite if 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.650
 you liked a hug and even the 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.650
 following
