each one of my manufacturers there so

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.920 
each one of my manufacturers there so
the<00:01:53.340> benefit<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.820> one<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.689> I'm

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
the benefit of that one is that I'm

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.600 
the benefit of that one is that I'm
going<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.320> able<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:55.649> additional<00:01:55.799> flags

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
going to be able to get additional flags

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.459 
going to be able to get additional flags
when<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.000> start<00:01:57.299> rolling<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.930> manufacture

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
when I start rolling for the manufacture

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.760 
when I start rolling for the manufacture
arms<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> 5<00:01:59.130> plus<00:01:59.340> instead<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.939> 6<00:02:00.270> plus<00:02:00.770> so

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
arms on a 5 plus instead of a 6 plus so

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.980 
arms on a 5 plus instead of a 6 plus so
I<00:02:01.799> have<00:02:02.130> 17<00:02:02.610> dice<00:02:02.820> here<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.210> all<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.689> flags

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
I have 17 dice here for all the flags

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.520 
I have 17 dice here for all the flags
combined<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.710> let's<00:02:04.920> see<00:02:05.009> how<00:02:05.070> many<00:02:05.159> 6s<00:02:05.549> and

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
combined so let's see how many 6s and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.440 
combined so let's see how many 6s and
one<00:02:07.530> fell<00:02:07.710> down<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.959> have<00:02:10.319> 1<00:02:10.920> 2<00:02:11.430> 3<00:02:11.459> 4<00:02:11.849> 5<00:02:12.810> 6

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
one fell down so I have 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.729 
one fell down so I have 1 2 3 4 5 6
all<00:02:15.450> right<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.049> because<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.379> was<00:02:16.500> able<00:02:16.709> to

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
all right so because I was able to

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.500 
all right so because I was able to
achieve<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.250> three<00:02:17.549> sixes<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.299> role

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
achieve the three sixes in that role

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.240 
achieve the three sixes in that role
there<00:02:18.720> each<00:02:18.930> one<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.290> these<00:02:19.349> manufacturers<00:02:20.069> is

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
there each one of these manufacturers is

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.039 
there each one of these manufacturers is
going<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.459> generate<00:02:20.610> extra<00:02:21.209> flags<00:02:21.480> on<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.840> roll

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
going to generate extra flags on a roll

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.039 
going to generate extra flags on a roll
of<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.230> five<00:02:22.470> plus<00:02:22.799> instead<00:02:23.189> of<00:02:23.340> six<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:25.019> I

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
of a five plus instead of six so so I

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.720 
of a five plus instead of six so so I
have<00:02:25.230> four<00:02:25.470> manufactory<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.370> I'm<00:02:26.430> gonna<00:02:26.549> get

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
have four manufactory so I'm gonna get

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.470 
have four manufactory so I'm gonna get
four<00:02:27.030> D<00:02:27.209> six<00:02:27.510> rules<00:02:27.720> on<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.019> one<00:02:28.849> and<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:30.299> got

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
four D six rules on this one and I got

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.470 
four D six rules on this one and I got
one<00:02:30.900> six<00:02:31.340> alright<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:32.519> over<00:02:32.549> here<00:02:32.970> I'm<00:02:33.180> going

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
one six alright so over here I'm going

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.599 
one six alright so over here I'm going
to<00:02:33.540> place<00:02:33.750> an<00:02:33.900> additional<00:02:34.019> flag<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:34.709> do<00:02:35.069> Sol<00:02:35.310> on

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
to place an additional flag on do Sol on

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.000 
to place an additional flag on do Sol on
the<00:02:35.959> ship<00:02:36.959> that's<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.439> shield<00:02:37.680> generator

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
the ship that's the shield generator

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.559 
the ship that's the shield generator
yeah<00:02:38.220> that's<00:02:38.609> one<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.879> the<00:02:38.939> shield<00:02:39.120> generators

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
yeah that's one of the shield generators

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.720 
yeah that's one of the shield generators
right<00:02:39.780> there

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
right there

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.619 
right there
alright<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:41.970> now<00:02:42.120> I'm<00:02:42.269> gonna<00:02:42.420> roll<00:02:42.599> some

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
alright so now I'm gonna roll some

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.360 
alright so now I'm gonna roll some
additional<00:02:43.079> dice<00:02:43.260> for<00:02:43.530> do<00:02:43.709> Sol<00:02:43.920> here<00:02:44.099> now<00:02:44.310> the

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
additional dice for do Sol here now the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.250 
additional dice for do Sol here now the
hive<00:02:44.640> city<00:02:44.909> counts<00:02:45.209> as<00:02:45.299> three<00:02:45.329> tiles<00:02:45.900> for<00:02:46.230> the

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
hive city counts as three tiles for the

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.050 
hive city counts as three tiles for the
sake<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.500> this<00:02:46.709> one<00:02:46.859> so<00:02:47.280> I'm<00:02:47.489> gonna<00:02:47.700> have<00:02:47.879> one

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
sake of this one so I'm gonna have one

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.789 
sake of this one so I'm gonna have one
existing<00:02:48.450> tile<00:02:48.659> plus<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.079> hive<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.590> I'm<00:02:49.680> gonna

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
existing tile plus the hive so I'm gonna

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:56.869 
existing tile plus the hive so I'm gonna
roll<00:02:49.980> 46<00:02:50.750> state<00:02:51.750> again<00:02:52.549> so<00:02:53.549> 46<00:02:54.120> for<00:02:54.870> do<00:02:55.109> Sol<00:02:55.879> not

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
roll 46 state again so 46 for do Sol not

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.839 
roll 46 state again so 46 for do Sol not
a<00:02:56.909> single<00:02:57.209> six<00:02:57.569> amongst<00:02:57.930> them<00:02:58.079> so<00:02:58.639> for<00:02:59.639> every

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
a single six amongst them so for every

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.759 
a single six amongst them so for every
planet<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:00.299> own<00:03:00.569> a<00:03:00.599> spaceport<00:03:01.079> on<00:03:01.470> I'm

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
planet that I own a spaceport on I'm

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.589 
planet that I own a spaceport on I'm
actually<00:03:02.010> allowed<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.430> move<00:03:02.790> one<00:03:03.150> flag<00:03:03.450> from

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
actually allowed to move one flag from

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.629 
actually allowed to move one flag from
that<00:03:03.780> planet<00:03:04.139> to<00:03:04.379> pretty<00:03:04.920> much<00:03:05.069> anywhere<00:03:05.370> else

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
that planet to pretty much anywhere else

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.819 
that planet to pretty much anywhere else
that's<00:03:05.909> unoccupied<00:03:06.319> so<00:03:07.319> I'm<00:03:07.500> actually<00:03:07.620> gonna

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
that's unoccupied so I'm actually gonna

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.099 
that's unoccupied so I'm actually gonna
pull<00:03:08.069> one<00:03:08.099> off<00:03:08.459> of<00:03:08.700> finet<00:03:09.030> right<00:03:09.239> here<00:03:09.480> because

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
pull one off of finet right here because

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.440 
pull one off of finet right here because
there's<00:03:10.379> a<00:03:10.530> pretty<00:03:10.799> strong<00:03:11.189> ad<00:03:11.609> mech<00:03:11.939> presence

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
there's a pretty strong ad mech presence

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.429 
there's a pretty strong ad mech presence
here<00:03:13.879> take<00:03:14.879> it<00:03:15.000> off<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.150> different<00:03:15.269> one<00:03:15.480> any<00:03:16.349> one

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
here we're gonna place it on the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.780 
here we're gonna place it on the
spaceport<00:03:23.849> on<00:03:24.569> that<00:03:25.530> wonderful<00:03:26.220> planet<00:03:26.549> with

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
spaceport on that wonderful planet with

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.569 
spaceport on that wonderful planet with
the<00:03:26.879> annihilation<00:03:27.389> device<00:03:28.250> now<00:03:29.250> this<00:03:29.400> one<00:03:29.549> I

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
the annihilation device now this one I

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.309 
the annihilation device now this one I
do<00:03:29.699> also<00:03:30.000> have<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.299> spaceport<00:03:30.659> on<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:31.019> as<00:03:31.109> well

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
do also have a spaceport on it as well

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.530 
do also have a spaceport on it as well
in<00:03:31.709> this<00:03:32.340> particular<00:03:32.519> case<00:03:33.060> there's<00:03:33.389> not

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
in this particular case there's not

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.289 
in this particular case there's not
really<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.900> whole<00:03:34.260> lot<00:03:34.799> of<00:03:34.829> places<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:35.879> want

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
really a whole lot of places that I want

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.509 
really a whole lot of places that I want
to<00:03:36.419> go<00:03:36.540> maybe<00:03:36.750> just<00:03:36.989> reinforce<00:03:37.500> do<00:03:37.769> Sol<00:03:38.010> so
