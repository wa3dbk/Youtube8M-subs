over<00:01:45.630> there<00:01:45.920> basically<00:01:47.270> this<00:01:48.270> park<00:01:48.659> part<00:01:48.930> 1<00:01:49.200> i

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
over there basically this park part 1 i

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.679 
over there basically this park part 1 i

this gun actually does a little bit more
damage<00:01:59.170> than<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.440> other<00:01:59.560> sniper<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.130> it

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
you know the robustness of the T energy

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.070 
you know the robustness of the T energy
I<00:02:19.270> actually<00:02:20.260> don't<00:02:20.860> run<00:02:21.760> out<00:02:21.880> of<00:02:21.910> T<00:02:22.690> energy

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
while doing it so I basically stand in

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.540

this<00:02:25.390> one<00:02:25.570> spot<00:02:25.600> using<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:26.650> one<00:02:27.100> weapon

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
this one spot using this one weapon

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.420 
this one spot using this one weapon
getting<00:02:28.180> shot<00:02:28.570> at<00:02:29.130> eating<00:02:30.130> up<00:02:30.250> t<00:02:30.640> energy<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.270> I

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
getting shot at eating up t energy and I

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.030 
getting shot at eating up t energy and I
still<00:02:33.430> sustain<00:02:33.790> through<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.239> um<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:35.470> did<00:02:35.890> do<00:02:36.010> a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
still sustain through it um I did do a

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.830 
still sustain through it um I did do a
little<00:02:36.250> bit<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.430> running<00:02:36.700> here<00:02:36.970> on<00:02:37.150> on<00:02:37.660> the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
little bit of running here on on the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.770 
little bit of running here on on the

see<00:04:04.830> here<00:04:04.980> when<00:04:05.130> I<00:04:05.160> do<00:04:05.280> get<00:04:05.580> my<00:04:06.060> life<00:04:06.989> gauge<00:04:07.470> is

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
see here when I do get my life gauge is

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.979 
see here when I do get my life gauge is
knocked<00:04:07.950> down<00:04:08.150> actually<00:04:09.150> refill<00:04:09.690> very

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
knocked down actually refill very

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.080 
knocked down actually refill very
quickly<00:04:10.290> that's<00:04:10.980> not<00:04:11.220> part<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.610> update

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
quickly that's not part of the update

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.710 
quickly that's not part of the update
that<00:04:12.299> actually<00:04:12.690> is<00:04:12.870> another<00:04:13.380> perk<00:04:14.360> not<00:04:15.360> a<00:04:15.390> perk

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
that actually is another perk not a perk

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.830 
that actually is another perk not a perk
an<00:04:16.580> ability<00:04:17.580> that<00:04:17.790> I<00:04:18.060> unlocked<00:04:18.419> when<00:04:18.540> I<00:04:18.660> reach

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
an ability that I unlocked when I reach

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.080 
an ability that I unlocked when I reach
level<00:04:19.169> i<00:04:19.350> think<00:04:20.280> it<00:04:20.340> was<00:04:20.400> around<00:04:20.519> level<00:04:20.850> 30

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
level i think it was around level 30

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.900 
level i think it was around level 30
level<00:04:21.180> 28<00:04:21.840> or<00:04:22.049> something<00:04:22.290> like<00:04:22.380> that<00:04:22.440> i

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
level 28 or something like that i

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.130 
level 28 or something like that i
basically<00:04:26.030> causes<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.240> to<00:04:27.419> replenish<00:04:27.840> your

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
tea energy twice the speed as normal so

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.350 
tea energy twice the speed as normal so

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.130 
damned I think the AI died maybe once or
twice<00:05:23.080> but<00:05:23.440> as<00:05:23.560> you<00:05:23.620> can<00:05:23.740> see<00:05:23.890> here<00:05:24.040> I<00:05:24.570> I<00:05:25.570> never

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
thought I barely even left the spot that

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.200 
thought I barely even left the spot that
I'm<00:05:28.270> and<00:05:28.450> I<00:05:28.480> just<00:05:28.660> take<00:05:28.810> this<00:05:28.930> point<00:05:29.320> and<00:05:30.210> wreck

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
I'm and I just take this point and wreck

this shit in fact I believe I beat this
part<00:05:34.000> so<00:05:34.390> quickly<00:05:34.870> that<00:05:35.080> there's<00:05:35.620> a<00:05:35.710> large

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
part so quickly that there's a large

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.490 
part so quickly that there's a large
delay<00:05:36.400> before<00:05:36.610> it<00:05:36.880> actually<00:05:36.970> gives<00:05:37.360> you<00:05:37.600> the

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
delay before it actually gives you the

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.930 
delay before it actually gives you the
the<00:05:38.830> next<00:05:39.070> part<00:05:39.280> of<00:05:39.400> the<00:05:39.460> mission<00:05:39.610> where<00:05:39.880> the

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
the next part of the mission where the

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.370 
the next part of the mission where the
trains<00:05:40.210> have<00:05:40.390> to<00:05:40.510> come<00:05:40.690> together<00:05:40.870> that's<00:05:41.260> how

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
trains have to come together that's how

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.890
