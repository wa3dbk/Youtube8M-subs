making<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.240> game<00:01:42.420> don't<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.810> worry<00:01:43.290> about<00:01:43.380> it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
making the game don't you worry about it

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.030 
making the game don't you worry about it
until<00:01:44.460> then<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.590> first<00:01:46.590> things<00:01:46.740> first<00:01:46.770> let's

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
until then so first things first let's

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.590 
until then so first things first let's
go<00:01:47.220> get<00:01:47.430> our<00:01:47.549> NDK<00:01:48.000> directory<00:01:48.479> after

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
go get our NDK directory after

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.999 
go get our NDK directory after
extracting<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.380> don't<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.619> anything<00:01:49.829> else

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
extracting you don't do anything else

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.039 
extracting you don't do anything else
just<00:01:50.399> extract<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.540> copy<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.990> link

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
just extract it and just copy the link

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.380 
just extract it and just copy the link
then<00:01:52.890> let's<00:01:53.159> go<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.369> our<00:01:53.399> game<00:01:53.850> was<00:01:54.119> set<00:01:54.360> up

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
then let's go to our game was set up

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.090 
then let's go to our game was set up
India<00:01:54.750> SDK<00:01:55.530> for<00:01:55.670> go<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.729> file<00:01:57.210> preferences

India SDK for go to file preferences

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.039 
India SDK for go to file preferences
then<00:01:59.100> select<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.759> Android<00:02:00.210> tab<00:02:00.450> all<00:02:00.930> right

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
then select the Android tab all right

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.770 
then select the Android tab all right
now<00:02:01.380> are<00:02:01.680> set<00:02:01.950> Android<00:02:02.430> NDK<00:02:02.640> location<00:02:03.630> never

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
now are set Android NDK location never

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.620 
now are set Android NDK location never
got<00:02:03.960> mine<00:02:04.200> pasted<00:02:04.649> there<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:05.490> pay<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> pasty

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
got mine pasted there just pay a pasty

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.869 
got mine pasted there just pay a pasty
directory<00:02:07.110> there<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.619> then<00:02:08.250> now<00:02:08.489> it's<00:02:08.729> going

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
directory there and then now it's going

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.389 
directory there and then now it's going
to<00:02:08.970> get<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
to get the

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.009 
to get the
DK<00:02:09.670> sit<00:02:09.879> up<00:02:10.000> alright<00:02:10.390> some<00:02:10.539> good<00:02:10.689> and<00:02:10.899> just

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
DK sit up alright some good and just

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.600 
DK sit up alright some good and just
puts<00:02:11.439> us<00:02:11.530> off<00:02:11.680> again<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.040> minimize<00:02:12.370> it

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
puts us off again and minimize it

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.759 
puts us off again and minimize it
alright<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:13.599> now<00:02:13.720> we<00:02:13.780> have<00:02:13.900> an<00:02:14.049> indie<00:02:14.319> calc<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
alright so now we have an indie calc the

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.190 
alright so now we have an indie calc the
way<00:02:14.860> let's<00:02:15.040> go<00:02:15.129> into<00:02:15.310> rest<00:02:15.579> SDK<00:02:16.860> alright<00:02:18.060> so

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
way let's go into rest SDK alright so

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.280 
way let's go into rest SDK alright so
look<00:02:20.200> at<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:20.349> again<00:02:20.909> mmm<00:02:21.939> and<00:02:22.659> about<00:02:23.110> try<00:02:23.230> to

look at that again mmm and about try to

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.640 
look at that again mmm and about try to
remind<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.739> guys<00:02:23.799> you<00:02:24.459> will<00:02:24.579> need<00:02:24.760> Java

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
remind you guys you will need Java

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.520 
remind you guys you will need Java
to<00:02:26.650> actually<00:02:27.069> export<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.909> export<00:02:28.629> as<00:02:28.840> well<00:02:28.989> so

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
to actually export to export as well so

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.860 
to actually export to export as well so
now<00:02:29.769> let's<00:02:30.010> get<00:02:30.099> our<00:02:30.280> SDK<00:02:30.879> set<00:02:31.150> up<00:02:31.269> so<00:02:31.540> go<00:02:31.689> to

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
now let's get our SDK set up so go to

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.610 
now let's get our SDK set up so go to
our<00:02:31.900> where<00:02:32.709> we<00:02:32.890> extracted<00:02:33.430> our<00:02:33.640> SDK<00:02:34.620> ADT

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
our where we extracted our SDK ADT

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.559 
our where we extracted our SDK ADT
bottle<00:02:35.890> right<00:02:36.010> here<00:02:36.250> good<00:02:37.180> wherever<00:02:37.420> you

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
bottle right here good wherever you

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.190 
bottle right here good wherever you
extracted<00:02:38.109> it<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.409> lunch<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:38.950> SDK<00:02:39.459> manager

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
extracted it and lunch the SDK manager

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.229 
extracted it and lunch the SDK manager
you<00:02:41.200> gotta<00:02:41.409> run<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:44.159> now<00:02:45.159> it'll<00:02:45.670> take<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:45.970> little

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
you gotta run it now it'll take a little

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.210 
you gotta run it now it'll take a little
while<00:02:46.389> for<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.049> actually<00:02:47.409> start<00:02:47.920> off<00:02:48.040> so

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
while for it to actually start off so

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.720 
while for it to actually start off so
give<00:02:48.459> it<00:02:48.489> a<00:02:48.609> few<00:02:48.760> moments<00:02:48.879> guys<00:02:50.400> alright<00:02:51.400> so

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
give it a few moments guys alright so

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.030 
give it a few moments guys alright so
once<00:02:52.000> starts<00:02:52.329> up<00:02:52.569> you<00:02:53.409> should<00:02:53.709> get<00:02:53.829> a<00:02:53.889> screen

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
once starts up you should get a screen

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.580 
once starts up you should get a screen
like<00:02:54.459> this<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:54.970> forgot<00:02:55.659> everything<00:02:55.780> installed

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
like this I forgot everything installed

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.360 
like this I forgot everything installed
so<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.280> recommend<00:02:58.239> just<00:02:58.420> for<00:02:58.959> security<00:02:59.889> start

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
so I recommend just for security start

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.210 
so I recommend just for security start
up<00:03:00.840> for<00:03:01.840> make<00:03:02.079> sure<00:03:02.349> your<00:03:02.500> API<00:03:02.739> doesn't<00:03:03.010> dirt

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
up for make sure your API doesn't dirt

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.690 
up for make sure your API doesn't dirt
out<00:03:03.459> installing<00:03:04.450> every<00:03:05.379> single<00:03:06.250> one<00:03:06.459> of<00:03:06.519> these

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
out installing every single one of these

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.330 
out installing every single one of these
files<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:07.900> I'm<00:03:08.650> just<00:03:08.769> gonna<00:03:08.889> minimize<00:03:09.099> all

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
files so I'm just gonna minimize all

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.160 
files so I'm just gonna minimize all
this<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.970> way<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.090> do<00:03:10.209> that<00:03:10.329> is<00:03:10.540> just<00:03:10.750> check

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
this the way to do that is just check

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.949 
this the way to do that is just check
mark<00:03:11.379> check<00:03:11.739> mark<00:03:11.980> all<00:03:12.189> of<00:03:12.489> these<00:03:12.670> foxes<00:03:13.090> so

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
mark check mark all of these foxes so

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.629 
mark check mark all of these foxes so
once<00:03:14.199> the<00:03:14.379> water<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.769> end<00:03:14.980> this<00:03:15.069> go<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.310> install

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
once the water to end this go to install

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.400 
once the water to end this go to install
packages<00:03:15.819> and<00:03:16.239> solve<00:03:16.599> every<00:03:17.139> one<00:03:17.290> of<00:03:17.319> the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
packages and solve every one of the

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.229 
packages and solve every one of the
packages<00:03:17.799> which<00:03:18.190> accepted<00:03:18.579> licenses<00:03:19.120> and

packages which accepted licenses and

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.059 
packages which accepted licenses and
everything<00:03:19.599> then<00:03:19.810> just<00:03:20.019> install<00:03:20.290> them<00:03:20.620> it

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
everything then just install them it

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.000 
everything then just install them it
will<00:03:21.489> take<00:03:21.760> an<00:03:21.940> extremely<00:03:22.569> long<00:03:22.810> time<00:03:23.139> it<00:03:23.500> took

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
will take an extremely long time it took

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.250 
will take an extremely long time it took
a<00:03:24.340> total<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:24.819> like<00:03:24.909> six<00:03:25.359> hours<00:03:25.510> for<00:03:26.109> me<00:03:26.230> to

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
a total of like six hours for me to

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.680 
a total of like six hours for me to
install<00:03:26.650> everything<00:03:26.769> but<00:03:27.669> this<00:03:27.879> wall<00:03:28.449> so<00:03:28.599> make

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
install everything but this wall so make

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.149 
install everything but this wall so make
sure<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:28.870> have<00:03:28.959> access<00:03:29.169> to<00:03:29.409> everything<00:03:29.829> for

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
sure you have access to everything for

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.920 
sure you have access to everything for
the<00:03:30.250> SDK<00:03:30.579> so<00:03:30.819> just<00:03:31.299> make<00:03:31.419> sure<00:03:31.540> you<00:03:31.659> do<00:03:31.750> that

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
the SDK so just make sure you do that

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.839 
the SDK so just make sure you do that
now<00:03:32.560> after<00:03:32.829> installing<00:03:33.159> after<00:03:33.430> doing<00:03:33.669> that

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
now after installing after doing that

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.050 
now after installing after doing that
you<00:03:34.569> will<00:03:34.690> get<00:03:34.900> air<00:03:35.230> go<00:03:35.500> inside<00:03:35.739> your<00:03:35.859> SDK<00:03:36.280> SDK

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
you will get air go inside your SDK SDK
