actually feels completely amazing okay
then<00:01:41.729> we're<00:01:42.479> gonna<00:01:42.600> take<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.049> up<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.350> this

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
then we're gonna take it up like this

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.920 
then we're gonna take it up like this
and<00:01:43.950> come<00:01:44.759> across<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.240> shoulder<00:01:45.570> now<00:01:45.750> it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
and come across the shoulder now it

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.600 
and come across the shoulder now it
would<00:01:46.049> obviously<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.560> easier<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
would obviously be easier to do in the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.429 
would obviously be easier to do in the
shower<00:01:47.790> where<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> don't<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> shirt<00:01:49.200> on

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
shower where I don't have a shirt on

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.620 
shower where I don't have a shirt on
here<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:49.979> you're<00:01:50.820> gonna<00:01:50.939> come<00:01:51.149> across<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
here but you're gonna come across the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.569 
here but you're gonna come across the
angle<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.110> PEC<00:01:52.350> then<00:01:53.070> you're<00:01:53.220> gonna<00:01:53.340> take

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
angle of the PEC then you're gonna take

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.510 
angle of the PEC then you're gonna take
it<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.880> go<00:01:53.939> down<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.320> bicep<00:01:55.320> down<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
it and go down the bicep down the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.179 
it and go down the bicep down the
forearm<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.210> then<00:01:57.930> all<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.649> way<00:01:58.740> into<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
forearm and then all the way into the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.469 
forearm and then all the way into the
hand<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.579> that's<00:01:59.640> where<00:01:59.880> these<00:02:00.030> little<00:02:00.299> claws

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
hand and that's where these little claws

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.719 
hand and that's where these little claws
really<00:02:01.469> come<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.829> handy<00:02:01.860> because<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.460> can

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
really come in handy because you can

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.880 
really come in handy because you can
scrub<00:02:03.090> them<00:02:03.240> right<00:02:04.110> through<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.469> hand<00:02:04.710> you

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
scrub them right through the hand you

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.190 
scrub them right through the hand you
then<00:02:05.460> all<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> way<00:02:05.909> up<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.540> you're<00:02:06.990> gonna<00:02:07.079> do

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
then all the way up and you're gonna do

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.389 
then all the way up and you're gonna do
the<00:02:07.290> exact<00:02:07.530> same<00:02:07.740> thing<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.190> other<00:02:08.220> side

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the exact same thing on the other side

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.900 
the exact same thing on the other side
and<00:02:08.970> when<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.270> get<00:02:09.390> done<00:02:09.629> reach<00:02:10.140> as

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
and when you get done reach as

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.270 
and when you get done reach as
that<00:02:11.480> range<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:12.050> motion<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.710> feel<00:02:12.950> how<00:02:13.130> much

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
that range of motion and feel how much

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.470 
that range of motion and feel how much
easier<00:02:13.520> it<00:02:13.850> is<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.650> let<00:02:15.650> your<00:02:15.800> shoulders<00:02:16.480> just

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
easier it is to let your shoulders just

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.080 
easier it is to let your shoulders just
sit<00:02:17.870> where<00:02:18.590> they're<00:02:18.770> supposed<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.250> tighten

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
sit where they're supposed to tighten

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.290 
sit where they're supposed to tighten
your<00:02:20.120> abs<00:02:20.980> just<00:02:21.980> press<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.430> scapula<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.090> just

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
your abs just press the scapula and just

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.360 
your abs just press the scapula and just
let<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.720> shoulders<00:02:24.140> be<00:02:24.860> back<00:02:25.040> where<00:02:25.250> they're

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
let the shoulders be back where they're

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.940 
let the shoulders be back where they're
supposed<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.730> live
