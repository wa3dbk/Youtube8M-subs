better<00:03:48.860> just<00:03:49.130> follow<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.209> signal<00:03:50.510> to<00:03:50.630> your

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
better just follow the signal to your

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.800 
better just follow the signal to your

target and this signal looks just like

stop staring at me you're prettier than

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.970 
stop staring at me you're prettier than
that<00:04:36.710> ghost<00:04:37.130> go<00:04:37.490> down<00:04:37.640> with<00:04:37.790> Ray
