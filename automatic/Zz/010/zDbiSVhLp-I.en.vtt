to get pushed home and my whole entire
life<00:00:45.120> changed<00:00:45.690> because<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.559> realized<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.190> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
life changed because I realized that the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.799 
life changed because I realized that the
brain<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.520> my<00:00:47.820> wheelchair<00:00:48.000> was<00:00:48.420> completely

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
brain of my wheelchair was completely

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.869 
brain of my wheelchair was completely
broken<00:00:49.050> which<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:50.010> 10<00:00:50.399> year<00:00:50.550> old<00:00:50.700> wheelchair

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
broken which is a 10 year old wheelchair

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.200 
broken which is a 10 year old wheelchair
so<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.510> makes<00:00:51.660> sense<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:53.820> everything

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
so that makes sense and then everything

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.689 
so that makes sense and then everything
in<00:00:54.390> my<00:00:54.510> van<00:00:54.750> broke<00:00:55.110> but<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.250> real<00:00:56.460> problem

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.330 
in my van broke but the real problem
came<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.360> next<00:00:57.510> day<00:00:57.660> when<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.199> had<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.920> rent<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
came the next day when I had to rent a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.510 
came the next day when I had to rent a
wheelchair<00:00:59.550> I<00:01:00.320> couldn't<00:01:01.320> find<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.980> fit

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
wheelchair I couldn't find one that fit

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.160 
wheelchair I couldn't find one that fit
me<00:01:02.670> because<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.420> only<00:01:03.690> one<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.049> was

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
me because the only one that was

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.469 
me because the only one that was
available<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:05.760> for<00:01:06.000> somebody<00:01:06.360> that's

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
available was one for somebody that's

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.950 
available was one for somebody that's
350<00:01:07.140> pounds<00:01:07.650> that's<00:01:08.310> not<00:01:08.460> me<00:01:08.610> I'm<00:01:09.119> 95<00:01:09.600> pounds
