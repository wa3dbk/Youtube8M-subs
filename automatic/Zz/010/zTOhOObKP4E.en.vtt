00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
which means we have a 7-inch device with

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.190 
which means we have a 7-inch device with
a<00:00:08.340> little<00:00:08.639> bit<00:00:08.760> lighter<00:00:09.000> specs<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.690> then<00:00:10.050> we

was<00:00:12.480> announced<00:00:12.750> last<00:00:12.900> year<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.469> can<00:00:13.650> show

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
was announced last year and I can show

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.620 
was announced last year and I can show
you<00:00:13.889> both<00:00:14.429> devices<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.120> right<00:00:15.269> next<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.509> each

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
you both devices and right next to each

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.450 
you both devices and right next to each
other<00:00:15.719> where<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:15.990> can<00:00:16.139> see<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.590> device

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
other where you can see that the device

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.609 
other where you can see that the device
on<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.150> right<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.720> regular<00:00:18.960> seven<00:00:19.470> and

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
on the right is the regular seven and

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.140 
on the right is the regular seven and
the<00:00:19.710> device<00:00:19.949> on<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.160> left<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> light<00:00:20.730> you

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
the device on the left is a light you

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.849 
the device on the left is a light you
can<00:00:21.270> see<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.750> screen<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.380> same<00:00:22.590> size

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
can see that the screen is the same size

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.590 
can see that the screen is the same size
but<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.160> device<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> left<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> little

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
but the device on the left is a little

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.599 
but the device on the left is a little
bit<00:00:24.689> bigger<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.769> was<00:00:25.890> probably<00:00:26.099> cheaper<00:00:26.460> to

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
bit bigger so it was probably cheaper to

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.650 
bit bigger so it was probably cheaper to
build<00:00:26.760> for<00:00:27.740> samsung<00:00:28.740> since<00:00:29.240> they<00:00:30.240> had<00:00:30.420> more

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
build for samsung since they had more

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.900 
build for samsung since they had more
space<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:31.590> still<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> battery<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.579> actually

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
space but still the battery is actually

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.870 
space but still the battery is actually
smaller<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.920> light<00:00:35.100> one<00:00:35.340> here<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.700> box

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
smaller in the light one here in the box

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.310 
smaller in the light one here in the box
on<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.059> left<00:00:36.210> hand<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> regular<00:00:37.079> one<00:00:37.200> if

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
on the left hand and the regular one if

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.600 
on the left hand and the regular one if
you<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.559> compare<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.950> specs<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.280> can<00:00:38.430> see

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
you just compare the specs you can see

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.310 
you just compare the specs you can see
here<00:00:38.879> four<00:00:39.390> thousand<00:00:39.840> against<00:00:40.079> three<00:00:40.290> a

what<00:00:55.920> stands<00:00:56.250> out<00:00:56.430> here<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.000> even<00:00:57.719> though<00:00:57.780> both

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
what stands out here is even though both

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.689 
what stands out here is even though both
have<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> same<00:00:58.379> as<00:00:58.800> screen<00:00:59.160> size<00:00:59.430> and

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
have the same as screen size and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.910 
have the same as screen size and
resolution<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.600> quality<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.350> screen<00:01:01.559> if

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
resolution the quality of the screen if

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.160 
resolution the quality of the screen if
you<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.190> look<00:01:02.460> at<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.609> from<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> side<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.420> not

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
you just look at it from the side is not

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.350 
you just look at it from the side is not
dead<00:01:04.439> great<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.920> gets<00:01:05.129> dark<00:01:05.400> quite<00:01:05.700> fast<00:01:06.000> and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
dead great it gets dark quite fast and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.120 
dead great it gets dark quite fast and
two<00:01:06.479> colors<00:01:06.869> change<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:08.010> look

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
two colors change and if you just look

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.100 
two colors change and if you just look
at<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> regular<00:01:08.520> one<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:09.510> can<00:01:09.659> see<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.930> also

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
at the regular one we can see that also

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.679 
at the regular one we can see that also
from<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> side<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:11.070> looks<00:01:11.310> quite<00:01:11.640> good<00:01:11.700> since

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
from the side it looks quite good since

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.340 
from the side it looks quite good since
we<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:12.900> probably<00:01:13.380> IPS<00:01:13.890> technology<00:01:14.240> inside

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
we have probably IPS technology inside

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.140 
we have probably IPS technology inside
so<00:01:16.350> otherwise<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.159> micro<00:01:17.670> SD<00:01:17.880> card

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
so otherwise we have to micro SD card

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.630 
so otherwise we have to micro SD card
slot<00:01:18.210> here<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.930> side<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.070> samsung
