always been my big problem with my
Maybelline<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.210> code<00:02:07.690> girls<00:02:08.019> stuff<00:02:08.379> that

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
Maybelline and code girls stuff that

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.550 
Maybelline and code girls stuff that
they<00:02:08.890> don't<00:02:09.129> really<00:02:09.340> have<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.640> coverage<00:02:10.149> and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
they don't really have the coverage and

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.539 
they don't really have the coverage and
I<00:02:11.560> mean<00:02:12.360> coverage<00:02:13.360> because<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:13.840> have<00:02:14.549> acne

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
I mean coverage because I have acne

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.430 
I mean coverage because I have acne
scars<00:02:15.849> because<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.510> have<00:02:16.689> acne

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
scars because I have acne

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.920 
scars because I have acne
and<00:02:18.070> when<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.220> break<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.670> hope<00:02:18.820> you<00:02:19.720> know<00:02:19.900> I

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
and when I break the hope you know I

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.390 
and when I break the hope you know I
don't<00:02:20.260> have<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.470> do<00:02:20.590> anything<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:21.160> them<00:02:21.280> to

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
don't have to do anything to them to

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.430 
don't have to do anything to them to
just<00:02:21.580> treat<00:02:21.850> them<00:02:21.940> with<00:02:22.120> medication<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.080> they

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
just treat them with medication and they

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.390 
just treat them with medication and they
still<00:02:23.800> leave<00:02:24.580> scars<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.860> I've<00:02:26.980> been<00:02:27.130> working

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
still leave scars and I've been working

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
on getting those getting them cleared up

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.040 
on getting those getting them cleared up
in<00:02:30.430> there<00:02:30.520> actually<00:02:30.910> clearing<00:02:31.210> up<00:02:31.390> because

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
in there actually clearing up because

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.360 
in there actually clearing up because
the<00:02:32.170> while<00:02:32.320> ago<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:32.590> had<00:02:32.710> broke<00:02:32.950> out<00:02:33.100> a<00:02:33.130> really

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
the while ago I had broke out a really

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.600 
the while ago I had broke out a really
bad<00:02:33.610> like<00:02:33.940> probably<00:02:34.270> an<00:02:34.480> hi<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:35.680> is<00:02:35.740> June<00:02:36.250> so

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
bad like probably an hi this is June so

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.060 
bad like probably an hi this is June so
this<00:02:36.730> was<00:02:36.910> like<00:02:37.030> in<00:02:37.210> September<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:37.960> think

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
this was like in September I think

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.400 
this was like in September I think
August<00:02:39.070> September<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.880> broke<00:02:40.840> out<00:02:41.020> really

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
August September I broke out really

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.010 
August September I broke out really
really<00:02:41.650> bad<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:43.000> don't<00:02:43.120> know<00:02:43.480> what<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.900> was

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
really bad and I don't know what it was

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.900 
really bad and I don't know what it was
from<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.380> think<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.650> was<00:02:44.710> because<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.340> tried<00:02:45.760> to

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
from I think it was because I I tried to

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.190 
from I think it was because I I tried to
change<00:02:46.260> my<00:02:47.260> whole<00:02:47.500> skin<00:02:48.010> care<00:02:48.280> regimen<00:02:48.840> all<00:02:49.840> at

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
change my whole skin care regimen all at

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.500 
change my whole skin care regimen all at
one<00:02:50.440> time<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:51.790> think<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.120> was<00:02:52.240> just<00:02:52.390> too

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
one time and I think it was just too

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.630 
one time and I think it was just too
much<00:02:52.720> for<00:02:52.900> my<00:02:53.020> skin<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.650> it's<00:02:54.130> working<00:02:54.430> out

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
much for my skin and it's working out

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.810 
much for my skin and it's working out
bad<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:55.900> had<00:02:55.930> spots<00:02:56.500> like<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.280> had<00:02:57.580> pimples

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
bad so I had spots like I had pimples

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.030 
bad so I had spots like I had pimples
all<00:02:58.120> over<00:02:58.180> my<00:02:58.540> face<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.930> was<00:02:59.050> terrible

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
all over my face it was terrible

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.510 
all over my face it was terrible
it's<00:03:00.850> Haribo<00:03:01.810> but<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.920> only<00:03:03.100> good<00:03:03.310> thing

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
it's Haribo but the only good thing

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.550 
it's Haribo but the only good thing
about<00:03:03.550> it<00:03:03.820> was<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.270> was<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.870> same<00:03:05.200> time

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
about it was that it was the same time

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.430 
about it was that it was the same time
that<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:06.160> was<00:03:06.250> starting<00:03:06.580> my<00:03:07.440> esthetician

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
that I was starting my esthetician

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.300 
that I was starting my esthetician
classes<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.960> we<00:03:10.960> were<00:03:11.140> getting<00:03:11.380> facials<00:03:11.770> like

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
classes and we were getting facials like

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.680 
classes and we were getting facials like
once<00:03:12.550> a<00:03:12.670> week<00:03:12.700> because<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.180> know<00:03:13.330> we<00:03:13.450> had<00:03:13.570> to

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
once a week because you know we had to

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.420 
once a week because you know we had to
practice<00:03:14.020> on<00:03:14.140> each<00:03:14.260> other<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.070> was<00:03:15.220> getting

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
practice on each other so I was getting

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.340 
practice on each other so I was getting
a<00:03:15.550> facial<00:03:15.760> once<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.270> week<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.540> I<00:03:16.600> always<00:03:17.080> get

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
a facial once a week and I always get

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.550 
a facial once a week and I always get
our<00:03:17.920> acne<00:03:18.460> facial<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.870> so<00:03:20.020> that's<00:03:20.260> kind<00:03:20.500> of

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
our acne facial and so that's kind of

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.350 
our acne facial and so that's kind of
really<00:03:20.740> what<00:03:20.860> helped<00:03:21.190> cleared<00:03:21.459> up<00:03:21.640> clear<00:03:22.240> up

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
really what helped cleared up clear up

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.540 
really what helped cleared up clear up
my<00:03:22.480> skin<00:03:22.810> was<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:23.890> facial<00:03:25.950> so<00:03:26.950> then<00:03:27.130> just<00:03:27.370> let

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
my skin was that facial so then just let

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.980 
my skin was that facial so then just let
you<00:03:27.670> know<00:03:27.700> that<00:03:27.850> take<00:03:28.240> actually<00:03:28.630> taken<00:03:28.840> care

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990

of skin and do what you need to do to it

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.520 
of skin and do what you need to do to it
does<00:03:30.940> work<00:03:31.240> because<00:03:31.540> that<00:03:31.660> cleared<00:03:32.110> my<00:03:32.260> skin

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530
