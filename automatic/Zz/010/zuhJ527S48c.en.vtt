00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
hey this is Steve attacker.com building

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.160 
hey this is Steve attacker.com building
and<00:00:04.560> remodeling<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:05.580> just<00:00:06.509> wanted<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.810> show<00:00:07.109> you

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
and remodeling I just wanted to show you

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.600 
and remodeling I just wanted to show you
how<00:00:07.529> you<00:00:07.589> can<00:00:08.360> build<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.570> mantle<00:00:10.170> if<00:00:11.130> you've<00:00:11.370> got

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
how you can build a mantle if you've got

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.850 
how you can build a mantle if you've got
some<00:00:12.210> trim<00:00:12.509> pieces<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:13.110> work<00:00:13.290> with

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
some trim pieces to work with

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.109 
some trim pieces to work with
I<00:00:14.690> think<00:00:15.690> designed<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.800> mantle<00:00:17.310> completely

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
I think designed the mantle completely

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.290 
I think designed the mantle completely
in<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.420> beginning<00:00:18.900> but<00:00:19.619> if<00:00:20.550> you've<00:00:20.730> seen<00:00:21.029> some

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
in the beginning but if you've seen some

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.490 
in the beginning but if you've seen some
of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.480> other<00:00:21.630> work<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:21.930> we've<00:00:22.470> done

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
of the other work that we've done

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.310 
of the other work that we've done
through<00:00:23.310> here<00:00:24.320> they're<00:00:26.359> sabar<00:00:27.359> our<00:00:28.109> wings

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
through here they're sabar our wings

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.069 
through here they're sabar our wings
cutting<00:00:29.240> material<00:00:31.369> columns<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.870> with<00:00:33.870> all

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
cutting material columns and with all

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.069 
cutting material columns and with all
that<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:35.329> have<00:00:36.329> some<00:00:36.630> trim<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.079> work<00:00:37.260> with<00:00:37.700> so<00:00:39.079> in

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
that I have some trim to work with so in

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.040 
that I have some trim to work with so in
Mantle's<00:00:40.790> whether<00:00:41.790> they're<00:00:42.090> being<00:00:42.300> built<00:00:42.629> out

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
Mantle's whether they're being built out

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.900 
Mantle's whether they're being built out
or<00:00:43.860> close<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.969> surfaces<00:00:45.860> a<00:00:46.860> box<00:00:47.430> needs<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
or close to the surfaces a box needs to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.250 
or close to the surfaces a box needs to
be<00:00:48.000> made<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:49.190> this<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.760> miter<00:00:51.059> piece<00:00:51.809> of

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
be made so this is just a miter piece of

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.000 
be made so this is just a miter piece of
cherry<00:00:52.649> they're<00:00:52.949> another<00:00:54.199> box<00:00:55.199> are<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.680> shape

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
cherry they're another box are you shape

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.619 
cherry they're another box are you shape
here<00:00:56.840> here<00:00:57.840> I'm<00:00:58.020> using<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.829> baseboard<00:00:59.629> that

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
here here I'm using the baseboard that

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.429 
here here I'm using the baseboard that
is<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.219> be<00:01:02.430> used<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> other<00:01:03.750> area<00:01:04.229> so

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
is going to be used in the other area so

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.560 
is going to be used in the other area so
we're<00:01:05.129> also<00:01:05.309> thinking<00:01:05.610> about<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.360> do

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
we're also thinking about what to do

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.920 
we're also thinking about what to do
this<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.290> top<00:01:07.680> rail<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:09.330> wings<00:01:09.510> kind

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
this is the top rail of the wings kind

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.840 
this is the top rail of the wings kind
so<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.979> had<00:01:11.070> two<00:01:11.310> options<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:12.240> trimming<00:01:12.630> this

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
so I had two options for trimming this

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.270 
so I had two options for trimming this
one<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.750> initial<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.530> was<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.070> use

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
one the initial one I was going to use

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.010 
one the initial one I was going to use
this<00:01:17.460> trend<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.430> pretty<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.720> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
this trend here and it's pretty I like I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.690 
this trend here and it's pretty I like I
think<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.680> would<00:01:22.799> look<00:01:22.920> great<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.490> go

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
think that that would look great we go

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.420 
think that that would look great we go
around<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.240> way<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.229> way<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:26.220> is

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
around that way in this way this is

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.630 
around that way in this way this is
definitely<00:01:26.640> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.570> used<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
definitely going to be used for the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.950 
definitely going to be used for the
edging<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:31.409> mantle<00:01:31.890> top<00:01:32.600> that's<00:01:33.600> two

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
edging of the mantle top that's two

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.140 
edging of the mantle top that's two
pieces<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.530> 3/4<00:01:35.009> inch<00:01:35.040> cherry

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
pieces of 3/4 inch cherry

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.730 
pieces of 3/4 inch cherry
plywood<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.520> already<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.090> place

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
plywood so that's already in place

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.920 
plywood so that's already in place
instead<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.799> putting<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.400> here<00:01:41.880> I'd<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.780> to

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
instead of putting this here I'd like to

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.109 
instead of putting this here I'd like to
leave<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.290> there<00:01:43.649> I'm<00:01:44.399> going<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.670> take<00:01:44.850> this

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
leave that there I'm going to take this

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:45.770 
leave that there I'm going to take this
here

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
here

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.859 
here
you<00:01:46.049> like<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:47.880> think<00:01:48.270> that'll<00:01:48.540> work<00:01:48.570> out

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
you like that I I think that'll work out

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.469 
you like that I I think that'll work out
well<00:01:50.540> now<00:01:51.540> for<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> crown<00:01:52.939> the<00:01:53.939> crown<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.450> not

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
well now for the crown the crown is not

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.520 
well now for the crown the crown is not
as<00:01:54.869> large<00:01:55.170> as<00:01:56.390> I<00:01:57.390> would<00:01:57.840> have<00:01:57.960> liked<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.469> you

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
as large as I would have liked so you

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.780 
as large as I would have liked so you
can<00:01:58.770> build<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.159> up<00:01:59.479> the<00:02:00.479> rails<00:02:00.899> on

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
can build that up the rails on

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:10.900 
can build that up the rails on
one's<00:02:02.000> body<00:02:03.010> like<00:02:04.010> this<00:02:04.720> so<00:02:06.220> put<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:09.910> coming

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
one's body like this so put that coming

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.670 
one's body like this so put that coming
out<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.090> little<00:02:11.300> bit<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:13.220> then<00:02:13.850> click<00:02:14.840> up<00:02:15.650> here

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
out a little bit and then click up here

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.470 
out a little bit and then click up here
and<00:02:18.680> then<00:02:18.890> by<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.160> time<00:02:19.280> we<00:02:19.520> put<00:02:19.940> this<00:02:20.120> on<00:02:20.420> here

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
and then by the time we put this on here

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.670 
and then by the time we put this on here
and<00:02:23.590> see<00:02:24.590> if<00:02:24.680> I've<00:02:24.800> got<00:02:24.830> one<00:02:25.250> more<00:02:26.080> piece<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:27.290> put

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
and see if I've got one more piece I put

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.170 
and see if I've got one more piece I put
on<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.130> put<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.430> there

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
on and put that there

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.970 
on and put that there
I<00:02:29.680> look<00:02:30.680> pretty<00:02:30.710> nice<00:02:31.040> with<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:32.800> that's<00:02:33.800> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
I look pretty nice with it so that's the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.420 
I look pretty nice with it so that's the
path<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:34.250> I'm<00:02:34.640> going<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.330> go<00:02:36.020> unless<00:02:36.560> it

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
path that I'm going to go unless it

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.990 
path that I'm going to go unless it
changes<00:02:37.490> a<00:02:37.970> little<00:02:38.180> bit<00:02:38.380> up<00:02:39.380> top<00:02:39.850> it's<00:02:40.850> gonna

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
changes a little bit up top it's gonna

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.680 
changes a little bit up top it's gonna
be<00:02:41.270> the<00:02:41.600> wainscoting<00:02:42.010> paneling<00:02:43.420> just<00:02:44.420> like

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
be the wainscoting paneling just like

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.150 
be the wainscoting paneling just like
through<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.770> rest<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.400> then<00:02:46.670> this<00:02:46.940> seam<00:02:48.160> will

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160
