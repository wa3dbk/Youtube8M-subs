00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.590
 It can be a bit like we'll say it sad 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.500
 it could be sad or it is not father of 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.570
 new live show either but it's something 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.490
 that disappoints a little for those who 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.380
 have incredible worlds 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.900

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.699

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.970
 sixth talent ok 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.030
 there's going to be a version that is minecraft 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.850
 xbox 360 edition is obviously for 360 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.820
 and there is another minecraft part that is in 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.800
 minecraft xbox one edition are very things 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.100
 different is the same developer 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.309
 but since he has better technical things and 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.870
 the xbox one that the 360 the worlds that 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.629
 we have in the 360 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.550
 We will not able to use them in Ursa go 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.680
 rather anything we have 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.899
 of minecraft xbox 360 we are not going to 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.640
 to be able to switch to the xbox one is to say black 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.259
 if you have an incredible world that 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.550
 they have spent years making that world and 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.220
 say or hands webs 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.780
 the best of all and when you follow the xbox 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.480

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.040

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.990
 zero there is no chance that 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.970

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.580
 statement there are three blacks where 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.200

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.020

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.240

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.790
 product that is don phil spencer the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.040
 microsoft executive he was the one 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.870
 He spoke with the producers of 4 photos 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.010

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.110
 who did not declare this mother's says 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.570
 we are updating it in very modes 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.710
 significant for the new platform 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.920
 larger worlds where there is not 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.560
 translation between xbox 360 and xbox one or 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.570

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.580
 this opinion 4 j studies wanted it 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.440

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.930
 lose the worlds of 360 fans 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.400
