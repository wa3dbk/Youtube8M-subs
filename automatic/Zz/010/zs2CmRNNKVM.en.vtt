I<00:00:57.809> don't<00:00:58.520> use<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.850> tip<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.420> glue<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.899> I

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
I don't use the tip of the glue and I

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.549 
I don't use the tip of the glue and I
use<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.280> toothpick<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:03.120> too<00:01:03.719> hard<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.290> control

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
use a toothpick it's too hard to control

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.050 
use a toothpick it's too hard to control
what<00:01:05.549> comes<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.990> glue<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.820> glue

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
what comes out of the the glue the glue

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.390 
what comes out of the the glue the glue
tip<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.740> sometimes<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.830> get<00:01:10.950> way<00:01:11.070> too<00:01:11.100> much

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
tip and sometimes you get way too much

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.760 
tip and sometimes you get way too much
and<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.760> gets<00:01:11.939> all<00:01:12.030> over<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.420> place<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.500> just

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
and it gets all over the place so I just

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.469 
and it gets all over the place so I just
use<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> toothpick<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.930> I<00:01:16.939> just<00:01:17.939> unscrew<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
use a toothpick and I just unscrew the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.870 
use a toothpick and I just unscrew the
top<00:01:20.960> make<00:01:21.960> sure<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.409> put<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.040> top<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.520> some

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
top make sure that I put the top on some

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.020 
top make sure that I put the top on some
surface<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> plastic<00:01:25.920> bag<00:01:26.159> or<00:01:26.490> something

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
surface like a plastic bag or something

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.840 
surface like a plastic bag or something
because<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.750> does<00:01:27.990> drop<00:01:28.520> some<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> glue

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
because it does drop some of the glue

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.149 
because it does drop some of the glue
and<00:01:30.170> you<00:01:31.170> don't<00:01:31.320> want<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.650> get<00:01:31.740> all<00:01:31.890> over

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
and you don't want it to get all over

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.350 
and you don't want it to get all over
the<00:01:32.280> step<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.729> over<00:01:32.790> things<00:01:33.650> so<00:01:35.119> it's<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
the step all over things so it's on a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.749 
the step all over things so it's on a
protective<00:01:36.900> surface<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:40.250> then<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.549> just

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
protective surface and and then you just

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.060 
protective surface and and then you just
take<00:01:41.880> your

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.920

Glu dip it in the in the glue the

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.649 
Glu dip it in the in the glue the
toothpick<00:01:51.350> just<00:01:51.590> put<00:01:52.579> it<00:01:52.670> on<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:52.909> back<00:01:53.090> make

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659
