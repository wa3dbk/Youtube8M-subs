00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.800 
matte formula in both the ones I have
are<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.830> sparkle<00:02:09.310> formula<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:11.560> what<00:02:12.810> it

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
are the sparkle formula this is what it

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.410 
are the sparkle formula this is what it
looks<00:02:14.019> like<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:15.880> think<00:02:15.940> I'm<00:02:16.209> actually

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
looks like and I think I'm actually

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.150 
looks like and I think I'm actually
gonna<00:02:16.660> leave<00:02:16.780> those<00:02:17.019> sifters<00:02:17.890> in<00:02:18.040> these

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
gonna leave those sifters in these

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.910 
gonna leave those sifters in these
because<00:02:18.400> they<00:02:18.670> are<00:02:18.730> massive<00:02:19.269> I<00:02:19.650> think<00:02:20.650> this<00:02:20.769> is

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
because they are massive I think this is

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.640 
because they are massive I think this is
like<00:02:21.099> five<00:02:21.340> grams<00:02:21.810> yeah<00:02:22.810> this<00:02:22.989> is<00:02:23.110> five<00:02:23.319> grams

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
like five grams yeah this is five grams

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.759 
like five grams yeah this is five grams
of<00:02:23.830> product<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:25.120> it's<00:02:25.239> really<00:02:25.450> huge<00:02:25.750> when<00:02:26.680> you

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
of product so it's really huge when you

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.280
