00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
hi guys this tutorial is going to be on

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.370 
hi guys this tutorial is going to be on
the<00:00:11.280> five<00:00:11.580> strand<00:00:11.970> braid<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.840> previously

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
the five strand braid so I previously

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.379 
the five strand braid so I previously
done<00:00:13.710> four<00:00:14.040> strand<00:00:14.340> braids<00:00:14.580> but<00:00:14.790> I'm<00:00:14.910> stepping

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
done four strand braids but I'm stepping

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.910 
done four strand braids but I'm stepping
this<00:00:15.510> one<00:00:15.660> up<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.840> notch<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.200> doing<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.619> five

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
this one up a notch and doing a five

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.100 
this one up a notch and doing a five
strand<00:00:17.189> it's<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:18.119> pretty<00:00:18.420> it's<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.930> bit

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
strand it's so pretty it's a bit

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.290 
strand it's so pretty it's a bit
complicated<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.860> I<00:00:20.100> would<00:00:20.279> suggest<00:00:20.460> going

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
complicated so I would suggest going

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.730 
complicated so I would suggest going
back<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.750> watching<00:00:21.990> my<00:00:22.110> four<00:00:22.350> strand<00:00:22.680> braid

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
back and watching my four strand braid

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.800 
back and watching my four strand braid
videos<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.640> before<00:00:24.180> just<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.480> practice

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
videos and before just to practice

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.060 
videos and before just to practice
getting<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.140> hang<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.350> those<00:00:25.530> before<00:00:25.860> you

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
getting the hang of those before you

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.859 
getting the hang of those before you
maybe<00:00:26.280> move<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:26.880> one<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.690> it's

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
maybe move on to this one but it's

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.689 
maybe move on to this one but it's
really<00:00:28.289> really<00:00:28.680> pretty<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.310> really

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
really really pretty and really

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.250 
really really pretty and really
interesting<00:00:30.270> and<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.600> creates<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.020> really

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
interesting and it creates a really

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.630 
interesting and it creates a really
thick<00:00:31.470> braid<00:00:31.740> you're<00:00:32.070> going<00:00:32.190> to<00:00:32.250> need<00:00:32.430> for

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
thick braid you're going to need for

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.820 
thick braid you're going to need for
this<00:00:32.730> really<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.780> hairbrush<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.800> brush

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
this really is a hairbrush to brush

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.619 
this really is a hairbrush to brush
through<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> hair<00:00:35.340> I'm<00:00:35.730> using<00:00:35.760> my<00:00:36.180> tangle

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629

hair that stick out a bit you can just

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.100 
hair that stick out a bit you can just
pin<00:00:50.670> them<00:00:50.820> back<00:00:50.850> into<00:00:51.120> place<00:00:51.300> nice<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.720> easy

smooth out all the hair and then I'm

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.280 
smooth out all the hair and then I'm
gonna<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.970> this<00:01:00.150> five<00:01:00.360> strand<00:01:00.690> braid<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.080> the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
gonna do this five strand braid on the

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.170 
gonna do this five strand braid on the
side<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.979> I'm<00:01:02.159> just<00:01:02.309> gonna<00:01:02.400> sweep<00:01:02.879> all<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
side so I'm just gonna sweep all the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.690 
side so I'm just gonna sweep all the
hair<00:01:03.360> over<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:04.260> my<00:01:04.620> right<00:01:04.830> hand<00:01:05.010> side<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
hair over to my right hand side the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.310 
hair over to my right hand side the
first<00:01:05.940> thing<00:01:06.119> we<00:01:06.210> want<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.479> do<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.110> split

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
first thing we want to do is to split

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.469 
first thing we want to do is to split
the<00:01:07.500> hair<00:01:07.650> into<00:01:07.830> five<00:01:08.100> which<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.790> be<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> little

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the hair into five which can be a little

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.800 
the hair into five which can be a little
bit<00:01:09.600> tricky<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.190> you<00:01:12.120> can<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.600> kind

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
bit tricky so and you can do this kind

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.090 
bit tricky so and you can do this kind
of<00:01:12.840> different<00:01:13.200> ways<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.410> could<00:01:13.740> split<00:01:13.980> it

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
of different ways you could split it

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.150 
of different ways you could split it
into<00:01:14.250> two<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.700> then<00:01:15.180> four<00:01:15.510> and<00:01:15.540> then

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
into two and then four and then

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.440 
into two and then four and then
triangular<00:01:17.160> section<00:01:17.730> but<00:01:18.000> I'm<00:01:18.120> just<00:01:18.300> gonna

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
triangular section but I'm just gonna

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.450 
triangular section but I'm just gonna
split<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.910> kind<00:01:20.910> of<00:01:21.000> as<00:01:21.180> equally<00:01:21.750> as<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.460> so

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
split it kind of as equally as I can so

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:31.410 
split it kind of as equally as I can so
that<00:01:24.150> could<00:01:24.420> be<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.630> section

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.150 

it's<00:01:32.420> difficult<00:01:32.900> to<00:01:33.020> try<00:01:33.290> and<00:01:33.320> keep<00:01:33.860> them

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
it's difficult to try and keep them

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.020 
it's difficult to try and keep them
except<00:01:34.640> for<00:01:34.670> as<00:01:35.060> well<00:01:35.650> if<00:01:36.650> you<00:01:37.160> have<00:01:37.550> anyone<00:01:37.850> on

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
except for as well if you have anyone on

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.500 
except for as well if you have anyone on
hand<00:01:38.330> like<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.750> mum<00:01:38.990> or<00:01:39.260> a<00:01:39.290> sister<00:01:39.770> or<00:01:39.980> a<00:01:40.010> brother

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
hand like a mum or a sister or a brother

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.330 
hand like a mum or a sister or a brother
you<00:01:41.510> could<00:01:41.690> ask<00:01:42.140> them<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.680> help<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:43.010> do<00:01:43.190> this

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
you could ask them to help you do this

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.460 
you could ask them to help you do this
because<00:01:43.490> this<00:01:43.610> is<00:01:43.670> actually<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.480> find<00:01:45.140> this<00:01:45.320> is

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
because this is actually I find this is

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.260 
because this is actually I find this is
the<00:01:45.590> trickiest<00:01:45.980> there<00:01:46.250> is<00:01:46.490> just<00:01:46.760> getting<00:01:47.060> all

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
the trickiest there is just getting all

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.060 
the trickiest there is just getting all
the<00:01:47.420> sections<00:01:47.780> ready<00:01:49.750> but<00:01:50.750> I<00:01:51.140> think<00:01:51.530> this<00:01:51.860> will

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
the sections ready but I think this will

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.820 
the sections ready but I think this will
do<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:53.240> if<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:53.540> just<00:01:53.660> split<00:01:53.900> this<00:01:53.990> one<00:01:54.200> into<00:01:54.590> two

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
do so if I just split this one into two

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.450 
do so if I just split this one into two
even<00:01:55.580> so<00:01:56.510> I've<00:01:56.690> got<00:01:56.840> two<00:01:56.990> sections<00:01:57.410> here<00:01:57.470> I'm

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
even so I've got two sections here I'm

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.810 
even so I've got two sections here I'm
gonna<00:01:58.610> have<00:01:58.670> this<00:01:58.880> section<00:01:59.300> in<00:01:59.480> the<00:01:59.570> middle

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
gonna have this section in the middle

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.600 
gonna have this section in the middle
and<00:02:01.820> then<00:02:02.360> I'm<00:02:02.660> gonna<00:02:02.810> have<00:02:03.110> things<00:02:03.950> too<00:02:04.280> in

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
and then I'm gonna have things too in

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.880 
and then I'm gonna have things too in
this<00:02:05.090> hand<00:02:05.330> now<00:02:05.660> you've<00:02:06.320> got<00:02:06.500> your<00:02:06.590> five

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
this hand now you've got your five

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.280 
this hand now you've got your five
sections<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:08.030> braid<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.600> actually<00:02:09.080> quite

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
sections the braid is actually quite

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.060 
sections the braid is actually quite
straightforward

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
straightforward

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.830 
straightforward
when<00:02:10.340> I<00:02:10.369> seen<00:02:10.670> this<00:02:10.760> before<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.209> was<00:02:11.480> like<00:02:11.600> oh

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
when I seen this before I was like oh

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.480 
when I seen this before I was like oh
that's<00:02:12.170> going<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.380> be<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:12.680> complicated<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.340> do

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
that's going to be so complicated to do

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.640 
that's going to be so complicated to do
but<00:02:13.880> it's<00:02:14.120> actually<00:02:14.480> quite<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.780> simple<00:02:15.080> pattern

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
but it's actually quite a simple pattern

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.040 
but it's actually quite a simple pattern
to<00:02:16.100> follow<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:17.180> I'm<00:02:17.390> gonna<00:02:17.480> start<00:02:17.780> with<00:02:17.959> this

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
to follow so I'm gonna start with this

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.170 
to follow so I'm gonna start with this
section<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.709> which<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.640> innermost

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
section and which is the innermost

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.900 
section and which is the innermost
section<00:02:20.720> kind<00:02:20.959> of<00:02:21.020> nearest<00:02:21.590> my<00:02:21.770> face<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.340> I'm

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
section kind of nearest my face and I'm

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.640 
section kind of nearest my face and I'm
going<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.060> pass<00:02:23.240> that<00:02:23.450> over<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.020> section<00:02:24.380> next

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
going to pass that over the section next

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:35.040 
going to pass that over the section next
to<00:02:24.740> it<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:26.110> then<00:02:27.190> under<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.520> middle<00:02:29.000> section

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.560 

and<00:02:35.560> now<00:02:35.770> I'm<00:02:35.890> gonna<00:02:36.040> hold<00:02:36.280> that<00:02:36.640> section<00:02:37.270> that

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
and now I'm gonna hold that section that

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.510 
and now I'm gonna hold that section that
was<00:02:37.690> in<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.900> middle<00:02:38.200> now<00:02:38.770> it's<00:02:39.070> in<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:39.310> hand

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
was in the middle now it's in that hand

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.190 
was in the middle now it's in that hand
and<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:39.970> has<00:02:40.090> become<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.750> new<00:02:40.930> middle

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
and that has become the new middle

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.270 
and that has become the new middle
section<00:02:41.560> which<00:02:41.740> I'm<00:02:41.830> just<00:02:41.860> going<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.160> leave

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
section which I'm just going to leave

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.790 
section which I'm just going to leave
down<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.580> middle<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.210> now<00:02:43.810> I'm<00:02:44.290> gonna<00:02:44.410> take

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
down the middle and now I'm gonna take

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.580 
down the middle and now I'm gonna take
the<00:02:45.610> outermost<00:02:46.150> section<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:47.050> this<00:02:47.170> one<00:02:47.380> here

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
the outermost section so this one here

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.430 
the outermost section so this one here
and<00:02:47.860> pass<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.250> over<00:02:48.670> that<00:02:48.790> section<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.570> under

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
and pass it over that section and under

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.230 
and pass it over that section and under
the<00:02:50.770> middle<00:02:50.920> section<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.610> that<00:02:51.640> is<00:02:51.970> going<00:02:52.150> to

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
the middle section and that is going to

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.610 
the middle section and that is going to
become<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.750> new<00:02:52.990> middle<00:02:53.320> section<00:02:53.710> so<00:02:55.440> now<00:02:56.440> I'm

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
become the new middle section so now I'm

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.040 
become the new middle section so now I'm
going<00:02:56.770> to<00:02:56.830> pick<00:02:57.040> up<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:57.490> in<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.820> hand<00:02:59.100> and

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
going to pick up that in that hand and

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.090 
going to pick up that in that hand and
then<00:03:02.050> you're<00:03:02.200> going<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.350> start<00:03:02.620> from<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:02.950> this

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
then you're going to start from it this

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.520 
then you're going to start from it this
side<00:03:03.340> again<00:03:03.520> so<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.330> section<00:03:04.990> closest<00:03:05.500> to

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
side again so the section closest to

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.470 
side again so the section closest to
your<00:03:05.740> face<00:03:05.800> is<00:03:06.280> going<00:03:06.460> to<00:03:06.520> go<00:03:06.640> over<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.300> next

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
your face is going to go over the next

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.940 
your face is going to go over the next
section<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:11.440> then<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:12.070> in<00:03:12.460> the<00:03:12.550> middle<00:03:13.950> the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
section and then and in the middle the

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.560 
section and then and in the middle the
hardest<00:03:15.400> bit<00:03:15.580> of<00:03:15.700> this<00:03:15.790> road<00:03:16.030> is<00:03:16.210> like<00:03:16.240> when

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
hardest bit of this road is like when

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.030 
hardest bit of this road is like when
you're<00:03:16.720> starting<00:03:17.050> off<00:03:17.320> to<00:03:17.530> get<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.740> all<00:03:17.860> kind

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
you're starting off to get it all kind

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.980 
you're starting off to get it all kind
of<00:03:18.070> in<00:03:18.250> position<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:19.000> then<00:03:19.480> once<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.810> braid

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
of in position and then once the braid

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.530 
of in position and then once the braid
is<00:03:20.110> being<00:03:20.290> started<00:03:20.740> a<00:03:20.830> bit<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.790> gets<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.330> little

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
is being started a bit it gets a little

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.630 
is being started a bit it gets a little
bit<00:03:22.780> easier<00:03:22.960> so<00:03:23.470> now<00:03:23.800> that<00:03:23.860> middle<00:03:24.280> section<00:03:24.430> is

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
bit easier so now that middle section is

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.130 
bit easier so now that middle section is
there<00:03:24.880> and<00:03:25.120> then<00:03:25.540> we're<00:03:25.630> going<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.810> take<00:03:25.990> this

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
there and then we're going to take this

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.340 
there and then we're going to take this
top<00:03:26.440> section<00:03:26.650> at<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.310> back<00:03:27.570> pass<00:03:28.570> it<00:03:28.810> over<00:03:28.930> the

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
top section at the back pass it over the

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.930 
top section at the back pass it over the
section<00:03:29.680> next<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:32.490> under<00:03:33.490> the<00:03:33.730> middle

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
section next to it and under the middle

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:45.600 
section next to it and under the middle
section

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.420 

like<00:03:46.180> psy

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.520 

and<00:03:52.579> then<00:03:53.150> we're<00:03:53.540> going<00:03:53.659> to<00:03:53.750> go<00:03:53.840> back<00:03:54.019> so

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
and then we're going to go back so

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.619 
and then we're going to go back so
affection<00:03:55.129> place<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.519> your<00:03:55.640> face<00:03:55.879> over<00:03:56.540> the

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
affection place to your face over the

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:13.630 
affection place to your face over the
next<00:03:56.840> section<00:03:57.349> and<00:03:58.750> then<00:03:59.750> under<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.349> middle

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.199 

so<00:04:14.640> that

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.490 

section<00:04:19.109> at<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.650> back<00:04:20.209> over<00:04:21.209> and<00:04:21.509> under<00:04:22.410> the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
section at the back over and under the

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:33.610 
section at the back over and under the
middle

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.719 

and<00:04:35.169> so<00:04:36.169> you<00:04:36.229> just<00:04:36.500> gotta<00:04:36.680> remember<00:04:36.800> over<00:04:37.490> and

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
and so you just gotta remember over and

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.689 
and so you just gotta remember over and
under<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.210> middle<00:04:38.419> really<00:04:38.900> from<00:04:39.830> each<00:04:40.130> side

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
under the middle really from each side

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.719 
under the middle really from each side
and<00:04:41.410> as<00:04:42.410> you<00:04:42.440> can<00:04:42.650> see<00:04:42.710> now<00:04:43.130> it's<00:04:43.460> tight

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
and as you can see now it's tight

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.550 
and as you can see now it's tight
starting<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:44.449> take<00:04:44.630> shape<00:04:44.660> a<00:04:45.020> little<00:04:45.199> bit<00:04:45.320> more

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
starting to take shape a little bit more

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.110 
starting to take shape a little bit more
so<00:04:45.800> it's<00:04:46.010> getting<00:04:46.280> a<00:04:46.430> little<00:04:46.699> bit<00:04:46.790> easier<00:04:47.060> for

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
so it's getting a little bit easier for

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.750 
so it's getting a little bit easier for
me<00:04:47.360> and<00:04:47.870> as<00:04:48.050> you<00:04:48.110> can<00:04:48.260> see<00:04:48.320> my<00:04:48.860> layers<00:04:49.490> at<00:04:49.699> the

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
me and as you can see my layers at the

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.159 
me and as you can see my layers at the
front<00:04:50.000> my<00:04:50.120> fringe<00:04:50.360> is<00:04:50.540> kind<00:04:50.720> of<00:04:50.750> coming<00:04:51.050> out<00:04:51.110> of

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
front my fringe is kind of coming out of

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.659 
front my fringe is kind of coming out of
it<00:04:51.350> but<00:04:51.470> I'm<00:04:51.560> gonna<00:04:51.650> sort<00:04:51.860> that<00:04:52.010> out<00:04:52.070> later<00:04:52.340> so

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
it but I'm gonna sort that out later so

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.300 
it but I'm gonna sort that out later so
don't<00:04:52.760> worry<00:04:52.940> about<00:04:53.030> that<00:04:53.300> so<00:04:54.260> then<00:04:54.530> this<00:04:54.919> back

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
don't worry about that so then this back

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:11.149 
don't worry about that so then this back
section<00:04:55.750> over<00:05:02.290> and<00:05:03.290> under<00:05:03.979> the<00:05:04.100> middle

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.100 

this<00:05:12.159> is<00:05:12.310> such<00:05:12.520> a<00:05:12.550> pretty<00:05:12.939> hairstyle<00:05:13.270> to<00:05:13.990> do

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
this is such a pretty hairstyle to do

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.929 
this is such a pretty hairstyle to do
you<00:05:14.409> can<00:05:14.560> see<00:05:14.770> it<00:05:14.860> already<00:05:14.979> just<00:05:15.219> half<00:05:15.610> thick

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:15.939 
you can see it already just half thick

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.020 
you can see it already just half thick
it's<00:05:16.240> making<00:05:16.689> the<00:05:17.229> braid<00:05:17.469> if<00:05:17.710> we<00:05:18.189> have<00:05:18.370> and<00:05:18.729> I

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
it's making the braid if we have and I

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.790 
it's making the braid if we have and I
think<00:05:19.449> this'll<00:05:19.569> be<00:05:19.689> difficult<00:05:20.139> to<00:05:20.229> do<00:05:20.379> if<00:05:20.650> you

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
think this'll be difficult to do if you

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.159 
think this'll be difficult to do if you
do<00:05:21.009> have<00:05:21.219> sure<00:05:21.490> to<00:05:21.699> have<00:05:21.909> so<00:05:22.509> I<00:05:22.539> would<00:05:22.960> suggest

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
do have sure to have so I would suggest

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.719 
do have sure to have so I would suggest
clipping<00:05:23.740> it<00:05:23.860> in<00:05:23.949> your<00:05:24.069> hair<00:05:24.219> extensions
