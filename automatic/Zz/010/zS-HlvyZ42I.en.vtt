00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.170
 I want salvation now 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.150
 I have just finished the contour video that succeeds to look here 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:06.040
 if you like 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.139
 so is a sequel 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.690
 and behold, I just want something to clap to be cold 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:17.189
 I chose her one more pink because I think that there in my 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:18.369
 Eyes Maicon up 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.039
 I think so it's a good thing in blue shimmering commutes to the rest 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.519
 on the one hand, that it is in the pension formula that I am 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.109
 was not aware 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.179
 or even the eye make-up 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.089
 around 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.719
 the two somehow interact when someone looks at you 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.630
 she is the overall picture 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.780
 and that's a bit visible, "says Red and Pink 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.790
 It brings disquiet to the face as it turns out about make-up they will 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.649
 is very on 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.830
 that you have such risks as the location is likely 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.920
 really focus only on one area of ​​the face put in the eyes 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.929
 or USD 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:55.890
 or life 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.790
 if you emphasize everything 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.120
 Certainly easier as their reputation unvarnished women's forest is simple 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.330
 is then said to be a percent 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.120
 Clown i see im here 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.660
 and she can just get too colorful from percent restless 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.580
 Therefore, eyes emphasize calmly a bad rule that is always so 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.580
 coined you can continue driving deeds 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.540
 and I think we're getting better effects than usual 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.850
 Ceylan used to condolence in the Champions League 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.000
 I'm just beautiful by the shape is better around it and it can be better 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.800
 make circular movements 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.500
 at 12 30 pm final 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.630
 climate neutral second 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.780
 around the players this is missing a Mac 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.780
 Holger Schmidt whom 11 filmically z 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.310
 that's easy it has here for easy Rio 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.650
 However, to attract me with her I always do it there is only one 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.950
 Certificate KV 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.240
 and count here set by Yaman contours of a rail 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.220
 and just above the pulpit for me just drop off the rose so that 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.280
 that merges into each other 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.610
 I prefer to kill 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.750
 Brundle movement 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.249
 that's just as the banks got caught 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:12.389
 but he is one so that it fades out a bit 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.780
 well i think i am here really one of the killers since i mean the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.999
 Of course it is such a thing which face shape to resist 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.950
 Hackmann who is a very long considering the market 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.749
 he should interrupt this with these a little bit 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.650
 and certainly also he has been larger 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.569
 and continue to the middle 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.279
 who has a threatening should keep as outside as possible 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:40.969
 and 10 but in principle I think this slightly oblique is quite a 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:42.069
 Hose easy 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.649
 to maintain unused movement to the pigeons 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:46.709
 that many 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.489
 EFI also likes to make these apple cheeks are on him 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.900
 so it's cute so i find that or with that syriani one emphasizes this 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.019
 Kindchenschema 30 that I say that 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.980
 You will then see a little bit hurt to see the imprisonment 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.189
 This suggests that you pinch 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.689
 if you get that effect, that's fine here 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.569
 but it also bothers, for example, then a look at the alarm clock so if 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.419
 her children have a colorful argument quickly interrupts them again 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.119
 a clear line 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:21.619
 and it's kind of like this 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:23.459
 and next to one and 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.259
 I do not want him to give up when her eyes meet again 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:30.549
 Obasi to make apple cheek then I would tell her 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.019
 that the eyes itch a bit make him give the ball and then you can 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.050
 hew the shrine and endure it here as well 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.900
 just not too deep just not too close to the nose because otherwise Thatcher face 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.760
 so together 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.139
 and bad now 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.529
 Kitchener kind of focus on the nose what here 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:49.699
 Nobody so right 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.819
 you'll find exciting starting from easier 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.979
 No, I do not think much of her, so it really only works for me 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:57.440
 very little familiar 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.979
 and that's really a bit fresh 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:01.449
 Reitz take 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.919
 and they have the war even if I do not have any contours of military men 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.999
 I also have a bit more color on it 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:09.779
 that I like to do 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.199
 KNA she works for me like that 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.489
 looked around from outside to inside 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.090
 You never have to do that in an English father division way 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.169
 then here is 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.279
 to some extent more color 

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:23.590
 than here 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.990
 when i did it doesn't work so well i can do that too 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.999
 do not explain why 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.870
 but I think the variant is best 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.580
 "They can do that to you, but that's five minutes for me 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.620
 to be in the lead 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.620
 and again here 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.980
 In principle, even when not so much games much is not for me 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:44.110
 lost a lot 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.919
 Talks Burden along 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.919
 and we want to enjoy it 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:54.979
 yes that is also with colored glass 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.379

 Glock cheeks 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.820
 my highlight 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.820
 why a highlight here as already mentioned in which Skype manage 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.639
 Culture video 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.380
 the form our face new because it was just a promise before 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:13.580
 empty canvas was 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.469
 meanwhile the shape was one 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.909
 and deep down here to feel a bit too 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:23.080
 and if, on the other hand, emphasize that again from below, the action too 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.310
 the eyes radiate a little bit more besides, he does not get it with him 

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:28.130
 come to mind 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.520
 praised on the most healthy 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.810
 and then you have to look but also what kind of face I had 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.970
 am very round and chimeras just right inserts the Unger is that 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.110
 Face work 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.370
 It's nice and economical 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.660
 He holds those he has such a flat long face at the bedside 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.610
 quite a larger area 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.009
 Dieter bleeding this to the finish 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.110
 which one for nothing that very much focused even more on the eyes 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.320
 Personally, I would not do that if my facial shape was not mine 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:56.360
 created for it 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.409

 Macs Leitzke car driver is beautiful, but there is a lot going on 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.080
 There were really many highlights »I simply have no color 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.849
 but only fine Shammam 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:16.249
 where you really should also distinguish a bit there is right 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:18.189
 some are very big 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:21.869
 and that then works quickly tiring a little put on 

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:25.269
 "It's much nicer when the GDR is really super club 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:28.020
 and then really only 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.460
 it seems like your skin just shines a bit 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.089
 and do not know if there was something on it 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:36.240
 So I really like her here 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.529
 And that was already the talk of Paule 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:42.449
 and who can afford to do so with his face shape, it certainly continues

 then it reigns smaller Klein in Gaza 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:58.599
 and actually everywhere where the sun would appear I would be here or on the 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:06:59.539
 forehead 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:01.610
 you can do that, too 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.539
 looks like him every nature from I already complemented by nature 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:07.909
 emphasizes that, of course, the whole thing 

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:10.439
 to weigh a bit and thus the hl 

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:12.899
 harmonious with the 2 2 against St 

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.899
 and a little bit more here 

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:21.219
 Of course, it is also possible APA 

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:27.050
 that one does not matter creamy products for example 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.680
 In addition, you have to deal with what you get along well, I think brother 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.490
 are there easy 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.949
 Super Easy but the foolproof 

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:37.009
 Well that was it then already 

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:40.069
 As you said, this is not actually a highlight 

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:41.559
 she really needs it 

00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:44.559
 when the light comes off for example during a flash photo 

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:49.240
 revoke 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.960
