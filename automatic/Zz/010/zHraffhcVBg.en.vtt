right<00:00:01.620> hello<00:00:02.010> today<00:00:02.429> we're<00:00:03.360> going<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.629> do<00:00:03.720> a

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
right hello today we're going to do a

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.980 
right hello today we're going to do a
video<00:00:03.899> I'll<00:00:04.410> need<00:00:05.089> this<00:00:06.089> is<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.299> condom<00:00:06.660> no<00:00:06.810> over

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
video I'll need this is a condom no over

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.160 
video I'll need this is a condom no over
here<00:00:07.370> but<00:00:08.370> it's<00:00:08.910> also<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.269> commute<00:00:09.690> for<00:00:09.870> people

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
here but it's also a commute for people

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.999 
here but it's also a commute for people
with<00:00:10.740> solder<00:00:11.340> DSCs<00:00:12.320> so<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.650> can<00:00:13.799> be<00:00:13.889> done

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
with solder DSCs so this can be done

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.910 
with solder DSCs so this can be done
without<00:00:14.190> ticking<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.670> top<00:00:14.820> off<00:00:15.320> so<00:00:16.320> how<00:00:16.859> to

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
without ticking the top off so how to

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.519 
without ticking the top off so how to
calibrate<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.609> SC's<00:00:18.170> what<00:00:19.170> i<00:00:19.199> need<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.380> do

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
calibrate the SC's what i need to do

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.540 
calibrate the SC's what i need to do
first<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:20.070> flip<00:00:20.430> your<00:00:20.850> quadcopter<00:00:21.060> over<00:00:22.550> you

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
first is flip your quadcopter over you

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.750 
first is flip your quadcopter over you
need<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.789> have<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.180> USB<00:00:24.510> plug<00:00:24.960> little<00:00:25.470> fit<00:00:25.760> into

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
need to have a USB plug little fit into

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.279 
need to have a USB plug little fit into
the<00:00:27.000> connectors<00:00:27.420> at<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.570> bottom<00:00:27.869> if<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.109> also

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the connectors at the bottom if you also

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.410 
the connectors at the bottom if you also
got<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.769> then<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.400> method<00:00:29.609> won't<00:00:29.910> work

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
got this then this method won't work

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.299 
got this then this method won't work
and<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.289> also<00:00:31.410> need<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.219> USB<00:00:32.610> plug<00:00:32.870> power<00:00:33.870> pot

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
and you also need the USB plug power pot

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.569 
and you also need the USB plug power pot
so<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.820> do<00:00:35.969> first<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.329> flip<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.660> over<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
so what you do first is flip it over and

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.069 
so what you do first is flip it over and
then<00:00:38.600> get<00:00:39.600> USB<00:00:40.020> lead<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.890> plug<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:42.079> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
then get USB lead and plug it in to the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.880 
then get USB lead and plug it in to the
connector<00:00:44.989> plug<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.739> isn't

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
connector plug that in this isn't

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.440 
connector plug that in this isn't
plugged<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.309> at<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.460> moment<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.090> what<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.300> do

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
plugged in at the moment so what you do

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.520 
plugged in at the moment so what you do
now<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.780> flip<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.140> back<00:00:50.120> over

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
now is flip it back over

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.410 
now is flip it back over
make<00:00:52.530> sure<00:00:52.680> yet<00:00:53.180> accelerometers<00:00:54.180> they're

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
make sure yet accelerometers they're

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.090 
make sure yet accelerometers they're
calibrated<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.500> do<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.800> mission

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
calibrated so you can do this on mission

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.270 
calibrated so you can do this on mission

this<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.700> flat<00:01:05.970> otherwise<00:01:06.150> they'll<00:01:06.689> be

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
this is flat otherwise they'll be

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.530 
this is flat otherwise they'll be

won't<00:01:10.260> work<00:01:10.500> for<00:01:10.890> calibrating<00:01:11.280> them<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:12.390> now

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
won't work for calibrating them so now

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.230 
won't work for calibrating them so now
what<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.720> need<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.430> get<00:01:14.430> USB<00:01:14.820> plug<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
what you need to do is get USB plug and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.600 
what you need to do is get USB plug and
plug<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.799> when<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.890> plug<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.280> it's

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
plug it in when you plug it in it's

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.490 
plug it in when you plug it in it's
gonna<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.479> flight<00:01:18.750> controller<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.439> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
gonna the flight controller is in a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.289 
gonna the flight controller is in a
staff<00:01:19.740> tool<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.310> we'll<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.939> enough<00:01:21.119> power

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
staff tool but we'll have enough power

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.640 
staff tool but we'll have enough power
for<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.320> motors<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.710> start<00:01:23.150> so<00:01:24.200> if<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.350> plug<00:01:25.500> it

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
for the motors to start so if we plug it

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.990 
for the motors to start so if we plug it
in<00:01:25.740> it'll<00:01:26.130> start<00:01:26.340> beeping<00:01:28.610> as<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.850> see

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
in it'll start beeping as you can see

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.039 
in it'll start beeping as you can see
it's<00:01:30.299> beeping

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
it's beeping

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.770 
it's beeping

the top you need to make sure you lift
it<00:01:59.850> also<00:02:00.000> calibrated<00:02:00.780> your<00:02:01.200> conflict<00:02:01.799> and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
it also calibrated your conflict and

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.560 
it also calibrated your conflict and
make<00:02:02.250> sure<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.430> calibrate<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.090> into<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:03.420> as

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
make sure you calibrate it into this as

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.179 
make sure you calibrate it into this as
well<00:02:03.689> now<00:02:04.500> we're<00:02:04.649> going<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.829> do<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.009> get<00:02:05.159> a

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
the stick to the left for a few seconds

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.140 
the stick to the left for a few seconds
check<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.870> move<00:02:31.049> -<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.530> not<00:02:31.709> working<00:02:32.159> put<00:02:33.090> it

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
check the move - and not working put it

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.649 
check the move - and not working put it
to<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.329> right<00:02:33.359> to<00:02:34.109> arm<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.760> then<00:02:38.480> all<00:02:39.480> the

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
to the right to arm it and then all the

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:47.000 
to the right to arm it and then all the
motors<00:02:39.989> are<00:02:40.139> now<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.439> sync<00:02:45.409> so<00:02:46.409> this<00:02:46.769> might<00:02:46.980> not

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
motors are now in sync so this might not

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.679 
motors are now in sync so this might not
work<00:02:47.189> the<00:02:47.430> first<00:02:47.459> time<00:02:47.879> if<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.299> doesn't<00:02:48.329> work

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
work the first time if it doesn't work

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.899 
work the first time if it doesn't work
in<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.049> Royal<00:02:49.200> bit<00:02:49.319> out<00:02:49.439> of<00:02:49.469> sync<00:02:49.769> all<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.760> need

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
in the Royal bit out of sync all I need

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.479 
in the Royal bit out of sync all I need
to<00:02:50.969> do<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.389> stop<00:02:52.199> the<00:02:52.500> start<00:02:52.769> again<00:02:52.949> so<00:02:53.159> unplug

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
to do is stop the start again so unplug

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.479 
to do is stop the start again so unplug
this<00:02:53.639> tiny<00:02:54.449> transmitter<00:02:54.719> off<00:02:55.280> unplug<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.430> from

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
this tiny transmitter off unplug it from

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.750 
this tiny transmitter off unplug it from
the<00:02:56.639> USB<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:58.230> wait<00:02:58.349> a<00:02:58.409> few<00:02:58.530> seconds<00:02:58.949> and<00:02:59.430> put<00:02:59.669> it

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
the USB so wait a few seconds and put it

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.250 
the USB so wait a few seconds and put it
back<00:02:59.879> in<00:03:00.030> if<00:03:00.180> none<00:03:00.419> of<00:03:00.480> this<00:03:00.569> works<00:03:00.840> make<00:03:01.109> sure

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
back in if none of this works make sure

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.759 
back in if none of this works make sure
everything<00:03:01.739> is<00:03:01.799> calibrated<00:03:02.489> correctly<00:03:02.519> and

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
everything is calibrated correctly and

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.780 
everything is calibrated correctly and
make<00:03:04.769> sure<00:03:04.889> if<00:03:05.010> this<00:03:05.099> is<00:03:05.189> on<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.370> flat<00:03:05.579> surface

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
make sure if this is on a flat surface

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.509 
make sure if this is on a flat surface
so<00:03:06.299> just<00:03:07.169> make<00:03:07.349> sure<00:03:07.379> when<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.129> put<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.370> down

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
so just make sure when you put it down

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.149 
so just make sure when you put it down
if<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.819> give<00:03:08.969> a<00:03:09.000> few<00:03:09.209> taps<00:03:09.469> to<00:03:10.469> make<00:03:10.590> sure<00:03:10.799> that

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
if you give a few taps to make sure that

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.189 
if you give a few taps to make sure that
the<00:03:11.370> likes<00:03:11.549> are<00:03:11.699> spread<00:03:11.939> out<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:13.019> flight

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:13.199 
the likes are spread out and the flight

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.099 
the likes are spread out and the flight
controllers<00:03:13.769> not<00:03:13.949> bouncing<00:03:14.340> around<00:03:14.430> inside

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
controllers not bouncing around inside

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.259 
controllers not bouncing around inside
so<00:03:16.109> this<00:03:16.799> is<00:03:16.979> how<00:03:17.129> to<00:03:17.189> calibrate<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.970> economy

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
so this is how to calibrate the economy

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.349 
so this is how to calibrate the economy
/<00:03:18.479> ESC<00:03:18.870> s<00:03:18.930> they're<00:03:19.229> soldered<00:03:19.680> in<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:21.030> your

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
/ ESC s they're soldered in to your

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.020 
/ ESC s they're soldered in to your
board<00:03:21.859> so<00:03:22.859> this<00:03:23.099> will<00:03:23.220> only<00:03:23.310> work<00:03:23.579> if<00:03:23.879> you've

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
board so this will only work if you've

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.509 
board so this will only work if you've
got<00:03:24.209> a<00:03:24.449> USB<00:03:25.129> socket<00:03:26.129> on<00:03:26.879> your<00:03:27.150> quadcopter

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
got a USB socket on your quadcopter

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.080 
got a USB socket on your quadcopter
so<00:03:29.519> as<00:03:29.699> you<00:03:29.790> see<00:03:30.000> this<00:03:30.720> has<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.930> USB<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:32.280> this<00:03:32.970> is

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
so as you see this has a USB so this is

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.670 
so as you see this has a USB so this is
my<00:03:33.209> method<00:03:33.419> on<00:03:33.810> how<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.079> do<00:03:34.229> that<00:03:34.379> any
