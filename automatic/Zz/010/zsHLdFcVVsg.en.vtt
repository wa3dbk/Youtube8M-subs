00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.250
 this tutorial is to explain how 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.400
 get a good exposure in our 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.860
 Photographs I will explain 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.740
 with this canon camera would begin 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.429
 explaining the parts of the camera as 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.130
 you will appreciate here this is the screen 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:30.160
 these are the control buttons 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:34.510
 this is the button made this is the dial 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.400
 of shutter this button here is the 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.920
 trigger 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:47.020
 this is the shutter diaphragm 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:51.790
 is here the purpose of the entity the flash 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.380
 in the shoe the visor and inside brings 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.870
 a memory that is what keeps all 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.680
 the photographs here in is an image 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.420
 so they can appreciate more carefully 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.200
 the parts of the camera better 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.200
 Selected 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.429
 alright now I'm going to explain some 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.890
 concepts that are important at the time 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.530
 to take a picture first of all 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:22.159
 which is the diaphragm the diaphragm is what 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.180
 that allows the entrance of light 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.240
 but it helps control it 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.510
 the following of smooth that is the made 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.610
 helps us to manage or control what 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.350
 is the sensitivity of the image by 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.160
 example we can apply in the image in 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.440
 movement in the frozen a sweep 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.350
 etcetera the following is the shutter 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.580
 which is controlled by the shutter dial 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:52.210
 and this helps us measure the speed or 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.240
 the time by which light enters the 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.240
 image 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.860
 more or less and if we can achieve a 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.200
 exposure how you get is 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.880
 adjusting the diaphragm depending on the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.770
 amount of light you want to take 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.770
 adjusting the time and focusing the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.239
 object correctly if we observe 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.970
 that is the screen if we observe the 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:18.480
 screen here you measure the speed and 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.090
 here he did and if the hairline of who 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.580
 is in the middle means that our photo 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.740
 was balanced correctly and will have 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.690
 a good exposure 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.670
 well this is all for this tutorial 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.880
 thank you for your attention and even the 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.880
 next
