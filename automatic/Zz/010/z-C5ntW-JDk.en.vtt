 a video and more the game mode of 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.009
 Samba is called survivor games galera 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.719
 It's good here's the first episode. 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.480
 People, I hope you like them. 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.850
 nor is it good is the service attack ip on 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.930
 description if you want to access the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.160
 server 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.900
 but finally the guys will explain 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.580
 basically how is it going here? 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.170
 for people you do not know is 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.429
 basically the following is a branch of 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.109
 games will have the same thing when 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.669
 to finish the time you are two minutes away 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.730
 When you're done you'll be able to break 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.649
 the things that delayed at last is rock as 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.750
 put my kit on board you can 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.329
 choosing your kits here has a way 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.059
 yesterday rock the cameras I want to have a 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.370
 lot of thing but the kit 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.030
 best galera is the kit that is free is the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.920
 jason 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.860
 which is the way it makes good kit 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.800
 first he is born with a sword and 2 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.199
 I think it's two meats and he's good. 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.359
 is useful compared to others who are not 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.640
 my opinion better jackson who was the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.350
 in fact it's one of the best only that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.960
 I mean when does everything start here? 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.939
 I was going to have an affair with 10 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.650
 who pick up the resources and try to kill 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.090
 other friends in brazil other players 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.920
 who are here she got who 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.310
 have the best item who has the best 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.080
 best pvp wins and if you go on the bench 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.729
 and there is nothing else going to die of a 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.409
 way to make it and I 'll be 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.610

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.590
 she can say she has the same strength 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.390
 than the diamond but it breaks it well 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.970

 face that almost filled died 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.690
 Let's eat a good meal. 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.240
 I give thanks to you 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.540

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.290
 type is not released then if you lose 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.360
 lost 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.160
 You can not smoke just because she 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.760
 You drink soup. She kind of eats soup. 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.070
 She does not drink knows and it's complicated so it 's 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.560
 basic but he mano is tense the uncle 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.390
 survivor games is a bit tense but it's a lot 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.520
 This map is well known by the 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.310
 Who do you think is today? 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.200

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.710
 distance blocks in the front 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.170
 the guy is here and he drinks a lot 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.750
 with games telling the truth or letter in 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.410
 Above me, I have not lived since the attack came. 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.050

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.660
 siegmann lets you see this guy has soup 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.520
 No soup, no more quiet. 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.020
 will be if I put tnt on the ground she 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.220
 I have to have some 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.450
 thing to explode 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.100
 You do not have to have something for her. 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.660
 Explode beauty, let's go after another. 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.580
 Dude, I really want to win this match. 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.890
 even because I'm recording right? 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.870

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.910
 snow there guys I make the team everyone 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.680
 my writings that play with me but 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.690
 When I'm recording if I killed, it 's 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.430
 because I'm recording so I do not 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.900
 I like to play that actually I 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.510
 I like team that is not on skype. 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.209

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.209
 Dude it 's no no I do not like you or 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.060
 I love bates going to date but although there 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.880
 What is the point of putting our distance? 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.650
 is well away from block types in 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.140
 front but I do not know why when 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.510
 I'm playing I can not kill you. 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.890
 play talk at the same time i think i 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.900
 I do not know what I have to have some 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.550

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.040

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.880
 old killing and type I have with the items 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.310
 Good, so good. 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.979

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.199
 die because the sound I'm not junk type 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:42.020

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.639
 but I'm good until spending 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.910

 dora nuts is the league was the one exposing 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.890
 they serve several things they can be 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.380
 playing here like hunger games i guess 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.870

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.760
 family around the success 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.860
 This is it I found a strange animal. 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.200
 looks like a mouse mixed with the squirrel and 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.680
 It's the same as the year.
