 early winter season 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.139

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.629
 quickly transforms 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.410
 like 'the survey which was indicated whole% and I hope it can 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.870

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.329
 zié to stabilize an under layer in case the mountain is preparing in fact 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:39.600
 yes actually but for 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.339
 it is an accident an accident which remains exceptional at the beginning 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:47.199
