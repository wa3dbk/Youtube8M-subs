00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
now I switch into my star me thinking I

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.639 
now I switch into my star me thinking I
can<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.340> threaten<00:00:47.610> whatever<00:00:47.879> he<00:00:48.090> does<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.719> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
can just threaten whatever he does I I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.950 
can just threaten whatever he does I I
can<00:00:49.980> threaten<00:00:50.370> his<00:00:50.520> Garrett<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.719> he

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
can threaten his Garrett is but he

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.830 
can threaten his Garrett is but he
actually<00:00:52.110> goes<00:00:52.440> into<00:00:52.860> his<00:00:53.629> shield<00:00:54.629> thing

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
actually goes into his shield thing

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.580 
actually goes into his shield thing
anyway<00:00:55.649> um<00:00:56.570> yeah<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> hydro<00:00:58.050> pump<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.469> get

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
anyway um yeah I hydro pump just get

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.770 
anyway um yeah I hydro pump just get
trying<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.190> get<00:00:59.280> off<00:00:59.370> solid<00:00:59.730> damage<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.270> guess

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
trying to get off solid damage I guess

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.209 
trying to get off solid damage I guess
he<00:01:00.930> predicted<00:01:01.350> some<00:01:01.530> sort<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.829> switch<00:01:02.039> he

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
he predicted some sort of switch he

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.500 
he predicted some sort of switch he
hears<00:01:02.399> him<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> lose<00:01:02.640> gengar<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.359> kind

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
hears him to lose gengar and just kind

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.740 
hears him to lose gengar and just kind
of<00:01:03.539> dies<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:05.119> again<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.330> think<00:01:06.360> he's

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
of dies but again I think he's

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.210 
of dies but again I think he's
predicting<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.260> switch<00:01:07.439> at<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.740> point<00:01:07.950> he

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
predicting a switch at this point he

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.780 
predicting a switch at this point he
goes<00:01:08.430> iron<00:01:08.850> head<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:10.100> yeah<00:01:11.100> I'm<00:01:11.220> basically

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
goes iron head and yeah I'm basically

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.399 
goes iron head and yeah I'm basically
showing<00:01:12.060> him<00:01:12.240> I'm<00:01:12.360> not<00:01:12.540> switching<00:01:12.900> you're

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
showing him I'm not switching you're

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.240 
showing him I'm not switching you're
gonna<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.979> care<00:01:14.610> star<00:01:14.939> me<00:01:15.119> um<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.259> I

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
gonna have to care star me um and that I

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.310 
gonna have to care star me um and that I
guess<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.299> isn't<00:01:18.659> something<00:01:18.900> he's<00:01:19.049> willing

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
guess just isn't something he's willing

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.480 
guess just isn't something he's willing
to<00:01:19.439> do<00:01:19.680> um<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:21.060> he<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.330> heads<00:01:21.750> again<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.770> after

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
to do um so he I heads again I after

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.370 
to do um so he I heads again I after
another<00:01:23.670> hydro<00:01:24.030> pump<00:01:24.180> at<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.869> point<00:01:25.110> he's

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
another hydro pump at this point he's

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.289 
another hydro pump at this point he's
got<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.310> no<00:01:26.430> Alf<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.390> he's<00:01:28.020> not<00:01:28.229> gonna<00:01:29.299> really

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
got like no Alf so he's not gonna really

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.999 
got like no Alf so he's not gonna really
be<00:01:30.450> straightening<00:01:30.689> too<00:01:30.930> much<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> figure

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
be straightening too much but I figure

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.499 
be straightening too much but I figure
shadow<00:01:32.250> sneaks<00:01:32.549> obviously<00:01:33.090> coming<00:01:33.240> at<00:01:33.390> this

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
shadow sneaks obviously coming at this

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.940 
shadow sneaks obviously coming at this
point<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.259> I'm<00:01:34.320> gonna<00:01:34.409> go<00:01:34.560> into<00:01:34.920> my<00:01:36.470> hawlucha<00:01:37.470> I

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
point so I'm gonna go into my hawlucha I

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.590 
point so I'm gonna go into my hawlucha I
believe<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.400> called<00:01:38.549> anyway<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.420> have

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600

into his Garrity's which I easily care

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.870 
into his Garrity's which I easily care
with<00:01:48.899> an<00:01:49.140> acrobatics<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.189> now<00:01:50.460> i<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.579> my<00:01:50.850> own

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
with an acrobatics and now i have my own

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.630 
with an acrobatics and now i have my own
burden<00:01:51.270> up<00:01:51.360> but<00:01:51.720> unfortunately<00:01:52.500> i<00:01:52.740> really

here<00:04:39.750> because<00:04:39.900> there's<00:04:40.409> no<00:04:40.560> real<00:04:40.740> point

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
here because there's no real point

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.029 
here because there's no real point
keeping<00:04:41.370> it<00:04:41.610> around<00:04:41.789> it's<00:04:42.060> a<00:04:42.120> 15-percent<00:04:42.810> and

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
keeping it around it's a 15-percent and

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.710 
keeping it around it's a 15-percent and
that<00:04:44.039> gives<00:04:44.190> me<00:04:44.280> a<00:04:44.400> free<00:04:44.580> switch<00:04:44.879> into<00:04:45.509> my

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720

that gives me a free switch into my
Charizard<00:04:46.349> and<00:04:46.590> that's<00:04:47.190> going<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.370> be

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
Charizard and that's going to be

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.939 
Charizard and that's going to be
important<00:04:48.300> because<00:04:48.539> now<00:04:49.199> I<00:04:49.229> can<00:04:49.379> just<00:04:49.680> start
