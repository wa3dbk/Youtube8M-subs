00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
used a tape and over time the button

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.310 
used a tape and over time the button
slid<00:02:30.620> okay<00:02:31.430> now<00:02:32.000> this<00:02:32.210> one<00:02:32.450> would<00:02:32.660> be<00:02:32.690> fixable

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
slid okay now this one would be fixable

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.020 
slid okay now this one would be fixable
but<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.650> wouldn't<00:02:34.010> want<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.280> put<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:34.580> back<00:02:34.760> in

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
but I wouldn't want to put it back in

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.670 
but I wouldn't want to put it back in
because<00:02:35.210> it'll<00:02:35.540> just<00:02:35.600> do<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.990> same<00:02:36.200> thing<00:02:36.260> and

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
because it'll just do the same thing and

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.890 
because it'll just do the same thing and

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
parts it's not I mean I like taking

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.140 
parts it's not I mean I like taking
things<00:02:42.530> apart<00:02:42.710> but<00:02:43.190> it's<00:02:43.340> not<00:02:43.520> something<00:02:44.000> I'd

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
things apart but it's not something I'd

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.410 
things apart but it's not something I'd
like<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.390> do<00:02:44.840> very<00:02:45.470> often<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.910> actually<00:02:47.060> get

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
like to do very often and I actually get

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.350 
like to do very often and I actually get
myself<00:02:47.690> an<00:02:48.200> iPhone<00:02:48.709> 5<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:51.400> not<00:02:52.400> 5s<00:02:52.850> but<00:02:53.060> five

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
myself an iPhone 5 the not 5s but five

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.390 
myself an iPhone 5 the not 5s but five
and<00:02:53.660> I'm<00:02:54.170> already<00:02:54.320> experiencing<00:02:55.220> some

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
and I'm already experiencing some

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.800 
and I'm already experiencing some
problems<00:02:55.550> with<00:02:56.000> that<00:02:56.800> so<00:02:57.800> I<00:02:58.160> get<00:02:58.790> myself<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.450> new

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
problems with that so I get myself a new

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.650 
problems with that so I get myself a new
replacement<00:03:00.080> button<00:03:01.090> it's<00:03:02.090> done<00:03:02.390> a<00:03:02.420> little

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
replacement button it's done a little

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.520 
replacement button it's done a little
differently<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.900> button<00:03:06.260> is<00:03:06.290> actually

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
differently and the button is actually

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.500 
differently and the button is actually
coming<00:03:07.040> separately<00:03:07.400> from<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.970> contact<00:03:08.420> group

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
coming separately from the contact group

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.380 
coming separately from the contact group
so<00:03:09.470> we'll<00:03:09.890> see<00:03:10.100> how<00:03:10.220> this<00:03:10.400> holds<00:03:10.700> up<00:03:10.850> well

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
so we'll see how this holds up well

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.650 
so we'll see how this holds up well
thank<00:03:11.990> you<00:03:12.140> for<00:03:12.320> watching
