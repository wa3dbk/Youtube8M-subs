 I bought them finite so that 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.960

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.270
 macerating but it is a maceration

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.580
 thyme and thyme lemon and rosemary for 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.920
 give it a touch 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.410
 also different and more aromatic we take 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.500
 a pan a little bit of oil 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.360
 our monolithic skillet that less than mónix 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.280
 We put our chicken back and forth 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.130
 you see that breasts are super finite 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.380
 with a minute on each side more than 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.710
 enough we add what is the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.520
 lemon thyme 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.520

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.250

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.379
