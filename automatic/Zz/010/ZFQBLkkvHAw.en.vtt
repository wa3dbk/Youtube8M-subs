00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 yes, welcome last at the lake 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.839
 I'm the smith and have the tank 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.730
 I made a small tutorial 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.190
 make that is gradual structured 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.509
 How do I build my models? 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.639
 tutorial is aimed above all 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.839
 beginners and those who are looking for the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.260
 I have never been interested in rapper 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.960
 I really dared to do that for a while 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.880
 I'm 25 years old I need it 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.590
 since I'm arguing are models 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.570
 in between, sometimes a few years 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.949
 break and taboo now in the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.080
 winter months simply lust again 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.969
 to get and build a model and me there 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.410
 on vacation , vacation is easy 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.410
 this step by step video 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.850
 so and we start the first step 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.190
 preparation 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.940
 First, the question is always what 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.649
 a model 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.329
 Do you want to build one now? 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.890
 German an American or 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.329
 a soviet tank completely builds 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.470
 no matter the marx city was no role 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.010
 you just have to you just for one 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.650
 decide 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.989
 I am now for a model 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.750
 decided on the ear are almost models 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.060
 panzer the tabletop strategy games 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.500
 were developed or even on dioramas 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.090
 to put the other background 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.640
 because they just are not happening now 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.119
 this arm almost a panzer three package 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.360
 Models j contains two tanks 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:21.539
 I've already built one together 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.430
 he looks so special on this 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.350
 armor is the simple design of the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.930
 are building together very fast 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.970
 little share and are as I said for 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.570
 the immediate use also thought to 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.430
 battlefield 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.979
 Here you can also see again so 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.090
 I do not have many parts 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.950
 easy for this model now 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.270
 decided to step by step 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.310
 Instructions also in the next few days 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.289
 ready to finish because of a revell 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.610
 armored cell phones average partially 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.259
 a few months because I always 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.569
 have ridden again where I do nothing 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.310
 or even do a bit more, or 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.789
 well how do you know how that is like you 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.619
 have time 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.300
 but I already have this tank 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.860
 formerly built by the world 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.149
 Here I have them again 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.410
 in comparison sink what actually the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.050
 difference between the two tanks 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.209
 So it's easy to see that 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.770
 the details at the rebel tank one 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.800
 whole corner are pronounced here looks 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.470
 one now only to further chains 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.180
 two doors, and here is one and got out 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.860
 there is nothing in the rebellion you have to 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.780
 individual armor part of the assemble the 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.370
 chain links live individually this is here 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.190
 at the mama almost header just one 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.440
 complete part 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.640
 the thing is just detail faithful pretty 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.730
 but also a bit 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.780
 more labor intensive if we have a model 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.610
 selected 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.470
 let's start getting everything right 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.540
 First you need a document 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.950
 I now have my pad here as 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.470
 I've been using it for years 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.390
 just been an old poster 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.280
 Here you can see it is often 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.250
 do not use before 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.970
 the white ones are enough 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.340
 from underlay next the other one 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.620
 I need material for that 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.209
 small kesting tinkered since I like it 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.040
 only sporadically said modellers 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.510
 I just have everything in a box 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.470
 packed so I can get the box 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.120
 and just start 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.000
 what we have ne crate everything in it 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.390
 of course whole lot of colors for which 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.390
 are clear 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.000
 here are a few pipettes that are for 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.970
 transportation of connections or even of 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.870
 Colors a few wooden sticks that needs 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.670
 to hear you always 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.980
 the gets her way, simply in 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.310
 McDonald's with five fingers discount.de 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.600
 lie why a few would come 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.489
 screwdriver with it I open the 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.470
 colors eyes because she has through too 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:32.269
 me around then a pair of tweezers 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.090
 finer and a slightly larger the 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.130
 always need one again 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.810
 Side cutter I use 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.209
 but not as often as you actually think 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.540
 everything a cutter and of course 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.250
 a different choice of brushes there 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.989
 you do not have to take expensive brushes 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.730
 or do any specialized brushes 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.700
 you very simple this in school 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.799
 at most, maybe you can 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.510
 the fine brush for the fine work 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.070
 there is a decent brush too 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.769
 recommend because he just a bit 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.570
 is more robust and easier to paint 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.600
 For example, we have a seat here 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.980
 a very roughly just one 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.620
 Just do not ask a little bit more 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.480
 So nice and handy are there you are 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.450
 As I said, he needs the many 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.370
 then I still have my box like one 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.810
 away shot glasses I always need 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.600
 if I want to mix colors or 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.000
 dilution with the film airbrush clear 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.940
 or just for that 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.380
 brush rhine to tilt 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.830
 There are single cleaners of rebels 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.900
 or even cheaper at the hardware store 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.370
 only tempo tina set of the may also be good 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.160
 to be used as a connection once 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.660
 full and costs only half of small 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.849
 Weber 0 1 I had once brought 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.270
 exactly the same effect is just like 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.590
 told 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.550
 priced is quite under pressure 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.860
 Hottest thing I always get from the waves 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.180
 take the contactless climate of contact 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.370
 dear of rewe is really good too 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.020
 process dries quickly and makes 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.819
 the whole thing would be very stable 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.139
 I also recommend with other plaintiffs 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.520
 i do not have that much experience i have 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:04.470
 have used ever but they are 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.389
 just not to put it that way 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.729
 we just need one more 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.380
 little jar the little jar is 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.419
 just for the sake of small parts et 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.250
 cetera pp that you are not grown 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.800
 a long time to complete I still 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.419
 nothing lost 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.490
 and of course the most important one 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.680
 decent cutter or too 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.479
 just a little bit better here 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.159
 I have a small set that I had 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.680
 bought me years ago here 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.690
 you can see I do well really great or 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.490
 Lovely so many nice knives for that 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.139
 I've been working a lot for a few years 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.080
 years and I think I 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:41.699
 You need felt twice 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.349
 not just unnecessarily cost money that is 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:45.900
 my main crafting stuff right one 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:48.210
 nice big stable theresa the 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.039
 blade is replaceable again and again 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.330
 each model breaks parts with it 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.460
 I have a sharp blade is that 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.840
 most important and also a little something in 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.740
 Of course, the hand is also the 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.150
 simple cutter now eg the are 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.009
 Maybe it was great, but I had to go 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.320
 just not feeling as much as I am 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.120
 now always difficult here can condition 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.330
 to do a really good job 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.800
 Endraß many also use a file 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.120
 to deburr I mean I have too 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.599
 wash once 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.919
 but it 's nothing to me anyway I do 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:20.669
 all this with the cutter knife and that 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.750
 works really well with it 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.430
 if the preparation so far 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.740
 we have finished everything 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:29.630
 and then in the next video too 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.630
 Step 2 begin to see
