00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
this this is probably like a little

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.440 
this this is probably like a little
whiskey<00:04:53.150> thing<00:04:53.360> what<00:04:53.780> that<00:04:53.930> looks<00:04:54.110> like<00:04:54.169> and

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
lastly the sweatshirt and this is the

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.880 
lastly the sweatshirt and this is the
reflection<00:05:01.490> hood<00:05:02.650> color<00:05:03.650> black<00:05:03.979> n<00:05:04.340> SRT<00:05:05.560> $86<00:05:06.560> so

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
reflection hood color black n SRT $86 so

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.909 
reflection hood color black n SRT $86 so
I<00:05:07.390> mean<00:05:08.390> that's<00:05:08.419> really<00:05:08.660> expensive<00:05:08.990> so<00:05:09.650> I

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
I mean that's really expensive so I

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.040 
I mean that's really expensive so I
guess<00:05:10.789> that's<00:05:10.940> kind<00:05:11.270> of<00:05:11.330> good<00:05:11.570> i<00:05:11.630> don't<00:05:11.840> know
