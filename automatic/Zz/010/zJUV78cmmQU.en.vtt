00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 personal hello okay I'm here to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.420
 record a tag is created by ag on 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.120
 would do 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.860
 she's a friend of ours that even 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.530
 participate in the literary forum between 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.350
 semicolons, and she created a tag 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.289
 What are we supposed to talk about the five books? 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.510
 that we would take to an island and I 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.850
 I believe there are five books that have 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.199
 importance in our life beyond 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.330
 until it will be a little different 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.240
 first I'm going to steal a little by 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.550
 six books instead of five and some 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.620
 I still have not read these books but I 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.719
 I'm risking this tag 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.770
 Because I know they're pretty good books. 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:44.670
 reflection and culture of a 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.350
 sweeping psychology and in 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.899
 sure I'm going to like it a lot 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.399
 books that we read and relay the rest of 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.820
 Our lives, let's go. 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.870
 the first book that I separated this 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.350
 edition of the cosac naify of war and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.320
 Peace season two two pocket books 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.920
 tomos I'll even show you that 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.420
 beautiful thing that this issue I have not yet 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.290
 I read war and peace 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:24.299
 I want to read, look at the cover with soldiers. 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:28.020

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.409
 you take a look at war and peace of 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:36.329
 Here and tolstoi 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:41.280
 inside the book inside the book 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.140
 we have some illustrations and here the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.140
 letrinha to give you an idea of 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.130
 how is it 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:53.280
 tá is a large letter is one that is here 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.930
 a guy and the huge mass has 2500 and 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.049
 few pages 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.560
 this collection of cosac naify and the translation 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.060
 was made straight from the Russian so it took 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.969
 three years to be produced 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.310
 of this book so I could not leave 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.500
 to take this book to a desert island 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.710
 The second book is a book I've already 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.050
 I'm tired of talking but I'll be back. 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.380
 John strip great hinterland of paths 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.780
 Guimarães Rosa This book I think 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.930
 to take only one book to a 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.930
 island this would be the book to those who do not 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.750
 read great sertão veredas do not know the 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.190
 who are missing the narrative is very 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.190
 riches and deals with all our dramas and 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.430
 of our joys also in a way 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.250
 as you have never read before in your 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.750
 I assure you, it 's a difficult book to 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.450
 read but it is an extremely 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.480
 the third book I 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.670
 take to an island is another one that I 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.800
 I have not read it yet but I'm sure it's 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.220
 a book that is going to mess with me a lot 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.150
 is a hundred years of solitude by gabriel garcía 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.460
 marquez 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.380
 I want to read this book this year he 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.470
 is in my goal of the twelve books to 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.890
 2013 I'm already finishing up this 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.100
 the next book I'm going to take to 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.610
 the island is thomas mann here 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:21.420
 magic mountain another falls to March 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.660
 are nearly a thousand pages okay and is a book 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.460
 extremely significant in history 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.570
 of world literature 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:33.660
 I did not read but I have a fascination 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.970
 for this book even without knowing the right to 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.190
 story, I do not know how to explain, you know when 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.160
 Do you have a fascination for something? 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.920
 that you do not know yet and I do not know if 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.550
 you have this kind of perception but it is 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:52.230
 This happens to me and this book here is 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:55.260
 everyone from afar is what gave me the most 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.500
 willingness to buy without even knowing the 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.590
 thomas mann's mountain history 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.520
 The next book is a little book that 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.800
 I already read this year the old man and the sea go 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.050
 this branch and since I will be in a 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.830
 island and here I will be on an island 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:16.859
 nothing like reading a book about the sea and 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.970
 This book is very beautiful, I loved it. 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.340
 I'll reread is a short 130 page book and 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.210
 sure it's on my list and 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.760
 ending this year I've already decided that I'm going 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.520
 read 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.400
 This is why I am losing even his fear and 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.680
 kimi punishment and I'm starting the law people 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.350
 poor poor people the first book of 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.300
 dostoievsky and I intend to read of the toy instead 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.620
 that poor people then read nights 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.570
 white 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.900
 hence I'm going to buy underground memories 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.810
 I still do not have it and I'm from here. 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:55.210
 I already have and this one says that the work 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:57.280
 his brother Karamazov's brothers did not 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.350
 I know what it's about and I know that 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.210
 beautiful edition translated from Russian 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.420
 directly I will not read any excess 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.210
 Look, I'm a boring boring person. 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.450
 when the earthquake with a book 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.670
 mainly foreign language 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.280
 translation has to be made from the original 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.380
 if it is not made of the original I'll already be 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.510
 discouraged then as I know 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:27.730
 dostoevsky is being translated from 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:30.910
 original tolstoi gogo ethics cove is 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.740
 several Russian authors, right? 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.380
 so I'm very excited to buy the 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.480
 collection of all of them and read them 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.260
 so this is the six books I 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:44.740
 I chose only to resume the brothers 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:48.100
