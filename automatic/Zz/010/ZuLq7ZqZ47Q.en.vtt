00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.670
 one of the segments that most attracts the desire 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.309
 of the Brazilian consumer is that of cars 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.730
 light and knife 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.340
 the abbey great pride in the offerings 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.130
 competition tightens the way is to use all 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.660
 the resources available to conquer 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.630
 more consumers 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.490
 is what made gm with an elite vectra the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.449
 most luxurious line 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.540
 now in addition to the 2.4 engine version 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:38.070
 have some cheaper engine 2.0 and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.540
 competitive position in the segment to 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.790
 within the proposal 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.329
 in addition to the weaker engine only come in 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.950
 gts hanging on the windshield that is the elite 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.270
 2.0 equals a 2.4 disguise for 100 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.489
 people 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.980
 seat belts with three points of 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.399
 support for everyone besides 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.930
 herbet front and side air 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.939
 conditioning and electrical 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.189
 board computer controller 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:14.509
 automatic speed where quality 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:18.060
 power steering lost in the trunk 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.549
 526 vitor for being the most sweaty version 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.220
 new and if you should have materials 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.530
 better quality finish both 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.330
 leather finish as the plastic 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.330
 panel is poor appearance 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.110
 another thing that does not please is the engine 2.0 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.720
 as it continues with the same force and 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.550
 make of old engines and the exchange 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.010
 automatic or power 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.640
 they showed little to move 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.770
 12 goal for this version worsening situation 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.040
 when fueled only with gasoline and 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.540
 loaded motor 7 almost seven 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.270
 horsepower 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.820
 just look at the numbers down there that 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.640
 you will see the difference of 15 shaft 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.470
 divide between vectra 2.0 with exchange 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:11.810
 manual and a 2.0 with automatic transmission 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:15.530
 mainly in large accelerations 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.700
 no difference is also felt in the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.830
 resumed 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.040
 besides low power and exchange 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.050
 four-speed automatic 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.590
 to the other vector 2.4 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.519
 in this version 2.0 is slow to reduce the 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.680
 march 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.610
 you can break the reduced branch 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.930
 manually 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.049
 looks better just be smart but not the 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.049
 ideal 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.069
 something else that does not match the engine 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.219
 2.0 and not with the performance that you 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.829
 offers even having a luxury car is the 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:53.730
 fuel consumption in the circuit 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:57.269
 earth did very little 4.5 of love 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.659
 chosen and alcohol and 5.9 we will put 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:06.379
 in practice sleeping sleep drinking 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:06.379
 engine v6 engine performance 1.6 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.220
 dynamically the automatic 2.0 is the same 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:18.829
 the other vectra or the position of driving 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.829
 precise direction but the perfect stroke 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.110
 vote disc brakes on all four wheels the 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.310
 df theme for 1 b1 cars in any 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.500
 situation 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.800
 a pity that because of the hoop wheels 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.260
 17-inch tires and low profile tires that 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.330
 with the serial vec 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.330
 they behaved in campanella 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.840
 the weight of the hour this elite version 2.0 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:51.260
 not convince the performance in the 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.500
 best consumption is weak in 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.239
 you really want the 2.0 model 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.060
 choose the version that has manual gearbox 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.640
 who ran the most balanced vectra 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.379
 now here between us if you really want 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.299
 an automatic vectra 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.510
 add a little more money and 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.390
 place the motor version 2.4 as the 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.269
 consumption is practically the same 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:18.220
 at least you will have more power and 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.220
 best shopping performance 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:27.620
 in the analysis of emÃ­lio vectra elite 2.0 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.440
 reach our average of 6.8 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.610
 the positive point were the internal space 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.970
