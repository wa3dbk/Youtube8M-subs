00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
texturing training we're going to be

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.830 
texturing training we're going to be
going<00:00:29.250> back<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.640> revisiting<00:00:29.789> our<00:00:30.359> texture

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
going back and revisiting our texture

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.120 
going back and revisiting our texture
we're<00:00:30.929> going<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.109> refine<00:00:31.410> actually<00:00:31.830> all<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
we're going to refine actually all the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.979 
we're going to refine actually all the
textures<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.730> scene<00:00:32.940> we're<00:00:33.149> gonna<00:00:33.270> take

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
textures in the scene we're gonna take

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.860 
textures in the scene we're gonna take
another<00:00:34.260> look<00:00:34.500> at<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.739> brass<00:00:35.690> one<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
another look at this brass one of the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.930 
another look at this brass one of the
things<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.260> happened<00:00:37.620> was<00:00:37.790> rendering<00:00:38.790> this

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
things that happened was rendering this

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.720 
things that happened was rendering this
in<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.149> steel<00:00:39.390> frame<00:00:39.680> this<00:00:40.680> all<00:00:40.920> these<00:00:41.399> textures

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
in a steel frame this all these textures

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.000 
in a steel frame this all these textures
look<00:00:41.969> pretty<00:00:42.239> good<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.809> then<00:00:43.440> once<00:00:43.860> we

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
look pretty good and then once we

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.410 
look pretty good and then once we
started<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.460> see<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.789> motion<00:00:45.000> which<00:00:45.390> is

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
started to see it in motion which is

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.209 
started to see it in motion which is
really<00:00:46.050> crucial<00:00:46.350> especially<00:00:46.770> when<00:00:47.100> you're

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
really crucial especially when you're

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.940 
really crucial especially when you're
doing<00:00:47.370> specular<00:00:47.969> or<00:00:48.000> reflective<00:00:48.600> textures<00:00:49.079> we

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
doing specular or reflective textures we

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.830 
doing specular or reflective textures we
saw<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.399> lot<00:00:50.670> isn't<00:00:51.090> working<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.570> saw<00:00:51.719> that

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
saw that a lot isn't working we saw that

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.600 
saw that a lot isn't working we saw that
the<00:00:51.960> reflection<00:00:52.320> reflections<00:00:53.070> are<00:00:53.190> too<00:00:53.340> hot

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the reflection reflections are too hot

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.740 
the reflection reflections are too hot
too<00:00:54.059> tight<00:00:54.870> too<00:00:55.230> precise<00:00:56.030> on<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.629> many

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
too tight too precise on so many

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.330 
too tight too precise on so many
different<00:00:58.170> materials<00:00:58.260> we're<00:00:58.890> gonna<00:00:59.010> be<00:00:59.160> real

we're<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.610> looking<00:01:05.790> at<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> base

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
we're going to be looking at the base

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.840 
we're going to be looking at the base
down<00:01:06.479> here<00:01:06.540> these<00:01:07.229> rocks<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.520> debris

down here these rocks and this debris

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.850 
down here these rocks and this debris
we're<00:01:09.119> going<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.420> texturing<00:01:10.350> those<00:01:10.590> as

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
we're going to be texturing those as

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.380 
we're going to be texturing those as
well<00:01:12.470> in<00:01:13.470> addition<00:01:14.030> we're<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.299> be

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
well in addition we're going to be

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.469 
well in addition we're going to be
adding<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.780> muzzle<00:01:16.110> flash<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
adding a muzzle flash in this in the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.080 
adding a muzzle flash in this in the
scene<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:20.340> scene<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.700> be<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> lot<00:01:21.060> more

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
scene the scene can be a lot more

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.090 
scene the scene can be a lot more
dramatic<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:21.960> there<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.229> an<00:01:22.409> actual<00:01:22.560> muzzle

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
dramatic if there is an actual muzzle

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.580 
dramatic if there is an actual muzzle
flash<00:01:23.280> blasting<00:01:23.909> at<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.060> end<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.600> weapon

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
flash blasting at the end of this weapon

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.520 
flash blasting at the end of this weapon
as<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.340> rotates<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.110> aside<00:01:28.110> from<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.380> being

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
as it rotates and aside from that being

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.280 
as it rotates and aside from that being
an<00:01:28.979> interesting<00:01:29.610> story<00:01:30.540> point<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> image

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
an interesting story point in the image

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.929 
an interesting story point in the image
it's<00:01:31.619> also<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:32.009> really<00:01:32.549> great<00:01:32.670> lighting

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it's also a really great lighting

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.270 
it's also a really great lighting
opportunity<00:01:33.650> we're<00:01:34.650> gonna<00:01:34.740> look<00:01:34.890> at<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> couple

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
opportunity we're gonna look at a couple

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.830 
opportunity we're gonna look at a couple
of<00:01:35.490> different<00:01:35.820> ways<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.180> approaching<00:01:36.450> that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
of different ways of approaching that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.050 
of different ways of approaching that
problem<00:01:37.159> one<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.340> ways<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.759> we're<00:01:38.970> going

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
problem one of the ways is we're going

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.120 
problem one of the ways is we're going
to<00:01:39.119> put<00:01:39.270> polygons<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.439> from<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.710> gun<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
to put polygons in from the gun and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.499 
to put polygons in from the gun and
we're<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> apply<00:01:41.670> some<00:01:41.729> painted

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
we're going to apply some painted

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.020 
we're going to apply some painted
textures<00:01:43.040> to<00:01:44.040> get<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.369> look<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> muzzle

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
textures to get it to look like a muzzle

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.120 
textures to get it to look like a muzzle
flash<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.540> we're<00:01:45.869> also<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.439> try<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
flash and we're also going to try a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.280 
flash and we're also going to try a
completely<00:01:47.759> different<00:01:48.329> approach<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.810> totally

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
completely different approach a totally

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.139 
completely different approach a totally
volumetric<00:01:49.680> effect<00:01:50.220> we're<00:01:50.820> gonna<00:01:50.970> add

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
volumetric effect we're gonna add

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.139 
volumetric effect we're gonna add
lighting<00:01:51.570> into<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.070> too<00:01:53.070> because<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.759> muzzle

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
lighting into it too because the muzzle

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.209 
lighting into it too because the muzzle
flash<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.570> course<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.140> an<00:01:55.350> explosion<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:56.070> front

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
flash of course is an explosion in front

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.639 
flash of course is an explosion in front
of<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.340> weapon<00:01:56.610> it's<00:01:56.759> an<00:01:57.060> intense<00:01:57.750> localized

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
of the weapon it's an intense localized

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.440 
of the weapon it's an intense localized
light<00:01:58.920> source<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.520> that's<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.270> really

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
light source and that's a really

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.179 
light source and that's a really
interesting<00:02:00.570> lighting<00:02:01.200> opportunity<00:02:01.829> for<00:02:02.040> us

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
interesting lighting opportunity for us

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.760 
interesting lighting opportunity for us
and<00:02:02.719> I<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.960> couple<00:02:04.469> of

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
and I have a couple of

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.850 
and I have a couple of
interesting<00:02:08.080> concrete<00:02:09.080> textures<00:02:09.500> here<00:02:09.649> look

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
interesting concrete textures here look

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.559 
interesting concrete textures here look
at<00:02:09.979> this<00:02:10.129> ones<00:02:10.399> add<00:02:10.910> a<00:02:10.970> little<00:02:11.239> bit<00:02:11.390> of<00:02:11.420> an

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
at this ones add a little bit of an

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.020 
at this ones add a little bit of an
angle<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:11.930> I'm<00:02:12.080> not<00:02:12.230> going<00:02:12.379> to<00:02:12.440> use<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:12.680> one

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
angle so I'm not going to use that one

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.580 
angle so I'm not going to use that one
this<00:02:14.030> one<00:02:14.269> actually<00:02:14.480> feels<00:02:14.989> really<00:02:15.170> good

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
this one actually feels really good

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.949 
this one actually feels really good
exactly<00:02:16.340> as<00:02:16.489> is<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.209> I'm<00:02:17.330> going<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.569> save<00:02:17.750> it

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.869 

save<00:02:20.959> as<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:22.010> notice<00:02:22.250> these<00:02:22.400> are<00:02:22.459> all<00:02:22.610> in<00:02:22.730> our

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
save as you notice these are all in our

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.300 
save as you notice these are all in our
text<00:02:23.180> or<00:02:23.299> photos<00:02:23.720> directory<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.410> will<00:02:24.830> not<00:02:25.010> save

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
text or photos directory I will not save

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.330 
text or photos directory I will not save
my<00:02:25.610> color<00:02:26.080> textures<00:02:27.080> in<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.799> same<00:02:27.980> directory

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
my color textures in the same directory

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.280 
my color textures in the same directory
up<00:02:28.400> with<00:02:28.549> them<00:02:28.640> in<00:02:28.760> their<00:02:28.849> own<00:02:29.080> proper<00:02:30.080> place

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
up with them in their own proper place

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:40.319 
up with them in their own proper place
in<00:02:30.319> images<00:02:32.980> say<00:02:33.980> once<00:02:34.400> again<00:02:34.519> it's<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.819> Targa

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.940 

treat<00:02:41.329> numbers<00:02:42.019> for<00:02:42.819> color

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
treat numbers for color

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.949 
treat numbers for color
TGA<00:02:46.150> 24<00:02:47.150> bit<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:49.700> I'm<00:02:49.790> going<00:02:49.819> to<00:02:49.970> take<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.569> luma

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
TGA 24 bit so I'm going to take the luma

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.780 
TGA 24 bit so I'm going to take the luma
from<00:02:51.319> this<00:02:51.500> which<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.099> black<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:52.700> white

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
from this which is the black and white

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.190 
from this which is the black and white
value<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.390> I'm<00:02:53.450> going<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.599> plug<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:53.900> into<00:02:54.019> the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
value and I'm going to plug it into the

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.920 
value and I'm going to plug it into the
specular<00:02:54.739> channel<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:56.360> see<00:02:56.510> what<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.750> does

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
specular channel and see what that does

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.589 
specular channel and see what that does
for<00:02:56.989> us<00:02:57.519> you<00:02:58.519> can<00:02:58.700> see<00:03:00.430> there<00:03:01.599> what's

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
for us you can see there what's

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.220 
for us you can see there what's
happening<00:03:04.360> you<00:03:05.360> know<00:03:05.480> I<00:03:05.510> think<00:03:05.720> we'll<00:03:06.049> also

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
happening you know I think we'll also

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.619 
happening you know I think we'll also
try<00:03:06.440> plugging<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:07.129> into<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.670> glossiness

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
try plugging it into the glossiness

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.410 
try plugging it into the glossiness
channel<00:03:09.140> too<00:03:09.760> it'll<00:03:10.760> tighten<00:03:11.030> up<00:03:11.269> the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
channel too it'll tighten up the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.090 
channel too it'll tighten up the
highlights<00:03:11.840> where<00:03:12.139> it's<00:03:12.290> brightest<00:03:12.769> where

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
highlights where it's brightest where

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.699 
highlights where it's brightest where
it's<00:03:13.220> whitest<00:03:13.609> and<00:03:14.079> hopefully<00:03:15.079> my<00:03:15.290> hope<00:03:15.500> is

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
it's whitest and hopefully my hope is

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.309 
it's whitest and hopefully my hope is
that<00:03:15.739> when<00:03:15.980> we<00:03:16.160> do<00:03:16.370> our<00:03:16.489> next<00:03:16.810> full<00:03:17.810> rotation

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
that when we do our next full rotation

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.530 
that when we do our next full rotation
of<00:03:18.410> this<00:03:18.530> will<00:03:18.769> see<00:03:19.160> little<00:03:19.430> sparkles<00:03:20.000> across

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
of this will see little sparkles across

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.809 
of this will see little sparkles across
the<00:03:20.780> rock<00:03:20.989> as<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:21.410> rotates<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:22.100> we're<00:03:22.670> not

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
the rock as it rotates and we're not

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.520 
the rock as it rotates and we're not
going<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.239> know<00:03:23.389> that<00:03:23.420> until<00:03:24.200> we<00:03:24.380> actually

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
going to know that until we actually

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.410 
going to know that until we actually
render<00:03:24.950> so<00:03:25.310> I'm<00:03:25.579> going<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:25.790> speculate<00:03:26.269> that

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
render so I'm going to speculate that

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.059 
render so I'm going to speculate that
that's<00:03:26.750> what<00:03:27.049> it<00:03:27.170> will<00:03:27.230> do<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.440> I'll<00:03:27.739> leave<00:03:28.040> it

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
that's what it will do and I'll leave it

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.229 
that's what it will do and I'll leave it
at<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.280> for<00:03:28.430> now<00:03:29.019> so<00:03:30.019> there<00:03:30.200> they<00:03:30.380> are<00:03:31.239> it's

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
at that for now so there they are it's

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.550 
at that for now so there they are it's
definitely<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.810> kind<00:03:33.019> of<00:03:33.109> thing<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.290> I<00:03:33.410> was

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
definitely the kind of thing that I was

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.080 
definitely the kind of thing that I was
going<00:03:33.769> for<00:03:33.889> oh<00:03:35.680> it's<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.739> small<00:03:36.920> detail<00:03:37.340> but

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
going for oh it's a small detail but

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.490 
going for oh it's a small detail but
because<00:03:38.389> there's<00:03:38.540> reflections<00:03:39.170> you<00:03:39.260> should

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
because there's reflections you should

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.050 
because there's reflections you should
see<00:03:39.680> light<00:03:39.859> playing<00:03:40.190> across<00:03:40.549> it<00:03:40.790> as<00:03:40.910> it

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
see light playing across it as it

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.580 
see light playing across it as it
rotates<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:42.280> because<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.870> luminous<00:03:44.870> part<00:03:45.139> at

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
rotates and because the luminous part at

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.190 
rotates and because the luminous part at
the<00:03:45.709> back<00:03:45.980> inside<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:46.940> louvers<00:03:47.299> is<00:03:47.569> quite<00:03:48.169> a

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
the back inside the louvers is quite a

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.150 
the back inside the louvers is quite a
bright<00:03:49.090> luminous<00:03:50.090> value<00:03:50.769> hopefully<00:03:51.769> you<00:03:51.919> will

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
bright luminous value hopefully you will

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.949 
bright luminous value hopefully you will
notice<00:03:52.489> that<00:03:52.609> but<00:03:52.849> once<00:03:53.239> again<00:03:53.510> we'll<00:03:53.690> see

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
notice that but once again we'll see

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.920 
notice that but once again we'll see
when<00:03:54.470> we<00:03:54.500> do<00:03:54.829> our<00:03:54.859> full<00:03:55.849> turntable<00:03:56.599> render

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
when we do our full turntable render

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.580 
when we do our full turntable render
again<00:03:57.109> for<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.620> third<00:03:57.650> time<00:03:59.169> we<00:04:00.169> can<00:04:00.349> go<00:04:00.470> ahead

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
again for the third time we can go ahead

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.890 
again for the third time we can go ahead
with<00:04:00.739> our<00:04:00.889> hue<00:04:01.280> and<00:04:01.519> pick<00:04:01.730> some<00:04:02.389> other<00:04:02.419> colors

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
with our hue and pick some other colors

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.430 
with our hue and pick some other colors
we<00:04:04.630> could<00:04:05.630> give<00:04:05.810> it<00:04:05.989> a<00:04:06.079> nice<00:04:06.260> purple

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
we could give it a nice purple

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.370 
we could give it a nice purple
now<00:04:09.440> let's<00:04:09.740> see<00:04:09.980> let<00:04:10.160> me<00:04:10.190> find<00:04:10.550> a<00:04:10.700> nice<00:04:10.850> I<00:04:11.380> think

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
now let's see let me find a nice I think

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.750 
now let's see let me find a nice I think
I<00:04:12.470> bought<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.710> nice<00:04:12.950> red<00:04:13.310> here<00:04:15.459> mmm<00:04:16.459> that's

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
I bought a nice red here mmm that's

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.240 
I bought a nice red here mmm that's
interesting<00:04:17.239> but<00:04:17.390> I'd<00:04:17.570> like<00:04:17.690> to<00:04:17.750> bring<00:04:18.250> I'd

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
interesting but I'd like to bring I'd

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.830 
interesting but I'd like to bring I'd
like<00:04:19.400> to<00:04:19.489> bring<00:04:19.609> the<00:04:19.730> brightness<00:04:20.000> down<00:04:20.390> try

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
like to bring the brightness down try

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.300 
like to bring the brightness down try
and<00:04:20.900> get<00:04:21.049> it<00:04:21.170> to<00:04:21.200> be<00:04:21.380> man<00:04:21.590> more<00:04:21.920> of<00:04:21.980> a<00:04:22.040> dark

and get it to be man more of a dark

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.160 
and get it to be man more of a dark
bloody<00:04:23.000> red<00:04:23.360> maybe<00:04:25.900> that's<00:04:26.900> pretty

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
bloody red maybe that's pretty

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.560 
bloody red maybe that's pretty
interesting

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
interesting

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.330 
interesting
I'm<00:04:29.570> just<00:04:29.780> I'm<00:04:30.140> gonna<00:04:30.380> turn<00:04:30.590> on<00:04:30.740> my<00:04:30.890> neutral

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
I'm just I'm gonna turn on my neutral

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.740 
I'm just I'm gonna turn on my neutral
light<00:04:31.460> here<00:04:31.730> for<00:04:31.910> them<00:04:32.030> just<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:32.330> get<00:04:32.450> a<00:04:32.510> better

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
light here for them just to get a better

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.050 
light here for them just to get a better
look<00:04:33.080> at<00:04:33.260> this<00:04:33.440> so<00:04:34.280> once<00:04:34.430> again<00:04:34.550> I'll<00:04:34.760> open<00:04:35.000> my

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
look at this so once again I'll open my

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.560 
look at this so once again I'll open my
see<00:04:35.360> editor<00:04:35.720> turn<00:04:36.140> on<00:04:36.260> my<00:04:36.380> neutral<00:04:36.740> light<00:04:37.510> so<00:04:38.510> I

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
see editor turn on my neutral light so I

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.830 
see editor turn on my neutral light so I
can<00:04:38.720> see<00:04:38.870> things<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.170> little<00:04:39.230> bit<00:04:39.470> better<00:04:39.650> and

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
can see things a little bit better and

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.720 
can see things a little bit better and
just<00:04:41.840> before<00:04:42.020> we<00:04:42.290> go<00:04:42.470> there<00:04:42.680> I'm<00:04:43.010> gonna<00:04:43.280> do<00:04:43.430> one

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
just before we go there I'm gonna do one

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.540 
just before we go there I'm gonna do one
more<00:04:43.930> turntable<00:04:44.930> render<00:04:45.260> of<00:04:45.380> this<00:04:45.560> just<00:04:46.460> to

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
more turntable render of this just to

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.520 
more turntable render of this just to
ensure<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:47.090> everything<00:04:47.840> is<00:04:48.020> working<00:04:48.230> the

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
ensure that everything is working the

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.020 
ensure that everything is working the
way<00:04:48.620> I<00:04:48.650> expect<00:04:49.100> it<00:04:49.190> to<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.460> way<00:04:49.550> it<00:04:49.640> seems<00:04:49.910> to

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
way I expect it to the way it seems to

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.630 
way I expect it to the way it seems to
be<00:04:50.270> in<00:04:50.660> these<00:04:51.169> still<00:04:51.470> images<00:04:51.830> it's<00:04:52.040> crucial<00:04:52.610> to

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
be in these still images it's crucial to

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.010 
be in these still images it's crucial to
do<00:04:52.850> that<00:04:53.000> before<00:04:53.270> moving<00:04:53.480> on<00:04:53.690> to<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:53.900> next

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
do that before moving on to the next

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.920 
do that before moving on to the next
step<00:04:54.400> so<00:04:55.400> that<00:04:55.520> we<00:04:55.640> don't<00:04:55.820> get<00:04:55.970> a<00:04:56.240> long<00:04:56.690> way

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
step so that we don't get a long way

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.960 
step so that we don't get a long way
down<00:04:56.960> a<00:04:57.169> road<00:04:57.500> and<00:04:57.730> discover<00:04:58.730> that<00:04:58.850> we<00:04:58.940> have

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
down a road and discover that we have

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.300 
down a road and discover that we have
some<00:04:59.300> major<00:04:59.450> problems<00:04:59.630> with<00:05:00.140> our<00:05:00.290> textures<00:05:00.740> so

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
some major problems with our textures so

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.950 
some major problems with our textures so
I'm<00:05:01.400> going<00:05:01.520> to<00:05:01.580> do<00:05:01.640> our<00:05:01.790> version<00:05:01.910> 3<00:05:02.390> turntable

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
I'm going to do our version 3 turntable

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.900 
I'm going to do our version 3 turntable
render<00:05:03.200> of<00:05:03.290> this<00:05:03.490> and<00:05:04.490> I'll<00:05:04.610> see<00:05:04.790> you<00:05:04.880> back

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
render of this and I'll see you back

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.030 
render of this and I'll see you back
here<00:05:05.300> then<00:05:05.330> I've<00:05:06.020> gone<00:05:06.200> in<00:05:06.470> back<00:05:06.650> into<00:05:06.890> buying

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
here then I've gone in back into buying

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.500 
here then I've gone in back into buying
volume<00:05:07.310> metrics<00:05:07.610> and<00:05:07.700> I<00:05:07.790> need<00:05:07.940> to<00:05:08.120> push<00:05:08.330> that

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
volume metrics and I need to push that

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.130 
volume metrics and I need to push that
out<00:05:08.570> so<00:05:08.780> I'm<00:05:08.870> going<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.050> increase<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:09.950> height

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
out so I'm going to increase the height

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.590 
out so I'm going to increase the height
which<00:05:12.140> will<00:05:12.350> make<00:05:12.470> it<00:05:12.500> longer<00:05:12.860> and<00:05:13.340> I<00:05:14.300> think

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
which will make it longer and I think

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.300 
which will make it longer and I think
that's<00:05:14.840> really<00:05:15.169> cool<00:05:15.410> and<00:05:15.590> VBR<00:05:15.919> as<00:05:16.130> we

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
that's really cool and VBR as we

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.190 
that's really cool and VBR as we
lengthen<00:05:16.760> this<00:05:17.060> we<00:05:17.240> can<00:05:17.419> see<00:05:17.660> the<00:05:17.810> volumetric

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
lengthen this we can see the volumetric

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.250 
lengthen this we can see the volumetric
push<00:05:18.680> out<00:05:19.030> and<00:05:20.030> we<00:05:20.390> can<00:05:20.540> even<00:05:20.690> see<00:05:20.900> it<00:05:21.020> cast

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
push out and we can even see it cast

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.690 
push out and we can even see it cast
shadows<00:05:21.680> from<00:05:21.770> our<00:05:21.950> guy<00:05:22.070> so<00:05:22.280> that's<00:05:22.370> pretty

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
shadows from our guy so that's pretty

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:31.620 
shadows from our guy so that's pretty
great<00:05:26.140> and<00:05:27.140> we'll<00:05:27.320> have<00:05:27.440> another<00:05:27.650> peak<00:05:27.919> in<00:05:28.190> vpr

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.360 

mmm<00:05:32.630> that's<00:05:32.810> looking<00:05:33.290> pretty<00:05:33.370> interesting

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
mmm that's looking pretty interesting

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.280 
mmm that's looking pretty interesting
actually<00:05:35.800> so<00:05:36.800> I'm<00:05:37.790> gonna<00:05:38.090> pop<00:05:38.360> into<00:05:38.720> my<00:05:38.840> camera

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
actually so I'm gonna pop into my camera

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.260 
actually so I'm gonna pop into my camera
view<00:05:40.570> I'll<00:05:41.570> go<00:05:41.870> back<00:05:42.020> and<00:05:42.290> I<00:05:42.350> will<00:05:42.500> turn<00:05:43.270> well

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
view I'll go back and I will turn well

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.550 
view I'll go back and I will turn well
I'm<00:05:44.450> gonna<00:05:44.540> do<00:05:44.720> three<00:05:44.870> things<00:05:45.169> I'm<00:05:45.350> going<00:05:45.500> to

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
I'm gonna do three things I'm going to

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.650 
I'm gonna do three things I'm going to
turn<00:05:45.740> my<00:05:46.340> volumetric<00:05:46.729> light<00:05:47.060> back<00:05:47.210> on<00:05:47.390> I'm

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
turn my volumetric light back on I'm

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.810 
turn my volumetric light back on I'm
gonna<00:05:47.870> turn<00:05:48.140> radiosity<00:05:48.620> on<00:05:48.979> I'm<00:05:49.460> going<00:05:49.610> to<00:05:49.700> set

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
gonna turn radiosity on I'm going to set

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.180 
gonna turn radiosity on I'm going to set
the<00:05:49.910> camera<00:05:50.090> up<00:05:50.300> to<00:05:50.479> make<00:05:50.660> sure<00:05:50.840> I<00:05:50.870> capture<00:05:51.710> the

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
the camera up to make sure I capture the

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.700 
the camera up to make sure I capture the
full<00:05:52.430> volume<00:05:52.640> that<00:05:52.940> you<00:05:53.060> can<00:05:53.210> afraid<00:05:53.570> and<00:05:54.500> then

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
full volume that you can afraid and then

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.440 
full volume that you can afraid and then
I'm<00:05:54.830> going<00:05:54.950> to<00:05:55.010> render<00:05:55.190> this<00:05:55.430> out<00:05:55.610> as<00:05:55.820> a<00:05:55.850> final

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
I'm going to render this out as a final

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.469 
I'm going to render this out as a final
render<00:05:56.750> for<00:05:56.990> this<00:05:57.200> project<00:05:57.440> and<00:05:58.330> there's<00:05:59.330> our

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
render for this project and there's our

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.580 
render for this project and there's our
final<00:05:59.660> render<00:06:00.190> so<00:06:01.190> in<00:06:02.150> this<00:06:02.330> second<00:06:03.020> volume<00:06:03.200> of

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
final render so in this second volume of

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.790 
final render so in this second volume of
lightly<00:06:04.040> of<00:06:04.190> texturing<00:06:04.550> we've<00:06:04.729> covered<00:06:05.800> in

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
lightly of texturing we've covered in

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.520 
lightly of texturing we've covered in
depth<00:06:07.340> and<00:06:07.580> in<00:06:07.700> detail<00:06:08.090> texture<00:06:08.930> refining

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
depth and in detail texture refining

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.380 
depth and in detail texture refining
process<00:06:10.010> so<00:06:10.160> the<00:06:10.250> process<00:06:10.729> of<00:06:10.880> looking<00:06:11.090> at

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390 
process so the process of looking at

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.800 
process so the process of looking at
textures<00:06:11.900> piece<00:06:12.500> by<00:06:12.740> piece<00:06:13.630> working<00:06:14.630> through

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
textures piece by piece working through

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.510 
textures piece by piece working through

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
them one at a time to create what you
