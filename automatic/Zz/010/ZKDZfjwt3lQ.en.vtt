female Pokemon just to avoid the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.110 
female Pokemon just to avoid the
frustration<00:02:33.049> of<00:02:34.049> a<00:02:34.319> tract<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:35.310> not<00:02:35.760> really

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
frustration of a tract it's not really

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.240

the fire type weakness and fire types

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.940 
the fire type weakness and fire types
are<00:07:18.060> pretty<00:07:19.060> common<00:07:19.540> in<00:07:19.660> this<00:07:19.780> generation<00:07:20.320> so

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:20.950 
are pretty common in this generation so

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.220 
are pretty common in this generation so
you<00:07:21.010> probably<00:07:21.370> have<00:07:21.730> a<00:07:21.790> fire<00:07:22.390> type<00:07:22.720> move<00:07:23.020> of

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.230 
you probably have a fire type move of

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.920 
you probably have a fire type move of
some<00:07:23.500> sort<00:07:24.000> or<00:07:25.000> something<00:07:25.600> to<00:07:25.720> deal<00:07:25.900> with

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:25.930 
some sort or something to deal with

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.990 
some sort or something to deal with
steel<00:07:26.290> type<00:07:26.500> steel<00:07:26.830> types<00:07:27.040> are<00:07:27.250> also<00:07:27.370> weak<00:07:27.730> to

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 
steel type steel types are also weak to

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.540 
steel type steel types are also weak to
ground<00:07:28.300> types<00:07:28.720> and<00:07:29.380> ground<00:07:29.890> types<00:07:30.130> are<00:07:30.370> pretty

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:30.550 
ground types and ground types are pretty

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.660 
ground types and ground types are pretty
common<00:07:30.850> -<00:07:31.440> anyways<00:07:32.440> that<00:07:32.650> wraps<00:07:32.890> up<00:07:33.100> Grimsley

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:33.670 
common - anyways that wraps up Grimsley

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.000 
common - anyways that wraps up Grimsley
he<00:07:33.970> isn't<00:07:34.270> too<00:07:34.420> bad<00:07:34.630> I<00:07:35.020> don't<00:07:35.230> really<00:07:35.500> find<00:07:35.800> him

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.010 
he isn't too bad I don't really find him

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.780 
he isn't too bad I don't really find him
that<00:07:36.130> difficult<00:07:37.170> anyways<00:07:38.170> next<00:07:38.560> time<00:07:38.950> we<00:07:39.610> will

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:39.790 
that difficult anyways next time we will

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.450 
that difficult anyways next time we will
be<00:07:39.910> taking<00:07:40.360> on<00:07:40.540> the<00:07:41.290> very<00:07:41.320> elegant<00:07:42.250> and
