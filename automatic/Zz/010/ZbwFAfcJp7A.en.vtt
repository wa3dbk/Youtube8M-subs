00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 and when youtube missing 90 with a 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.940
 new video at least this time 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.200
 ends this gameplay that the game does not 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.940
 go 3 as they have asked you quite 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.370
 we have given me enough emails 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.809
 electronic asking me this gameplay 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.370
 let's start a little with what is 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.160
 let's focus on what the campaign is 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.270
 surely there is multiplayer but let's go 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.119
 to play a little the campaign so that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.980
 you can see this a little bit 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.570
 graphics the gameplay the functions 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.670
 the controls and see if this 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.760
 they like it or not and it's worth it 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.030
 buy it and download it 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.760
 but well let's continue with this 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.940
 this something important is that it is 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.969
 we can a little expensive and this is also 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.949
 very heavy weighs a lot and well let's 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.870
 see here is a little about 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.140
 introduction to the game the graphs of 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.159
 they are truly the best they are excellent for 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.180
 those sides and you can not complain 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.180
 absolutely nothing 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.230
 I think if we go a bit this part and 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.120
 let's see a bit of the gameplay not 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.890
 by shooting and playing airplay but this 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.909
 here they only show what they are 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.760
 the controls as you can 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:14.660
 appreciate and let's see how to shoot 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.040
 touch to shoot them and kill them was 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:21.250
 simple nothing fancy 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.770
 and that we intend this to use the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.600
 selected skill in all kinds of 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.810
 streets and style and now ko 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.170
 ok swipe to see the change of the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.170
 view 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.430
 and well I saw it and touch the triangle 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.670
 to jump let's jump to see how 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.670
 we are going 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.680
 and well, since here I am doing 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.680
 its introduction 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.979
 in my foot more soldiers coat for nothing 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.299
 let's see a little leave your 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.979
 comments on how you think 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.530
 this guy from before and if as I am 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.969
 doing right now by bringing them in the 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.609
 screen of the video so that you what 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.709
 can see this with good definition and 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.810
 aside the video from the camera so that 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.400
 see how those who play or if they 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.140
 would like only the video of the 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.819
 camera them comments not because this 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.190
 channel is based and is formed according to what 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.190
 that you ask, we will continue 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.960
 ok here are the dialogues but let's 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.780
 give skip to not be so long is not 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.910
 this video and we're going to start killing 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.860
 these people are supposed to with this button 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.960
 shooting 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.960
 would worry about taking down a sneijder 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.500
 that is, if we can find it 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.550
 this Thursday is available for what 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.050
 ipad iphone is the iphone ipod touch 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.690
 playability is not bad I was 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.610
 playing on iphone like this I am not 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.850
 very lover of this type of games for 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.000
 The person devices I like the most 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.560
 games like more mobile-focused 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.080
 it's people who are very good at playing that 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.540
 kind of games and they like that guy 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.790
 of games playing them on an ipad is provided 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.680
 a little more but you can not 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:19.040
 check it for you checks 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.610
 since they are not cheap 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.920
 - This one is a bit expensive at the start 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.020
 of the video appeared what is the 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.290
 price the lapse of mexico and the app store 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.329
 United States 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.920
 and this one who does not let himself be shot does not 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.300
 it stops us moving 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.300
 I believe that I will never move from here 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.540
 to do a little more 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.310
 we can see now I do not have this 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.340
 they have us and from above 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.720
 I have killed 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.080
 the brothers we are going to see him return to 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.080
 try 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.760
 but well that's not to teach is 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.670
 how to play, much less is that 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.890
 you can see the gameplay though 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.930
 they call me many times to use them to 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.930
 that because we already regret once 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.889
 the effects are very good so yes no 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.879
 humans that I'm very used to 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:30.330
 play in what is a control in a 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:30.330
 console 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.000
 let Stone 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:46.800
 I did not have the opportunity to play the 2 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:50.030
 the 100 that we were united to kill 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.030
 we will retrying 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.560
 again the day then let's jump what 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.029
 then he changes his weapons 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.540
 that is, he pointed 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.569
 ok here is also one that I always 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:18.889
 is killing I think we're going to change 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.889
 another weapon that follows a little better 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.669
 and if as I said, leave your 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.260
 comments is very important to know if 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.180
 they like companies and how I am 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.740
 doing right now that you see in the 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.389
 screen that is appreciated a bit more what 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.760
 which are graphics that looks a bit 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.900
 more I say can not appreciate what they are 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.060
 the graphics for example some versions 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.100
 they died to kill but good 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.169
 basically it was bringing them a part of the 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.740
 game for you to see the 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:48.900
 playability the graphics this how is the 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.030
 environment a bit 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.040
 and very good friends can no longer pass from 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.110
 that I had gone a little better 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:01.380
 previously if this had happened 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:03.360
 mission but record but well I hope that 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.039
 you liked the comments 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.690
 they are very important if you like this 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.009
 game that you think the cost and if 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.150
 they want us to make the teeth of this 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:13.430
 way also this 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.280
 the button I like something well known in 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.620
 A lot to motivate us, keep uploading videos 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.210
 the more response and let you one 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.880
 just as much as they give us they are united to this 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.800
 channel sign up in the part here 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.170
 up I have been missing friends selling 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.550
 to finish missing 90 I think it has 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.700
 liked this example and see you in the 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.700
 next
