00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.960
 no doubt the world of warcraft from 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.550
 blizzard and is the undisputed leader 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.769
 among mmr pg 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.900
 almost a decade title blizzard 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.150
 sit on his throne contemptuously 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.310
 observing down on pathetic attempts to steal 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.949
 his crown but do not be fooled in 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.380
 warcraft were rivals their was so 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.869
 many that sometimes you can easily get off 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.710
 from the account one thing for all applicants 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.470
 was shared 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.230
 they lost every year we watch 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.090
 the birth of another killer Vova came to 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.399
 the fact that this term is so lost 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.380
 their power that they began to call any 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.960
 a game that looks promising 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.329
 despite the domination of the blizzard felt 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.670
 market pressure 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.620
 and yet the world of warcraft kept his 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.899
 crown leaving behind a train of 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.030
 battered and broken pretenders that 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.039
 makes the game so popular as she 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.110
 keeps popularity and loyalty among 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.210
 their players so long and 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.100
 why despite the care of many of them 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.829
 she remains one of the most popular 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.409
 games in the world 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.030
 availability and mass appeal 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.700
 It happened so that most mr pg 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.830
 difficult to master many see in this 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.790
 a certain charm once a player 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.650
 studies the basics 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.290
 he feels joy and pride in himself 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.479
 slightly overcoming the first difficulties of the player 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.790
 sense of self-importance increases 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.180
 this first experience is seasoned with all sorts 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.650
 goodies right up to end game content 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.110
 the original world of warcraft raised this 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.689
 difficulty bar and since then constantly and 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.780
 and lowers and it is not necessarily bad 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.820
 trend despite the fact that the decline 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.950
 the difficulty of the game has hit the number 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.049
 hardcore community she also lured 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.470
 millions of hardcore lovers 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.990
 soul 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.780
 In short the world of warcraft probably 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.180
 The most accessible and understandable IFA in the world 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.310
 after a while the new arrivals 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.960
 players become permanent 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.040
 Subscribers who can become skilled 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.649
 gameplay players want to immediately say that 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.899
 World of Warcraft is not suited to all a 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.090
 a while ago I deactivated my account 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.640
 because I got bored although recently 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.369
 thought about returning must say 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.520
 it was fun very very fun 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.470
 each class by them 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.690
 from their unique pieces and abilities 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.550
 that contributes to satisfying whims 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.280
 mixed players and how nice 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.470
 swing call it skinner box if 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.360
 you like but the world of warcraft gives you 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.400
 sense of success every time you 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.130
 raise your level finish 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.380
 quest or get new skill experience 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.630
 in general, a very positive world 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.400
 warcraft became that second breath for 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.150
 urgently needed genre 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.070
 resuscitation marketing is never worth it 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.560
 underestimate the power of marketing 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.420
 blizzard campaigns too 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.580
 see what they have achieved 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.740
 Of course, part of the success was obtained 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.380
 due to the authority that the company itself 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.180
 by itself a good pr if what company and 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.690
 can be called the legendary toyota 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.120
 blizzard 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.520
 even before the release of world of warcraft they 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.410
 created a number of the best games in their genres from 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.360
 ever existed portfolio 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.050
 Blizzard before starting Vova was 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.940
 perfect 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.560
 so many have subscribed for 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.840
 the fact that the company is always everything 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.330
 it turns out more blizzard not 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.920
 skimped on the ad campaign all of them 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.680
 marketing moves were incredible 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.270
 successful which accelerated the process 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.240
 popularization type but in general itâ€™s also 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.709
 fair for inside gaming experience 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.130
 blizzard knows what their fans need and 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.280
 provides them with constant updates 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.130
 fans 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.440
 one word world of warcraft is facebook 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.540
 all i mr pg in which many play 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.670
 because their friends are playing and 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.600
 besides this, they themselves have invested a lot 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.850
 labor in the game 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.240
 One of the strengths is that 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.350
 the game for many players has become permanent 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.420
 pastime many continue 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.459
 to play in the Islands because they have already penetrated 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.720
 play and start playing another mmorpg 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.640
 will be labor on content of course 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.170
 There are reasons why the world of warcraft 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.480
 so long remains on the throne 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.030
 blizzard excelled in constant release 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.190
 updates and add-ons to the game even in spite of 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.350
 big additions for example cataclysm and 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.620
 pandaria in cars and in themselves hundreds of small 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.959
 goodies produced with every 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.090
 Don such as dungeons weapons and 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.370
 new quest chains are 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.650
 the constancy of the release of updates allowed 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.380
 blizzard to keep in shape when others 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.690
 games are already closing their servers loyalty 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.299
 quality standards serves good service 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.340
 companies like in any other game in 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.199
 vove enough bugs and glitches but they 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.060
 insignificant compared to other games 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:31.650
 this genre both new and 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:34.050
 well-established social component as 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.150
 I often heard many players dedicate 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.560
 the time of the world of warcraft for reasons honestly 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.750
 not related to the game itself 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.699
 loyalty to friends and colleagues with whom 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.680
 they play doing their thing 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.479
 one of my friends met her 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.430
 future husband is in avi 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.530
 others have strong 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.169
 familiarity in such things 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.330
 Islands play the role of mediator blizzard 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.520
 deserves respect for entering the game 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.600
 social element that holds 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.310
 and returns players to their ranks 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.270
 employee dedication except 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.370
 loyal players 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.650
 it is worth remembering the staff who assiduously 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.900
 my personal experience is trying for us 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.180
 communicating with the dwarves and the blizzard was extremely 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.460
 positive they behaved presentably 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.320
 and were always ready to assist with 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.860
 most were just interested 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.840
 to chat 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.090
 one even beat his greeting and 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.919
 farewell the form of role-playing was true 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.020
 several cases when waiting time 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.599
 the answer was a little more than I would like 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.700
 but in general, the desire and opportunity to help 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:32.550
 blizzard workers are always on top 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.860
 believe me they work I dealt with 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.310
 many terrible admins and who is not and 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.410
 it honestly spoiled the impression of the game 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.330
 culture last but not least 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.880
 an aspect that helped the game rise 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.449
 the world of warcraft became part of the modern 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.099
 cultures 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.590
 try to find at least one person 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:50.190
 who never heard of the world of 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.590
 warcraft 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.630
 and now find at least 4 which 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.510
 never played god at least once 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:00.960
 you are unlikely to find such people 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:03.990
 the outcome of the WOV holds the throne of government over 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.060
 all MMP pg games for many years these 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.960
 he owes his diligence to blizzard to high 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.240
 game quality 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.950
 maybe the trance will be shaken soon because 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.560
 New subscription and gaming payment schemes 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.990
 time has passed and the words of the game look like 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.850
 much brighter and and the current brilliance of many 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.010
 declare that a sharp drop in numbers 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.080
 Subscriptions may result in a final 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.940
 the death of the game especially due to the fact that 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.190
 blizzard spends time on the next em 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.110
 uma project at least vov can 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.750
 give primacy to no other project 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.300
 more promising but I think that 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.920
 this day is of course still a long blizzard 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.520
 know how to adapt to new 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.040
 conditions 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.530
 they are already considering a microtransaction scheme 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.810
 or even the period of the game in fritupley 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.970
 yes and finally we must see that game 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.770
 which will be able to put Islands on their knees 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.990
 but so far we have not met a single game 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.810
 which even remotely deserved 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:54.800
 the name of the killer is Vova but until then yes 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.800
 live the king 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.810
 team x affairs and looking for sites for 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.730
 translation partnerships 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.770
 trailers and tiger reviews with 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.490
 offers to contact the administration 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.750
