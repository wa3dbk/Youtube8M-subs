00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
actually a Genesis inside that console

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.830 
actually a Genesis inside that console
there<00:01:05.140> is<00:01:05.170> a<00:01:05.320> powell<00:01:05.650> motherboard<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:06.840> it's

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
there is a powell motherboard and it's

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.830 
there is a powell motherboard and it's
currently<00:01:08.140> set<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.409> pal<00:01:08.770> actually<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:10.630> got<00:01:10.780> a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
currently set to pal actually it's got a

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.539 
currently set to pal actually it's got a
switch<00:01:11.049> this<00:01:11.259> modification<00:01:11.710> on<00:01:12.189> it<00:01:12.310> and<00:01:12.460> it's

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
switch this modification on it and it's

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.300 
switch this modification on it and it's
set<00:01:12.790> to<00:01:12.820> pal<00:01:13.119> and<00:01:13.420> if<00:01:14.350> I<00:01:14.469> pan<00:01:14.710> around<00:01:14.920> again

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
set to pal and if I pan around again

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.630 
set to pal and if I pan around again
here<00:01:16.049> panning<00:01:17.049> on<00:01:17.200> my<00:01:17.409> extra<00:01:17.979> energy<00:01:18.340> being

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
here panning on my extra energy being

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.459 
here panning on my extra energy being
interface<00:01:19.380> photo<00:01:20.380> zoom<00:01:20.799> in<00:01:21.009> alert<00:01:21.930> see<00:01:22.930> if<00:01:23.259> we

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:23.469 
interface photo zoom in alert see if we

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.340 
interface photo zoom in alert see if we
can<00:01:23.680> see<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:25.390> we<00:01:25.509> can<00:01:25.689> see<00:01:25.899> at<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.170> bottom

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
can see that so we can see at the bottom

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.950 
can see that so we can see at the bottom
the<00:01:26.680> vertical<00:01:27.100> refresh<00:01:27.430> is<00:01:27.700> 49<00:01:28.210> point<00:01:28.509> 6

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
the vertical refresh is 49 point 6

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.819 
the vertical refresh is 49 point 6
because<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.950> console<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.549> set<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:31.149> pal<00:01:31.829> so

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
because the console is set to pal so

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.279 
because the console is set to pal so
again<00:01:33.789> some<00:01:34.000> of<00:01:34.030> this<00:01:34.210> may<00:01:34.450> not<00:01:34.600> show<00:01:34.899> up<00:01:34.960> too

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
again some of this may not show up too

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.529 
again some of this may not show up too
well<00:01:35.320> on<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.799> video<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.460> certainly<00:01:37.270> not<00:01:37.420> as

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
well on the video and certainly not as

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:38.910 
well on the video and certainly not as
well<00:01:37.719> as<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:37.840> does<00:01:38.140> when<00:01:38.320> you're<00:01:38.530> looking<00:01:38.770> at

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
well as it does when you're looking at

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.399 
well as it does when you're looking at
it<00:01:38.950> for<00:01:39.219> real<00:01:39.430> but<00:01:40.329> I'm<00:01:40.630> going<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:40.840> pan<00:01:41.049> back<00:01:41.259> to

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
it for real but I'm going to pan back to

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.240 
it for real but I'm going to pan back to
the<00:01:41.500> TV<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:43.320> zoom<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.469> again<00:01:44.829> to<00:01:45.130> get

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
the TV and zoom and again to get

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:57.139 
the TV and zoom and again to get
everything<00:01:45.520> in<00:01:45.850> view<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:52.920> let<00:01:53.920> me<00:01:54.039> just<00:01:54.070> check

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.620 

ok<00:01:58.149> close<00:01:58.719> enough<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.320> would<00:01:59.380> say<00:01:59.710> and<00:02:00.630> right

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
ok close enough I would say and right

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.539 
ok close enough I would say and right
now<00:02:01.929> what<00:02:02.109> I'm<00:02:02.229> going<00:02:02.439> to<00:02:02.499> do<00:02:02.710> is<00:02:02.920> go<00:02:03.130> into<00:02:03.280> the

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
now what I'm going to do is go into the

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:09.290 
now what I'm going to do is go into the
scroll<00:02:03.909> test<00:02:06.990> like<00:02:07.990> so

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
scroll test like so

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.640 
scroll test like so
and<00:02:11.240> again<00:02:12.240> with<00:02:12.510> frame<00:02:12.750> rates<00:02:13.020> not<00:02:13.200> matching

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
and again with frame rates not matching

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.100 
and again with frame rates not matching
between<00:02:13.800> here<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.520> YouTube<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.270> everywhere

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
between here and YouTube and everywhere

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.470 
between here and YouTube and everywhere
else<00:02:16.320> you<00:02:17.280> won't<00:02:17.400> all<00:02:17.610> have<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:17.970> take<00:02:18.150> my<00:02:18.300> word

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
else you won't all have to take my word

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.510 
else you won't all have to take my word
for<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.990> this<00:02:19.200> scrolling<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:19.980> fairly

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
for it that this scrolling is fairly

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.900 
for it that this scrolling is fairly
smooth<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.870> we're<00:02:22.050> at<00:02:22.170> 50<00:02:22.680> Hertz<00:02:23.130> here<00:02:23.460> and

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
smooth so we're at 50 Hertz here and

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.120 
smooth so we're at 50 Hertz here and
what<00:02:24.180> I'm<00:02:24.270> going<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.450> do<00:02:24.600> now<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.710> using<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
what I'm going to do now is using the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.280 
what I'm going to do now is using the
switch<00:02:26.790> list<00:02:27.090> mod<00:02:27.300> I'm<00:02:27.600> going<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.020> switch<00:02:28.260> to

motherboard<00:05:26.520> so<00:05:30.800> flick<00:05:31.800> this<00:05:31.950> one<00:05:32.280> on<00:05:32.430> this

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
motherboard so flick this one on this

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.170 
motherboard so flick this one on this
one<00:05:33.090> doesn't<00:05:33.300> have<00:05:33.450> a<00:05:33.630> 50<00:05:34.410> 60<00:05:34.590> hertz<00:05:34.980> which<00:05:36.110> so

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
one doesn't have a 50 60 hertz which so

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.300 
one doesn't have a 50 60 hertz which so
hum<00:05:39.180> background<00:05:40.370> we<00:05:41.370> have<00:05:41.460> a<00:05:41.490> drive<00:05:41.790> in<00:05:42.000> there

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
hum background we have a drive in there

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.969 
hum background we have a drive in there
same<00:05:44.310> as<00:05:44.460> before

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
same as before

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.850 
same as before
notice<00:05:46.979> now<00:05:47.280> that<00:05:47.870> the<00:05:48.870> vertical<00:05:49.440> refresh

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
notice now that the vertical refresh

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.130 
notice now that the vertical refresh
rate<00:05:50.040> is<00:05:50.070> fifty<00:05:50.460> nine<00:05:50.610> point<00:05:50.880> nine<00:05:51.180> which<00:05:51.930> is<00:05:52.110> a

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
rate is fifty nine point nine which is a

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.570 
rate is fifty nine point nine which is a
lot<00:05:52.350> closer<00:05:52.680> to<00:05:53.010> the<00:05:53.630> NTSC<00:05:54.630> spec<00:05:55.169> and<00:05:55.580> that's

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
lot closer to the NTSC spec and that's

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.300 
lot closer to the NTSC spec and that's
significant

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
significant

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:06.409 
significant
so<00:05:59.310> backyard<00:05:59.940> again<00:06:00.950> and<00:06:04.430> my<00:06:05.430> game<00:06:05.760> it<00:06:06.180> should

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
so backyard again and my game it should

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.320 
so backyard again and my game it should
take<00:06:06.690> us<00:06:06.720> straight<00:06:06.990> back<00:06:07.470> to<00:06:07.770> 240p<00:06:08.760> test<00:06:08.790> suite

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
take us straight back to 240p test suite

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.659 
take us straight back to 240p test suite
and<00:06:10.229> down<00:06:10.470> to<00:06:10.680> the<00:06:10.770> scroll<00:06:11.070> test<00:06:13.310> and<00:06:14.310> just<00:06:14.580> a

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 
and down to the scroll test and just a

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.580 
and down to the scroll test and just a
moment<00:06:15.030> by<00:06:15.150> my<00:06:15.360> TV<00:06:16.229> derps<00:06:16.500> around<00:06:16.979> there<00:06:17.940> we<00:06:18.000> go

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
moment by my TV derps around there we go

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.960 
moment by my TV derps around there we go
and<00:06:19.590> this<00:06:20.010> time<00:06:21.140> you'll<00:06:22.140> see<00:06:22.500> that<00:06:22.970> the

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
and this time you'll see that the

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.760 
and this time you'll see that the
scrolling<00:06:24.300> is<00:06:24.570> smooth<00:06:24.870> well<00:06:25.260> you<00:06:25.560> can't

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
scrolling is smooth well you can't

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.830 
scrolling is smooth well you can't
really<00:06:25.860> tell<00:06:26.190> again<00:06:26.940> because<00:06:27.270> of<00:06:27.419> differences

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
really tell again because of differences

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.530 
really tell again because of differences
in<00:06:28.020> framerate<00:06:28.760> between<00:06:29.760> here<00:06:29.970> and<00:06:30.000> YouTube

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
in framerate between here and YouTube

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.230 
in framerate between here and YouTube
but<00:06:30.570> you'll<00:06:31.440> notice<00:06:31.710> that<00:06:32.010> there's<00:06:32.220> no<00:06:32.520> lines

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
but you'll notice that there's no lines

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.589 
but you'll notice that there's no lines
cutting<00:06:33.840> across<00:06:34.200> the<00:06:34.260> screen<00:06:35.030> so<00:06:36.030> the<00:06:36.270> problem

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 
cutting across the screen so the problem

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:36.780

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:29.850 
not so far off spec but it all depends

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.250 
not so far off spec but it all depends
so<00:07:30.850> when<00:07:31.120> I<00:07:31.150> have<00:07:31.390> tried<00:07:31.600> that<00:07:31.750> I'll<00:07:31.900> report
