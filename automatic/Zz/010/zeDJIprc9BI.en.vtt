there's a user manual just gives very
quick<00:00:09.360> overview<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.780> how<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.960> set<00:00:10.230> yourself<00:00:10.349> we

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
quick overview of how to set yourself we

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.589 
quick overview of how to set yourself we
have<00:00:11.099> three<00:00:11.490> pin<00:00:11.700> code<00:00:11.969> which<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.300> can<00:00:12.420> see

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
have three pin code which you can see

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.709 
have three pin code which you can see
here<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:14.070> output<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.849> 5<00:00:15.120> volt<00:00:15.420> 1

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
here and the output on this is 5 volt 1

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.930 
here and the output on this is 5 volt 1
amp<00:00:15.750> DC<00:00:16.320> ok<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.340> then<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:17.520> look<00:00:17.640> at<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.760> front

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
amp DC ok and then we look at the front

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.580 
amp DC ok and then we look at the front
of<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.180> unit<00:00:18.300> here<00:00:18.720> what<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.260> here<00:00:19.500> is

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
of the unit here what we have here is

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.320 
of the unit here what we have here is
you<00:00:19.710> have<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.859> power<00:00:20.070> indicator<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:21.000> simply

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
you have a power indicator it simply

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.939 
you have a power indicator it simply
command<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> red<00:00:22.020> anything<00:00:22.529> like<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.710> this

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
command is a red anything like that this

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.679 
command is a red anything like that this
power<00:00:23.220> going<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.699> unit<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.359> then<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.600> have

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
power going to the unit and then we have

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.109 
power going to the unit and then we have
switch<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.260> allows<00:00:25.380> us<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.769> choose<00:00:26.580> what

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
switch that allows us to choose what

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.670 
switch that allows us to choose what
output<00:00:27.570> we're<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.140> I'll<00:00:28.349> just<00:00:28.560> do

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
output we're going to have I'll just do

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.380 
output we're going to have I'll just do
a<00:00:28.769> quick<00:00:28.859> overview<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:29.640> choices<00:00:30.060> out<00:00:30.179> here

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
a quick overview what choices out here

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.900 
a quick overview what choices out here
by<00:00:30.539> rotating<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.109> box<00:00:31.349> around<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.550> let's<00:00:32.730> just

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
by rotating a box around so let's just

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.900 
by rotating a box around so let's just
go<00:00:33.059> here<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.860> on<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> input<00:00:35.309> side<00:00:35.520> we've<00:00:35.790> only

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
go here and on the input side we've only

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.700 
go here and on the input side we've only
two<00:00:36.149> inputs<00:00:36.510> going<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> power<00:00:37.500> input

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
two inputs going in with a power input

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.500 
two inputs going in with a power input
here<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.430> they<00:00:38.550> are<00:00:38.579> tapped<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.940> HDMI<00:00:39.480> input

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
here and they are tapped the HDMI input

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.600 
here and they are tapped the HDMI input
so<00:00:40.200> that's<00:00:40.320> quite<00:00:40.469> good<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.250> terms<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
so that's quite good and in terms of the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.639 
so that's quite good and in terms of the
output<00:00:41.790> here<00:00:42.270> we<00:00:42.480> have<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> following<00:00:42.930> one

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
output here we have the following one

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.250 
output here we have the following one
two<00:00:43.920> tree<00:00:44.570> connectors<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.140> is

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
two tree connectors here and this is

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.810 
two tree connectors here and this is
part<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.770> why<00:00:47.520> pvp<00:00:48.480> are<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.190> set<00:00:50.190> up<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.700> we

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
part of why pvp are and set up and we

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.400 
part of why pvp are and set up and we
can<00:00:50.969> output<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.420> way<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.809> more<00:00:51.989> commonly

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
can output that way but more commonly

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.830 
can output that way but more commonly
people<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:52.920> using<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.309> with<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> VGA

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
people to be using it with the VGA

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.420 
people to be using it with the VGA
output<00:00:54.840> here<00:00:55.230> which<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.860> run<00:00:56.219> out<00:00:56.370> of

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
output here which is going to run out of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.060 
output here which is going to run out of
the<00:00:56.520> visual<00:00:56.879> output<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.539> then<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the visual output and then we have the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.130 
the visual output and then we have the
audio<00:00:59.460> output<00:00:59.609> here<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.180> two<00:01:00.480> DS<00:01:00.660> RCA

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
audio output here of two DS RCA

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.410 
audio output here of two DS RCA
connectors<00:01:01.770> left<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.190> right<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:02.550> stereo<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
connectors left and right for stereo and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.910 
connectors left and right for stereo and
alternatively<00:01:04.110> though<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.589> actually<00:01:04.680> use

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
alternatively though we can actually use

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.640 
alternatively though we can actually use
that<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.850> SPD<00:01:05.970> fear<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> digital

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
that the SPD fear for the digital

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.219 
that the SPD fear for the digital
optical<00:01:08.130> Toslink<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.180> hash<00:01:09.450> tag<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.900> go<00:01:10.049> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
optical Toslink and hash tag to go and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.880 
optical Toslink and hash tag to go and
connect<00:01:10.500> digital<00:01:11.400> optical<00:01:12.330> sound<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.500> so

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
connect digital optical sound and so

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.100 
connect digital optical sound and so
when<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.820> were<00:01:14.880> using<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.390> particular<00:01:15.689> setup

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
when we were using this particular setup

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.230 
when we were using this particular setup
well<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:16.799> had<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> scenario<00:01:17.220> here<00:01:17.729> such<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
well we had a scenario here such as the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.350 
well we had a scenario here such as the
satellite<00:01:18.689> set-top<00:01:18.930> box<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.250> hdmi<00:01:20.549> output

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
satellite set-top box and we hdmi output

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.640 
satellite set-top box and we hdmi output
on<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:21.900> want<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> connect<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.619> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
on it and we want to connect it to a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.170 
on it and we want to connect it to a
monitor<00:01:22.740> that's<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:23.580> but<00:01:24.000> unfortunately

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
monitor that's here but unfortunately

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.200 
monitor that's here but unfortunately
would<00:01:24.900> say<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:26.220> know<00:01:26.310> if<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:26.790> had<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
would say and you know if we had a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.569 
would say and you know if we had a
marker<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.630> didn't<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.229> an<00:01:28.350> HDMI<00:01:28.740> input<00:01:29.009> on

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
marker that didn't have an HDMI input on

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.210 
marker that didn't have an HDMI input on
it<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:30.000> need<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.270> convert<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.600> over<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.229> VGA<00:01:31.710> now

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
it we need to convert it over to VGA now

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.319 
it we need to convert it over to VGA now
for<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.430> purposes<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.060> demonstration

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
for the purposes of this demonstration

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.270 
for the purposes of this demonstration
here<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.439> put<00:01:34.560> actually<00:01:34.890> chosen<00:01:35.100> this

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
here we put actually chosen this

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.710 
here we put actually chosen this
television<00:01:35.610> specifically<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.509> that

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
television specifically because of that

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.310 
television specifically because of that
port<00:01:36.990> HDMI<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.250> also<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:41.180> VGA<00:01:42.180> port<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.170> let's

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
port HDMI and also a VGA port so let's

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.230 
port HDMI and also a VGA port so let's
just<00:01:43.530> look<00:01:43.649> at<00:01:43.710> how<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:43.979> would<00:01:44.520> water<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:45.030> up

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
just look at how we would water this up

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.609 
just look at how we would water this up
and<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.350> we've<00:01:47.130> got<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.000> menu

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
and so we've got in here to the menu

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.200 
and so we've got in here to the menu
this<00:01:48.770> is<00:01:48.890> an<00:01:49.009> HDMI<00:01:49.399> a<00:01:49.700> derivative<00:01:49.880> works

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
this is an HDMI a derivative works

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.730 
this is an HDMI a derivative works
occasionally<00:01:50.630> they've<00:01:51.020> collected<00:01:51.439> about

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
occasionally they've collected about

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.859 
occasionally they've collected about
television<00:01:52.219> we've<00:01:53.000> gotten<00:01:53.359> adhere<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.780> the

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
television we've gotten adhere to the

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.359 
television we've gotten adhere to the
picture<00:01:54.229> resolution<00:01:54.530> screen

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
picture resolution screen

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.190 
picture resolution screen
and<00:01:55.579> the<00:01:55.670> reason<00:01:56.030> we've<00:01:56.149> chosen<00:01:56.179> this<00:01:56.689> is<00:01:56.960> that

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
and the reason we've chosen this is that

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.109 
and the reason we've chosen this is that
this<00:01:57.619> can<00:01:57.799> happen<00:01:57.979> anything<00:01:58.429> all<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:58.909> way<00:01:59.000> up

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
this can happen anything all the way up

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.330 
this can happen anything all the way up
to<00:01:59.270> 1080p<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.500> if<00:02:00.590> you<00:02:00.649> look<00:02:00.799> at<00:02:00.890> things<00:02:01.219> you

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
to 1080p so if you look at things you

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.100 
to 1080p so if you look at things you
can<00:02:01.460> go<00:02:01.609> for<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:02.289> 1080p<00:02:03.289> RI<00:02:03.679> are<00:02:04.219> for<00:02:04.869> 720<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:05.959> I

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
can go for a 1080p RI are for 720 and I

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.680 
can go for a 1080p RI are for 720 and I
think<00:02:06.289> the<00:02:06.350> same<00:02:06.619> 5<00:02:06.950> 7<00:02:07.280> 4<00:02:07.459> as<00:02:07.670> well<00:02:07.819> okay<00:02:08.209> so

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
think the same 5 7 4 as well okay so

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.890 
think the same 5 7 4 as well okay so
depending<00:02:09.170> on<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.319> setup<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:10.009> it<00:02:10.670> may<00:02:10.879> may<00:02:11.780> or

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
depending on the setup and it may may or

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.509 
depending on the setup and it may may or
may<00:02:12.019> not<00:02:12.049> work<00:02:12.440> would<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.739> pick<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.069> thing<00:02:13.310> so

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
may not work would you pick the thing so

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:14.770 
may not work would you pick the thing so
you<00:02:13.549> might<00:02:13.790> need<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.150> adjust<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:14.510> screen

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
you might need to adjust the screen

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.850 
you might need to adjust the screen
resolution<00:02:14.959> hang<00:02:15.440> on

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
resolution hang on

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.470 
resolution hang on
so<00:02:16.040> we're<00:02:16.250> just<00:02:16.280> going<00:02:16.519> to<00:02:16.549> spend<00:02:16.819> traded<00:02:17.360> up

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
so we're just going to spend traded up

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.479 
so we're just going to spend traded up
1080p<00:02:18.200> use<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.590> highest<00:02:18.920> ones<00:02:19.099> that<00:02:19.250> we<00:02:19.340> have

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
1080p use the highest ones that we have

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.729 
1080p use the highest ones that we have
here<00:02:19.670> okay<00:02:19.879> so<00:02:20.299> I'm<00:02:20.780> going<00:02:21.049> to<00:02:21.079> here<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.500> if<00:02:21.620> I

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
here okay so I'm going to here is if I

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.770 
here okay so I'm going to here is if I
put<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.190> HDMI<00:02:22.730> T<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:23.090> would<00:02:23.360> like<00:02:23.540> this

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
put the HDMI T I would like this

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.569 
put the HDMI T I would like this
television<00:02:24.110> as<00:02:25.099> you<00:02:25.190> can<00:02:25.280> see<00:02:25.459> it's

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
television as you can see it's

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.059 
television as you can see it's
disconnected<00:02:25.940> now<00:02:26.269> I<00:02:26.569> come<00:02:27.349> along<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.860> I'm

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
disconnected now I come along and I'm

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.069 
disconnected now I come along and I'm
just<00:02:28.220> pushing<00:02:28.430> into<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.790> HDMI<00:02:29.299> input<00:02:29.329> here

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
just pushing into the HDMI input here

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.530 
just pushing into the HDMI input here
so<00:02:30.530> this<00:02:30.680> human<00:02:31.040> is<00:02:31.160> now<00:02:31.310> taking<00:02:31.819> that<00:02:32.000> HDMI

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
so this human is now taking that HDMI

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.339 
so this human is now taking that HDMI
input<00:02:33.230> it's<00:02:33.620> converting<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.459> VGA<00:02:34.849> output

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
input it's converting it to a VGA output

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.020 
input it's converting it to a VGA output
column<00:02:36.349> here<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:37.010> open<00:02:37.310> source<00:02:37.640> open<00:02:38.209> hero

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
column here and I open source open hero

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.059 
column here and I open source open hero
and<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.150> go<00:02:41.329> in<00:02:41.569> here<00:02:41.690> from<00:02:41.900> VGA<00:02:42.230> well<00:02:42.769> just<00:02:42.920> look

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
and I go in here from VGA well just look

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.009 
and I go in here from VGA well just look
will<00:02:43.549> see<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.819> area<00:02:43.940> here<00:02:44.299> I'm<00:02:44.720> receiving

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
will see the area here I'm receiving

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.420 
will see the area here I'm receiving
this<00:02:45.200> became<00:02:45.410> screen<00:02:45.739> over<00:02:45.950> Sanders<00:02:46.280> over

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
this became screen over Sanders over

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.220 
this became screen over Sanders over
that's<00:02:46.819> quite<00:02:47.150> this<00:02:47.299> apartment<00:02:47.780> but<00:02:48.140> we

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
that's quite this apartment but we

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.390 
that's quite this apartment but we
actually<00:02:48.470> come<00:02:48.560> about<00:02:48.739> in<00:02:48.890> here<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.310> just

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
actually come about in here and just

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.780 
actually come about in here and just
disconnect<00:02:49.879> this<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.470> reconnected<00:02:51.639> it<00:02:52.639> might

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
disconnect this and reconnected it might

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.910 
disconnect this and reconnected it might
need<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.060> do<00:02:53.180> this<00:02:53.329> a<00:02:53.359> few<00:02:53.540> times<00:02:53.690> got<00:02:54.620> first

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
need to do this a few times got first

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.440 
need to do this a few times got first
time<00:02:55.130> there<00:02:55.340> so<00:02:55.639> it<00:02:55.700> just<00:02:55.910> kind<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.150> needed<00:02:56.420> to

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
time there so it just kind of needed to

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.360 
time there so it just kind of needed to
be<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.750> power<00:02:56.959> back<00:02:57.230> off<00:02:57.470> from<00:02:57.680> power<00:02:57.889> calm

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
be the power back off from power calm

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.270 
be the power back off from power calm
you<00:02:58.910> see<00:02:59.060> there<00:02:59.269> for<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.630> thing<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.170> so<00:03:01.130> we

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
you see there for the thing so so we

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.309 
you see there for the thing so so we
tested<00:03:01.730> their<00:03:01.880> intestinal<00:03:02.420> 1080p<00:03:03.139> with

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
tested their intestinal 1080p with

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.710 
tested their intestinal 1080p with
tested<00:03:03.680> 720<00:03:04.280> etcetera<00:03:04.670> so<00:03:05.030> teeth<00:03:05.239> were<00:03:05.450> fine

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
tested 720 etcetera so teeth were fine

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.280 
tested 720 etcetera so teeth were fine
for<00:03:05.750> us

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
for us

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.199 
for us
so<00:03:06.470> that's<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:06.859> anyway<00:03:07.190> now<00:03:07.519> there's<00:03:07.730> a<00:03:07.790> sister

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
so that's it anyway now there's a sister

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.330 
so that's it anyway now there's a sister
unit<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.720> this<00:03:08.840> which<00:03:09.109> is<00:03:09.139> converting<00:03:09.739> VGA<00:03:10.190> or

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
unit of this which is converting VGA or

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.729 
unit of this which is converting VGA or
HDMI<00:03:10.579> and<00:03:11.299> that's<00:03:11.480> far<00:03:11.750> more<00:03:11.900> common<00:03:12.319> and

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
HDMI and that's far more common and

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.920 
HDMI and that's far more common and
because<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:13.579> DVR<00:03:14.000> things<00:03:14.329> to<00:03:14.450> that<00:03:14.599> but

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
because the DVR things to that but

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.539 
because the DVR things to that but
there's<00:03:15.079> also<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.380> niche<00:03:15.590> market<00:03:15.620> for<00:03:16.190> these<00:03:16.340> as

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549
