00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.579

 recapitulating that we used the 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:41.200
 People used colorless enamel. 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:49.990
 the white enamel will put a droplet 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:53.590
 in the glaze an agent used and haunts the 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:55.360
 choose shadow you want the clear 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.320

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:03.910
 There goes the taste of each one so that's it 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:08.260
 there is that is the result of three that 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:11.229
