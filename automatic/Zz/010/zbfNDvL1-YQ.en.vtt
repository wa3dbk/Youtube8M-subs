both of those songs used the open hi-hat
technique<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.989> completely<00:00:52.440> change<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.010> feel

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
technique to completely change the feel

technique to completely change the feel
of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.640> rhythm<00:00:53.940> before<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.839> get<00:00:55.019> into<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
of the rhythm before I get into the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.509 
of the rhythm before I get into the
examples<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.890> song<00:00:56.070> let<00:00:56.280> me<00:00:56.339> show<00:00:56.460> you

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
examples in the song let me show you

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.220 
examples in the song let me show you
what<00:00:56.699> I'm<00:00:56.789> talking<00:00:56.940> about<00:00:57.239> I'm<00:00:57.780> gonna<00:00:57.899> play<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
what I'm talking about I'm gonna play a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.259 
what I'm talking about I'm gonna play a
basic<00:00:58.499> four<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> floor<00:00:59.339> beat<00:00:59.609> two<00:01:00.239> and

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
basic four in the floor beat two and

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:07.550 
basic four in the floor beat two and
four<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.659> the<00:01:00.690> snare<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.810> beat<00:01:07.020> has<00:01:07.530> a

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
four on the snare so that beat has a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.800 
four on the snare so that beat has a
particular<00:01:08.100> feel<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.790> if<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.330> open<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
particular feel to it if I open the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.469 
particular feel to it if I open the
hi-hat<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.440> all<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.980> ants<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.580> really<00:01:12.120> changes

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
hi-hat on all the ants it really changes

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.940 
hi-hat on all the ants it really changes
the<00:01:12.659> rhythm<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.079> I'll<00:01:13.170> play<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.409> regular<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the rhythm so I'll play it regular and

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:22.940 
the rhythm so I'll play it regular and
then<00:01:14.100> move<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:21.200> now<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.439> very<00:01:22.649> basic

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
then move it now it's a very basic

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.560 
then move it now it's a very basic
example<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.850> hopefully<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.270> hear<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
example so hopefully you can hear the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.330 
example so hopefully you can hear the
difference<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> open<00:01:25.380> hi-hat<00:01:25.530> makes<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
difference the open hi-hat makes in the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.760 
difference the open hi-hat makes in the
rhythm<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.180> feel<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.689> rhythm<00:01:27.960> Mike

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
rhythm in the feel of the rhythm Mike

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.069 
rhythm in the feel of the rhythm Mike
Portnoy<00:01:29.159> does<00:01:29.399> this<00:01:29.579> technique<00:01:30.149> in<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.899> song

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
Portnoy does this technique in the song

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.899 
Portnoy does this technique in the song

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.420 

that's<00:01:53.480> a<00:01:53.600> really<00:01:53.870> cool<00:01:54.110> powerful<00:01:54.980> and<00:01:55.160> mean

that's a really cool powerful and mean

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.490 
that's a really cool powerful and mean
sounding<00:01:56.090> groove<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.660> by<00:01:57.020> opening<00:01:57.200> the

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
sounding groove and by opening the

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.440 
sounding groove and by opening the
hi-hat<00:01:57.950> on<00:01:57.980> the<00:01:58.250> ands<00:01:58.730> it<00:01:58.850> gives<00:01:59.180> it<00:01:59.330> an

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
hi-hat on the ands it gives it an

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.840 
hi-hat on the ands it gives it an
up-tempo<00:02:00.050> feel<00:02:00.530> let<00:02:01.310> me<00:02:01.400> show<00:02:01.550> you<00:02:01.640> what<00:02:01.760> it

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
up-tempo feel let me show you what it

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:27.390 
up-tempo feel let me show you what it
sounds<00:02:01.880> like<00:02:02.120> without<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.660> open<00:02:02.930> hi-hat

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.560 

so<00:02:28.400> hopefully<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.790> can<00:02:28.850> hear<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.180> difference

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
so hopefully you can hear the difference

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.180 
so hopefully you can hear the difference
even<00:02:30.020> though<00:02:30.230> it's<00:02:30.410> essentially<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.950> same

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
even though it's essentially the same

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.610 
even though it's essentially the same
rhythm<00:02:31.490> just<00:02:32.030> by<00:02:32.150> opening<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:32.720> hi-hat<00:02:33.380> it

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
rhythm just by opening that hi-hat it

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.500 
rhythm just by opening that hi-hat it
really<00:02:34.070> changes<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.459> feel<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.240> groove

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
really changes the feel of the groove

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.940 
really changes the feel of the groove

the ands one technique you can do and
this<00:02:42.770> is<00:02:42.860> what<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.010> do<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:43.520> think<00:02:44.360> one<00:02:45.050> two<00:02:45.770> three

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
this is what I do I think one two three

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.210 
this is what I do I think one two three
four<00:02:47.209> I'm<00:02:47.510> not<00:02:47.720> thinking<00:02:48.080> of<00:02:48.200> lifting<00:02:48.769> my<00:02:48.950> foot

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
four I'm not thinking of lifting my foot

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.460 
four I'm not thinking of lifting my foot
on<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.370> ends<00:02:49.820> I'm<00:02:50.120> thinking<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.630> closing<00:02:50.989> the

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
on the ends I'm thinking of closing the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.940 
on the ends I'm thinking of closing the
hi-hat<00:02:51.920> on<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.280> one<00:02:52.550> two<00:02:53.269> three<00:02:53.709> four<00:02:54.709> and

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
hi-hat on the one two three four and

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.610 
hi-hat on the one two three four and
when<00:02:55.160> I<00:02:55.190> do<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.840> automatically<00:02:56.840> it's<00:02:57.200> open

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
when I do that automatically it's open

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.380 
when I do that automatically it's open
on<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.830> ends<00:02:58.220> one<00:02:58.760> two<00:02:59.480> three<00:03:00.260> four<00:03:00.980> one<00:03:01.700> two

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
on the ends one two three four one two

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.330 
on the ends one two three four one two
three<00:03:02.800> four

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.400 

I<00:03:10.880> know<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:12.060> looks<00:03:12.270> easy<00:03:12.540> it's<00:03:13.020> gonna<00:03:13.170> take

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
I know it looks easy it's gonna take

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.990 
I know it looks easy it's gonna take
some<00:03:13.590> time<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.890> get<00:03:13.980> used<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.280> especially<00:03:14.490> when

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
some time to get used to especially when

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.090 
some time to get used to especially when
you're<00:03:15.120> listening<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:16.770> take<00:03:16.980> it

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
you're listening to that and so take it

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.130 
you're listening to that and so take it
slow<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.700> work<00:03:18.270> on<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.570> until<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.900> can<00:03:19.020> do

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
slow and work on that until you can do

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.320 
slow and work on that until you can do
without<00:03:19.320> even<00:03:19.680> thinking<00:03:20.010> about<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.250> turn<00:03:21.090> over

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
without even thinking about it turn over

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.170 
without even thinking about it turn over

poppies from garbage I'm looking

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.950 
poppies from garbage I'm looking
specifically<00:03:29.430> at<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.910> second<00:03:30.360> line<00:03:30.630> this

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
specifically at the second line this

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.360 
specifically at the second line this
rhythm<00:03:31.350> written<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.710> second<00:03:32.040> line<00:03:32.190> you're

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
rhythm written the second line you're

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.590 
rhythm written the second line you're
gonna<00:03:32.460> see<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.820> there's<00:03:33.000> an<00:03:33.090> open<00:03:33.450> hi-hat

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
gonna see that there's an open hi-hat

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.170 
gonna see that there's an open hi-hat
technique<00:03:34.170> there<00:03:34.410> as<00:03:34.530> well<00:03:34.709> now<00:03:35.430> here<00:03:35.790> instead

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
technique there as well now here instead

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.820 
technique there as well now here instead
of<00:03:36.300> opening<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.900> hi-hat<00:03:37.230> on<00:03:37.260> all<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.650> Ann's

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
of opening the hi-hat on all the Ann's

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.430 
of opening the hi-hat on all the Ann's
like<00:03:38.250> Mike<00:03:38.430> Portnoy<00:03:38.880> did<00:03:39.150> this<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.900> gonna<00:03:39.990> open

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
like Mike Portnoy did this is gonna open

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.370 
like Mike Portnoy did this is gonna open
it<00:03:40.590> on<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.920> one<00:03:41.100> end<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:42.060> three<00:03:42.390> and<00:03:42.660> let

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
it on the one end and the three and let

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.720 
it on the one end and the three and let
me<00:03:43.500> play<00:03:43.680> this<00:03:43.830> rhythm<00:03:44.010> for<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:44.550> you<00:03:44.640> can

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
me play this rhythm for you so you can

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:58.940 
me play this rhythm for you so you can
hear<00:03:44.880> what<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.150> sounds<00:03:45.390> like<00:03:57.680> when<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.770> have

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
hear what it sounds like when you have

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.010 
hear what it sounds like when you have
to<00:03:59.220> open<00:03:59.670> high<00:03:59.820> hats<00:04:00.060> in<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.480> roll<00:04:00.690> like<00:04:00.840> this

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
to open high hats in a roll like this

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.550 
to open high hats in a roll like this
you<00:04:01.200> can't<00:04:01.470> close<00:04:01.770> it<00:04:01.830> in<00:04:02.190> between<00:04:02.400> each<00:04:02.940> one

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
you can't close it in between each one

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
you can't close it in between each one
in<00:04:04.560> this<00:04:04.739> case<00:04:04.980> it's<00:04:05.160> just<00:04:05.220> left<00:04:05.550> open<00:04:05.910> Lukas

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.710 

now<00:04:11.580> again<00:04:11.790> I'm<00:04:11.970> trying<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.239> point<00:04:12.420> out<00:04:12.570> the

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
now again I'm trying to point out the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.660 
now again I'm trying to point out the
difference<00:04:13.140> that<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.440> open<00:04:13.709> hi-hat<00:04:13.860> makes<00:04:14.340> so

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
difference that the open hi-hat makes so

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.190 
difference that the open hi-hat makes so
I'm<00:04:14.760> gonna<00:04:14.880> play<00:04:15.030> this<00:04:15.180> rhythm<00:04:15.420> without<00:04:15.810> the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
I'm gonna play this rhythm without the

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:41.620 
I'm gonna play this rhythm without the
open<00:04:16.500> hi-hat

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.150 

so<00:04:42.630> you<00:04:42.720> can<00:04:42.840> see<00:04:43.020> something<00:04:43.350> as<00:04:43.530> simple<00:04:43.860> as

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
so you can see something as simple as

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.920 
so you can see something as simple as
introducing<00:04:44.760> a<00:04:44.820> new<00:04:44.970> sound<00:04:45.300> like<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.660> open

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
introducing a new sound like the open

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.560 
introducing a new sound like the open
hi-hat<00:04:46.110> can<00:04:46.830> really<00:04:47.070> change<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.700> feel<00:04:48.060> of<00:04:48.330> the

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
hi-hat can really change the feel of the

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.600 
hi-hat can really change the feel of the
rhythm<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:48.960> I<00:04:49.560> want<00:04:49.740> you<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:49.920> explore<00:04:50.310> that

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
rhythm and I want you to explore that

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.850 
rhythm and I want you to explore that
with<00:04:50.820> beats<00:04:51.360> that<00:04:51.570> you<00:04:51.600> play<00:04:52.020> now<00:04:52.470> everybody

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
with beats that you play now everybody

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.280 
with beats that you play now everybody
has<00:04:53.070> this<00:04:53.430> beat<00:04:53.970> that<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.390> they<00:04:54.750> sit<00:04:54.930> down<00:04:55.080> and

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
has this beat that the they sit down and

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.050 
has this beat that the they sit down and
play<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:55.590> first<00:04:55.800> beat<00:04:56.070> but<00:04:56.400> they<00:04:56.490> always<00:04:56.820> play

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
play the first beat but they always play

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.260 
play the first beat but they always play
your<00:04:57.660> beat<00:04:58.020> try<00:04:58.770> adding<00:04:59.220> some<00:04:59.250> open<00:04:59.700> hi-hat<00:04:59.910> to

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
your beat try adding some open hi-hat to

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.970 
your beat try adding some open hi-hat to
that<00:05:00.450> so<00:05:00.930> if<00:05:01.080> you<00:05:01.170> sit<00:05:01.410> down<00:05:01.440> and<00:05:01.620> play

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
that so if you sit down and play

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:26.930 
that so if you sit down and play
whatever<00:05:25.070> so<00:05:26.070> I<00:05:26.130> encourage<00:05:26.370> you<00:05:26.490> to<00:05:26.580> explore

whatever so I encourage you to explore

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.450 
whatever so I encourage you to explore
your<00:05:27.270> rhythms<00:05:27.750> add<00:05:28.050> some<00:05:28.500> open<00:05:28.830> hi-hat<00:05:29.040> get

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
your rhythms add some open hi-hat get

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.040 
your rhythms add some open hi-hat get
creative<00:05:29.910> with<00:05:30.030> it<00:05:30.090> I<00:05:30.330> hope<00:05:30.540> this<00:05:30.690> lesson<00:05:30.900> has

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
creative with it I hope this lesson has

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.420 
creative with it I hope this lesson has
