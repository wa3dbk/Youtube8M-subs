00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.049
 welcome to a new video of is bike 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.349
 or this time we're going to talk about the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.369
 new turbo tire for the rim route 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.199
 preferred by cyclists 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.480
 professionals who want to go to the top 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.669
 and they do not want to give anything of advantage 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.950
 the secret really about this tire is 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.809
 in his scream material we are going to talk about 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.919
 material of the housing and the 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:30.919
 anti puncture protection 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.379
 the cripton is the key compound in this 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.030
 rim for the development of this 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.949
 compound we had to have our 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.720
 laboratories is an exclusive compound 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.360
 of specialist using information 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.980
 of professional cyclists and they told us 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.870
 what was the needs and the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.850
 feedback from them were 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.040
 result of the thor grip the turbo tire 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.110
 but in addition to this compound 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.659
 we had to mix others to give the 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.260
 required consistency compounds for 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.760
 also give resistance to the rays 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.460
 ultraviolet and that had a tire 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.170
 for a long time with the most qualities 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.170
 the result was this magnificent tire 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.710
 we have to talk about the housing the 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.659
 housing that we use in our turbo 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.950
 is a housing that normally does not 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.280
 used in the tire industry 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.409
 of very high tp and 220 pp and what 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.619
 we achieve with this pp is a very tire 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.110
 flexible and very light 205 grams no more 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.060
 on the sides of the case gives us the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.830
 capacity for flexibility and the result 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.830
 is that we have a smoother ride 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.570
 but of course we have to think 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.820
 also in the puncture resistance 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.770
 that's why we look for many components 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.780
 a material that gave us the resistance 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.100
 to avoid cuts or penetration of 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.750
 glasses when we're rolling in the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.509
 road but that kept us that 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.250
 flexibility and that low weight we rehearse 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.320
 with ordinary compounds with other 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.240
 more advanced fibers and the result we 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.399
 He gave that nylon is the best material 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.470
 that we can use in a caliber and in 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.659
 a specific density like that we're going to 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.060
 achieve flexibility and endurance 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.100
 that we needed the result in the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.200
 most sold tire and the one you like the most 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.789
 to professional athletes visit a 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.840
 special store and if they ask for this 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.840
 rim thank you for watching
