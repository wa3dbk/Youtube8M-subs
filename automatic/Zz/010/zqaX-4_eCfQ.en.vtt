has been an uphill battle with fitness

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.260 
has been an uphill battle with fitness
and<00:00:45.239> nutrition<00:00:45.440> she<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.489> past<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.030> tied<00:00:48.239> up

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
and nutrition she in the past is tied up

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.600 
and nutrition she in the past is tied up
a<00:00:48.480> few<00:00:48.660> times<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.680> when<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.860> looked<00:00:50.129> at<00:00:50.219> fergies

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
a few times so when I looked at fergies

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.790 
a few times so when I looked at fergies
current<00:00:51.030> diet<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.539> saw<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.230> she<00:00:52.410> was<00:00:52.440> really

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
current diet I saw that she was really

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.619 
current diet I saw that she was really
in<00:00:52.949> need<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.160> some<00:00:53.309> extra<00:00:53.820> sodium<00:00:54.059> some

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
in need of some extra sodium some

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.689 
in need of some extra sodium some
electrolytes<00:00:55.079> she<00:00:55.949> also<00:00:56.070> needed<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.550> better

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
electrolytes she also needed a better

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.029 
electrolytes she also needed a better
mineral<00:00:57.180> balance<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.780> diet<00:00:57.989> overall<00:00:58.559> so

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
mineral balance in the diet overall so

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.860 
mineral balance in the diet overall so
we<00:00:59.129> added<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.489> different<00:00:59.820> feed<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> diet<00:01:00.539> to

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
we added a different feed to the diet to

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.840 
we added a different feed to the diet to
ensure<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> better<00:01:01.559> mineral<00:01:02.039> balance<00:01:02.219> overall

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
ensure a better mineral balance overall

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.850 
ensure a better mineral balance overall
we<00:01:03.180> added<00:01:03.510> electrolytes<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.409> we<00:01:04.500> added<00:01:04.799> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
we added electrolytes and we added a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.890 
we added electrolytes and we added a
really<00:01:05.129> absorbable<00:01:05.670> vitamin<00:01:06.119> E<00:01:06.299> supplement

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
really absorbable vitamin E supplement

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.660 
really absorbable vitamin E supplement

the risk of tying up since we've changed
diet<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.159> feel<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.729> she<00:01:11.939> has<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> lot<00:01:12.299> more

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
enough before we ran cross-country and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.870 
enough before we ran cross-country and
this<00:01:36.600> year<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.049> been<00:01:37.560> able<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.130> give<00:01:38.759> her
