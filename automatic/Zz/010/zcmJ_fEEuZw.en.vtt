00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
that so i didn't but this is what the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.669 
that so i didn't but this is what the
hair<00:00:29.699> looks<00:00:29.880> like<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> quick

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
hair looks like and this is a quick

weave<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:32.579> invisible<00:00:33.059> part<00:00:35.030> and<00:00:36.030> i<00:00:36.809> didn't

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
weave with invisible part and i didn't

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.360 
weave with invisible part and i didn't
think<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.290> was<00:00:37.410> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.710> enough<00:00:37.950> here<00:00:38.160> but

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
think it was going to be enough here but

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.880 
think it was going to be enough here but
it<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:39.480> was<00:00:39.690> enough<00:00:39.989> here<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.440> all<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.649> this

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
it is it was enough here so all of this

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.200 
it is it was enough here so all of this
is<00:00:40.950> just<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:41.579> package<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.890> i<00:00:43.890> think<00:00:44.879> i<00:00:45.000> put

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
is just one package and i think i put

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.920 
is just one package and i think i put
the<00:00:45.329> 14-inch<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:46.260> top<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:48.180> 12-inch<00:00:48.660> on

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
the 14-inch on top in the 12-inch on

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.060 
the 14-inch on top in the 12-inch on
bottom<00:00:49.289> i<00:00:50.360> think<00:00:51.739> or<00:00:52.739> maybe<00:00:52.800> not<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:54.410> if<00:00:55.410> you

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
bottom i think or maybe not but if you

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.889 
bottom i think or maybe not but if you
put<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.460> 14-inch<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> bottom<00:00:57.840> and

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
put the 14-inch on the bottom and

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.099 
put the 14-inch on the bottom and
12-inch<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:59.070> top<00:00:59.879> then<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.719> going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> be

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
12-inch on top then it's going to be

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.380 
12-inch on top then it's going to be
more<00:01:01.289> layered<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:02.160> i<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.520> did<00:01:02.850> cut<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.210> a
