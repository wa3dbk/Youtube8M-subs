so let's start with the installation

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.719 
so let's start with the installation
process<00:01:03.799> the<00:01:04.799> installation<00:01:05.280> file<00:01:05.460> comes

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
process the installation file comes

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.130 
process the installation file comes
around<00:01:06.000> 64<00:01:06.540> MB<00:01:07.820> so<00:01:08.820> by<00:01:08.909> default<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.900> gets

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
around 64 MB so by default it gets
