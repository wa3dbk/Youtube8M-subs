00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:09.320
 from costa rica greets them jose alberto 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:13.530
 moya today is Monday , October 8, 2012 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.900
 this is the second model that 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.189
 we build an electro motor 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:24.539
 magnetic on this occasion the rotor that 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.960
 we have used is a bearing of 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.940
 hard disk scrapped from computer to 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.620
 which one was placed 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.700
 plates or discs 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.760
 and 16 were added 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.720
 neodymium magnets 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:48.300
 as we see the producer 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:51.680
 rotate with enough stability 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.020
 and with enough force 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.950
 to obinna that generates the magnetic field 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.580
 is the same as was used in the model 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.580
 number 1 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.289
 the switch 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:13.200
 it's a magnetic o6 district 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.750
 that allows us to interrupt and connect 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.420
 the magnetic field of the coil so that 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.420
 the movement of the rotor is generated 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.520
 the source later 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.299
 it's the same 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:35.009
 the same adapter that converts 110 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:38.850
 volts of alternating current in 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.900
 approximately 12 volts of current 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.050
 direct in this case 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.780
 the voltage that is connecting or 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.900
 which is feeding the motor 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.340
 volts approximately and with that 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.310
 voltage to protect the switch and not 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.090
 melt it 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.579
 the engine works a lot 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.079
 let's stop the power supply 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.079
 to observe 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.890
 rotor in its configuration 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.190
 there the engine is stopping and in 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.470
 this shot we can observe 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.230
 the composition of the rotor 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.080
 as we said earlier is a 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.650
 bearing discarded hard drive 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:40.129
 computer that was placed 6 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:44.970
 plates or discs and 16 neodymium magnets 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:48.180
 in groups of 4 we are going to reconnect 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.030
 the power source to see how the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.160
 engine starts 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.830
 we need a little boost so that 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.330
 the engine starts to work and there 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.330
 we are watching 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:08.320
 the operation of this simple engine 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.320
 magnetic electro 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.370
 as we said in the previous video 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.860
 the next step once we have 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.240
 this rotor that is going to be is final 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.620
 to build 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:27.430
 the magnetic motor bed in and generator 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.200
 here we have mounted on a plate 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.170
 Test all components 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.550
 electronic circuit what we 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.060
 would be to replace the coil with 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.950
 a battery coil 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:47.680
 and with a core of welding rods 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:51.129
 of a sixteenth 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.300
 when we build this this new 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:57.970
 engine of this new model 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:02.220
 we will present the results in a new 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.220
 video thank you very much
