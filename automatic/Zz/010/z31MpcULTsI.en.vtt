you know challenges coming up and if I
have<00:06:01.050> a<00:06:01.080> bad<00:06:01.380> attitude<00:06:01.560> then<00:06:02.659> it's<00:06:03.659> not<00:06:03.870> really

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
have a bad attitude then it's not really

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.540 
have a bad attitude then it's not really
going<00:06:04.380> to<00:06:04.469> make<00:06:04.650> anything<00:06:04.979> but
