00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.109
 so on the gearbox and mean 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:12.269
 Clutch more precisely mechanism squeezing 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.929
 Clutch is important here is the shaft on which 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.210
 we have a lever 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.460
 clutch release lever this shaft 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.710
 installed us in the body here here 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.640
 it comes here is inserted here on 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.779
 shaft mounted and here it's foot 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.710
 in the middle of this 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:38.790
 from two sides wearing sleeves sleeves these 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.739
 need only to plug 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.239
 toggle more precisely the entire shaft with a fork 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.260
 switching did not dangle with us to the right 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.260
 to the left is understandable means to the shaft 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.329
 such a lever is installed 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.329
 two shoulders he acts on us 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.460
 release bearing 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.970
 here that is all this mechanism 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.340
 David you here on the release lever 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.619
 and that is, on the release bearing 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.290
 the outflow was outworn in the inner drum 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.640
 clutch and squeezes the inner wheels 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.799
 side of the engine is understandable 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.049
 with that when i took it all down 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.430
 on a shaky lever with our hands is very 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:31.829
 strongly dangles on the shaft dangles here 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:36.200
 so here for clarity, this is 2 well all 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.350
 dangling again the hole glorified 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.360
 ships 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.360
 pressed pin this pin 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.430
 passes through this fork 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.890
 the center of the shaft goes outside here this 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.869
 pin precisely hole in which 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.850
 the pin is inserted a little bit at us zakir 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.180
 but not at the edges but apparently so that the pin does not 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.780
 dropped out but not really pin 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.420
 he fell out he just hung out now I 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.969
 pulled here let's see how the pin shaft 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.899
 nouveau insert pin tight here everything 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.000
 ok done the pin itself shaft itself here 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.150
 this one is inserted in the hole too 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.990
 OK, that is, it does not hang out much 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.420
 can say 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.550
 the girl has but a little gets up 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.280
 pretty tight processing quality too 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.070
 not bad this detail is conditioned so 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.240
 does the hole mean as glorified 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.240
 Now we are all at least 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:53.670
 12 and 3 so 12 3 moreover, we measure exactly 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:56.880
 you are so 11 9 4 tenths of millimeters 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:11.290
 it is clear that such a connection is also a marriage 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:17.550
 measure another sleeves 13 and 2 so 11 9 and there 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:21.970
 13 2 respectively 2 point three 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:25.030
 millimeter is obtained oh 1.3 millimeter 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.490
 on say 1 and 3 well these 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.350
 rattle and so it is clear that dangles like 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:36.270
 and this detail is all clear this is a marriage roller itself 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.590
 like nothing in the thin plug defective 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.800
 so go on the inner drum 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.310
 the clutch which we have through the bearing 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.810
 needle so here it acts on and 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.530
 through bearing 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.330
 this bearing we have 60 minutes what 4 if 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.870
 according to the soviet it means 4 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.060
 bearing 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.950
 we are working on a set of disks 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:02.980
 clutch this one here is more accurate through 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.350
 a set of disks affects this one 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.920
 washer 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.980
 here and so he presses on her she 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.030
 diaphragm spring here this one 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.760
 spring rests on the clutch drum 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.130
 Now through this ring here but it is obvious for 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.049
 so that he himself doesnâ€™t scratch himself 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.200
 aluminum can wear on it 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:27.250
 It works clearly when we 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.040
 squeeze the clutch lever through these 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.520
 two bearings and inner drum 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:36.000
 compresses the spring the spring weakens in 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.290
 mode we have here these disks 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.139
 because here it is a plate worth 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.539
 this position 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:51.840
 and a ring is mounted on the outside 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:53.969
 inside the drum like this squeezing 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.580
 grip we move this one over here 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:58.800
 the cup he drives the discs loosen 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.930
 respectively outward and here these 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.099
 steel drive wheels remain worth 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:08.340
 the drum is driven by the slots here 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:10.669
 these are the inner drum clamp 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.509
 drives loosen if begin 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.120
 rotate freely relative to each other 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:18.930
 friend's grip is squeezed all clear with 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:24.840
 this is so the disks we have here are good thickness 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:26.580
 and big led driven discs we have in 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.710
 excellent condition not even everywhere when 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.960
 worked here maybe see it 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.389
 that is, the oxide film does not see the line 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.289
 Slave drives are also in excellent condition 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:41.279
 all cuts on them in place means disks 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:44.610
 still to work shelf so it all means 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:47.580
 now the internal clutch drum here 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:52.169
 what did not like firstly this 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.710
 104 radial bearings about which 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.719
 already spoke to the Soviet treasurer 104 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.060
 photoblog but again the year March 20 hours 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:02.039
 but already there is a serious elevator lift 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.800
 radial here it is of course not to see him 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:08.550
 it turns out we say that he is a backlash 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.979
 rather big internal dangles 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:14.129
 ring that is, well, maybe the fact is that 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:17.159
 bearing chinese because firm yu 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:19.169
 bi pi up clear world brand with such 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:22.139
 the name is not clear what is Chinese 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:24.810
 Chinese bearing has rights for 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:26.099
 hanging out being new means on 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.099
 needle bearing 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:32.219
 I did not like that the needles roll 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:34.349
 Now directly on these here parts Details 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:36.919
 must be tempered if i'm not mistaken 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:39.719
 in 60 the threshold should be hardness 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:42.300
 so that you can use them as 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:44.520
 body rolling bearings did not like 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.349
 the fact that the parts are polished i.e. 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.479
 in other words, processed roughly something 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:50.909
 that the other here is still even prominent 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:53.400
 risks and under bearings surface 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:55.770
 must be so clean 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.419
 Well, what should it be a mirror if 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.370
 surface is mirror and sufficient 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:01.500
 hardness it suits as rings 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.139
 there is no bearing in it 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.900
 that's how it came out of the cutter all the risks 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:10.320
 but it is probably visible on it 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:13.710
 a trifle is a trifle just it will lead 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.199
 rapid wear of the bearing needles themselves 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.330
 and the separators and the rings themselves are picking too 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:19.500
 it is formed by the way it is already vodka from where 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.020
 formed him 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.020
 but I can hardly see his eyes 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:28.800
 is there petting here that is essentially 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:34.490
 essentially exploit this design 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.490
 also can not be clearly cleaned
