00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.800
 it is the meters of talking to head chip 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.610
 of nokia gamer and today I'm going to teach 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.810
 for you how to make this sword of 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.619
 minecraft diamond only with cardboard 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.779
 and home materials that you will see 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.500
 follow all the materials that we are going to 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:34.440
 use in this upcoming production say let's 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:38.129
 there the materials for us to do this 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.530
 diamond sword are the following one 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.480
 glue stick or liquid in case of 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.840
 are always net as it is I think more 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.570
 easy to handle a pen to make 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.840
 the mold a pair of scissors 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.289
 it is recommended to use thin end to end 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.780
 huh 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.879
 small so it gets easier to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.440
 cut is and the impressions of the sword 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.199
 I'll be making it available on 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.049
 description of this video download of a pdf 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.060
 in which you can lower these two in 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.850
 sheet a4 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.390
 so you may be making the sword 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.799
 also a clear card that will be the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.240
 that will sustain the things that 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.530
 Happen here. 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.549
 The secret is working. It's also difficult. 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.740
 a leaf that never 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.810
 God, with cardboard, that in the case 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.829
 is using milk because he is more 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.540
 fine right 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.880
 they can use anyone in their 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.990
 preference but would be using cardboard 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.759
 of milk 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.950
 now that you know all the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.950
 materials we will go to the next step 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.399
 this step we will need a 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.240
 scissors in which we will cut the two 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.210
 swords 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.229
 this one or the front and this one is the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.259
 verse 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.670
 Can you see the shadow are different? 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.740
 the two swords 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.049
 We'll get the scissors and let's go. 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.659
 remember around them 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.380
 The record does not have to be perfect 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.030
 We'll sort it out later. 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.610
 all the bad clippings right? 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:20.770
 then the record as you know soon 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:23.290
 let the next step in step with the 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.280
 two swords already cut out like you 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.520
 can see it 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.850
 We'll get one of the two put. 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.340
 one to the corner get you the other and 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.520
 Let's put it on the cardboard in an area 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.700
 free and let's draw soon let's do 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.700
 a kind of outline in it on the cardboard 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:50.500
 What did you immediately see next? 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:53.260
 now with the sword already drawn on the 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.440
 as you can see 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.950
 We'll get the scissors and let's go. 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.739
 remind us of the cardboard that this will be 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.350
 our sword or cardboard well and 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.630
 it is recommended to use a stylus because with 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.780
 the scissors are really hard to cut 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.010
 but since I do not have a stylus I will 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.290
 use the scissors 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:21.670
 let's now to the next step 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:24.549
 continue to play our part now 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.430
 as you can see our role already 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.070
 is cut in the shape of the sword 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.230
 let's see a simple and relaxing step 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.600
 what is necklace 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.900
 We'll get the liquid glue the stick. 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.180
 and pass on the sword with there that we have 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.370
 that spread it or see more care 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.190
 not to spread too much can not stay 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:51.579
 with many bubbles and rip the sword 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:53.769
 let's now to the next step case 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.560
 you are using liquid glue 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.130
 You will cross-shaped walkway 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.829
 so well in the shape of the same sword and will 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.840
 spread it with your well-spread finger 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.530
 as I said earlier not to 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.530
 create bubbles 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:17.150
 now with the glue already spread 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:19.430
 you will get the already trimmed pdf that 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:26.540
 we import from the beginning of the video and 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:28.520
 paste it on the cardboard with the sword 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.590
 already glued on cardboard 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.820
 you will notice that there have been some 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:38.210
 burrs along the sword but relax 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.450
 all this you can take with the scissors 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.090
 throughout the process and do not forget 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.930
 you should put the other side of the 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.540
 sword 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.840
 said process following the same 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.840
 previously 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:59.150
 now with all the burrs taken and 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:02.900
 with the front and back of the sword glued 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:06.020
 and of course the sword also signed right 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:10.160
 we finished our sword of the 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:13.580
 minecraft and we can already kill the 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.729
 clippers or the head of the 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:20.570
 pheromone we have here I'm going to put 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:26.210
 the sword in my holder and there is another 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:28.610
 which had already done nothing of heavy rain and 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.680
 This is what this was a quick video of 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.020
