00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.089
 another video with the introduction of the c3 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.890
 Processors succeeded in combining the combination 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.690
 out of achievement and that one 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.929
 manageable price we throw today 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.730
 a look at the new c3 12 31 v3 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.379
 and welcome to one 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.800
 further review after the glorious 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.400
 success of the c3 12 30 v 3 offers intel with 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.920
 the 12 31 43 a cpu of the latest harry 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.170
 fresh generation altogether were 12 10 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.210
 The three hessel called Cdu on the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.390
 Mass market let loose with optional 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.630
 a stroke of up to 4 1 gigahertz with 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.329
 except the e3 12 26 v3 own all 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.550
 c &amp; c up to four cores eight threads and eight 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.829
 megabyte l3-cache the intel hd graphics 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.280
 is reserved for only a few models 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.090
 Test Candidate e3 12 31 v3 is now clocking 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.399
 with 34 or 3.8 ghz yes and that was it 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.320
 then already four cores 8 8 megabytes 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.910
 cache and so on and so on 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.039
 stays the same as the old one 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.140
 predecessor 12.30 before 3m offers this 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.300
 refresh model just 100 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.670
 megahertz more timing typical of intel 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.790
 new cpu means new chip set 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.630
 in principle, c and b 312 31 v3 apply 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.509
 is with the chipsets b85 h 87 as well 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.270
 z 87 compatible provided the most current 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.369
 version is installed more info too 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.439
 Intel's new chip set generation is available 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.000
 in a separate video linked in the 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.920
 video description the past 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.420
 already showed that a minimal increase 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.259
 no huge boost in performance 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.900
 can cause 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.970
 if this also applies to the 12 31 v3 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.270
 Let's take a closer look 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.270
 it's 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.300
 overall, this is also evident here 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.460
 once that the increase in the basic 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.200
 clocking at 100 megahertz no giant 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.710
 Achievement scores achieved as already the 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.720
 predecessor 12.30 before 3 he offers 12 31 v3 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.700
 a tremendous achievement for everyone 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.960
 conceivable scope of application with the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.130
 do without an internet the 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.960
 graphics unit and the 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.570
 transfer option is this cpu 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.120
 the combination of the price of an i5 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.250
 and the power of an i7 processor like 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.170
 usual is the most important question whether 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.210
 An upgrade to a hesse refresh 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.040
 cpu worth it in the first place worth the 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.750
 hessel refresh cpu it just for all 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.700
 those who are completely new 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.950
 want to build a system owns its 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.110
 sandy as a resort system, the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.020
 refresh series without skipping 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.830
 Find more videos on henry 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.480
 you here 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.920
 or in the video description then 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.390
 I almost thank you if you 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.980
 liked then gave the video yet 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.420
 a thumbs up thought and 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.040
 Impressions fit as always well in the 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.310
 Comment section in this sense 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.310
