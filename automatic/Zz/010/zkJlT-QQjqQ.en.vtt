00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.600
 Hello, welcome to the painting in the last class. 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.910
 we started talking about the 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.949
 general characteristics of annelids 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.930
 today we will talk about the classification 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:18.240
 in this lode 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.910
 Do you know the classes of 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.040
 good olden days 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.810
 before we talk about the classes 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.020
 important to remember that this 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.030
 classification is based on the quantity 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:35.160
 of bristles the bristles are very 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:38.100
 important for locomotion in annelids 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.219
 the annelids may have many bristles 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.170
 few or have no offer 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.399
 Let's see here then when it happens. 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.149
 this good ranking first we have to 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.839
 class of politicians and by name 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.899
 we'll understand what 500 means 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.569
 personal means bristles and polly 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.110
 many are animals that have 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:06.450
 many bristles politicians are 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.990
 predominantly marine 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.829
 they live locomovendo actively in the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:18.840
 can live in galleries 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:22.340
 that are made in the sands in each of my 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.759
 body of politicians exists expansions 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.890
 which are called para puhdys 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.159
 are very similar structures 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:38.429
 cantatas are represented here 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:41.880
 the puddings and near here para 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:45.539
 puddings we find the bristles and how 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.810
 I already told you in this group there are many 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:51.200
 bristles but what is being on the ballot 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.359
 staff are small filaments 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.749
 generally thin and not very rigid 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:02:01.079
 and they facilitate the movement of the 

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:05.759
 annelids so here we represent 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.890
 the bristles the best known representative 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.120
 of the politicians we have is nereida 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.600
 Nereida is a predatory marine worm with 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.930
 night activity and can reach up to 45 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.819
 centimeters in length 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.840
 on the head of these animals 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:29.159
 there are some tentacles and also oils 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.010
 very primitive ones going beyond the 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:35.129
 politicians we also have the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.189
 oligopolies and what do you think 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:42.569
 that name means as I already said 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:45.989
 that everything means little sow and oligo 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.209
 then these are annelids with few 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.639
 body bristles 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.540
 It is in this group that we find the 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:57.900
 Earthworms live many 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.870
 gardens and their bristles are invisible to 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.989
 naked eye but you can see the 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.980
 worm bristles if they pass on the 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.989
 posterior region to the anterior region 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.569
 of the body passing in well 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.109
 slowly along the body of this 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.930
 animal 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:18.599
 you will be able to feel the bristles 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.470
 earthworms have no head and no 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.199
 puddings 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.739
 they have a mouth located in the 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:28.500
 first segment of the body-one that 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.049
 is located at the last 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.709
 feed small remains of 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:37.169
 vegetable fungi bacteria and they 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.739
 have an important role 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:43.319
 because they make it easier to 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:47.040
 process of decomposition of matter 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.949
 Organic much personal attention worm 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.319
 it is not a composer organism 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:53.370
 the decomposers are fungi and 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.680
 bacteria 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.709
 but the earthworms they can crush 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.069
 particles that are in the sun and this 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.659
 facilitate decomposition 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.280
 these animals are also very 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:09.180
 important to the process of 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:13.220
 fertilization and the last class 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:16.199
 of annelids is the class of Ciro dinho's 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.500
 In this class we find the famous ones. 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:22.289
 blood sucks and these animals do not 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.289
 have sows in blood sucks 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:28.139
 usually live in freshwater environment 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.680
 there are few species that are marine 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.830
 and most live in 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.990
 before one - such as marshes and 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:42.710
 these animals have suction cups 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:46.210
 in the anterior region of the body that the region 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.520
 of the head and also in the posterior region 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.490
 which is the region of the anus 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.400
 these suction cups are very important 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.460
 for fixing these animals 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:02.449
 and in these suction cups there are small 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.770
 identical and how you should imagine the 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:08.960
 leech name comes from the food habit 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.650
 of these animals because they feed on 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.050
 of blood they suck the blood or 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.570
 body fluids of various 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.530
 vertebrates such as fish 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:24.349
 reptiles and even mammals 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.889
 when there is blood rising it fixes on the animal 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:31.009
 happens the injection of a substance 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:33.800
 anticoagulant through these identical 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:36.860
 this anticoagulant substance makes 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.900
 the blood does not become coagulated and action 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.440
 who climbed got to ingest this liquid 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.830
 with greater ease and certain species 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.080
 leech can even ingest animals 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.740
 whole body as per 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.900
 example, slugs, worms and larvae of 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.000
 insects 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.580
 we ended up here with the classification 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.130
 of the annelids and in the next class 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.389
 let's talk about the goal to improve not 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.389
 Lose yourself there
