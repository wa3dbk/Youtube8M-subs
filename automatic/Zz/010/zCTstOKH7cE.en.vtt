means clean up and yeah clean up the
cylinder<00:01:10.530> bores<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> outcome

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.850 

this<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:20.210> there<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.390> is

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
this is there it is

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.420 
this is there it is

heads installed one now coercion place
there's<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.520> reason<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.090> time<00:01:27.840> being

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
there's a reason for that time being

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
been primed some system we did that nor

is<00:02:05.100> where<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.369> learned<00:02:05.640> from<00:02:07.910> most<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.770> of

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
is where I learned from most of it of

is where I learned from most of it of
course<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.190> kind<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.610> have<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.790> natural

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
course I just kind of have a natural

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.380 
course I just kind of have a natural
knack<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.660> deal<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:14.670> oil<00:02:14.819> can<00:02:15.180> it

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
knack to deal with it to the oil can it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.809 
knack to deal with it to the oil can it
that<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.989> doesn't<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.650> doesn't<00:02:16.819> get

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
that that doesn't that doesn't get

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.800 
that that doesn't that doesn't get
installed<00:02:18.890> based<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.010> don't<00:02:20.160> think<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:23.810> there's

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
installed based I don't think so there's

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.660 
installed based I don't think so there's
a<00:02:24.900> reason<00:02:25.140> why<00:02:25.440> developed<00:02:25.950> cupboards<00:02:26.280> off<00:02:26.459> on

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
a reason why developed cupboards off on

I<00:04:01.220> seem<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.370> believe<00:04:04.430> so<00:04:05.430> what<00:04:05.730> happened<00:04:06.120> here

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
I seem to believe so what happened here

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.660 
I seem to believe so what happened here
was<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:06.570> we<00:04:06.750> broke<00:04:06.990> rank<00:04:07.380> yeah<00:04:10.370> this<00:04:11.370> is<00:04:11.550> the

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
was that we broke rank yeah this is the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.990 
was that we broke rank yeah this is the
motor<00:04:11.880> that<00:04:12.030> came<00:04:12.480> out<00:04:13.370> when<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.550> one<00:04:14.760> that's

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
motor that came out when the one that's

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.870 
motor that came out when the one that's
in<00:04:15.240> it<00:04:15.360> now<00:04:15.570> was<00:04:15.960> put<00:04:16.200> in<00:04:16.350> and<00:04:17.190> that<00:04:17.520> wasn't

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
in it now was put in and that wasn't

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.330 
in it now was put in and that wasn't
supposed<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.600> really<00:04:19.230> do<00:04:19.680> much<00:04:19.950> but

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
supposed to really do much but

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.240 
supposed to really do much but
surprisingly<00:04:21.030> enough<00:04:21.150> they<00:04:21.600> did<00:04:21.810> it<00:04:22.800> lasted

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
surprisingly enough they did it lasted

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.890 
surprisingly enough they did it lasted
three<00:04:23.490> years<00:04:23.520> so<00:04:24.090> what<00:04:24.840> do<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:24.990> know<00:04:25.820> so<00:04:26.900> when

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
three years so what do you know so when

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.920 
three years so what do you know so when
this<00:04:28.050> engine<00:04:28.470> was<00:04:28.680> installed<00:04:29.180> it<00:04:30.180> had<00:04:30.450> new

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
this engine was installed it had new

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.790 
this engine was installed it had new
heads<00:04:33.170> they<00:04:34.170> were<00:04:34.290> rebuilt

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
heads they were rebuilt

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.420 
heads they were rebuilt
anyway<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:36.510> injector<00:04:36.930> we<00:04:37.770> had<00:04:37.980> a<00:04:38.010> couple<00:04:38.280> of

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
anyway the injector we had a couple of

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.520 
anyway the injector we had a couple of
injector<00:04:38.940> pumps<00:04:39.300> we've<00:04:39.480> had<00:04:39.630> one<00:04:39.840> rebuilt<00:04:40.230> for

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
injector pumps we've had one rebuilt for

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.250 
injector pumps we've had one rebuilt for
it<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:43.520> it's<00:04:44.520> only<00:04:44.670> got<00:04:44.880> 15,000<00:04:45.810> on<00:04:45.900> itself

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
it and it's only got 15,000 on itself

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.590 
it and it's only got 15,000 on itself
they<00:04:47.100> should<00:04:47.310> be<00:04:47.460> good<00:04:47.700> we<00:04:47.940> just<00:04:48.150> took<00:04:48.330> and

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
they should be good we just took and

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.690 
they should be good we just took and
check<00:04:48.810> them<00:04:48.990> all<00:04:49.110> out<00:04:49.350> and<00:04:49.530> they're<00:04:50.370> good<00:04:50.580> to

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
check them all out and they're good to

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.490 
check them all out and they're good to
go<00:04:50.880> so<00:04:51.270> there's<00:04:51.510> no<00:04:51.690> sitting<00:04:52.020> on<00:04:52.140> that<00:04:52.380> other

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
go so there's no sitting on that other

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:13.830 
go so there's no sitting on that other
engine

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.330 

we've<00:05:14.840> started<00:05:15.110> working<00:05:15.380> on<00:05:15.680> it<00:05:15.740> we're

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
we've started working on it we're

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.730 
we've started working on it we're
waiting<00:05:16.730> for<00:05:16.900> this<00:05:17.900> to<00:05:17.960> come<00:05:18.260> out<00:05:18.440> for<00:05:18.710> a

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:02.570 
see if I can find me a stove over to

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.140 
see if I can find me a stove over to
rebuild<00:07:03.460> maybe<00:07:04.460> that<00:07:04.669> I<00:07:04.700> can<00:07:04.820> get<00:07:04.910> something

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.150
