 those who know us and nothing we are very 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.289
 happy and satisfied to have 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.750
 participated in this in this adventure so 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.259
 nice for us really a dream 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.390
 what we have been able to do and we will continue 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.420
 struggling to achieve our dreams and 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.040
 our goals thank you good fits 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.840
 stress that 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.220
 in participation we still have 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.270
 little deformed time we are an orchestra 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.240
 new nerves were inside 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.770
 positioned from within us 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.630
 just like at the beginning we thought very 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.780
 shy but then we were not affirming 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.850
 where in such a way that we start to 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.340
 like the producers and especially 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.790
 our first producer maricarmen 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.920
 Marin was already 20 seconds away so that 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.590
 close the wall and you obviously 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.110
 they remain that they want disqualified but 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.400
 in an incredible way let's say 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.970
 begin to rise this the jury does not and 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.950
 you manage to pass this fence so it is 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.340
 as I say we started a little shy 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.800
 nervous about him because of the magnitude of 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.690
 event that we are participating not us 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.670
 we are left to say open mouth because 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.670
 we never knew this with the short time 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.010
 that we have never thought to get to that to 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.819
 times instances but not good thanks to 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.329
 God gave us the strength to be able 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.579
 to understand each other and to refine our 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.260
 instruments and the singers can 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.980
 tune your voice to be able to do so 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.819
 dance to the producers who lived as 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.760
 as they have presented to you this 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.069
 as a sweet cane when the trujillo 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.170
 provinces copy will marry how the 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.030
 presentation in this contest this is what 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.280
 that we cut ourselves as good as 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.829
 be big they wanted us we wanted to get there 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.200
 and we arrived not like a big house 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.510
 dynamic at the moment that our 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.299
 singer begins to give his first 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.840
 words and start singing and first thing 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.000
 what I did was from home big cane 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.349
 sweet orchestra is the first thing he said 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.780
 after we feel very 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.639
 proud of that my family and I the 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.129
 family lion sanchez is grateful to 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.379
 first with god with all the 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.629
 musicians that accompanied us that not that 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.909
 they accompany us and as the town of house 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.250
 great with all those nice people that 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.049
 supported us well the next step is 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.849
 we have the first gala we are already 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.530
 within the program and which from here 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.870
 let's go compete with different 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.810
 groupings around Peru that's a 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.220
 very very tough competition because they are in 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.629
 the second season and I think that 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.090
 they saved the best for this second 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.680
 season and within them we 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.870
 for us 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.700
 it's beneficial benefit and it's a great 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.060
 profit and a dream achieved is not 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.129
 He invested a lot but the satisfaction is 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.620
 very very very big very apart from what 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.659
 economic of all satisfaction by 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.790
 achieve this dream this dream come true 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.459
 reality is very immense I do not have 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.009
 words to be able to describe everything 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:21.639
 that I feel at this moment what kind 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:23.860
 have been playing as an orchestra so far 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.600
 we have six months not to see him a year 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.520
 year since last year that we do not present 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.460

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.380
 great not who invited us this the 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.849
 mayor of big caste we 're the 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.770
 former mayor of a large house in which 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:39.310
 We are very grateful because there 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:42.310

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.160

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.210
 little kick of luck and see what luck 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.190

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.750
 happen from here to forward you already 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.759

 national level as my brother said was 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:01.759
 it's a very tough competition really 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.759
 we went with just 4 months of 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.710
 formed as an orchestra we do not compete with 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.870
 great orchestras that were already 10 years old 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.360

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.370
 there as good house great tell us what we are 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.319
 and I think most of the house surrendered 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.050
 we are talented and that is what 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:20.180
 We take us to the capital 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.639

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.570
 the theme that made us win the casting in 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.120
 first place of videos and the one that made us 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.190

 they have come from moralito but this music 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.660
 is delayed 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:41.870
 uniformed we are happy there are many 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.490
 things that we have to cook gives me a lot 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.410

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.970
 difference they see they were the ones 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.400
 they played the day of their casting today now 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.710
 others appear that what we have to 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.930
 get let's teach let's give it 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:00.260
 with a bag with strength to make 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.690
 best of this category of comments 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.900
 many so that the producers have 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.880
 request to the authorities is that they give 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.350
 little more of importance to young people 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.060
 big house and not the young 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.640
 talented a lot of talent in big house 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.370
 in the province of ascope not good now 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.680
 that we are on anniversary do not wait 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.020
 that the mayor communicates with us 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.720
 or the party committee so that a u 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.190
 another way we have a presentation in 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.750
 the in the event that is this that is going to 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.940
 perform not for the house libertarian 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.310
 great since we were also 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.710
 our first presentation in said 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.180
 event not also for example us 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:38.419
 we feel suddenly a little 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.550
 because we heard out there that they bring 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:42.229
 group from outside like the serrano heart 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.889
 we did not try to compare ourselves with them 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:48.080
 but at least this one wants him 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:50.690
 it was the mayor that now that we have a 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.789
 authority the first mayor give us the 

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.889
 opportunity to share the stage with 

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:57.440
 them since it would be for us a great 

00:07:54.889 --> 00:08:01.150
 more achievement in our on our way 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.150
 which is in the way of music not 

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.860
 it seems that this group and that knows 

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.750
 lift the producers of your cart 

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.750
 and go to the next stage
