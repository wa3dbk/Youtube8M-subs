00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 in 1963 the extrication actor was 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.600
 used for the first time on a 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.220
 racing circuit 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.599
 the tool was six groups they 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.500
 had to be hanging on the back 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.210
 a van 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.099
 now he weighs only fifteen 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.839
 kilos can be handled by just one 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.640
 person and helps to clear a 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.390
 victim of a road accident in 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.390
 a few minutes 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.420
 during an emergency 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.420
 the minutes are precious 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.940
 a rescue tool must open a 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.620
 vehicle like a tin can and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.010
 cut in steel calm as in 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.720
 butter 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.170
 because a few seconds can do 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.170
 all the difference 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.590
 it is a hydraulic fluid that gives 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.760
 the power to the jaws that cut 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.760
 and to branches that spreads 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.310
 the manufacture of an extrication 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.710
 starts with a milling machines that 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.690
 shape the jaws or branches in 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.900
 a solid aluminum bar of quality 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.900
 aviation 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.540
 these branches are then coated with a 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.189
 protective layer a turn its brick 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.890
 now the protective cap that 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.110
 will cover the end of the tool a 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.880
 sharp attack carbide shapes 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.070
 solid aluminum that turns high 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.170
 speed into a stopper which will then 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.369
 pierced and treated with a layer of 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.369
 whole rust protector 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.990
 the branches are made of steel to 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.990
 tools 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.270
 a grinding machine guaranteed that they 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.270
 are perfectly flat 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.920
 a worker inserts a seal that will prevent 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.220
 the hydraulic fluid to escape from the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.220
 cylinder 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.520
 they lubricate a year track with fluid 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.540
 hydraulic so they read in the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.130
 cylinder without damaging the interior 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.420
 then lens years using a mallet to 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.870
 that it can be connected to a 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.870
 joint 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.530
 it connects this joint to the pistons 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.420
 and firmly secures it up this 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.310
 articulation transmits power to 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.310
 branches to cut or spread 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.319
 I 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.629
 the worker then puts the cap 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.900
 assembled in place on the cylinder and the 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.900
 boulogne 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.220
 it is aimed at the two casings connected to the cylinder 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.140
 hydraulic tool and installs a 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.790
 plug that protects the hoses and makes 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.960
 using the wheel easier 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.400
 the worker tightens the bolts and 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.400
 Complete the order tap 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.599
 he then sets the handle at 20 which allows 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.810
 the operator to hold the tool in 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.810
 security 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.150
 this protective device will look 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.900
 all moving parts away from 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.900
 rescuer's hands 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.739
 the worker now aligns the holes 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.989
 in the jaws to those of the tool and 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.989
 inserts a steel hinge pin 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.760
 they place a counter nut and as 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.140
 for all the bindings of authie their 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.430
 greenhouse according to standards 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.430
 precise engineering 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.890
 once the jaws are in place 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.870
 the worker securely secures them to 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.610
 articulation using an axis 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.940
 of steel alloys and a ring of 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.940
 detention 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.110
 he's now unfolding the device 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.110
 protector and finishes the assembly 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.520
 a worker test the extricating actors 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.870
 which was filled with fluids 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.030
 hydraulic fire-resistant 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.010
 the device he uses is designed 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.330
 to measure the pressure where it is 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.330
 the strongest during the cut 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.830
 the tool passed the pressure test 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.550
 that it is necessary to cut the metal or the open 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.890
 to clear a victim 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.210
 thanks to this tool the emergency teams 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.250
 who arrive at the scene of an accident 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.250
 are equipped to save lives
