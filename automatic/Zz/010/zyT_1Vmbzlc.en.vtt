00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.050 

I<00:00:00.230> did<00:00:01.230> not<00:00:01.439> expect<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:02.040> cheapo<00:00:02.429> that<00:00:02.639> old<00:00:02.760> I<00:00:02.909> was

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
I did not expect a cheapo that old I was

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.269 
I did not expect a cheapo that old I was
hoping<00:00:03.389> to<00:00:03.510> get<00:00:03.629> medals<00:00:04.170> in<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.410> super-g<00:00:05.130> and

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
hoping to get medals in the super-g and

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.710 
hoping to get medals in the super-g and
the<00:00:05.339> divine<00:00:05.670> but<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.029> didn't<00:00:06.359> think<00:00:06.450> they'd<00:00:06.660> be

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
the divine but I didn't think they'd be

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.320 
the divine but I didn't think they'd be
gold<00:00:07.200> so<00:00:07.589> that's<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.090> definitely<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.120> presence

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
gold so that's a definitely a presence

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.020 
gold so that's a definitely a presence
of<00:00:09.630> pleasant<00:00:10.200> surprise<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:10.679> far<00:00:10.710> but<00:00:11.130> uh<00:00:11.160> you

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
of pleasant surprise so far but uh you

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.190 
of pleasant surprise so far but uh you
know<00:00:12.090> maybe<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.389> puts<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.719> little<00:00:12.840> added

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
know maybe that puts a little added

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.390 
know maybe that puts a little added
pressure<00:00:13.380> for<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.799> PSoC

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400

I don't know when I was 16 I guess I

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.350 
I don't know when I was 16 I guess I
didn't<00:00:21.460> think<00:00:21.520> that<00:00:21.760> I<00:00:21.790> was<00:00:21.910> gonna<00:00:22.000> have<00:00:22.180> the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
didn't think that I was gonna have the

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.420 
didn't think that I was gonna have the
career<00:00:22.720> that<00:00:22.750> I<00:00:22.990> did<00:00:23.230> I'm<00:00:23.950> with<00:00:24.100> so<00:00:24.280> many

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
career that I did I'm with so many

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.980 
career that I did I'm with so many
injuries<00:00:24.760> and<00:00:25.060> there's<00:00:25.240> been<00:00:25.360> almost<00:00:25.600> five

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
injuries and there's been almost five

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.250 
injuries and there's been almost five
years<00:00:26.050> of<00:00:26.740> skiing<00:00:27.100> so<00:00:27.690> somehow<00:00:28.690> in<00:00:28.930> those<00:00:29.080> five

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
years of skiing so somehow in those five

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.750 
years of skiing so somehow in those five
years<00:00:29.290> I<00:00:29.560> did<00:00:29.740> make<00:00:29.890> it<00:00:29.920> to<00:00:30.280> the<00:00:30.580> World

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.900 
years I did make it to the World
Championships<00:00:31.420> but<00:00:31.780> I<00:00:32.760> don't<00:00:33.760> know<00:00:33.820> I'm

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
Championships but I don't know I'm

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.430 
Championships but I don't know I'm
pretty<00:00:33.940> happy<00:00:34.360> with<00:00:34.630> how<00:00:34.960> things<00:00:35.200> have<00:00:35.410> been

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
pretty happy with how things have been

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.860 
pretty happy with how things have been
going<00:00:35.560> lately<00:00:35.860> and<00:00:36.430> I<00:00:36.790> played<00:00:37.450> a<00:00:37.480> lot<00:00:37.690> in<00:00:37.720> the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
going lately and I played a lot in the

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.279 
going lately and I played a lot in the
last<00:00:37.960> couple<00:00:38.230> years

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.939 

oh<00:00:43.059> I<00:00:44.059> think<00:00:44.510> we<00:00:44.780> always<00:00:44.960> have<00:00:45.260> you<00:00:45.500> know<00:00:45.530> top

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
oh I think we always have you know top

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.310 
oh I think we always have you know top
of<00:00:46.129> athletes<00:00:46.609> that<00:00:46.960> we<00:00:47.960> don't<00:00:48.109> have<00:00:48.199> the

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
of athletes that we don't have the

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.020 
of athletes that we don't have the
deepest<00:00:48.620> team<00:00:48.800> like<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.280> Austrians<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:49.850> or

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
deepest team like the Austrians to or

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.209 
deepest team like the Austrians to or
something<00:00:50.239> like<00:00:50.390> that<00:00:50.449> but<00:00:50.839> we<00:00:50.960> have<00:00:51.140> you<00:00:52.129> know

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
something like that but we have you know

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.430 
something like that but we have you know
the<00:00:52.339> last<00:00:52.550> for<00:00:53.030> a<00:00:53.089> while<00:00:53.239> we've<00:00:53.479> had<00:00:53.510> athletes

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
the last for a while we've had athletes

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.689 
the last for a while we've had athletes
that<00:00:54.589> are<00:00:54.649> winning<00:00:55.430> races<00:00:55.609> and<00:00:56.030> um<00:00:57.549> yeah<00:00:58.549> it's

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
that are winning races and um yeah it's

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.069 
that are winning races and um yeah it's
tough<00:00:58.850> ii<00:00:59.210> yeah<00:00:59.269> i<00:00:59.329> don't<00:00:59.570> and<00:00:59.750> World

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
tough ii yeah i don't and World

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.479 
tough ii yeah i don't and World
Championships<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:00.680> Olympics<00:01:01.039> the<00:01:01.190> fields

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
Championships and Olympics the fields

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:02.799 
Championships and Olympics the fields
aren't<00:01:01.670> quite<00:01:01.820> as<00:01:01.969> deep<00:01:02.149> as<00:01:02.269> it<00:01:02.299> normally<00:01:02.510> are

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
aren't quite as deep as it normally are

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.289 
aren't quite as deep as it normally are
so<00:01:03.079> we<00:01:03.440> have<00:01:04.250> better<00:01:04.460> better<00:01:04.729> opportunities

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
so we have better better opportunities

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:06.520 
so we have better better opportunities
and<00:01:05.509> maybe<00:01:05.659> have<00:01:05.930> a<00:01:05.960> little<00:01:06.049> less<00:01:06.350> pressure

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
and maybe have a little less pressure

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.160 
and maybe have a little less pressure
but<00:01:06.890> I<00:01:07.130> think<00:01:07.580> it's<00:01:07.759> kind<00:01:08.509> of<00:01:08.539> a<00:01:08.630> coincidence

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.359 

medal<00:01:12.170> count<00:01:12.380> why<00:01:12.530> is<00:01:12.590> this<00:01:12.740> this<00:01:13.130> World

different titles but she wasn't there

so I'm I'm excited to have her back and

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.660 
so I'm I'm excited to have her back and
I<00:03:15.510> know<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.980> I'm<00:03:16.980> sure<00:03:17.190> there's<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.430> lot<00:03:17.550> of

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
I know that I'm sure there's a lot of

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.910 
I know that I'm sure there's a lot of
pressure<00:03:17.850> on<00:03:17.970> her<00:03:18.210> but<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:18.630> think<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:19.050> she's

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
pressure on her but I think that she's

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.350 
pressure on her but I think that she's
gonna<00:03:20.070> perform<00:03:20.340> strongly<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.120> I'm<00:03:21.180> really

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
gonna perform strongly and I'm really

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.850 
gonna perform strongly and I'm really
excited<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.720> race<00:03:21.900> against<00:03:22.230> her<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.590> he<00:03:22.710> goes

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
excited to race against her and he goes

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.880 
excited to race against her and he goes

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.790 

I<00:03:30.920> think<00:03:31.520> that<00:03:31.750> pressure<00:03:32.750> is<00:03:33.020> just<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.350> frame<00:03:33.620> of

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
I think that pressure is just a frame of

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.110 
I think that pressure is just a frame of
mind<00:03:33.830> business<00:03:34.400> is<00:03:34.520> just<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.760> mindset<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:37.120> I'm

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
mind business is just a mindset and I'm

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.210 
mind business is just a mindset and I'm
doing<00:03:38.570> this<00:03:38.660> for<00:03:38.900> me<00:03:39.020> and<00:03:39.200> racing<00:03:39.920> because

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
doing this for me and racing because

I've always loved racing and I love the
feeling<00:03:42.560> of<00:03:42.770> going<00:03:43.430> fast<00:03:43.730> there's<00:03:44.570> this

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
feeling of going fast there's this

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.570 
feeling of going fast there's this
adrenaline<00:03:45.350> rush<00:03:45.530> that<00:03:45.560> can't<00:03:46.190> be<00:03:46.280> replaced

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
adrenaline rush that can't be replaced

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.440 
adrenaline rush that can't be replaced
and<00:03:47.500> that's<00:03:48.500> on<00:03:48.710> doing<00:03:49.580> when<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:49.820> race<00:03:50.120> when<00:03:50.360> I'm

parents<00:03:54.320> want<00:03:54.500> me<00:03:54.530> to<00:03:54.620> do<00:03:55.450> yeah<00:03:56.450> I<00:03:56.480> think<00:03:56.690> in<00:03:57.020> a

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
parents want me to do yeah I think in a

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.470 
parents want me to do yeah I think in a
way<00:03:57.230> having<00:03:57.860> happy<00:03:58.430> had<00:03:58.670> success<00:03:59.090> this<00:03:59.240> year

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
way having happy had success this year

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.820 
way having happy had success this year
there<00:03:59.660> is<00:03:59.690> definitely<00:04:00.230> more<00:04:00.290> pressure<00:04:00.350> just

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
there is definitely more pressure just

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.420 
there is definitely more pressure just
because<00:04:01.990> you<00:04:02.990> know<00:04:03.080> you<00:04:03.170> value<00:04:03.320> value<00:04:04.190> that<00:04:04.370> uh

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
because you know you value value that uh

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.580 
because you know you value value that uh
those<00:04:05.270> achievements<00:04:05.600> not<00:04:05.900> much<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:06.350> you

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
those achievements not much and you

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.130 
those achievements not much and you
definitely<00:04:06.950> want<00:04:07.160> it<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:07.430> I<00:04:07.700> want<00:04:08.360> to<00:04:08.390> try<00:04:09.080> to

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
definitely want it so I want to try to

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.900 
definitely want it so I want to try to
defend<00:04:09.350> my<00:04:09.530> time<00:04:09.739> with<00:04:09.950> yes<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:10.250> you<00:04:10.820> know

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
defend my time with yes and you know

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.360 
defend my time with yes and you know
after<00:04:11.270> winning<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.690> last<00:04:11.840> couple<00:04:12.800> races<00:04:12.860> here

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
after winning the last couple races here

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.550 
after winning the last couple races here
it's<00:04:13.550> uh<00:04:13.820> adds<00:04:14.780> more<00:04:14.930> pressure<00:04:14.989> but<00:04:15.440> at<00:04:15.500> the

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
it's uh adds more pressure but at the

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.860 
it's uh adds more pressure but at the
same<00:04:15.709> time<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.040> think<00:04:16.280> it's<00:04:17.150> not<00:04:17.390> more<00:04:17.570> pressure

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
same time I think it's not more pressure

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.390 
same time I think it's not more pressure
than<00:04:18.109> I've<00:04:18.500> dealt<00:04:18.799> with<00:04:18.859> before<00:04:19.040> another

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
than I've dealt with before another

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.510 
than I've dealt with before another
World<00:04:19.669> Cup<00:04:19.850> races<00:04:20.209> and<00:04:20.390> it's<00:04:21.109> you<00:04:21.709> know<00:04:21.769> like

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
World Cup races and it's you know like

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.190 
World Cup races and it's you know like
Mikhail<00:04:22.850> said<00:04:23.030> it's<00:04:23.180> just<00:04:23.390> you<00:04:23.540> just<00:04:23.810> have<00:04:23.930> to

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
Mikhail said it's just you just have to

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.170 
Mikhail said it's just you just have to
be<00:04:24.320> fast<00:04:24.560> down<00:04:24.770> through<00:04:24.980> the<00:04:25.070> gates<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:25.550> you

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
be fast down through the gates and you

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.929 
be fast down through the gates and you
just<00:04:26.330> got<00:04:26.450> to<00:04:26.540> get<00:04:26.600> your<00:04:26.690> head<00:04:26.870> out<00:04:27.020> of<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.140> way

00:04:31.929 --> 00:04:31.939 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:33.609 

on<00:04:32.209> the<00:04:32.449> tech<00:04:32.659> side<00:04:32.689> I<00:04:32.959> mostly<00:04:33.289> look<00:04:33.439> on<00:04:33.559> the

00:04:33.609 --> 00:04:33.619 
on the tech side I mostly look on the

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:35.529 
on the tech side I mostly look on the
tech<00:04:33.800> side<00:04:34.009> and<00:04:34.189> I<00:04:34.309> think<00:04:34.369> we<00:04:35.240> don't<00:04:35.419> have

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
tech side and I think we don't have

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.139 
tech side and I think we don't have
whole<00:04:35.809> and<00:04:36.189> yeah<00:04:37.189> we're<00:04:37.550> still<00:04:37.789> hooked<00:04:38.059> up

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:38.149 
whole and yeah we're still hooked up

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:40.449 
whole and yeah we're still hooked up
guys<00:04:38.330> mostly<00:04:38.809> but<00:04:39.020> most<00:04:39.709> of<00:04:39.830> our<00:04:39.919> coaches<00:04:40.339> are

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:40.459 
guys mostly but most of our coaches are

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:42.010 
guys mostly but most of our coaches are
American<00:04:41.059> that<00:04:41.149> I<00:04:41.240> work<00:04:41.419> with<00:04:41.449> that<00:04:41.629> worked<00:04:41.929> a

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
American that I work with that worked a

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.929 
American that I work with that worked a
little<00:04:42.110> bit<00:04:42.289> of<00:04:42.409> Andy<00:04:42.709> but<00:04:42.889> uh<00:04:42.919> you<00:04:43.729> know<00:04:43.789> they

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:43.939 
little bit of Andy but uh you know they

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:47.199 
little bit of Andy but uh you know they
do<00:04:44.059> a<00:04:44.089> good<00:04:44.270> job<00:04:44.330> for<00:04:44.539> sure<00:04:44.869> but<00:04:45.139> um<00:04:46.179> yeah<00:04:47.179> I

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
downtown slalom races that I really

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.080 
downtown slalom races that I really
haven't<00:05:16.110> had<00:05:16.290> much<00:05:16.350> time<00:05:16.710> and<00:05:17.130> here<00:05:17.790> I've<00:05:17.940> been

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
haven't had much time and here I've been

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.450 
haven't had much time and here I've been
training<00:05:18.560> all<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.650> downhill<00:05:19.980> training<00:05:20.280> runs

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
training all the downhill training runs

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.670

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
and then doing the super-g and training

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.780 
and then doing the super-g and training
some<00:05:22.830> song<00:05:23.010> kind<00:05:23.280> of<00:05:23.340> you<00:05:23.400> ready<00:05:23.550> for<00:05:23.730> the

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
some song kind of you ready for the

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.310 
some song kind of you ready for the
combined<00:05:24.090> as<00:05:24.240> well<00:05:24.420> so<00:05:24.660> I<00:05:24.690> really<00:05:24.810> have<00:05:25.200> to

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
combined as well so I really have to

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.340 
combined as well so I really have to
have<00:05:25.470> much<00:05:25.680> time<00:05:25.860> on<00:05:26.070> the<00:05:26.220> jet<00:05:27.060> skis<00:05:27.360> but<00:05:27.750> uh<00:05:27.810> I

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
have much time on the jet skis but uh I

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.290 
have much time on the jet skis but uh I
think<00:05:28.710> I<00:05:29.040> mean<00:05:29.280> a<00:05:29.340> couple<00:05:29.550> days<00:05:29.790> out<00:05:29.940> two<00:05:30.180> days

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
think I mean a couple days out two days

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.000 
think I mean a couple days out two days
of<00:05:30.510> GS<00:05:30.720> training<00:05:31.050> that<00:05:31.260> should<00:05:31.440> be<00:05:31.560> enough<00:05:31.770> to

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
of GS training that should be enough to

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.130 
of GS training that should be enough to
to<00:05:32.580> get<00:05:32.700> the<00:05:32.790> timing<00:05:33.210> the<00:05:33.300> precision<00:05:33.720> back<00:05:33.870> but

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
to get the timing the precision back but

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.470 
to get the timing the precision back but
I<00:05:34.170> can<00:05:34.410> be<00:05:34.530> fast<00:05:34.740> again<00:05:34.980> and<00:05:35.280> uh<00:05:35.400> you<00:05:36.120> know<00:05:36.180> GS

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
I can be fast again and uh you know GS

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.510 
I can be fast again and uh you know GS
is<00:05:36.660> something<00:05:37.050> that<00:05:37.200> actually<00:05:37.320> comes<00:05:38.130> back<00:05:38.340> to

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
is something that actually comes back to

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.670 
is something that actually comes back to
me<00:05:38.580> pretty<00:05:38.760> quickly<00:05:39.000> relative<00:05:39.300> to<00:05:39.810> some<00:05:40.530> other

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
me pretty quickly relative to some other

the snow conditions have come out with

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.430 
the snow conditions have come out with
uh<00:05:47.640> with<00:05:48.420> hot<00:05:48.570> water<00:05:48.660> kind<00:05:48.900> of<00:05:48.990> poor<00:05:49.200> letter

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
uh with hot water kind of poor letter

they've<00:05:49.650> been<00:05:49.800> having<00:05:49.980> in<00:05:50.340> the<00:05:50.400> weeks<00:05:50.640> leading

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
they've been having in the weeks leading

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.520 
they've been having in the weeks leading
up<00:05:51.000> to<00:05:51.060> this<00:05:51.270> so<00:05:51.570> I<00:05:51.840> think<00:05:52.200> they've<00:05:52.380> done<00:05:52.500> a

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530

up to this so I think they've done a
great<00:05:52.710> job<00:05:52.830> and<00:05:53.130> I<00:05:53.190> think<00:05:53.220> being<00:05:53.970> on<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:54.150> hill

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.420 
great job and I think being on the hill
and<00:05:54.960> skiing<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.410> speed<00:05:55.620> races<00:05:55.980> in<00:05:56.070> the<00:05:56.130> super

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
and skiing the speed races in the super

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.770 
and skiing the speed races in the super
geniune<00:05:56.730> and<00:05:56.970> this<00:05:57.150> long<00:05:57.330> even<00:05:57.600> yesterday

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
geniune and this long even yesterday

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.080 
geniune and this long even yesterday
helps<00:05:58.320> you<00:05:58.530> use<00:05:59.250> that<00:05:59.430> snow<00:05:59.640> conditions

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
helps you use that snow conditions

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.060 
helps you use that snow conditions
because<00:06:00.270> it's<00:06:00.420> not<00:06:00.650> 100<00:06:01.650> percent<00:06:01.890> like<00:06:02.010> a

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
because it's not 100 percent like a

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.740 
because it's not 100 percent like a
normal<00:06:02.430> race<00:06:02.580> conditions<00:06:03.030> it's<00:06:03.210> it's<00:06:03.510> hard

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
normal race conditions it's it's hard

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.450 
normal race conditions it's it's hard
but<00:06:03.930> also<00:06:04.140> has<00:06:04.440> kind<00:06:04.740> of<00:06:04.770> a<00:06:04.890> spring<00:06:05.130> each<00:06:05.250> layer

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
but also has kind of a spring each layer

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.260 
but also has kind of a spring each layer
to<00:06:05.550> it<00:06:05.820> so<00:06:06.000> it's<00:06:06.150> a<00:06:06.450> little<00:06:07.020> bit<00:06:07.110> different
