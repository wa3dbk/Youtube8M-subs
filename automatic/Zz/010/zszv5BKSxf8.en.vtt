00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.770
 hi cuberos as I said in my previous 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.170
 video and let's talk about f 2 l methods 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.210
 tricks tips so you can improve 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.509
 our times so if you're already 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.700
 started in frydrych method and wants to be 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.890
 faster this video is going to come to you very 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.619
 well in my previous the video spoke 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.179
 on how to make the cross faster 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.609
 just remember that the ideal is 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.849
 do it in 6 7 8 movements taking 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.009
 two or three seconds on the page of the 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.050
 online timer that timer you will see that 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.480
 there is an option to solve the cross it 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.090
 they indicate the movements and you will see that 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.760
 there are always six seven and eight 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.820
 movements no more we start 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.429
 f2 discuss the like must know 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.280
 look for pairs to insert and finish 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:51.940
 with the first two layers resolved 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.850
 well we have to have already dominated then 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.280
 the different types of pairs I will know 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.300
 identify them and know how to execute them 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:05.710
 example green orange opposites here 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.750
 so I put it under and executed it what is 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.330
 our problem that then the next 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.710
 we have to find it to turn the cube 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.090
 and we lose a few valuable seconds 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.600
 so 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.450
 a good method to improve would be 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.000
 solve the cube very very slowly in such 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.030
 way that while 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.810
 we put the pair that we already know where it goes 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.810
 we are looking at the next pair 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.500
 so as not to waste time and go directly 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.659
 go get him 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.740
 it's one way would be to solve it very 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.530
 slowly another way would be for example 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.060
 with eyes closed 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.950
 we have this pair we already know that it will go 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.110
 well I close my eyes and I solve it 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.950
 because close your eyes to have 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:06.020
 totally auto me automated where is it going 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.539
 each pair in such a way that once we see 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.490
 let's do it very fast and now 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:16.630
 let's keep our next pair in mind 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.640
 worth another method would be to use a 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.290
 metronome 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.280
 a metronome at a normal speed per 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.280
 example 60 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.610
 and we have it 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.070
 well in such a way that the metronome follows 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.170
 and you can not stop if you need to 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.850
 it slows down at the beginning nothing happens 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.020
 so to 40 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.020
 you solve the pair 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.519
 and you're already looking for the next one 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.349
 way that does not appear at any time 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.849
 turn the cube because you rotate the cube 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.900
 but not in any way crazy 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.280
 but with knowing that you're doing 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.620
 because breaks are the worst because 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.560
 begin to spend seconds and tour the 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.620
 cube and you're totally disoriented 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.170
 that's why we've already carried three methods 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.330
 very slowly looking at the next 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:20.810
 Couple with eyes closed to run 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.209
 fast each different type of torque and 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.480
 we have now seen a metronome starting 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.450
 slowly and gradually increasing the 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.560
 speed well and another method that 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:36.150
 I propose I would finally be 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.150
 point us in a paper 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:46.690
 have a table ready for this style 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.270
 in which we are going to make 12 attempts and 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:53.620
 we are going to record the movements that 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:56.890
 we have done to perform the cross and the 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.870
 that we have needed for the c2 l ya 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.210
 I say that the cross would be ideal to do the 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:06.400
 less than 8 movements so if 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:08.110
 we started aiming then 10 12 13 no 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.390
 nothing happens at the beginning you're a little 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.930
 lost and until you find the way 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.850
 faster because you need a lot of practice 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.060
 but the goal of this is to go see 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.920
 you're going to slowly improving 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.100
 end of the two attempts you can do 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.740
 your average and you are comparing you are not going 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.150
 comparing how you are improving in the case 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.250
 of f2 l then let's count the same 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:38.160
 movements that we need to 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:41.090
 solve the f2 l for example it would be 1 2 3 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.930
 we look for the next 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:49.639
 4 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:53.039
 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 so go counting the 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.380
 trying to use the least pauses 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:58.560
 possible is to say rather slowly 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.729
 to see the next pair and let's go 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.530
 pointing the ideal number as I have 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:08.940
 fÃ©lix seen it said in a 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:13.070
 site is 40 and that to be able to do it 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.800
 in less than 40 movements all f2 him 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:19.150
 then I tell you the same thing at first 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.190
 the best point 46-45 nothing happens 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.620
 because we're going to go the goal of this is 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.080
 you're going to love going to want to do 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.420
 do it in the least number of 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.800
 possible movements then to 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.080
 principle will be many but then 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.960
 you will look for the shortest way until 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.830
 you get for example to numbers of 35 30 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.480
 even 25 depending on how the case is 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.570
 nothing else this has been today's video 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.240
 I hope it is very useful for you to put 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:50.210
 in practice these methods that I 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.150
 I propose and nothing if you liked the 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.540
 video subscribe 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:58.950
 and you know very soon more videos in one 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.950
 minute and see you later
