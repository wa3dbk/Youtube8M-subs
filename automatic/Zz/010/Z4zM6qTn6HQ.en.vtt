 post leave to be able to do what is 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.900
 the untethered jailbreak that still does not 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.239
 it goes out to what it is to the public 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.970

 new version will know that they lost 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.610
 what is the gebre a tester but if 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.540

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.730
 or of version 5.0 with this video 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.100
 tutorial will be able to serve them for 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.750
 be able to return to this previous version and 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.420
 can another do what is the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.089
 jailbreak untethered with networks not well 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.239
 let's start a very important note 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:07.950
 for users who have iphone 4s 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:10.320
 ipad ipad 2 and ipad 3 the new ipad not 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.030
 this serves them since it does not yet exist 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.520
 the tool to be able to do what 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.770
 is the always for ipad 3 and for the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.680
 iphone 4 of 7 for two we can not 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.270
 still return from them but always 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.580
 always keep ch ch for maybe in 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.890
 the future will be able to use it well first thing 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.110
 what we need to have are 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.510
 four tools by which he 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.310
 in which we will create what is the 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.050
 custom firmware the second tool 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:44.410
 is the ios 5.0.1 or 5.0 in which 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.050
 we have the cch saved and the and the 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.479
 ch ch file in which we are going to 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.040
 integrate what is in the custom facebook 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.470
 we are also going to need what is the 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.410
 team umbrella to just in case it gives us 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.670
 some error what is in this in this 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.790
 good tutorial video 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.740
 and we are going to execute what is the program 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.780
 for windows users have to 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.340
 open it as administrator and the 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.530
 Mac users have to use what 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.750
 is the red show application and what else 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.300
 ahead what is a video so that 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.890
 know how to do it well 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.170
 here we get what is welcome 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.350
 of the program we are going to give to who says 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.080
 ok and start loading and it's downloaded not 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.060
 is going to come out four options the first 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.550
 option is what allows us to create what 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.110
 what is the course a work pin 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.570
 personalized with ch ch 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.200
 the second option allows us to take the 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.440
 hh of our device if not what 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.440
 we have 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.140
 the third one allows us to show the ch sh 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.680
 c.ch.ch that are on the server and the 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.019
 fourth allows us to use put the 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.590
 phone or ipod touch in efe mode 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.360
 to be able to explore with them if 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.700
 we do not have the ones that are 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.890
 the ch sh we can use the second option 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.659
 but in our case as is the video 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.049
 we are going to use the first option that is 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:10.170
 Create a custom per custom well 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.590
 Here he tells us to look for what the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.230
 ch ch file that we have 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.329
 saved in this case if we 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.410
 we have if we want to go back to 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:24.510
 version 5.0 or 5.0.1 we will have to 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.849
 select what are 12 hs h 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.519
 corresponding in my case in the version 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.230
 5.0 point 1 in which I have the 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.720
 file here on the desktop as they can 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.900
 see I'm going to give you an open says 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.310
 the program is going to start verifying 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.020
 and once he's going to tell us to look 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.080
 what is the 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:47.210
 the uncles 5.0.1 for an iphone4 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.670
 we should draw up here in the first 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.920
 option 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.720
 and I have it, you look for it where 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.520
 they have saved it in my case I have it 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.300
 here on the desk and I will give 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.010
 because he's going to start checking it 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.470
 then we will come out what is this 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.520
 window giving credits to these users 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:09.400

 show here where it says create ipc wy in 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.100
 this moment will start to create what 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.810
 It's your custom firmware and here it goes 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.370
 delay this case about five minutes or 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.860
 less depending on the speed your 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.730
 computer I'm going to put the video for 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.980

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.870
 what is to create I like a firmware 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.050
 custom personalized sorry with 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:41.460

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.690

 here the fight and face window 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.639

 what is it with itunes 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:34.500

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:37.669
 version 5.0.1 but you connect your 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.870

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.000
 tells us to turn off our 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.639
 device device to start 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.199
 once your iphone is already off 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.840
 ipod touch or ipad we will activate 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:51.509
 says being tells us that in five 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.069

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.660
 10 seconds here what are you going to 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.060
 press it 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.610
 to tell you they will find the counting 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.950
 here tells us to release the button 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.160
 power and let's press the com button 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.410
 for 30 seconds once done that and the 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.800
 device will recognize it as a 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:13.350
 way of faith in which you are going to 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.900
 enter what is itunes in windows 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.840
 they are going to press what is chips more than 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.670
 restore they will choose their custom 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.230
 custom found here in 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:26.040
 the desk that was just created here 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.720
 we want them here and then once 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.550
 she already selected it 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.790
 start what is the restoration of 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.100
 your device in some cases many 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.630
 I have been told that they have done it and 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.800
 it has come out what is wrong 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:43.680
 very famous that is 31 94 apparently if 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.570
 I'm not wrong when I do that 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.730
 what they are going to do is have to use the 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.930
 application name here in which we 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.930
 here we are going to execute 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.750
 the most recent version at 5.10 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:59.760
 point 15 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.760
 I will start to open 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.610
 let's go ok and here we're going to execute what 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.450
 is the tse tse server 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.550
 I do not have the device connected 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:13.110
 but you are going to choose here 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.110
 Havana option click 

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:22.380
 and they are going to have to see these two options 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:24.750
 who see here tsss see start and the and that 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.480
 has accepted the connection once done 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:30.090
 this is going to itunes again for 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.220
 can restore again if everything has 

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:35.520
 come out if everything goes well they will have their 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:38.100
 device in version 5.0.1 or in the 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.710
 version 5.0 according to which they have chosen 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.960
 to create your custom firmware and good 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:46.380
 because being there they can do what 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:49.290
 is the untethered jailbreak again 

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:52.140
 with suspicion and be able to install their 

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:53.520
 favorite applications I say goodbye to me
