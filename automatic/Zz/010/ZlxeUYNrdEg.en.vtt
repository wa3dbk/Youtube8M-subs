00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.740 

today<00:00:01.680> we<00:00:01.890> find<00:00:02.190> out<00:00:02.429> whether<00:00:03.090> painting<00:00:03.659> an

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
today we find out whether painting an

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.039 
today we find out whether painting an
old<00:00:03.929> sea<00:00:04.290> with<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.009> spray<00:00:05.370> can<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.420> good<00:00:06.690> idea

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
old sea with a spray can is a good idea

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.330 
old sea with a spray can is a good idea
or<00:00:07.290> not

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.490 

so<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.490> seats<00:00:14.790> out<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.360> old<00:00:15.509> 240<00:00:16.199> it's

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
so this seats out of the old 240 it's

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.179 
so this seats out of the old 240 it's
actually<00:00:17.130> an<00:00:17.220> r32<00:00:17.789> skyline<00:00:18.529> see<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.740> had<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
actually an r32 skyline see I had the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.010 
actually an r32 skyline see I had the
matching<00:00:20.490> pair<00:00:20.699> in<00:00:20.789> there<00:00:20.939> prior<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.330> putting

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
matching pair in there prior to putting

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.009 
matching pair in there prior to putting
in<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.470> Profi<00:00:22.859> SVG<00:00:23.340> from<00:00:23.580> Recaro<00:00:23.970> as<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.330> bucket

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
in the Profi SVG from Recaro as a bucket

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.679 
in the Profi SVG from Recaro as a bucket
so<00:00:25.470> now<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.189> kind<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.609> really<00:00:27.150> mismatched

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
so now it's kind of a really mismatched

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.990 
so now it's kind of a really mismatched
pair<00:00:28.019> not<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.560> mention<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:28.949> blue<00:00:29.369> faded

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
pair not to mention this is blue faded

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.630 
pair not to mention this is blue faded
and<00:00:30.150> ugly<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.050> I'm<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.619> try<00:00:31.800> using<00:00:32.009> this

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
and ugly so I'm going to try using this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.209 
and ugly so I'm going to try using this
which<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> dupli-color<00:00:33.649> the<00:00:34.649> vinyl<00:00:35.040> and

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
which is a dupli-color the vinyl and

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.100 
which is a dupli-color the vinyl and
fabric<00:00:35.280> paint<00:00:35.910> I've<00:00:36.270> used<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> past

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
fabric paint I've used it in the past

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.990 
fabric paint I've used it in the past
with<00:00:37.380> pretty<00:00:37.739> good<00:00:37.920> success<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.579> figured

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
with pretty good success so I figured

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.209 
with pretty good success so I figured
why<00:00:39.540> not<00:00:39.570> let's<00:00:40.079> try<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.710> seat<00:00:40.980> but

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
why not let's try it on this seat but

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.010 
why not let's try it on this seat but
first<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:42.030> got<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.210> clean<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.629> thing<00:00:42.870> off

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
first we got to clean this thing off

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.010 
first we got to clean this thing off
because<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.770> filthy<00:00:44.600> it's<00:00:45.600> pretty

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
because it is filthy it's pretty

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.569 
because it is filthy it's pretty
critical<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.649> make<00:00:46.800> sure<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> clean

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
critical to make sure you have a clean

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.639 
critical to make sure you have a clean
surface<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.360> fabric<00:00:48.780> paint<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.200> stick<00:00:49.469> to

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
surface for the fabric paint to stick to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.270 
surface for the fabric paint to stick to
so<00:00:50.100> don't<00:00:50.399> skip<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.000> step<00:00:51.270> or<00:00:51.510> half-ass<00:00:52.170> it

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.889 

next<00:00:56.280> step<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.879> remove<00:00:57.000> as<00:00:57.300> much<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
next step is to remove as much of the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.740 
next step is to remove as much of the
plastic<00:00:58.379> trim<00:00:58.649> as<00:00:58.800> possible<00:00:59.340> as<00:00:59.600> you're<00:01:00.600> about

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
plastic trim as possible as you're about

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.229 
plastic trim as possible as you're about
to<00:01:00.989> see<00:01:01.199> brute<00:01:01.620> force<00:01:01.949> isn't<00:01:02.370> always<00:01:02.579> answer

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
to see brute force isn't always answer

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.500 
to see brute force isn't always answer
to<00:01:03.390> removing<00:01:03.780> plastic<00:01:04.260> pieces<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:05.150> fact<00:01:06.150> it's

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
to removing plastic pieces in fact it's

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.960 
to removing plastic pieces in fact it's
pretty<00:01:06.930> much<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.470> worst<00:01:07.710> idea<00:01:08.250> since<00:01:08.549> you

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
pretty much the worst idea since you

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.480 
pretty much the worst idea since you
always<00:01:09.180> end<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.630> breaking<00:01:09.930> something

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:24.359 

ah<00:01:19.800> look<00:01:20.800> at<00:01:20.950> that

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:36.130 

now<00:01:24.789> there's<00:01:24.969> nothing<00:01:25.479> holding<00:01:25.750> this<00:01:25.869> thing

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.200 

don't<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.260> as<00:01:37.410> I<00:01:37.560> did<00:01:37.620> and<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.490> broke<00:01:38.850> it

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
don't do as I did and just broke it

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.590 
don't do as I did and just broke it
see<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.900> always<00:01:40.140> got<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.500> look<00:01:40.910> before<00:01:41.910> you

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
see you always got to look before you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.110 
see you always got to look before you
remove<00:01:42.930> Oh<00:01:43.290> wha<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.430> isn't<00:01:44.760> the<00:01:44.820> end<00:01:44.940> of<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
remove Oh wha this isn't the end of the

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.430 
remove Oh wha this isn't the end of the
world<00:01:45.410> now<00:01:46.410> it<00:01:46.500> pops<00:01:46.710> right<00:01:46.830> off<00:01:48.050> I'm<00:01:49.050> asking

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
world now it pops right off I'm asking

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.050 
world now it pops right off I'm asking
some<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.770> exposed<00:01:50.160> metal<00:01:50.310> parts<00:01:50.910> is<00:01:51.030> a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
some of the exposed metal parts is a

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.330 
some of the exposed metal parts is a
good<00:01:51.300> idea<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:51.900> not<00:01:52.080> really<00:01:52.350> necessary<00:01:53.040> since

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
good idea but not really necessary since

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.710 
good idea but not really necessary since
most<00:01:53.550> of<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.910> actually<00:01:54.030> covered<00:01:54.540> by<00:01:54.660> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
most of it is actually covered by the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.740 
most of it is actually covered by the
trim<00:01:55.080> but<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.620> figure<00:01:55.980> hey<00:01:56.220> why<00:01:56.970> not<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.480> don't

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
trim but I figure hey why not I don't

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.870 
trim but I figure hey why not I don't
want<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.020> take<00:01:58.200> any<00:01:58.380> chances<00:01:58.830> with<00:01:59.070> overspray

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
want to take any chances with overspray

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.230 
want to take any chances with overspray
I<00:02:01.010> then<00:02:02.010> clean<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.400> seat<00:02:02.610> one<00:02:02.850> more<00:02:03.030> time

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
I then clean the seat one more time

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.420 
I then clean the seat one more time
because<00:02:03.480> you<00:02:03.660> can<00:02:03.930> never<00:02:04.230> have<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.620> surface<00:02:05.160> to

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
because you can never have a surface to

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.090 
because you can never have a surface to
clean<00:02:05.850> before<00:02:06.060> painting<00:02:08.899> here<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:09.990> go<00:02:10.200> last

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
clean before painting here we go last

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.300 
clean before painting here we go last
part<00:02:11.370> left<00:02:11.840> most<00:02:12.840> difficult<00:02:13.350> one<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.709> what

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
part left most difficult one and what

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.580 
part left most difficult one and what
that<00:02:14.459> I'm<00:02:14.610> unsure<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:15.230> let's<00:02:16.230> paint<00:02:16.440> this

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
that I'm unsure of let's paint this

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.160 
that I'm unsure of let's paint this
thing<00:02:16.860> see<00:02:17.640> what<00:02:17.760> happens<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:21.600> instructions

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
thing see what happens the instructions

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.170 
thing see what happens the instructions
say<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.380> spray<00:02:22.680> light<00:02:22.980> coats<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:23.610> really<00:02:23.970> I

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
say to spray light coats but really I

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.050 
say to spray light coats but really I
just<00:02:24.600> kept<00:02:25.020> bombing<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.530> on<00:02:25.650> there<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.190> asked

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
just kept bombing it on there and asked

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.240 
just kept bombing it on there and asked
for<00:02:27.090> technique<00:02:27.570> well<00:02:27.990> you're<00:02:28.320> also<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:28.980> your

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
for technique well you're also on your

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
they were floating dandelion seed pods

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.130 
they were floating dandelion seed pods
everywhere<00:02:54.500> as<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:57.239> layers<00:02:57.480> went<00:02:57.810> on<00:02:57.930> the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
everywhere as the layers went on the

seat was actually starting to darken

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.540

with a light or dark colored fabric will

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.300

10 minutes in between coats and I found
out<00:03:16.349> a<00:03:16.380> failure<00:03:16.920> on<00:03:17.280> my<00:03:17.370> part<00:03:17.580> I<00:03:18.150> should<00:03:18.750> have

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
out a failure on my part I should have

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.050 
out a failure on my part I should have
made<00:03:19.019> sure<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.590> grain<00:03:19.890> here<00:03:20.250> was<00:03:20.880> all

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
made sure that the grain here was all

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.300 
made sure that the grain here was all

well now that I've painted it it's
ingrained<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.819> doesn't<00:03:33.150> look<00:03:33.360> like<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:33.690> wants

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
ingrained it doesn't look like it wants

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.589 
ingrained it doesn't look like it wants
to<00:03:34.110> come<00:03:34.290> out<00:03:34.349> so<00:03:35.099> that's<00:03:35.849> a<00:03:36.090> huge<00:03:36.269> problem

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
to come out so that's a huge problem

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.370 
to come out so that's a huge problem
that's<00:03:37.380> a<00:03:37.590> fail<00:03:38.239> now<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.299> know<00:03:39.660> don't<00:03:40.319> make

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
that's a fail now you know don't make

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.460 
that's a fail now you know don't make
the<00:03:40.590> same<00:03:40.829> mistake<00:03:41.959> yet<00:03:42.959> another<00:03:43.170> problem

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
the same mistake yet another problem

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.190 
the same mistake yet another problem
that<00:03:43.620> I've<00:03:43.860> noticed<00:03:44.069> is<00:03:44.519> I'm<00:03:45.329> spraying<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:45.959> lot

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
that I've noticed is I'm spraying a lot

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.379 
that I've noticed is I'm spraying a lot
of<00:03:46.530> black<00:03:46.739> paint<00:03:47.010> here<00:03:47.340> but<00:03:47.579> it<00:03:47.670> doesn't<00:03:47.970> seem

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
of black paint here but it doesn't seem

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.349 
of black paint here but it doesn't seem
to<00:03:48.630> be<00:03:48.720> turning<00:03:48.900> black<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.950> culprit<00:03:50.880> is<00:03:51.120> that

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
to be turning black the culprit is that

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.629 
to be turning black the culprit is that
the<00:03:51.510> suede<00:03:52.049> from<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.470> seat<00:03:52.769> is<00:03:53.280> actually

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
the suede from the seat is actually

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.490 
the suede from the seat is actually
missing<00:03:54.090> in<00:03:54.299> this<00:03:54.420> area<00:03:54.870> which<00:03:55.049> is<00:03:55.079> created

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
missing in this area which is created

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.559 
missing in this area which is created
like<00:03:55.590> this<00:03:55.650> gray<00:03:55.980> sheen<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:57.030> that's<00:03:57.359> something

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
like this gray sheen so that's something

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.080 
like this gray sheen so that's something
to<00:03:57.720> watch<00:03:57.930> out<00:03:58.200> for<00:03:58.230> make<00:03:58.950> sure<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.970> don't

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
to watch out for make sure you don't

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.520 
to watch out for make sure you don't
just<00:04:00.389> keep<00:04:00.510> over<00:04:00.810> spraying<00:04:01.109> because<00:04:01.440> it

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
just keep over spraying because it

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.680 
just keep over spraying because it
really<00:04:01.739> doesn't<00:04:02.040> matter<00:04:02.160> it's<00:04:03.090> just<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.569> is

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
really doesn't matter it's just it is

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.340 
really doesn't matter it's just it is
what<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:03.989> is

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
what it is

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.080 
what it is
and<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:04.560> got<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.799> leave<00:04:04.889> it<00:04:05.100> finding<00:04:05.910> out

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
and you got to leave it finding out

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.170 
and you got to leave it finding out
suede<00:04:06.780> seats<00:04:07.549> difficult<00:04:08.549> much<00:04:08.940> more

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
suede seats difficult much more

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.449 
suede seats difficult much more
difficult<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.750> paint<00:04:10.019> then<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.769> fabric<00:04:10.980> seats

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
difficult to paint then the fabric seats

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.520 
difficult to paint then the fabric seats
that<00:04:11.549> I've<00:04:11.670> done<00:04:11.819> in<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.030> past

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.660 

all<00:04:17.530> right<00:04:17.770> I<00:04:18.160> think<00:04:19.150> that's<00:04:19.360> it<00:04:19.890> put<00:04:20.890> on<00:04:21.070> about

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
all right I think that's it put on about

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.830 
all right I think that's it put on about
four<00:04:22.480> coats<00:04:22.780> it's<00:04:23.710> not<00:04:23.860> getting<00:04:24.100> any<00:04:24.190> darker

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
four coats it's not getting any darker

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.970 
four coats it's not getting any darker
so<00:04:25.840> this<00:04:26.770> is<00:04:27.160> your<00:04:27.430> finished<00:04:27.670> product

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
so this is your finished product

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.040 
so this is your finished product
personally<00:04:29.980> I'm<00:04:30.700> not<00:04:30.760> that<00:04:31.330> happy<00:04:31.780> with<00:04:31.930> how

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
personally I'm not that happy with how

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.320 
personally I'm not that happy with how
it<00:04:32.170> turned<00:04:32.200> out<00:04:32.530> it<00:04:33.190> kind<00:04:33.580> of<00:04:33.640> sucks<00:04:33.940> that<00:04:34.210> the

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
it turned out it kind of sucks that the

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.270 
it turned out it kind of sucks that the
suede<00:04:34.570> doesn't<00:04:34.960> stick<00:04:35.170> or<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.890> paint<00:04:36.100> doesn't

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
suede doesn't stick or the paint doesn't

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.620 
suede doesn't stick or the paint doesn't
stick<00:04:36.580> as<00:04:36.730> well<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.090> suede<00:04:37.330> as<00:04:37.510> I

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
stick as well to the suede as I

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.100 
stick as well to the suede as I
anticipated<00:04:38.020> but<00:04:39.270> overall<00:04:40.270> I<00:04:40.420> think<00:04:40.600> the<00:04:40.840> seat

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
anticipated but overall I think the seat

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.520 
anticipated but overall I think the seat
looks<00:04:41.470> better<00:04:42.100> than<00:04:42.340> it<00:04:42.400> did<00:04:42.520> before<00:04:43.140> so<00:04:44.140> it's

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
looks better than it did before so it's

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.350 
looks better than it did before so it's
a<00:04:44.620> win<00:04:44.770> in<00:04:44.890> that<00:04:45.040> step<00:04:45.400> I<00:04:45.640> wish<00:04:45.970> it<00:04:46.150> would<00:04:46.270> have

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
a win in that step I wish it would have

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.120 
a win in that step I wish it would have
been<00:04:46.510> a<00:04:46.660> little<00:04:46.870> bit<00:04:47.110> cleaner<00:04:47.320> nicer<00:04:47.620> I<00:04:47.860> was

there<00:05:15.710> you<00:05:15.860> go<00:05:16.010> nothing<00:05:16.490> so<00:05:16.820> that's<00:05:16.940> something

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
there you go nothing so that's something

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.700 
there you go nothing so that's something
you<00:05:17.420> definitely<00:05:17.750> don't<00:05:18.050> have<00:05:18.260> to<00:05:18.410> worry<00:05:18.620> about

and<00:05:20.050> here's<00:05:21.050> what<00:05:21.230> it<00:05:21.320> looks<00:05:21.500> like<00:05:21.620> installed

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
and here's what it looks like installed

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.220 
and here's what it looks like installed
I'd<00:05:22.790> say<00:05:23.120> compared<00:05:23.570> to<00:05:23.660> what<00:05:23.870> it<00:05:23.960> looked<00:05:23.990> like

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
I'd say compared to what it looked like

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.120 
I'd say compared to what it looked like
before<00:05:24.470> this<00:05:25.370> job<00:05:25.730> is<00:05:26.000> definitely<00:05:26.360> a<00:05:26.660> success

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
before this job is definitely a success

it's by no means perfect but at least it

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.080 
it's by no means perfect but at least it
matches<00:05:30.620> the<00:05:30.770> interior<00:05:31.160> better<00:05:31.400> then<00:05:31.940> when

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
matches the interior better then when

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.190 
matches the interior better then when
