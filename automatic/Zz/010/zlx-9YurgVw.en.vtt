 and files exactly I find these 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.080
 composition superlecker need 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.510
 the coconut from the protein known world 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.550
 but also an osnabrück belt and 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.260
 nevertheless coconut shave to decorate 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.910
 It is best you have the good 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.190
 mix on mine is not that great and that 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.230
 you will see them here too 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.690
 start as first with our would have 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.230
 to give in the mixer and this small too 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.989
 chop 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.789
 here you do mixa still really good with 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.170
 You should take care that you are not a flour 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.059
 it produces but it still a 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.190
 a bit more powerful part in doing so 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.260
 could that possibly be what you see 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.149
 I also left something too long 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.609
 but there are still some delicious ones 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.439
 not at all afterwards 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.510
 we have our dried fruits in medium 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.159
 the mixer and now it starts with me 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.049
 members to rebel 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.840
 For this you actually need one 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.060
 mixer of efficiency is stronger and 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.000
 not as nervous as my choice of 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.630
 not properly done and something 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.630
 stopped 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.729
 if your mixa regulates exactly how 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.680
 My then just takes a fork 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.259
 or your hands and transfigured the dough 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.150
 that is also wonderful and I need 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.350
 you mixa do you have any mix on 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.850
 suggestions i definitely need one 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.310
 new mix of this is namely the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.049
 Total scrap but you see I have 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.570
 also so my mass manufactures 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.659
 get together then we take 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.189
 a trainer for coconut oil so can 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.040

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.189
 I would like to find it but mega 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.640
 delicious and really only one topic 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.640
 for in with 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:10.060
 really less is enough 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.060
 then we start that in our home 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.100
 then I admit to change something 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:33.310
 To fight one add cacau he is 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.310
 quite casually, though 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.040
 to say I love are simply 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.150
 Now it all comes down for 15 minutes in 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.900
 trier tours 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.040
 so that the dough is not on your hands 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.239
 march possibility have already 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.909
 grated cakes give this one 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.209

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.209
 world 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.230
 without raising our hands 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.870
 when finished with the molds 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.640
 our churches 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.590
 Let's put it in the coconut shavings 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.549
 pause again and then give 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.409
 on a plate 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.540
 now you could either naturally 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:37.430
 Take cocoa powder or chopped 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.430
