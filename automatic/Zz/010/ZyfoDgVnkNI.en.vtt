 anxiously the split screen and 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.159
 multiple windows that finally arrived

 split screen only for ipad 2 the 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.149
 most recent of the collection and in everything 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:46.179
 the rest I am 9 looks almost the same as ios 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.950
 8 except for a few subtle changes like 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.140
 change of peace name because now it 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.119

 flipboard that at the moment will only have 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:59.560
 content in English the most useful of 19 not 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.689
 are the new functions but the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.909
 improvements to the battery and the process of 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.129

 Battery saving that provides up to three 

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:11.680
 more hours of loading and more users will be able 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.960
 download to 19 because it does not use as much 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.120
 storage space and not 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.330
 include any old device that 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.000
 already have or is 8 regarding that x 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.160
 novelties were minimal so much so that 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.530
 they did not even change their location 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.390
 they were in yos emery and it's not because I 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.340
 be loved and be the only one if your beautiful 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.950

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.530

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.690
 the captain is called the name of the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.030
 rock formation of the national park 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.070

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.440
 naturals within the bar of 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.180
 spotlight and ask him a question like what 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.130
 would you do in your daily life to find 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.200
 anything inside your machine 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.540
 It also has the function of split screen 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.790
 that allows you to see two applications one 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.800
 next to another one at a time and better 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.960
 performance that was expected 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.020
 but an apple presentation does not stay 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.790
 complete without that something else a little surprise 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.190
 that had not been saved very well 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.790
 because we had already foreseen it
