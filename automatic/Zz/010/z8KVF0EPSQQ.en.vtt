00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
duo processor that will be using our

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.470 
duo processor that will be using our
computer<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.280> it's<00:02:48.760> easier<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.300> do<00:02:49.450> that

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
computer and it's easier to do that

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.360 
computer and it's easier to do that
outside<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.590> case<00:02:50.800> because<00:02:51.130> you'll<00:02:51.340> have

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
outside of the case because you'll have

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.580 
outside of the case because you'll have
a<00:02:51.520> lot<00:02:51.670> more<00:02:51.730> room<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.210> work<00:02:52.240> with<00:02:52.420> first<00:02:53.260> we're

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
change the IO plate that's very

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.849 
change the IO plate that's very
important<00:04:10.510> because<00:04:10.540> it<00:04:11.019> has<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.590> correct

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
important because it has the correct

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.920 
important because it has the correct
layout<00:04:12.400> ports<00:04:12.910> for<00:04:13.120> your<00:04:13.209> motherboard<00:04:13.690> and

layout ports for your motherboard and
each<00:04:14.200> month<00:04:14.590> was<00:04:14.739> different<00:04:15.280> so<00:04:15.700> you<00:04:15.760> need<00:04:15.970> to

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
each month was different so you need to

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.789 
each month was different so you need to
use<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.450> idol<00:04:16.750> plate<00:04:17.109> that<00:04:17.260> came<00:04:17.440> through<00:04:17.739> her

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
use the idol plate that came through her

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:18.930 
use the idol plate that came through her
mother<00:04:17.979> board<00:04:18.220> instead<00:04:18.489> of<00:04:18.579> the<00:04:18.669> one<00:04:18.789> that's

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
on the case now this one is a bit

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
unusual because it screws on lock so

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.820 
unusual because it screws on lock so
we're<00:04:24.070> just<00:04:24.100> going<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.460> unscrew<00:04:24.880> that<00:04:25.030> one<00:04:25.830> and

we're just going to unscrew that one and

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.430 
we're just going to unscrew that one and
remove<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:29.430> place<00:04:30.430> in<00:04:30.700> this<00:04:31.000> new<00:04:31.180> honor

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:04.120 
kazar motherboard is an ATX motherboard
simply<00:04:57.090> screw<00:04:58.090> it<00:04:58.150> in<00:04:58.240> by<00:04:58.389> hand<00:04:58.560> like<00:04:59.560> that

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.620 

I'm<00:05:05.130> going<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.430> solve<00:05:05.610> motherboard<00:05:06.120> the

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
I'm going to solve motherboard the

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.020 
I'm going to solve motherboard the
port's<00:05:07.020> here<00:05:07.440> will<00:05:07.920> fit<00:05:08.100> through<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.460> holes

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
port's here will fit through the holes

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.240 
port's here will fit through the holes
in<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.630> i/o<00:05:09.780> play<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.260> resistance<00:05:10.710> fall<00:05:10.950> and

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
in the i/o play the resistance fall and

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.600 
in the i/o play the resistance fall and
these<00:05:11.880> holes<00:05:12.240> here<00:05:12.660> are<00:05:13.040> where<00:05:14.040> the<00:05:14.130> standoffs

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
these holes here are where the standoffs

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.390 
these holes here are where the standoffs
will<00:05:15.390> go<00:05:15.980> we're<00:05:16.980> going<00:05:17.100> to<00:05:17.160> put<00:05:17.280> the

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
will go we're going to put the

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.890 
will go we're going to put the
motherboard<00:05:17.790> inside<00:05:18.090> of<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.210> case<00:05:18.390> now<00:05:18.630> and

motherboard inside of the case now and

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.200 
motherboard inside of the case now and
when<00:05:19.800> you're<00:05:19.920> doing<00:05:20.160> that<00:05:20.280> put<00:05:20.610> it<00:05:20.730> in<00:05:20.820> very

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
when you're doing that put it in very

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.590 
when you're doing that put it in very
carefully<00:05:21.810> and<00:05:22.020> even<00:05:22.830> the<00:05:22.920> ports<00:05:23.310> toward<00:05:24.150> the

aisle play in the back the portable just

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.050 
aisle play in the back the portable just
punched<00:05:28.380> right<00:05:28.620> through<00:05:28.680> it<00:05:29.160> very<00:05:29.610> handily

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
punched right through it very handily

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
lets you see exactly where it needs to

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.250 
lets you see exactly where it needs to
