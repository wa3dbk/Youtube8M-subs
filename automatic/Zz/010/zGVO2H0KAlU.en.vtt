 They have to choose friends. What will they be? Children or men? 

00:00:14.367 --> 00:00:17.076
 - Four aces, baby. - How did you do it, Jer? Let's go!

 Mom's house for you tonight. 

00:00:34.324 --> 00:00:38.284
 The FBI will arrive in thirty seconds. You must go now. 

00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:40.518
 Who? No, none of this is mine! 

00:00:42.822 --> 00:00:44.663
 FBI! Down! 

00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:47.006
 Wait! It is not mine! 

00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:50.235
 - They were wrong as a man. - Obviously. 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.418
 - They set a trap for me. - Things are like that, you're in trouble, son. 

00:00:57.836 --> 00:01:01.555
 Rachel Holloman, look in the window. Would he risk his life for his son? 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.454
 Who you are? 

00:01:02.647 --> 00:01:06.822
 There is a car in the corner, it has the keys on it. Start walking. 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:09.168
 Time of your call 

00:01:10.968 --> 00:01:11.919
 We told him to run. 

00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:13.273
 How did you get this number? 

00:01:13.896 --> 00:01:14.805
 It has ten seconds. 

00:01:14.972 --> 00:01:15.816
 What are you talking about? 

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:16.786
 Crouch now! 

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:19.730
 THIS SEPTEMBER 

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:21.924
 Go away, Jerry. Jump now! 

00:01:24.786 --> 00:01:27.443
 He could not do it alone. Somebody helps him. 

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:31.056
 You were the one on the phone ?! 

00:01:31.217 --> 00:01:32.115
 Did he call you too? 

00:01:32.268 --> 00:01:32.883
 He drives. 

00:01:32.883 --> 00:01:33.510
 FBI! 

00:01:34.252 --> 00:01:35.249
 ONCE THEY CHOOSE YOU 

00:01:35.443 --> 00:01:37.221
 Obey and you will survive. 

00:01:37.382 --> 00:01:38.245
 How do you see this? 

00:01:38.408 --> 00:01:39.184
 Disobey ... 

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:39.669
 What did he say? 

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:40.636
 and they will die. 

00:01:40.636 --> 00:01:41.948
 YOU CONTROL IT 

00:01:41.948 --> 00:01:43.626
 Someone is cutting off the energy ... 

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:46.328
 ... traffic cameras. 

00:01:46.328 --> 00:01:47.379
 The lights turn green. 

00:01:49.598 --> 00:01:50.300
 Any theory? 

00:01:52.806 --> 00:01:54.296
 He wants us to go to the armored truck. 

00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:57.569
 - The briefcase. Containing? - Has no sense. 

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:59.302
 - I will not do this. - Do you want us to steal? 

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:00.325
 Do it now. 

00:02:01.438 --> 00:02:01.968
 Now now! 

00:02:04.805 --> 00:02:06.041
 FROM THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER STEVEN SPIELBERG 

00:02:06.576 --> 00:02:09.955
 What if it is a trap to distract us from something bigger? 

00:02:10.128 --> 00:02:10.856
 REZA 

00:02:11.524 --> 00:02:12.526
 Discover what happens. 

00:02:12.526 --> 00:02:13.378

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:15.923
 DO NOT 

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:17.127
 TEA 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:18.765
 ELIJAN 

00:02:19.176 --> 00:02:20.153
