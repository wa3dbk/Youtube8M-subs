you know we like to take this
opportunity<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.659> learn<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.929> little<00:00:04.650> something

opportunity to learn a little something
about<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.520> weather<00:00:05.730> that's<00:00:06.089> right<00:00:06.299> we're

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
about the weather that's right we're

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.059 
about the weather that's right we're
getting<00:00:06.660> some<00:00:06.839> great<00:00:07.049> questions<00:00:07.470> from<00:00:07.919> the

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
getting some great questions from the

getting some great questions from the
kids<00:00:08.370> yes<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.500> something<00:00:10.500> we<00:00:10.590> haven't<00:00:10.740> had<00:00:10.860> a

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
kids yes and something we haven't had a

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.400 
kids yes and something we haven't had a
whole<00:00:11.280> lot<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.670> in<00:00:12.090> last<00:00:12.389> time<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:13.019> seems<00:00:13.290> like

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
whole lot of in last time it seems like

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.460 
whole lot of in last time it seems like
month<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.160> seems<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:14.639> calm<00:00:14.940> but<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.599> wind<00:00:15.900> how

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
month it seems so calm but the wind how

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.810 
month it seems so calm but the wind how
does<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.710> come<00:00:16.830> about<00:00:16.980> right<00:00:17.340> that's<00:00:17.670> right

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
does it come about right that's right

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.670 
does it come about right that's right
that's<00:00:17.970> that's<00:00:18.359> another<00:00:18.720> age-old<00:00:19.109> question

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
that's that's another age-old question

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.830 
that's that's another age-old question
what<00:00:19.710> causes<00:00:20.279> when<00:00:20.789> let's<00:00:21.060> get<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.510> question

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
what causes when let's get the question

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.029 
what causes when let's get the question
asked<00:00:22.080> here<00:00:22.199> from<00:00:22.350> again<00:00:22.590> from<00:00:22.619> Pioneer

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
asked here from again from Pioneer

element great question Rachel thanks so
much<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.430> well<00:00:35.550> we're<00:00:35.670> gonna<00:00:35.760> start<00:00:36.149> with<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
much and well we're gonna start with the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.330 
much and well we're gonna start with the
whole<00:00:36.930> general<00:00:37.410> reason<00:00:37.739> why

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
whole general reason why

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.310 
whole general reason why
storms<00:00:38.969> are<00:00:39.180> blowing<00:00:39.270> wind<00:00:39.690> back<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.110> forth

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
storms are blowing wind back and forth

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.049 
storms are blowing wind back and forth
and<00:00:40.440> why<00:00:40.559> wind<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.040> constantly<00:00:41.489> moving<00:00:41.700> across

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
and why wind is constantly moving across

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.970 
and why wind is constantly moving across
the<00:00:42.180> country<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.989> here's<00:00:43.469> what's<00:00:43.680> happening

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the country so here's what's happening

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.560 
the country so here's what's happening
here's<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.219> map<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.700> United<00:00:45.090> States<00:00:45.120> right

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
here's a map of the United States right

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.299 
here's a map of the United States right
down<00:00:45.809> here<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.440> three<00:00:46.710> dimensional<00:00:46.860> look

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
down here it's a three dimensional look

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.240 
down here it's a three dimensional look
way<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.989> space<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.829> jet

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
way up here in space we have the jet

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.830 
way up here in space we have the jet
stream<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.700> if<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.090> don't<00:00:51.360> know<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> jet

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
stream and if you don't know if the jet

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.330 
stream and if you don't know if the jet
stream<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.140> it's<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.440> river<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.770> air<00:00:53.039> moving

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
stream is it's a river of air moving

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.340 
stream is it's a river of air moving
very<00:00:53.520> rapidly<00:00:53.940> sometimes<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.510> hundred<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> 200

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
very rapidly sometimes a hundred to 200

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.950 
very rapidly sometimes a hundred to 200
miles<00:00:55.920> per<00:00:56.129> hour<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.850> at<00:00:57.120> times<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.719> jet

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
miles per hour and at times the jet

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.529 
miles per hour and at times the jet
stream<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.350> converging<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.489> itself<00:00:59.940> here<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
stream is converging on itself here and

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.830 
stream is converging on itself here and
at<00:01:00.870> times<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.640> diverging<00:01:02.640> right<00:01:03.359> here<00:01:03.660> and

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
at times it's diverging right here and

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.090 
at times it's diverging right here and
that's<00:01:03.989> very<00:01:04.350> important<00:01:04.830> as<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.949> what's

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that's very important as to what's

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.440 
that's very important as to what's
happening<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> ground<00:01:05.790> because<00:01:06.299> what's

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
happening at the ground because what's

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.330 
happening at the ground because what's
happening<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> ground<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.799> coming<00:01:08.189> from

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
happening at the ground is coming from

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.280 
happening at the ground is coming from
the<00:01:08.549> wind<00:01:08.760> aloft<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:09.630> when<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> air

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the wind aloft here when the air

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.260 
the wind aloft here when the air
converges<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.159> has<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.460> go<00:01:11.580> somewhere<00:01:11.939> when

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
converges it has to go somewhere when

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.020 
converges it has to go somewhere when
you<00:01:12.380> pile<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.619> Arab<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:14.189> forced<00:01:14.610> down

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you pile that Arab so it's forced down

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.420 
you pile that Arab so it's forced down
as<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.930> forced<00:01:16.259> down<00:01:16.560> because<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> earth<00:01:17.220> is

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
as it's forced down because the earth is

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.160 
as it's forced down because the earth is
spinning<00:01:17.640> instead<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.630> going<00:01:18.840> straight<00:01:18.900> down

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
spinning instead of going straight down

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.679 
spinning instead of going straight down
it<00:01:19.439> starts<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.860> go<00:01:19.979> down<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.369> spin<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.479> this

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
it starts to go down and spin like this

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.630 
it starts to go down and spin like this
in<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.930> clockwise<00:01:22.350> fashion<00:01:22.619> that's<00:01:23.369> high

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
in a clockwise fashion that's high

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.249 
in a clockwise fashion that's high
pressure<00:01:23.970> at<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.180> surface<00:01:24.420> you're<00:01:24.689> pushing

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
pressure at the surface you're pushing

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.840 
pressure at the surface you're pushing
air<00:01:25.409> down<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.979> surface<00:01:26.189> here<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.729> we

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
air down to the surface here and so we

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.640 
air down to the surface here and so we
have<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.000> an<00:01:27.210> abundance<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.049> air<00:01:28.259> at<00:01:28.500> high

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
have a an abundance of air at high

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.460 
have a an abundance of air at high
pressure<00:01:28.979> well<00:01:29.640> low<00:01:29.909> pressure<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.600> an<00:01:30.960> absence

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
pressure well low pressure is an absence

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.380 
pressure well low pressure is an absence
of<00:01:31.619> air<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.009> air<00:01:32.220> rushes<00:01:32.790> from<00:01:32.970> high<00:01:33.150> pressure

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
of air so air rushes from high pressure

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.510 
of air so air rushes from high pressure
to<00:01:33.630> low<00:01:34.020> pressure<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.130> gonna<00:01:35.280> go

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
to low pressure so it's gonna go

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.390 
to low pressure so it's gonna go
clockwise<00:01:35.880> around<00:01:36.540> high<00:01:37.259> pressure<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.920> as<00:01:38.220> it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
clockwise around high pressure and as it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.980 
clockwise around high pressure and as it
goes<00:01:38.520> then<00:01:38.700> around<00:01:38.970> high<00:01:39.090> pressure<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.630> then

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
goes then around high pressure and then

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.539 
goes then around high pressure and then
funnels<00:01:40.439> into<00:01:40.829> low<00:01:41.250> pressure

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
funnels into low pressure

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.580 
funnels into low pressure
counterclockwise<00:01:42.360> when<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.229> gets<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
counterclockwise when it gets to the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.960 
counterclockwise when it gets to the
middle<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:43.950> got<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.220> go<00:01:44.310> somewhere<00:01:44.340> else<00:01:44.700> it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
middle it's got to go somewhere else it

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.050 
middle it's got to go somewhere else it
can't<00:01:45.149> go<00:01:45.270> down<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.200> goes<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.829> feeding<00:01:47.790> in

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
can't go down so it goes up feeding in

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.090 
can't go down so it goes up feeding in
what's<00:01:48.270> called<00:01:48.540> divergence<00:01:49.439> aloft<00:01:49.619> as<00:01:49.979> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
what's called divergence aloft as you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.679 
what's called divergence aloft as you
spread<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.579> air<00:01:50.670> apart<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.119> can't<00:01:51.360> create

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
spread the air apart we can't create

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.450 
spread the air apart we can't create
what<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:52.200> call<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> vacuum<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:53.340> to

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
what we call a vacuum so you have to

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.889 
what we call a vacuum so you have to
fill<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.850> air<00:01:54.030> up<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.329> everything<00:01:54.630> works

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
fill that air up so everything works

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.300 
fill that air up so everything works
together<00:01:55.110> right<00:01:55.470> here<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.799> you've<00:01:55.920> got<00:01:56.130> this

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
together right here so you've got this

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.459 
together right here so you've got this
the<00:01:56.820> sinking<00:01:57.060> air<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.540> then<00:01:57.869> spinning<00:01:58.320> into

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the sinking air and then spinning into

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.469 
the sinking air and then spinning into
that<00:01:58.680> low-pressure<00:01:59.009> system<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.850> there's<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
that low-pressure system and there's the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.999 
that low-pressure system and there's the
rising<00:02:00.869> air<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.350> you're<00:02:01.530> getting<00:02:01.680> air

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
rising air and so you're getting air

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.859 
rising air and so you're getting air
moving<00:02:02.399> constantly<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.329> around<00:02:03.689> high

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
moving constantly and so around high

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.389 
moving constantly and so around high
pressure<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.380> got<00:02:04.500> clockwise<00:02:04.920> around<00:02:05.219> low

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
pressure you got clockwise around low

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.950 
pressure you got clockwise around low
pressure<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.820> counterclockwise<00:02:06.270> that's

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
pressure of counterclockwise that's

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.900 
pressure of counterclockwise that's
generally<00:02:07.409> how<00:02:07.439> WinForms<00:02:08.160> all<00:02:08.369> across<00:02:08.670> the

country in some places the wind can get

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.340 
country in some places the wind can get
squeezed<00:02:11.819> through<00:02:12.150> mountain<00:02:12.599> gaps<00:02:12.900> and

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
squeezed through mountain gaps and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.290

Celer a downward and get strong cross
winds<00:02:15.600> up<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.840> 60<00:02:16.170> miles<00:02:16.350> per<00:02:16.680> hour<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.250> there's

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
winds up to 60 miles per hour so there's

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.520 
winds up to 60 miles per hour so there's
all<00:02:18.180> different<00:02:18.210> kinds<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.840> ways<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.020> get<00:02:19.260> wind

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
all different kinds of ways to get wind

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.140 
all different kinds of ways to get wind
but<00:02:19.770> those<00:02:19.890> are<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.130> general<00:02:20.520> ways<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:21.030> the

but those are the general ways that the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
wind blows probably a lot more

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.080 
wind blows probably a lot more
