inside this area right in here which is
quite<00:02:07.330> a<00:02:07.390> bit<00:02:07.600> actually<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:10.000> what<00:02:10.420> if<00:02:10.989> I<00:02:11.110> want

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
quite a bit actually and what if I want

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.690 
quite a bit actually and what if I want
to<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:11.500> can<00:02:11.650> also<00:02:11.890> use<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:12.340> as<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.459> background

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
to I can also use it as a background

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.580 
to I can also use it as a background
stand<00:02:13.120> because<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.510> also<00:02:13.720> carry<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:14.170> legs<00:02:14.410> so

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
stand because I also carry the legs so

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.500 
stand because I also carry the legs so
let's<00:02:14.769> put<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.010> on<00:02:15.069> here<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.549> I<00:02:16.120> can<00:02:16.239> still<00:02:16.360> use

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
let's put it on here and I can still use

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.080 
let's put it on here and I can still use
it<00:02:16.660> as<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:17.019> was<00:02:17.140> originally<00:02:17.260> designed<00:02:18.090> again

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
it as it was originally designed again

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.360 
it as it was originally designed again
it's<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.600> modular<00:02:20.110> system<00:02:20.110> there's<00:02:20.830> no<00:02:21.099> right

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
it's a modular system there's no right

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.430 
it's a modular system there's no right
or<00:02:21.400> wrong<00:02:21.760> way<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.000> attach<00:02:22.450> this<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.989> anything

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
or wrong way to attach this to anything

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.860 
or wrong way to attach this to anything
it<00:02:24.250> would<00:02:24.430> work<00:02:24.700> for<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.540> this<00:02:25.690> is<00:02:25.750> what

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
it would work for you and this is what

it would work for you and this is what
works<00:02:26.140> for<00:02:26.319> me<00:02:26.440> it's<00:02:27.130> really<00:02:27.549> just<00:02:28.150> that

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
works for me it's really just that

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:37.010 
works for me it's really just that
simple

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020
