a<00:00:43.710> resurgence<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.460> don't<00:00:44.610> know<00:00:44.670> if<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:44.879> gonna

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
a resurgence I don't know if it's gonna

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.810 
a resurgence I don't know if it's gonna
be<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> repeat<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.750> California<00:00:46.350> Gold<00:00:46.379> Rush

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
be a repeat of the California Gold Rush

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.920 
be a repeat of the California Gold Rush
but<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:47.850> think<00:00:48.059> central<00:00:48.390> banks<00:00:48.690> around<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
but I think central banks around the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.240 
but I think central banks around the
world<00:00:48.989> are<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.590> rushing<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
replenish their goal reserves which I

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.799 
replenish their goal reserves which I
think<00:00:53.250> are<00:00:53.340> much<00:00:53.579> too<00:00:53.789> low<00:00:54.000> relative<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.690> their

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
think are much too low relative to their

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.260 
think are much too low relative to their
reserves<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.469> other<00:00:55.739> fiat<00:00:56.190> currencies<00:00:56.760> but

real<00:01:37.530> monetary<00:01:38.159> discipline<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
real monetary discipline and the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.789 
real monetary discipline and the
government<00:01:40.079> wouldn't<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.350> able<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.560> get<00:01:40.680> away

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
government wouldn't be able to get away

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.639 
government wouldn't be able to get away
with<00:01:41.400> all<00:01:42.000> these<00:01:42.180> huge<00:01:42.509> deficits<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.409> all<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
with all these huge deficits and all the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.100 
with all these huge deficits and all the
artificial<00:01:43.979> stimulus<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.909> QE<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.600> we

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
artificial stimulus and the QE if we

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.020 
artificial stimulus and the QE if we
were<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> gold<00:01:46.619> standard<00:01:47.030> asia-pacific

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
were on a gold standard asia-pacific

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.090 
were on a gold standard asia-pacific
obviously<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> huge<00:01:48.780> economic<00:01:49.350> region<00:01:49.920> for

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
obviously a huge economic region for

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.130 
obviously a huge economic region for
california<00:01:50.579> specifically<00:01:51.090> when<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.930> look<00:01:52.049> at

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
california specifically when you look at

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.450 
california specifically when you look at
what<00:01:52.200> China<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.530> doing<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.890> gold<00:01:53.100> right<00:01:53.280> now

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
what China is doing with gold right now

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.069 
what China is doing with gold right now
there<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.119> think<00:01:54.479> are<00:01:54.570> some<00:01:54.659> real<00:01:54.840> questions

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
there I think are some real questions

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.160 
there I think are some real questions
about<00:01:55.470> what<00:01:56.310> california<00:01:56.969> regulators<00:01:57.719> and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
about what california regulators and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.230 
about what california regulators and
politicians<00:01:58.710> policymakers<00:01:59.610> should<00:01:59.790> be

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
politicians policymakers should be

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.850 
politicians policymakers should be
thinking<00:02:00.570> about<00:02:00.750> how<00:02:01.079> China<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.500> viewing<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
thinking about how China is viewing the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.410 
thinking about how China is viewing the
gold<00:02:02.009> markets<00:02:02.310> well<00:02:02.610> China's<00:02:03.000> buying<00:02:03.210> gold

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
gold markets well China's buying gold

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.539 
gold markets well China's buying gold
they're<00:02:04.259> buying<00:02:04.469> as<00:02:04.619> much<00:02:04.740> as<00:02:04.920> they<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.100> I

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
they're buying as much as they can I

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.770 
they're buying as much as they can I
think<00:02:05.909> they're<00:02:06.030> going<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.180> buy<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.329> lot<00:02:06.540> more

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
think they're going to buy a lot more

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.229 
think they're going to buy a lot more
china<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:07.950> world's<00:02:08.129> largest<00:02:08.459> producer<00:02:08.849> a

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
that government just buys it up

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.330 
that government just buys it up
and<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:13.990> think<00:02:14.170> they<00:02:14.500> understand<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.250> the

and I think they understand that the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.850 
and I think they understand that the
dollars<00:02:15.700> days<00:02:15.940> are<00:02:16.180> numbered<00:02:16.740> nobody<00:02:17.740> really

dollars days are numbered nobody really

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.160 
dollars days are numbered nobody really
knows<00:02:18.160> how<00:02:18.580> large<00:02:18.970> that<00:02:19.030> number<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.660> but<00:02:19.990> it's

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
knows how large that number is but it's

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.780 
knows how large that number is but it's
certainly<00:02:20.320> getting<00:02:21.070> smaller<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.730> smaller

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
certainly getting smaller and smaller

certainly getting smaller and smaller
you<00:02:22.180> know<00:02:22.240> I'm<00:02:22.420> we're<00:02:22.660> pissing<00:02:23.080> off<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.230> lot<00:02:23.440> of

this new factor log just came into

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.060 
this new factor log just came into
existence<00:02:40.390> which<00:02:40.960> punishes<00:02:41.260> people<00:02:41.590> for

existence which punishes people for
holding<00:02:42.460> dollars<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.270> know<00:02:43.360> America

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
holding dollars and you know America

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.720 
holding dollars and you know America
needs<00:02:44.140> everybody<00:02:44.740> around<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.100> world<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.520> load

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
needs everybody around the world to load

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.730 
needs everybody around the world to load
up<00:02:45.880> on<00:02:46.060> dollars<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.690> load<00:02:46.870> up<00:02:47.020> on<00:02:47.200> Treasuries

up on dollars to load up on Treasuries
and<00:02:47.890> now<00:02:48.370> we're<00:02:48.580> literally<00:02:48.850> biting<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.390> hands

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
and now we're literally biting the hands

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.480 
and now we're literally biting the hands
that<00:02:49.780> feed<00:02:49.990> us<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.380> think<00:02:50.470> we're<00:02:51.100> doing<00:02:51.310> a

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
that feed us so I think we're doing a

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.580 
that feed us so I think we're doing a
lot<00:02:51.610> of<00:02:51.670> things<00:02:51.910> on<00:02:52.120> our<00:02:52.150> own<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.900> accelerate

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
lot of things on our own to accelerate

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.730 
lot of things on our own to accelerate
the<00:02:53.980> dollars<00:02:54.340> demise
