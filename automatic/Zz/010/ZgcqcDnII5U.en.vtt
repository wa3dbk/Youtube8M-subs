00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello people get to my next 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.609
 wow gold this time it's about frost 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.859
 Fabric as you can see we are already one 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.690
 ice crown here in this part 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.830
 many of you will still take this place 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.990
 know about the old addition 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.360
 tournament dailies in this area 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.279
 There are a lot of mob groups closely 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.630
 stand together where you are under pug 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:26.160
 this undead pug is very dry 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.869
 a lot of frost fabric there are groups that 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.699
 there are always six directly next to each other 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.199
 and they do not go away from each other 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.239
 Here we see so dead groups 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.160
 Unfortunately, I currently find kainz because 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.440
 Here I have a lot of driving 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.730
 just one recovered are even more than 6 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.860
 you just go and skin why 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.270
 or just pull new and 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.239
 the tilt thereafter was invited already 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.770
 frost shop is just that relatively little 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.440
 pressed but usually need the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.449
 really much my second recommendation for 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.760
 frost boss is up here on the left 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.430
 the shadows vault here are very 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.360
 a lot of humanoid pugs that very much 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.010
 has little response 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.979
 you can see the fall directly with 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.909
 A blow to us still plowing 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.500
 actually right again 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.299
 this device is unfortunately part of a quest 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.920
 but you can do it even if he 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.869
 quest did not just enter 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.000
 but sometimes annoying because here 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.000
 other players are sometimes like me 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.470
 just 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.369
 However, they were able to do a lot 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.780
 frost fabric and barely cool if 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.130
 So that's what you give yourself first 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.600
 have shown very many 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.189
 players are just like me you are 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.200
 just up here because this area 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.869
 is not really from 90s really 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.430
 gets because most of the targeted 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.259
 it works faster, however 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.810
 only if there are no players 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.020
 otherwise it's a lot up here 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.020
 more quickly 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.100
 I'll kill those up here again 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.100
 respawn 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.150
 this pug troops also it here 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.670
 bone 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.340
 they can be exchanged by like that 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.990
 strange rest in so comical rest the 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.570
 However, the speed of movement increase 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.520
 Not really worth it to us 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.980
 The bones could also be easy 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.630
 sell at npc as usual should 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.430
 her gray things not easy 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.380
 delete or just leave there 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.600
 but with clay and the mpc sell 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.620
 because we do not want gold just 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.620
 to lie down somewhere 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.020
 My last tip for frost stuff 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.030
 is located in max hamers at the 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.640
 military quarter always the trash before the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.480
 first building for clapping and 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.590
 subsequently , under no circumstances may the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.660
 knocking out the first boss 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.000
 after that could reset the bottles 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.190
 yes let the mobs here are very very 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.500
 just basically two 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.500
 Pulling up to three groups together is easy 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.400
 For a bit and then fall 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.400
 also relatively fast 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:10.900
 you do not look below 50 anymore 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:13.209
 percent live with two groups and the 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.120
 tilt very fast in the frost 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.380
 we have here right at the beginning and up 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.380
 There is much more to it 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.130
 in between one can of course 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.130
 marcel fedde or something like that 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.310
 to keep going a bit longer 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.440
 stays up 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.270
 we should fit the mobs 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.730
 Disarm a once in a while that can 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.980
 pretty bad when it comes to 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.560
 bad time comes when you eg 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:50.500
 so many you can do that pretty bad 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:53.460
 go out and usually ends up with the flight 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.460
 mount back up 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.450
 with cult around skip, of course, actually 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.680
 almost directly around 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.600
 Apart from that, they are groups 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.900
 What I normally do shows me again 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.280
 always on the way back take something 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.920
 Of course, not at the 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.760
 lets mops but takes her directly 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.790
 and sold to the npc because that is 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:21.340
 left gold is supposed to be down here then 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:23.080
 again a few groups and afterwards 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.520
 Can you go back upstairs ? 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.680
 and then do it all over again 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.820
 until you wait an hour 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:34.150
 you have to do that was the last tip 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.910
 for frost fabric I say usual 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.950
 set if the video you liked 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.620
 and you wanted to subscribe more 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.270
 Licon and thank you for looking up 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.270
 the next one was pure looking
