00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.170
 Those of long-lived groups has not stable movement to Otsu to play house is this tower 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.370
 It is impossible to make it red 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:19.070
 I agree 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:19.070
 Lighting bullets that are fired by the burning of the gold component show a big fluctuation in the image 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:28.150
 me 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:33.300
 Does the mysterious light that appeared in the phoenix show a steady glow like a payback? 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.300
 Or does it shake like a light bullet? 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.130
 Let's blue 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.550
 If it was light to say 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.760
 Car that you will see that the form is in place 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.210
 New Howe car 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.210
 Almost net increase is seen but it is gone 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:01.880
 Light of the Phoenix people but variations are stable at least you can see this person after the round data 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.970
 Over but it flares how 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.340
 Borland street always fine 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:13.079
 It is linked 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:17.899
 If the phoenix light is a flare, you should see more variation in the histogram 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.899
 Yuta extracted from the video is uniform 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.710
 For example Dos do you interpret what the left that was reflected in the video 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.570
 This does Mase Jai's certification 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.920
 Is It is true that there is no ze's lighting'm light a small typhoon 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:49.580
 But this video is of high quality 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:52.299
 Voice that points out that it is impossible to draw a clear conclusion because camera shake and the neighborhood of the city are affecting 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.299
 Is also up 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:04.940
 The example and its analysis have led to the identification of the light only by denying the possibility of the light bullet 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.940
 not 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:16.090
 Just because there is no data to adapt does not mean that in a space ship 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:21.569
 I just do not know the identity 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.569
 It is an unidentified flying object literally unknown 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.430
 What was it that night appeared in the sky of Phoenix ? 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:41.560
 There are multiple witness testimonials, so whether or not they were looking at the same object 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:45.870
 It is not only to prove 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.870
 There may be more than one style 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:58.020
 ufo researcher Rallyo's survey continues 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:01.940
 But flying objects with features as witnessed far surpassed current technology 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.940
 There seems to be no doubt that it is a thing 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:12.400
 Light of Phoenix is whether it was space ship 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:12.400
 Renaming can only wait for technological advances in science 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:25.630
 Once a day new knowledge will unravel the mystery 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:32.550
 But trial and error Paraku team showed me that challenged the Phoenix Lights Only 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:32.550
 It is a driving force of various ideas that enable impossible even now and now 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:44.200
 If the speakers gave up, mankind would never reach the moon 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.470
 Without imagination that leads to new discoveries 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:53.940
 Today's progress would have been impossible 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.940
 It will not be possible to overcome the problems currently faced 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.190
 But Phoenix's light is still a mystery phenomenon 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:13.750
 Only have derived data 4 corner Toka snow diligently finish us to the such as the mountain after all 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.990
 There is no 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.730
 We do 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.730
 Their huge sightings 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.110
 Area color 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.629
 I think I'd like to close to reality 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:39.289
 Phoenix light is a number 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:39.289
 Not yet scientifically proven 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.730
 The clarification is entrusted to the future
