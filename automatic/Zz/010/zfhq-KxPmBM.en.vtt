00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
with the curve just to find the shape

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:08.710 
with the curve just to find the shape
that<00:01:00.229> you<00:01:00.589> really<00:01:00.890> want<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:08.420> they<00:01:08.539> just

what<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.360> might<00:01:30.480> call<00:01:30.690> a<00:01:30.750> rasp<00:01:31.460> like<00:01:32.460> we

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
what you might call a rasp like we

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.150 
what you might call a rasp like we
shaped<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.180> back<00:01:33.330> of<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.630> neck<00:01:33.870> and<00:01:34.230> now<00:01:35.040> I'm

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
shaped the back of the neck and now I'm

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.520 
shaped the back of the neck and now I'm
going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.400> finish<00:01:35.640> shaping<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.360> neck<00:01:36.600> down<00:01:37.320> to

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
going to finish shaping the neck down to

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:55.380 
going to finish shaping the neck down to
that<00:01:37.680> pencil<00:01:38.070> line

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.840 

and<00:01:56.390> now<00:01:56.540> keep<00:01:56.810> in<00:01:56.990> mind<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.950> center<00:01:58.310> line<00:01:58.520> and

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
and now keep in mind the center line and

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.149 
and now keep in mind the center line and
how<00:01:59.510> it<00:01:59.720> matches<00:01:59.900> the<00:02:00.320> center<00:02:00.619> line<00:02:00.830> on<00:02:00.860> the

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
how it matches the center line on the

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.190 
how it matches the center line on the
back<00:02:01.400> of<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.790> guitar<00:02:01.940> if<00:02:02.690> you<00:02:02.840> use<00:02:03.020> the

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
back of the guitar if you use the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.550 
back of the guitar if you use the
asymmetrical<00:02:03.979> profile<00:02:04.580> you<00:02:05.509> may<00:02:05.659> these<00:02:05.990> don't

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
asymmetrical profile you may these don't

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.930 
asymmetrical profile you may these don't
actually<00:02:06.710> line<00:02:07.220> up<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.119> sort<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.539> have<00:02:08.720> to

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
actually line up so you sort of have to

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.880 
actually line up so you sort of have to
feather<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.330> center<00:02:11.840> line<00:02:12.050> on<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.560> back<00:02:12.709> of

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
feather the center line on the back of

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.940 
feather the center line on the back of
the<00:02:12.980> neck<00:02:13.190> into<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.970> back<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.390> guitar

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
the neck into the back of the guitar

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.350 
the neck into the back of the guitar
sort<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.040> angle<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.550> in<00:02:16.760> till<00:02:17.060> they<00:02:17.180> match<00:02:19.360> and

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
sort of angle it in till they match and

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.760 
sort of angle it in till they match and
now<00:02:20.660> I'm<00:02:20.720> going<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.930> just<00:02:21.110> start<00:02:21.290> rounding

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
now I'm going to just start rounding

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.610 
now I'm going to just start rounding
over<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.900> sharper<00:02:24.290> edge<00:02:24.470> here<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:27.350> get<00:02:27.500> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
over the sharper edge here and get the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.810 
over the sharper edge here and get the
other<00:02:27.769> side<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:32.620> sort<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.739> you<00:02:33.860> want<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.190> blend

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
other side I sort it you want to blend

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.240 
other side I sort it you want to blend
this<00:02:35.120> back<00:02:35.450> edge<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.140> neck<00:02:36.350> into<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.070> back

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
this back edge of the neck into the back

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.610 
this back edge of the neck into the back
of<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.550> guitar<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:38.989> all<00:02:39.170> looks<00:02:39.410> like

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
of the guitar so that it all looks like

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.090 
of the guitar so that it all looks like
one<00:02:39.860> piece<00:02:44.050> then<00:02:45.050> blend<00:02:45.350> it<00:02:45.470> into<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.739> sides

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
one piece then blend it into the sides

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.370 
one piece then blend it into the sides
as<00:02:46.370> well<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:46.850> here<00:02:47.420> I've<00:02:47.570> switched<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.140> little

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
as well I here I've switched to a little

00:02:48.380 --> 00:03:01.540 
as well I here I've switched to a little
finer<00:02:49.930> file<00:02:50.930> or<00:02:51.230> rasp

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.890 

and<00:03:02.550> be<00:03:02.700> sure<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.030> work<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.360> down<00:03:03.540> from<00:03:03.720> the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
and be sure and work it down from the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.480 
and be sure and work it down from the
heel<00:03:04.170> all<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.470> way<00:03:04.650> into<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.100> back<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.430> the

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
heel all the way into the back of the

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:28.380 
heel all the way into the back of the
neck

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.690 

you<00:03:29.390> also<00:03:29.659> want<00:03:30.050> to<00:03:30.080> make<00:03:30.230> sure<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:30.709> keep<00:03:31.370> that

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
you also want to make sure you keep that

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.410 
you also want to make sure you keep that
contour<00:03:32.360> of<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:33.319> arched<00:03:33.680> back<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.459> continue

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
contour of the arched back and continue

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.500 
contour of the arched back and continue
it<00:03:35.569> through<00:03:35.780> that<00:03:35.959> heel<00:03:36.230> as<00:03:36.440> well<00:03:37.360> then<00:03:38.360> we're

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
it through that heel as well then we're

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.059 
it through that heel as well then we're
going<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.780> go<00:03:38.930> with<00:03:39.379> some<00:03:39.620> hundred<00:03:39.920> grit

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.180 
sandpaper and start smoothing everything
out<00:03:43.390> pay<00:03:44.390> attention<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:45.080> that<00:03:45.470> joint<00:03:45.890> between

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
out pay attention to that joint between

00:03:46.190 --> 00:04:01.690 
out pay attention to that joint between
the<00:03:46.549> body<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.209> neck

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.780 

and<00:04:02.700> then<00:04:02.910> work<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:04.040> very<00:04:05.040> back<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.580> heel

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
and then work the very back of the heel

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.460 
and then work the very back of the heel
of<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.060> neck<00:04:06.240> and<00:04:06.540> smooth<00:04:06.900> that<00:04:07.080> into<00:04:07.260> the

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
of the neck and smooth that into the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:24.390 
of the neck and smooth that into the
body<00:04:07.650> as<00:04:07.860> well

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.310 

and<00:04:25.400> then<00:04:25.550> you<00:04:25.670> want<00:04:26.090> a<00:04:26.180> smooth<00:04:26.750> transition

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
and then you want a smooth transition

00:04:27.320 --> 00:05:32.260 
and then you want a smooth transition
from<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.740> heel<00:04:28.070> into<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.520> back<00:04:28.790> of<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.060> neck

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.670 

and<00:05:33.270> here<00:05:33.449> I'm<00:05:33.570> just<00:05:33.600> sort<00:05:33.930> of<00:05:33.990> rounding<00:05:34.440> over

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
and here I'm just sort of rounding over

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.759 
and here I'm just sort of rounding over
that<00:05:34.830> edge<00:05:35.070> a<00:05:35.100> little<00:05:35.580> more
