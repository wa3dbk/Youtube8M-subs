00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:48.740 
starting to liquify so I know I'm

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.190 
starting to liquify so I know I'm
getting<00:00:49.070> really<00:00:49.190> close<00:00:49.630> now<00:00:50.630> what<00:00:50.870> you<00:00:51.020> want

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
to do is be very careful when you're

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.810 
to do is be very careful when you're
cooking<00:00:52.850> this<00:00:53.320> because<00:00:54.320> it<00:00:54.590> can<00:00:54.800> turn<00:00:55.040> a<00:00:55.400> very

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
cooking this because it can turn a very

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.390 
cooking this because it can turn a very
dark<00:00:56.120> color<00:00:56.210> very<00:00:56.720> quickly<00:00:57.020> and<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:58.010> darker

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
dark color very quickly and the darker

dark color very quickly and the darker
the<00:00:58.850> caramel<00:00:59.300> color<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.780> more<00:00:59.990> bitter<00:01:00.200> the

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
the caramel color the more bitter the

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.520 
the caramel color the more bitter the
flavor<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:02.660> other<00:01:02.780> thing<00:01:03.020> to<00:01:03.170> keep<00:01:03.290> in<00:01:03.470> mind

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
flavor the other thing to keep in mind

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
over here I have a sieve on top of a

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.229 
over here I have a sieve on top of a
very<00:02:30.989> big<00:02:31.319> measuring<00:02:31.890> cup<00:02:32.099> and<00:02:32.370> what<00:02:33.120> I'm

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
very big measuring cup and what I'm

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.960 
very big measuring cup and what I'm
gonna<00:02:33.390> do<00:02:33.629> now<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:33.840> strain<00:02:34.379> the<00:02:34.560> mixture<00:02:34.970> by

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
gonna do now is strain the mixture by

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.470 
gonna do now is strain the mixture by
straining<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.720> mixture<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:37.950> removes<00:02:38.489> the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
straining the mixture this removes the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.300 
straining the mixture this removes the
larger<00:02:39.959> parts<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.560> egg<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.920> we<00:02:41.099> don't

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
larger parts of the egg that we don't

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.180 
larger parts of the egg that we don't
want<00:02:41.580> in<00:02:41.730> our<00:02:41.849> flan<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:43.069> straining<00:02:44.069> the

want in our flan and straining the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.339 
want in our flan and straining the
mixture<00:02:44.610> will<00:02:44.879> give<00:02:45.060> our<00:02:45.239> flan<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.690> nice<00:02:45.900> smooth

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
mixture will give our flan a nice smooth

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.600 
mixture will give our flan a nice smooth
