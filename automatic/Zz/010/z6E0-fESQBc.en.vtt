00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.759

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.860
 be asking why 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.880
 Good, and I'll explain here one way. 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.819
 logic 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.000
 When you buy a game he has his 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.460
 licensing there everything cute and so on 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.610
 especially on pc 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.220
 things nÃ© like sting etc is good and 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.410
 when you crack it's a game you lose 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.840
 Do you have this fake license? 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.150
 Are you playing an illegal game? Let's say 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.640
 so you can not upgrade if you 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.650
 can lose the game and if you can have 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.310
 problems anyway 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.370
 You may end up losing the game if you 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.920
 update and what happens is when you 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.530
 does not update the game itself you do not 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.690
 can put new things inside 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.100
 of the game and rockstar is doing the 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.370
 Next is protecting your 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.470
 update that when it launches it goes 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.140
 launch with more positives for the 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.240
 people who have a cool game to get 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.070
 update and who does not have the game does 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.710
 update in no way do not pick up 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.920
 update manually 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:07.100
 simply put some kind of 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.860
 thing in the cloud get mocked 27 to 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.780
 istanbul having one putting a protection 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.440
 within this update for those who have 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.810
 a game 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.420
 I legally got to play and did not have 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.960
 If that's the case, let's say the way 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.110
 to force the guy quoted follow 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.370

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.180

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.800
 that's usually where it's because 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.650
 like this if you have a game created 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.530
 you can do this console thing 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.960
 Do not have it, say so, but it will 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.600

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.910
