I dinosaur presumably another hadrosaur
or<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.370> larger<00:02:17.940> herbivore<00:02:18.480> we<00:02:19.230> have<00:02:19.470> less<00:02:20.310> suit

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
or a larger herbivore we have less suit

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.810 
or a larger herbivore we have less suit
to<00:02:20.700> Saurus<00:02:21.180> which<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.600> small<00:02:21.750> bipedal

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
dinosaur presumably another hadrosaur we

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.530 
dinosaur presumably another hadrosaur we
have<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.930> lapper<00:02:31.560> asaurus<00:02:32.190> which<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:33.920> a

have a lapper asaurus which is a

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.170 
have a lapper asaurus which is a
serratus<00:02:36.540> or<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:36.990> in<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.440> same<00:02:37.650> family<00:02:38.100> as

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
serratus or it's in the same family as

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.120 
serratus or it's in the same family as
Tyrannosaurus<00:02:39.180> it's<00:02:39.360> similar<00:02:40.290> looking<00:02:40.920> to

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
Tyrannosaurus it's similar looking to

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.490 
Tyrannosaurus it's similar looking to
Gallimimus<00:02:41.580> only<00:02:42.060> has<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.300> smaller<00:02:42.810> head<00:02:43.170> and

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
Gallimimus only has a smaller head and

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.490 
Gallimimus only has a smaller head and
this<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.550> carnivorous<00:02:45.030> dinosaur<00:02:45.960> so<00:02:46.260> really

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
this is a carnivorous dinosaur so really

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.140 
this is a carnivorous dinosaur so really
interesting<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.040> see<00:02:47.460> another<00:02:47.700> one<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:48.000> them

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
interesting to see another one of them

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.140 
interesting to see another one of them
we<00:02:48.960> have<00:02:49.200> one<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.340> either<00:02:50.580> an<00:02:50.880> ally

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
we have one that is either an ally

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.080 
we have one that is either an ally
oremus<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:52.080> Allosaurus<00:02:52.710> or<00:02:52.970> somewhere<00:02:53.970> in

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
oremus and Allosaurus or somewhere in

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.330 
oremus and Allosaurus or somewhere in
that<00:02:54.120> family<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.710> most<00:02:55.950> likely<00:02:56.190> a

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
that family and it is most likely a

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.150 
that family and it is most likely a
smaller<00:02:56.940> carnivore<00:02:57.630> but<00:02:58.350> still<00:02:58.860> in<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
smaller carnivore but still in the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.930 
smaller carnivore but still in the
Tyrannosaur<00:02:59.910> family<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:00.930> small<00:03:01.290> compared<00:03:01.800> to

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
Tyrannosaur family so small compared to

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.610 
Tyrannosaur family so small compared to
Tyrannosaurus<00:03:02.940> Rex<00:03:03.210> but<00:03:03.480> still<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:04.050> larger

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
Tyrannosaurus Rex but still a larger

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.460 
Tyrannosaurus Rex but still a larger
carnivorous<00:03:05.270> animal<00:03:06.270> so<00:03:06.960> those<00:03:07.290> are<00:03:07.320> just

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
carnivorous animal so those are just

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.950 
carnivorous animal so those are just
kind<00:03:07.740> of<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.100> ones<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:08.670> we've<00:03:09.030> seen<00:03:09.570> on<00:03:09.780> the

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
kind of the ones that we've seen on the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.530 
kind of the ones that we've seen on the
little<00:03:10.830> touch<00:03:11.310> pad<00:03:11.610> that<00:03:11.820> they're<00:03:12.000> playing<00:03:12.330> on

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
little touch pad that they're playing on

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.450 
little touch pad that they're playing on
huzza<00:03:13.230> what<00:03:13.560> do<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.710> think<00:03:13.920> about<00:03:14.040> all<00:03:14.340> this

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
huzza what do you think about all this

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.140 
huzza what do you think about all this
stuff<00:03:15.680> yes<00:03:16.680> very<00:03:16.950> interesting<00:03:17.430> given<00:03:18.030> that

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
stuff yes very interesting given that

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.210 
stuff yes very interesting given that
we've<00:03:18.360> seen<00:03:18.660> these<00:03:19.020> new<00:03:19.260> dinosaurs<00:03:19.800> on<00:03:20.130> the

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
we've seen these new dinosaurs on the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.030 
we've seen these new dinosaurs on the
tablet<00:03:20.640> um<00:03:21.020> other<00:03:22.020> interested<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.800> see

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
tablet um other interested to see

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.390 
tablet um other interested to see
whether<00:03:23.910> as<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:24.600> said<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:24.900> these<00:03:25.400> dancers

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
whether as you said that these dancers

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.250 
whether as you said that these dancers
are<00:03:27.000> probably<00:03:27.300> not<00:03:27.450> going<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.660> be<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.020> film

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
are probably not going to be in the film

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.430 
are probably not going to be in the film
but<00:03:28.890> might<00:03:29.100> be<00:03:29.220> mentioned<00:03:29.760> briefly<00:03:30.120> by<00:03:30.600> maybe

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
but might be mentioned briefly by maybe

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.660 
but might be mentioned briefly by maybe
in<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:32.540> buy<00:03:33.540> some<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.930> park<00:03:34.140> people<00:03:34.670> if

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
in and buy some of the park people if

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.120 
in and buy some of the park people if
not<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.480> was<00:03:36.840> thinking<00:03:37.140> here<00:03:37.320> that<00:03:37.560> as<00:03:37.739> you

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
not the I was thinking here that as you

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.770 
not the I was thinking here that as you
said<00:03:38.340> there<00:03:38.520> could<00:03:38.640> be<00:03:38.700> future<00:03:39.239> attractions

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
said there could be future attractions

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.430 
said there could be future attractions
for<00:03:39.870> maybe<00:03:40.200> um<00:03:41.270> up<00:03:42.270> up<00:03:42.600> in<00:03:42.750> our<00:03:42.959> later<00:03:43.230> in<00:03:43.380> the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
for maybe um up up in our later in the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.280 
for maybe um up up in our later in the
park<00:03:43.709> but<00:03:44.670> we<00:03:44.820> just<00:03:44.940> don't<00:03:45.120> see<00:03:45.390> that<00:03:45.420> or<00:03:45.840> they

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
park but we just don't see that or they

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.770 
park but we just don't see that or they
could<00:03:46.320> be<00:03:46.530> possible<00:03:47.450> dinosaurs<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.570> might

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
could be possible dinosaurs that might

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.690 
could be possible dinosaurs that might
even<00:03:48.810> be<00:03:49.020> in<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.320> next<00:03:49.530> film<00:03:49.860> but<00:03:50.190> as<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.640> said

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
even be in the next film but as I said

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.420 
even be in the next film but as I said
it's<00:03:51.030> probably<00:03:51.330> just<00:03:52.100> dinosaur<00:03:53.100> sub<00:03:53.250> emotes

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
it's probably just dinosaur sub emotes

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.890 
it's probably just dinosaur sub emotes
in<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.730> film<00:03:54.000> much<00:03:54.270> like<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.690> first

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
in the film much like in the first

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.900 
in the film much like in the first
dressing<00:03:55.170> park<00:03:55.500> where<00:03:55.800> Dennis<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.520> Jewish

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
dressing park where Dennis and Jewish

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.870 
dressing park where Dennis and Jewish
stealing<00:03:57.270> embryos<00:03:57.510> we<00:03:58.170> saw<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.680> metric<00:03:59.610> at<00:03:59.760> the

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
stealing embryos we saw a metric at the

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.300 
stealing embryos we saw a metric at the
Soros<00:04:00.239> and<00:04:00.510> some<00:04:01.470> other<00:04:01.620> dinosaurs<00:04:02.100> that<00:04:02.220> we

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
Soros and some other dinosaurs that we

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.920 
Soros and some other dinosaurs that we
can<00:04:02.459> actually<00:04:02.640> get<00:04:02.820> to<00:04:02.880> see<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.390> film<00:04:03.630> but

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
can actually get to see in the film but

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.600 
can actually get to see in the film but
we<00:04:04.080> thought<00:04:04.320> they<00:04:04.650> were<00:04:04.739> mentioned<00:04:05.160> so<00:04:05.400> move

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
we thought they were mentioned so move

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.720 
we thought they were mentioned so move
its<00:04:05.730> gonna<00:04:05.910> be<00:04:06.030> like<00:04:06.060> that

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
its gonna be like that

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.160 
its gonna be like that
yeah<00:04:08.730> really<00:04:08.969> good<00:04:09.090> thoughts<00:04:09.450> I<00:04:09.659> totally

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
yeah really good thoughts I totally

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.080 
yeah really good thoughts I totally
agree<00:04:10.290> like<00:04:10.860> I<00:04:11.010> said<00:04:11.069> none<00:04:11.700> of<00:04:11.849> these<00:04:12.060> are

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
agree like I said none of these are

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.979 
agree like I said none of these are
confirmed<00:04:13.189> just<00:04:14.189> some<00:04:14.849> dinosaurs<00:04:15.420> they<00:04:15.780> are

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
confirmed just some dinosaurs they are

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
the film but this is not confirmed that

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.730 
the film but this is not confirmed that
they<00:04:50.970> will<00:04:51.090> be<00:04:51.150> in<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.509> film<00:04:51.720> he<00:04:52.289> brought<00:04:52.500> up<00:04:52.620> a

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
they will be in the film he brought up a

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.529 
they will be in the film he brought up a
good<00:04:52.919> point<00:04:52.979> when<00:04:53.490> Dennis<00:04:53.910> Nedry<00:04:54.150> was

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
good point when Dennis Nedry was

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.469 
good point when Dennis Nedry was
stealing<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.199> dinosaur<00:04:56.130> embryos<00:04:56.639> that<00:04:56.910> they

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
stealing the dinosaur embryos that they

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.420 
stealing the dinosaur embryos that they
did<00:04:57.690> not<00:04:57.810> we<00:04:58.229> did<00:04:58.380> not<00:04:58.470> actually<00:04:58.680> see<00:04:58.889> some<00:04:59.340> of

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
did not we did not actually see some of

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.400 
did not we did not actually see some of
those<00:04:59.550> dinosaurs<00:05:00.090> in<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.210> film<00:05:00.539> so<00:05:01.259> I<00:05:01.289> think

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
those dinosaurs in the film so I think

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.200 
those dinosaurs in the film so I think
this<00:05:01.770> might<00:05:01.979> be<00:05:02.009> the<00:05:02.280> case<00:05:02.460> but<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:03.030> never

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
this might be the case but you never

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.510 
this might be the case but you never
know<00:05:03.419> we<00:05:03.690> could<00:05:03.900> see<00:05:04.110> them<00:05:04.259> so<00:05:05.039> leave<00:05:05.280> in<00:05:05.400> the

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
know we could see them so leave in the

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.670 
know we could see them so leave in the
