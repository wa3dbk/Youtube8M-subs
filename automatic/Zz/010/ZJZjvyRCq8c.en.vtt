00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
didn't make it by him so I think it's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.789

pretty<00:01:59.759> good<00:01:59.969> too<00:02:00.290> if<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.439> guys<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.770> it

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
like cover and just drive around and

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.920 
like cover and just drive around and
shoot<00:02:22.020> people<00:02:22.110> with<00:02:22.320> like<00:02:23.360> SMG<00:02:24.360> or<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.720> AP

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
shoot people with like SMG or the AP

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.540 
shoot people with like SMG or the AP
pistol<00:02:25.350> depending<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.010> whatever<00:02:26.190> one<00:02:26.520> you

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
pistol depending on whatever one you

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.780 
pistol depending on whatever one you
have<00:02:26.760> yet<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.030> be<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.150> little<00:02:27.300> 36w<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.610> get<00:02:29.610> this

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
have yet to be a little 36w to get this

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.840 
have yet to be a little 36w to get this
mission<00:02:30.180> but<00:02:30.480> um<00:02:31.160> it's<00:02:32.160> quite<00:02:32.490> simple<00:02:32.730> you

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
mission but um it's quite simple you

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.150 
mission but um it's quite simple you
don't<00:02:32.970> really<00:02:33.210> have<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.420> be<00:02:33.600> 36<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.590> think

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
don't really have to be 36 but I think

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.900 
don't really have to be 36 but I think
you<00:02:35.250> can<00:02:35.430> do<00:02:35.580> fine<00:02:36.270> job<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.840> then<00:02:36.990> click

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
you can do fine job and then click

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.990 
you can do fine job and then click
co-edited<00:02:38.910> under<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.720> missions<00:02:40.020> tab<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:41.000> you

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
co-edited under the missions tab and you

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.120 
co-edited under the missions tab and you
can<00:02:42.030> restart<00:02:42.930> this<00:02:43.080> mission<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.709> think<00:02:43.980> I've

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
can restart this mission I think I've

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.710 
can restart this mission I think I've
only<00:02:44.310> done<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.610> couple<00:02:44.880> times<00:02:45.209> if<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.510> just

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
only done a couple times if you just

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.140 
only done a couple times if you just
constantly<00:02:46.320> press<00:02:46.740> like<00:02:46.980> Artie<00:02:47.489> really<00:02:47.910> fast

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
constantly press like Artie really fast

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.199 
constantly press like Artie really fast
you<00:02:48.330> will<00:02:48.540> restart<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.260> but<00:02:49.860> um<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.280> think<00:02:51.090> it

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
you will restart it but um I think it

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.250 
you will restart it but um I think it
it's<00:02:52.050> kind<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.470> like<00:02:53.540> almost<00:02:54.540> like<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.080> one

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
it's kind of like almost like the one

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260 
it's kind of like almost like the one
glitch<00:02:55.560> where<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.280> um<00:02:56.489> there's<00:02:57.180> another

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
glitch where you um there's another

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.080 
glitch where you um there's another
mission<00:02:57.870> where<00:02:58.050> if<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.980> exploded<00:02:59.520> like<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.790> car

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
mission where if you exploded like a car

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.460 
mission where if you exploded like a car
you<00:03:00.180> get<00:03:00.300> nine<00:03:00.510> thousand<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.900> can<00:03:01.020> do<00:03:01.110> in<00:03:01.260> like

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
you get nine thousand you can do in like

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.460 
you get nine thousand you can do in like
20<00:03:02.160> seconds<00:03:02.489> by<00:03:02.640> like<00:03:03.270> shooting<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.989> rocket<00:03:04.320> in

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
20 seconds by like shooting a rocket in

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.229 
20 seconds by like shooting a rocket in
that<00:03:04.800> direction<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.370> you'll<00:03:05.850> finish<00:03:06.030> the

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
that direction and you'll finish the

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.420 
that direction and you'll finish the
mission<00:03:06.330> really<00:03:06.630> fast<00:03:06.900> but<00:03:07.620> on<00:03:07.770> this<00:03:07.920> one<00:03:08.130> you

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
mission really fast but on this one you

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.070 
mission really fast but on this one you
can<00:03:08.459> see<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.700> cargobob<00:03:09.180> lens<00:03:09.570> here<00:03:09.750> if<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:09.930> go

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
that guy is an enemy and you can easily

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.840 
that guy is an enemy and you can easily
um<00:03:15.840> just<00:03:16.380> drop<00:03:16.890> out<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.220> get<00:03:17.400> into<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.580> cargo

um just drop out and get into the cargo
Bob<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.330> just<00:03:19.049> fly<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.260> pick<00:03:19.500> up<00:03:19.620> the

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.650 
Bob and just fly and pick up the
container<00:03:20.070> it's<00:03:20.280> really<00:03:20.519> easy<00:03:20.730> i<00:03:21.030> think<00:03:21.269> i<00:03:21.570> was

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
container it's really easy i think i was

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.660 
container it's really easy i think i was
able<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.900> do<00:03:22.049> this<00:03:22.260> like<00:03:22.500> three<00:03:23.040> times<00:03:23.310> and

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
able to do this like three times and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.390 
able to do this like three times and
about<00:03:23.970> um<00:03:24.480> i<00:03:24.690> don't<00:03:25.410> know<00:03:25.500> 10<00:03:25.830> minutes<00:03:26.130> or<00:03:26.280> 15

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
about um i don't know 10 minutes or 15

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.050 
about um i don't know 10 minutes or 15
minutes<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:27.390> did<00:03:27.600> take<00:03:27.780> me<00:03:27.840> about<00:03:28.310> 25<00:03:29.310> min<00:03:29.880> or

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
minutes it did take me about 25 min or

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.930 
minutes it did take me about 25 min or
probably<00:03:30.750> five<00:03:31.049> minutes<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.860> complete<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.310> but

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
probably five minutes to complete it but

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.850 
probably five minutes to complete it but
i<00:03:33.209> think<00:03:33.720> i<00:03:33.810> felt<00:03:34.019> like<00:03:34.049> i<00:03:34.230> was<00:03:34.320> running<00:03:34.650> a

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
i think i felt like i was running a

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.470 
i think i felt like i was running a
little<00:03:34.980> slow<00:03:35.100> but<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.820> can<00:03:35.970> easily<00:03:36.090> do<00:03:36.420> this

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
little slow but you can easily do this

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.990 
little slow but you can easily do this
mission<00:03:36.870> as<00:03:37.049> it<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.620> can<00:03:37.799> see<00:03:37.920> you<00:03:38.040> can<00:03:38.100> take

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
mission as it you can see you can take
