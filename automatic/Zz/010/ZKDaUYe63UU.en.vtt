00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
around in awkward places as it is so

around in awkward places as it is so
what<00:02:13.090> we<00:02:13.209> should<00:02:13.420> do<00:02:14.100> if<00:02:15.100> you<00:02:15.280> like<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:16.780> use<00:02:16.959> a

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
what we should do if you like just use a

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
before it's not that hard to learn just

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.050 
before it's not that hard to learn just
keep<00:02:43.900> practicing<00:02:44.530> on<00:02:44.560> your<00:02:44.680> own<00:02:44.800> house<00:02:45.190> your

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
can do it and I quickly learn save a lot

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.900 
can do it and I quickly learn save a lot
of<00:02:53.290> water<00:02:58.140> there<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.230> go<00:02:59.440> empty<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.489> out<00:03:00.519> every

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
of water there you go empty it out every

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.430 
of water there you go empty it out every
sort<00:03:02.519> but<00:03:03.519> there's<00:03:03.760> one<00:03:03.910> thing<00:03:04.180> you<00:03:04.480> have<00:03:05.410> to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
sort but there's one thing you have to

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.590 
sort but there's one thing you have to
learn<00:03:05.739> as<00:03:05.980> well<00:03:06.720> one<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:07.900> but<00:03:09.480> when<00:03:10.480> you're

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
learn as well one of you but when you're

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.920 
learn as well one of you but when you're
using<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.930> water<00:03:11.079> bed<00:03:11.380> pots<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:13.420> do<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.720> for

here and I like a roof over the other

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.970 
here and I like a roof over the other
windows<00:03:24.850> but<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.540> lot<00:03:25.690> of<00:03:25.720> properties<00:03:26.230> what

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
windows but a lot of properties what

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.380 
windows but a lot of properties what
you're<00:03:27.100> going<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.280> find<00:03:27.549> is<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.940> water<00:03:28.150> will

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
you're going to find is the water will

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.949 
you're going to find is the water will
drip<00:03:28.780> off<00:03:29.040> onto<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.190> bottom<00:03:30.489> window<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:31.060> what

drip off onto the bottom window so what

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.870 
drip off onto the bottom window so what
you<00:03:32.079> need<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.410> do<00:03:32.590> is<00:03:33.070> once<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.370> finish<00:03:33.760> the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
you need to do is once you finish the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.509 
you need to do is once you finish the
ship<00:03:34.120> ship<00:03:34.390> motor<00:03:35.200> off<00:03:35.470> on<00:03:35.650> your<00:03:35.739> backpack<00:03:36.220> or

whatever using wipe the bottom of the

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.530 
whatever using wipe the bottom of the
sill<00:03:39.880> like<00:03:40.060> that

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
sill like that

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.120 
sill like that
that'll<00:03:41.410> help<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.680> stop<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.010> trips<00:03:44.130> then

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
that'll help to stop the trips then

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.250 
that'll help to stop the trips then
leave<00:03:45.549> that<00:03:45.760> window<00:03:46.120> for<00:03:46.360> a<00:03:46.390> while<00:03:49.019> go<00:03:50.019> and<00:03:50.170> do

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
leave that window for a while go and do

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.220 
leave that window for a while go and do
something<00:03:50.530> else<00:03:50.799> like<00:03:51.220> this<00:03:51.610> for<00:03:51.880> instance

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
something else like this for instance

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.949 
something else like this for instance
and<00:03:53.230> then<00:03:53.320> that<00:03:53.500> time<00:03:54.209> should<00:03:55.209> stop<00:03:55.570> dripping

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
and then that time should stop dripping

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.220 
and then that time should stop dripping
sufficiently

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
sufficiently

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.589 
sufficiently
because<00:03:57.739> if<00:03:57.890> you<00:03:58.280> leave<00:03:58.489> it<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.790> drip<00:03:59.060> when<00:03:59.480> you

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
because if you leave it to drip when you

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.930 
because if you leave it to drip when you
clean<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.959> window<00:04:00.370> splash<00:04:01.370> on<00:04:01.580> the<00:04:01.610> sill

this it's great no problem at all so
that's<00:04:44.150> another<00:04:44.479> thing<00:04:44.690> you<00:04:44.810> can<00:04:44.960> be<00:04:45.080> thinking

that's another thing you can be thinking

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.620 
that's another thing you can be thinking
of<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:46.160> back<00:04:46.310> that<00:04:46.520> well<00:04:46.669> these<00:04:46.910> pouches<00:04:47.240> are

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
of the back that well these pouches are

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.379 
of the back that well these pouches are
only<00:04:47.750> 50<00:04:48.110> pence<00:04:48.350> each<00:04:48.610> put<00:04:49.610> various<00:04:49.910> things<00:04:50.210> in

only 50 pence each put various things in

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.050 
only 50 pence each put various things in
them<00:04:50.540> I've<00:04:50.630> got<00:04:50.660> a<00:04:50.780> little<00:04:50.900> poll<00:04:51.200> here

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
them I've got a little poll here

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.090 
them I've got a little poll here
extension<00:04:53.350> and<00:04:54.350> as<00:04:54.470> I<00:04:54.560> can't<00:04:54.830> reach

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
extension and as I can't reach

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.680 
extension and as I can't reach
surprising<00:04:55.880> what<00:04:56.000> you<00:04:56.090> can<00:04:56.240> reach<00:04:56.419> with<00:04:56.600> a

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
surprising what you can reach with a

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.170 
surprising what you can reach with a
little<00:04:56.900> extension<00:04:57.260> like<00:04:57.560> that<00:04:57.850> you<00:04:58.850> get<00:04:59.030> used

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
little extension like that you get used

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.080 
little extension like that you get used
to<00:04:59.330> where<00:04:59.479> they<00:04:59.600> go<00:05:00.820> scraper<00:05:01.960> bird<00:05:02.960> muck<00:05:04.090> now

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
to where they go scraper bird muck now

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.140 
to where they go scraper bird muck now
that<00:05:05.530> go<00:05:06.530> on<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.800> end<00:05:06.919> of<00:05:07.010> the<00:05:07.100> pole<00:05:07.539> as<00:05:08.539> well

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
that go on the end of the pole as well

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.290 
that go on the end of the pole as well
so<00:05:11.150> that's<00:05:11.360> about<00:05:11.539> it<00:05:11.870> as<00:05:12.410> some<00:05:12.860> of<00:05:12.950> the

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
so that's about it as some of the

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.250 
so that's about it as some of the
traditional<00:05:14.300> gear<00:05:14.539> that<00:05:14.720> you<00:05:14.780> can<00:05:14.930> be<00:05:15.020> using

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
traditional gear that you can be using

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.230 
traditional gear that you can be using
makes<00:05:16.100> it<00:05:16.220> really<00:05:16.370> convenient<00:05:16.789> it's<00:05:17.030> not<00:05:17.150> as

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
makes it really convenient it's not as

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.029 
makes it really convenient it's not as
hard<00:05:17.389> as<00:05:17.539> you<00:05:17.630> think

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
hard as you think

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.669 
hard as you think
there<00:05:19.039> you<00:05:19.100> go<00:05:19.220> drop<00:05:19.490> down
