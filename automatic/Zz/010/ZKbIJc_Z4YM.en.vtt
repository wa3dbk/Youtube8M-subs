00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
got a clear image panel eliminating

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.500 
got a clear image panel eliminating
layered<00:00:56.420> images<00:00:57.190> connect<00:00:58.190> share<00:00:58.219> eco<00:00:59.149> sensors

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
layered images connect share eco sensors

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.669 
layered images connect share eco sensors
can<00:00:59.780> be<00:00:59.809> little<00:01:00.140> be<00:01:00.260> easier<00:01:00.559> on<00:01:00.589> the

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
can be little be easier on the

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.399 
can be little be easier on the
environment<00:01:00.769> two<00:01:01.489> HDMI<00:01:01.909> ports<00:01:02.390> ports<00:01:03.109> which

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
environment two HDMI ports ports which

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.260 
environment two HDMI ports ports which
is<00:01:03.440> good<00:01:03.800> for<00:01:03.949> me<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:04.430> it<00:01:04.940> is<00:01:04.970> a<00:01:05.120> plasma<00:01:07.270> so

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
is good for me and it is a plasma so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.950 
is good for me and it is a plasma so
that<00:01:08.540> is<00:01:08.860> 43<00:01:09.860> inches<00:01:10.130> or<00:01:10.340> 109<00:01:11.120> centimeters

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
that is 43 inches or 109 centimeters

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.690 
that is 43 inches or 109 centimeters
across<00:01:12.830> diagonally<00:01:13.340> I<00:01:14.560> do<00:01:15.560> not<00:01:15.950> have<00:01:16.070> a<00:01:16.100> tripod

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
across diagonally I do not have a tripod

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.310 
across diagonally I do not have a tripod
so<00:01:16.880> it's<00:01:17.000> gonna<00:01:17.090> be<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.270> little<00:01:17.689> bit<00:01:17.810> tricky

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
so it's gonna be a little bit tricky

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.450 
so it's gonna be a little bit tricky
getting<00:01:18.770> this<00:01:19.040> out<00:01:19.189> of<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.399> box<00:01:20.229> but<00:01:21.229> I<00:01:21.259> can<00:01:21.890> do

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
getting this out of the box but I can do

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.969 
getting this out of the box but I can do
it<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.060> if<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:23.420> actually<00:01:23.810> I<00:01:24.020> probably<00:01:24.740> just

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
it so if you actually I probably just

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:54.109 
it so if you actually I probably just
put<00:01:25.159> this<00:01:25.280> here

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.149 

it's<00:01:55.119> pretty<00:01:55.329> nice<00:01:55.539> so<00:01:55.750> far<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:59.770> give<00:01:59.979> you<00:02:00.069> a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
it's pretty nice so far just give you a

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.410 
it's pretty nice so far just give you a
view<00:02:00.310> then<00:02:02.520> all<00:02:03.520> right<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:03.909> here's<00:02:04.149> what<00:02:04.330> we

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
view then all right so here's what we

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.690 
view then all right so here's what we
got<00:02:04.599> when<00:02:05.380> we<00:02:05.409> first<00:02:05.770> open<00:02:06.099> the<00:02:06.189> box<00:02:06.399> it

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
got when we first open the box it

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.249 
got when we first open the box it
doesn't<00:02:06.939> look<00:02:07.119> pretty<00:02:07.330> slim<00:02:07.689> actually<00:02:08.080> so

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
doesn't look pretty slim actually so

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.490 
doesn't look pretty slim actually so
looks<00:02:09.250> like<00:02:09.340> a<00:02:09.459> pretty<00:02:09.700> decent<00:02:09.819> TV<00:02:10.599> right<00:02:11.470> here

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
looks like a pretty decent TV right here

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.819 
looks like a pretty decent TV right here
I<00:02:13.079> think<00:02:14.079> this<00:02:14.230> would<00:02:14.470> be<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.709> stand<00:02:16.620> unless<00:02:17.620> I

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
I think this would be the stand unless I

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.250 
I think this would be the stand unless I
am<00:02:17.920> mistaken<00:02:18.099> I<00:02:18.670> have<00:02:18.819> no<00:02:19.120> idea<00:02:19.450> what<00:02:19.599> this<00:02:19.750> is

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
am mistaken I have no idea what this is

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.890
