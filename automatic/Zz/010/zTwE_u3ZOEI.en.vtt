00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 so people come back to gc back 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.540
 see you again and your seat 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.849
 I 'll be right in front of you 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.920
 military base or only in one with the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.480
 base because we would like for 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.910
 special and you may see it 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.199
 already a nozzle jet or even several 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.630
 So 200 is just there and what is 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.900
 because the gate is flying 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.279
 well transport helicopter very nice 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.730
 we need this intermediate step above 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.200
 to steal optimally would be a first 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.790
 flying object here are the helicopters I have 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.680
 to jump off a parachute and 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.430
 maybe the best would be too 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.649
 not wrong 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.719
 Once I managed to cloud and 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.280
 so nope that tried so it is not so 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.390
 is likely that the fire department 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:54.239
 to trot link or armor armored 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.329
 dare shortly comes then the 1 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.660
 no matter the linksys 31 now we have 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.980
 Get us now we must here and better 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.439
 to jump off because we have 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.990
 Watch out if we would go the base 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:13.290
 Of course, first and get them 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.220
 We will try and listen to them 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.700
 will of course try us 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.150
 shoot down with wonderful missiles yes 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.000
 so it looks like I'm really curious 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.770
 So I'm really a bit 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.220
 that is also what i could do 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.220
 really happy 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:45.819
 Let's go over there everything cool everything 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:50.170
 cool everything should then cool to small 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:56.549
 pull or untie yes yes yes yes 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.549
 good going 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:08.340
 Come on over quickly shoot me 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.799
 constant RÃ¶merstein now agreed 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.550
 to steal afra 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.550
 that was close 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.239
 No 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:45.730
 okay we did it and 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.730
 psychologist harms ok 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.000
 that was fine now okay 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.050
 take a deep breath first 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.240
 how was that now? 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.340
 exactly rocket 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.380
 a perfect 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.610
 OK 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.610
 we can of course rocket 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.680
 problematic come 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.710
 he will say we fly to that 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.430
 land must 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.430
 that is gone 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.300
 Perfect 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.450
 I'm happy that we made it 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.540
 Everything is cool 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.540
 something like that 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.219
 a low-flying that something like that on me 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.569
 let's think about that because it's natural 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.569
 not so easy to fly 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.340
 finally 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.380
 no matter 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.310
 we are here 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.360
 the bitkom 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:33.420
 that's really cool is cool as 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.420
 a lot of fun but you can 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.940
 really cool 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:50.350
 here a plane all locked much 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.509
 Radegund area 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:18.670
 That was our maximum for five years now 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:20.730
 we just stay down here and 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:25.090
 wait for everything cool 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:30.580
 one sees and soja has to be seen 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:38.500
 just think briefly i would say we 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:39.460
 get out of fun I thank you 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.350
 me for you and you do not have them 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.840
 seen so good but when I turn up 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:48.790
 they see us as that's stupid now 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.720
 We had to wait that often and I had 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:55.180
 let's go up, yes you are 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.440
 Honorable end , we would say thank you 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.060
 to see for me i believe says fun 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.920
 made and main thing often so much 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.600
 as clouds me is done it 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.620
 At the same time shoots if the animal finds the animal 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.920
 Zeppelin was awesome 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.920
 until then
