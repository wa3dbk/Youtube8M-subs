00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:22.140
 children and fairy tales of jacob and 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:25.869
 wilhelm grimm straw coal and bean 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.150
 a poor old man lived in a village 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.980
 Woman who had a court live 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.500
 brought together and wanted to cook them 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.510
 So she made a fire on her stove 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.970
 rightly so that's the faster 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.180
 burn it should lit it with a 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.640
 Hand full straw on as you put the beans in 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.250
 the pot shook him, she fell 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.800
 unnoticed one on the floor next to 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.579
 a straw came to rest 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.370
 soon after, a green coal sprang 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:58.210
 From the hearth to the two down there began the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.190
 straw and spoke dear friends 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.550
 you come from tubs 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.770
 the coal replied I'm alright 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.200
 luck had sprung from the fire and would have 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.660
 I did not enforce it that way 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.289
 was the death to me I certainly would ash 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.920
 burnt 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:16.659
 The bean said I'm still with 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.970
 heiler got away with it 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:24.210
 but the old one would have put me in the pot 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:28.360
 I would be without mercy 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.990
 Ready cooks wait like my camera 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.770
 I would be in a better fate 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.229
 The straw spoke to everyone 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.750
 my brothers have the old in fire and 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.200
 smoke up 60 she's up 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.670
 once packed and killed 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.159
 luckily I'm between her 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.320
 slipped through the fingers haha what 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.159
 but let's start now spoke the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.040
 coal mine i replied the bean 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.799
 because we die so happy timmer 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.860
 we have escaped as we want 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.110
 keeping good people together and doing so 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.070
 not a new misfortune here 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.810
 suffered and emigrated collectively 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.180
 move to a foreign country 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.579
 The proposal pleased the other two 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.560
 and they started each other 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.000
 path 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.550
 but soon they came to a small one 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.950
 brook or no bridge or he dies 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.090
 she did not have to go over like that 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.450
 should come 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.730
 the straw took good advice and spoke 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.040
 I want to get across so you can 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.730
 on me like on a bridge over 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.680
 go 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.890
 So the straw stretched out 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.230
 one bank to another and the coal to the other 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.350
 of heated nature was also tripping 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.210
 quite bold on the newly built bridge as 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.160
 but she had come into the middle and 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.210
 under your watery hiss, you heard 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.870
 you are scared 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.930
 she stopped and did not dare 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.650
 the straw continued but began to grow 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.080
 burn 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.080
 broke in two pieces and fell into the 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.970
 bach the coal slipped down as it hissed 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.870
 they came into the water and gave the spirit 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.820
 to which prudently yet bean 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.040
 had to stay behind on the shore 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.490
 could not laugh about the story 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:19.270
 stop and laugh so much that she 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.700
 now it was about her too 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.490
 if not for good luck 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.040
 schneider der wanderschaft was on 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.830
 Rested the brook because he was one 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.470
 he had a compassionate heart so he got needle 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.320
 and twist and sew them together 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.150
 the brune thanked him 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.310
 most beautiful 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.880
 but because he needed black thread 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.600
 would have 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.440
 So all the beans have a time side 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.440
 black seam
