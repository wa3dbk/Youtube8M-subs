00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
I'll talk about that in a second with

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.959 
I'll talk about that in a second with
the<00:00:41.870> Nvidia<00:00:42.320> experience<00:00:42.980> application<00:00:43.850> that

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
the Nvidia experience application that

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.360 
the Nvidia experience application that
they've<00:00:44.090> recently<00:00:44.510> launched<00:00:44.989> into<00:00:45.340> open<00:00:46.340> beta

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
they've recently launched into open beta

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.200 
they've recently launched into open beta
and<00:00:46.820> that<00:00:47.390> is<00:00:47.660> the<00:00:48.470> option<00:00:49.460> called<00:00:49.820> shadow

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
and that is the option called shadow

and that is the option called shadow
play<00:00:50.540> which<00:00:51.020> we'll<00:00:51.200> talk<00:00:51.230> about<00:00:51.380> in<00:00:51.560> just<00:00:51.680> a

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
play which we'll talk about in just a

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.530 
play which we'll talk about in just a
second<00:00:52.100> so<00:00:52.250> let<00:00:52.670> me<00:00:52.760> go<00:00:52.850> over<00:00:52.970> the<00:00:53.090> basics<00:00:53.390> of

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
second so let me go over the basics of

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.790 
second so let me go over the basics of
the<00:00:53.660> Nvidia<00:00:53.960> chill<00:00:54.200> if<00:00:54.320> you<00:00:54.410> don't<00:00:54.590> know<00:00:54.680> what

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
the Nvidia chill if you don't know what

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.470 
the Nvidia chill if you don't know what
it<00:00:54.860> is<00:00:54.950> essentially<00:00:55.430> allows<00:00:55.610> you<00:00:55.850> to<00:00:56.060> stream

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
it is essentially allows you to stream

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.170 
it is essentially allows you to stream
games<00:00:56.900> from<00:00:57.200> your<00:00:57.380> gaming<00:00:57.650> PC<00:00:58.190> over<00:00:59.030> your

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
games from your gaming PC over your

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.950 
games from your gaming PC over your
Wi-Fi<00:00:59.540> network<00:01:00.070> to<00:01:01.070> a<00:01:01.270> handheld<00:01:02.270> controller

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
Wi-Fi network to a handheld controller

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.719 
Wi-Fi network to a handheld controller
with<00:01:03.290> a<00:01:03.320> built-in<00:01:03.800> screen<00:01:04.100> that<00:01:04.369> runs<00:01:04.579> on

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
with a built-in screen that runs on

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.609 
with a built-in screen that runs on
Android<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:05.689> you<00:01:05.750> can<00:01:05.990> play<00:01:06.229> saying<00:01:06.500> like

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
Android so you can play saying like

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.469 
Android so you can play saying like
Skyrim<00:01:07.159> like<00:01:07.490> battlefield<00:01:08.090> something<00:01:08.360> like

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
Skyrim like battlefield something like

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.440 
Skyrim like battlefield something like
BioShock<00:01:08.990> Infinite<00:01:09.310> on<00:01:10.310> max<00:01:10.729> settings<00:01:10.850> at

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
BioShock Infinite on max settings at

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.600 
BioShock Infinite on max settings at
720p<00:01:12.049> you<00:01:12.380> can't<00:01:12.560> play<00:01:12.740> at<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:12.920> 1080p<00:01:13.250> because

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
720p you can't play at a 1080p because

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.630 
720p you can't play at a 1080p because
the<00:01:13.790> resolution<00:01:14.270> of<00:01:14.329> the<00:01:14.450> screen<00:01:14.570> is<00:01:14.840> 720p<00:01:15.320> and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
the resolution of the screen is 720p and

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.670 
the resolution of the screen is 720p and
stream<00:01:16.640> that<00:01:16.850> wirelessly<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:18.049> a<00:01:18.079> controller

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
stream that wirelessly to a controller

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.130 
stream that wirelessly to a controller
so<00:01:19.070> if<00:01:19.220> you<00:01:19.310> wanted<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:19.729> play<00:01:19.909> your<00:01:20.479> pc<00:01:20.870> games

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
so if you wanted to play your pc games

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.890 
so if you wanted to play your pc games
not<00:01:21.950> at<00:01:22.100> your<00:01:22.190> desk<00:01:22.250> not<00:01:22.970> wherever<00:01:23.270> your<00:01:23.479> pc<00:01:23.840> is

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
not at your desk not wherever your pc is

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.660 
not at your desk not wherever your pc is
located<00:01:24.350> but<00:01:24.409> somewhere<00:01:24.770> else<00:01:24.920> maybe<00:01:25.190> say<00:01:25.550> on

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
located but somewhere else maybe say on

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.730 
located but somewhere else maybe say on
the<00:01:25.760> porch<00:01:26.060> or<00:01:26.300> on<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.720> couch<00:01:26.900> or<00:01:27.229> in<00:01:27.260> bed<00:01:27.350> or

the porch or on the couch or in bed or

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.740 
the porch or on the couch or in bed or
something<00:01:27.830> like<00:01:28.010> that<00:01:28.390> it<00:01:29.390> would<00:01:29.540> allow<00:01:29.690> you

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
something like that it would allow you

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.180 
something like that it would allow you
to<00:01:29.840> do<00:01:29.900> that<00:01:30.049> and<00:01:30.200> it<00:01:30.290> does<00:01:30.409> it<00:01:30.530> extremely<00:01:30.979> well

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
to do that and it does it extremely well

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.250 
to do that and it does it extremely well
with<00:01:31.370> very<00:01:31.940> low<00:01:32.180> input<00:01:32.390> latency<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:32.990> i'll<00:01:33.110> put

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
with very low input latency and i'll put

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.890 
with very low input latency and i'll put
a<00:01:33.290> link<00:01:33.320> in<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.650> description<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.460> a<00:01:34.900> great

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
to push it back again which is kind of

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.590 
to push it back again which is kind of
frustrating<00:03:37.549> but<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.209> same<00:03:38.359> tie<00:03:38.540> is

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
frustrating but the same tie is

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.849 
frustrating but the same tie is
understandable<00:03:39.319> because<00:03:39.440> it<00:03:39.709> is<00:03:39.829> a

understandable because it is a

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.800 
understandable because it is a

completely new piece of technology and

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.379 
completely new piece of technology and
I'm<00:03:41.870> sure<00:03:42.109> they<00:03:42.650> had<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.579> push<00:03:43.790> out<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.060> Nvidia

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
I'm sure they had to push out the Nvidia

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:45.520 
I'm sure they had to push out the Nvidia
shield<00:03:44.450> first<00:03:44.989> because<00:03:45.200> they<00:03:45.319> had<00:03:45.410> already

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
shield first because they had already

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.069 
shield first because they had already
delayed<00:03:45.920> that<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.489> once<00:03:47.329> they<00:03:47.510> got<00:03:47.660> that<00:03:47.840> out

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
delayed that and once they got that out

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.170 
delayed that and once they got that out
now<00:03:48.500> there<00:03:48.709> are<00:03:48.799> we<00:03:48.920> starting<00:03:49.280> to<00:03:49.370> work<00:03:49.609> quite

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
now there are we starting to work quite

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.599 
now there are we starting to work quite

option<00:04:59.030> comes<00:04:59.180> out<00:04:59.419> hopefully<00:05:00.020> it's<00:05:00.289> good

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
option comes out hopefully it's good

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.830 
option comes out hopefully it's good
hopefully<00:05:01.280> it's<00:05:01.430> not<00:05:01.610> too<00:05:01.940> buggy<00:05:02.330> at<00:05:02.570> first

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
hopefully it's not too buggy at first

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.600 
hopefully it's not too buggy at first
and<00:05:03.110> hopefully<00:05:03.590> it<00:05:03.830> has<00:05:03.919> a<00:05:03.949> lot<00:05:04.160> of<00:05:04.190> options

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
and hopefully it has a lot of options

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.590 
and hopefully it has a lot of options
for<00:05:04.910> things<00:05:05.240> like<00:05:05.389> audio<00:05:07.030> inputs<00:05:08.030> and<00:05:08.210> outputs

for things like audio inputs and outputs

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.680 
for things like audio inputs and outputs
as<00:05:08.810> well<00:05:09.350> as<00:05:09.620> resolutions<00:05:10.550> and<00:05:10.850> frame<00:05:11.060> rates

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
and things along those lines but it's

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.469 
and things along those lines but it's
