00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.770
 gta5 game world game that blew the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.179
 the most awaited game of the 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.370
 history of mankind 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.170
 and this is the man on the tv that goes 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.240
 come to a verdict that we play 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.910
 ladies of the game without game time more 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.220
 expected of the year and that yes 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.230
 expectations that rockstar created the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.480
 What did you think of the base? 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.640
 with the ladies of the ladies marathon 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.609
 I waged war on the dawn shift and the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.199
 girls geeks and yes the game the game of the year 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.250
 the game of life the ideal game for 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.260
 whole family 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.510
 the Olhanense is for everyone but let's 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.399
 start talking about the expectations of the game 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.910
 at the time the rockstar built in his 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.610
 reputation an almost real expectation 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.440
 yes, because she only plays then I play 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.239
 from the games of the ancient titles that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.989
 she did not only of her generation but of 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.820
 other 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.010
 we just wait for rockstar to do the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.980
 best game of the year every month and 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.440
 now see that as GTA5 said concluded 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.120
 Yes, the whole expectation and we spoke 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.809
 several times during the marathon 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.510
 Following 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.630
 the rockstar april generation with gta 4 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.930
 talking looks only the xbox 360 and ps3 are 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.470
 able to do this and now throughout the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.540
 world 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.270
 It's amazing what she was doing now. 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.820
 got gta5 said galera let's finish 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.350
 this generation with the player 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.600
 their expectation was even greater 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.380
 because the launch interval of this 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.540
 gta was made 15 years and others you to 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.520
 general who was accustomed to a 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.759
 interval of two years is not that then 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.020
 I think everyone is now and it's good 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.790
 I think we could remember the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.710
 the best times we saw in this 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.040
 game I like very active in 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.600
 He found them building the right with three 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.790
 characters the construction of this narrative 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.979
 very good that you normally 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.810
 people erect a character just so one 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.240
 character can not only develop 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.570
 right he has a bad bow is the most 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.500
 common law and develops past law 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.540
 such a rockstar was there caught 3 gow3 hand 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.850
 said the second goal and this guy is fucking 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.399
 NATO now the only frank development 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.960
 we who can face 11 and are truce 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.000
 what can the tremor 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.790
 You want to play with the three time 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.090
 whole knows you've created three characters 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.970
 postage 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.890
 a narrative that crosses what you 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.750
 can follow one followed another exchange 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.290
 any time almost any time 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.569
 Is this gta5 for me more than gta 4? 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.610
 he gave me the feeling of being a gta 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:33.129
 a street gta knows the gta decades 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.290
 in that gp here is more holds a has more 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.989
 do you have more of san andrÃ©s? 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.819
 and there's more gt to 3 so he's more 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.500
 Open world and it's more for you. 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.379
 he is more focused on gameplay in 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.480
 missions than in history itself 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.079
 which is very good but he knows 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.090
 you 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.180
 ovals the avai will do what you 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.000
 want to go play will be happier and 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.860
 you let what was your face was is 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.500
 a striking moment 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.379
 Look at the moment you got to steal the 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.200
 ong finally because it took so long 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.959
 It's how I stayed I got very attached 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.540
 the face-to-face is not to see that he is the 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.069
 more insane has a moment of play that the 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.250
 trevor he wakes up with a dress 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.549
 absurdly short in the middle of the 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:22.359
 Then the erick descended the rolling mountain. 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:24.819
 kind of wonderful game he wakes up with 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.859
 strange people in his bed he wakes up 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.500
 removing the face from inside of a stack 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:32.139
 of disgusting dirty dishes and type these 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.760
 little touches that rockstar gave to 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.430
 these characters to leave are 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.440
 the only thing that was was sensational is because 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.840
 has a whole character construction 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.849
 these transitions are not the best 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.090
 missions for you want to be a task 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.489
 hard right is a chest spoke choose a 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.410
 that a mission that I enjoyed was 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.510
 the mission of the two planes I used two 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.359
 planes with trevor you take a single engine 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.120
 and then you have to fly low over the 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.889
 city for the military radar does not catch you 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.019
 The beginning that is flying you have to 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:05.200
 look a bong you when you arrive 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.880
 near him you have to get into it and there 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.060
 When you enter it you have to 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.090
 control the boeing after controlling the 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.700
 Tram comes handy fighters to take the 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.010
 battery that you can not reach in the 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.630
 destination and you have to play boeing 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.210
 to leave parachute 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.670
 ego is very crazy very one of the best 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.620
 chances I had was so you go to a 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.710
 What I found most cool was the 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.530
 submarine already had to catch is the 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.230
 bob that cup ram steal the bob car 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.960
 dylan military base robocar gobbi catch the 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.150
 cargo bob hook on submarine 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.790
 I think the submarine submarine games 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.560
 then comes back after bob games 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.050
 submarine on top of a truck and 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.820
 directs the way and in that which is also the 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.470
 so cool from gt is so you go 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.190
 alternating the characters in the middle of the 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.170
 emission and then only emotion not if I liked it 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.240
 I think it was the first mission 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.210
 you can control the three 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.850
 characters exchanging alternating them that 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.110
 was the mission of our rescue mission 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:11.140
 It's a guy who's stuck inside the 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:12.700
 iof building and rfb of them you have 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.640
 what to do with helicopters three 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.690
 helicopters do not have two in the helicopter 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.340
 You have to stop in front of a building and 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.580
 online or down is the job is 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.700
 riding the maicon descends from abseiling 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.190
 You will descend from rappel and you will history 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.260
 the glass catches the face 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.270
 Pull back and then you have to give 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.520
 franklin snipper cover that 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.120
 There's another difficult one, you'll understand. 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.170
 that 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.840
 and another thing that is very worthwhile 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:45.430
 We are easter eggs and fuchs delivered to 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:48.190
 ass is rockstar also made his name 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.660
 based on that or little things 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.640
 hidden for you to look for people 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.660
 found several of them is a flying saucer 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.660
 sunken 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.880
 has a frozen there has the big foot has 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.280
 Ghost Girl Ghost With It All 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.050
 world the ghost boy I think the 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.420
 more cool and in the middle of all this 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.480
 narrative of all this of this immensity 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:10.390
 that gta 5 has some bugs this is almost 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.640
 unavoidable let's say a map of that size 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.400
 from an open book that yes a map 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.520
 this size is almost impossible for you 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.470
 not having problems but only for girls but 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.870
 it's only mines it's the collision problems 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.310
 here there is no place to lean 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.310
 explained 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.600
 the wall is a stone stood alone at 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.520
 face your face 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.310
 a country and will hit the guy crosses 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.350
 it is a collision problems if 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.620
 these problems will happen in 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:41.680
 several games will have a point of this 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.190
 it does not disrupt the game experience 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.320
 huh 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.600
 you can not he can not disturb 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.000
 a mission knows it can not be disturbed 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.710
 an easter egg you'll find this 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.540
 this does not happen in gta all 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.520
 missions I did I had a problem 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.640
 had a business that we found 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.920
 It was foggy that it was good that we 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:04.750
 is trying to blow up a tower with 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:09.370
 works and pegÃµes is a natural means 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:11.170
 people went there good pilot towards not 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.200
 was a bath was already having a jet is a 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:17.830
 pilot jatinho already had direction o tower 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:21.220
 is and jumped from parachute where it stops 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.210
 and a jetliner stopped and crashed as well as 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.180
 frozen in the air 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.760
 good but this is ours is this was ours 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.650
 gta5 verdict a game that not only is 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.060
 important for gamers 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.800
 but it is important for the industry 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.480
 entertainment as all yes was a 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.190
 game that more for a product of 

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.400
 entertainment that has 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:42.580
 money over a period of time in a 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.410
 day to 800 million dollars and more 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.680
