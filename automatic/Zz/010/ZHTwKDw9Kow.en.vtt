vehicles<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.600> could<00:02:03.689> be<00:02:03.840> more<00:02:03.990> than<00:02:04.170> four

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
vehicles that could be more than four

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.780

but<00:02:04.799> as<00:02:04.890> all<00:02:05.040> right<00:02:05.189> now<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.399> could<00:02:05.579> do<00:02:05.670> this

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
but as all right now we could do this

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.580 
but as all right now we could do this
for<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> first<00:02:06.450> one<00:02:06.630> says<00:02:06.899> grab<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.350> stick

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
for so the first one says grab the stick

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.190 
for so the first one says grab the stick
of<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.799> fast<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.369> nimble<00:02:08.640> Western<00:02:09.450> beads<00:02:10.020> are

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
of the fast and nimble Western beads are

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.530 
of the fast and nimble Western beads are
our<00:02:10.289> training<00:02:10.739> jet<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.160> push<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:11.910> edge

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
our training jet and push it to the edge

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.089 
our training jet and push it to the edge
of<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.840> envelopes<00:02:13.319> that<00:02:13.439> pretty<00:02:13.739> much<00:02:13.920> means

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
of the envelopes that pretty much means

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.759 
of the envelopes that pretty much means
we<00:02:14.549> have<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.879> new<00:02:15.120> training<00:02:15.659> jet<00:02:16.049> most<00:02:16.469> likely

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
we have a new training jet most likely

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.009 
we have a new training jet most likely
won't<00:02:16.950> be<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.099> fast<00:02:17.519> one<00:02:17.849> but<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.390> guess<00:02:18.719> it<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:18.989> a

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
won't be a fast one but I guess it is a

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.209 
won't be a fast one but I guess it is a
jet<00:02:19.319> so<00:02:19.469> I<00:02:19.500> guess<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.709> means<00:02:19.920> it's<00:02:20.010> going<00:02:20.129> to

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
jet so I guess that means it's going to

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.099 
jet so I guess that means it's going to
be<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.579> some<00:02:20.819> decent<00:02:21.239> speed<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:21.750> next<00:02:21.900> when

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
be of some decent speed so the next when

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:23.899 
be of some decent speed so the next when
they<00:02:22.200> spend<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.620> short<00:02:22.829> leave<00:02:23.280> buzzing<00:02:23.819> the

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
they spend a short leave buzzing the

they spend a short leave buzzing the
