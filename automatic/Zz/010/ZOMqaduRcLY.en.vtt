00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
so this is the X FX screen sorry I don't

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.890 
so this is the X FX screen sorry I don't
have<00:00:35.840> my<00:00:35.960> tripod<00:00:36.500> around<00:00:37.390> so<00:00:38.390> it's<00:00:38.629> going<00:00:38.809> to

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
have my tripod around so it's going to

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.210 
have my tripod around so it's going to
be<00:00:39.050> a<00:00:39.080> little<00:00:39.410> bit<00:00:39.739> shaky<00:00:42.160> go<00:00:43.160> to<00:00:43.220> the<00:00:43.370> layout

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
be a little bit shaky go to the layout

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:52.799 
be a little bit shaky go to the layout
the<00:00:46.220> first<00:00:46.519> drive<00:00:46.760> is<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.210> FET<00:00:48.430> boost

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.470 

and<00:00:53.260> we<00:00:53.410> have<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.730> sd1<00:00:55.649> drive<00:00:56.649> model<00:00:57.269> this<00:00:58.269> is

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
and we have the sd1 drive model this is

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.150 
and we have the sd1 drive model this is
the<00:00:58.510> triad<00:00:59.050> which<00:00:59.289> I<00:00:59.440> always<00:00:59.769> have<00:01:00.010> in<00:01:00.100> the

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
the triad which I always have in the

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.819 
the triad which I always have in the
loop<00:01:00.340> but<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:01.600> very<00:01:01.870> subtle<00:01:02.199> it<00:01:02.469> doesn't

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
loop but it's very subtle it doesn't

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.469 
loop but it's very subtle it doesn't
it's<00:01:03.370> not<00:01:03.430> key<00:01:03.760> to<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.000> tone<00:01:04.530> got<00:01:05.530> your<00:01:05.680> amp

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
it's not key to the tone got your amp

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.700 
it's not key to the tone got your amp
get<00:01:07.479> your<00:01:07.659> cab<00:01:07.869> I<00:01:09.509> use<00:01:10.509> this<00:01:10.659> filter<00:01:11.050> block<00:01:11.440> as

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
get your cab I use this filter block as

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.420 
get your cab I use this filter block as
a<00:01:12.460> volume<00:01:13.060> decrease<00:01:13.570> during<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.200> shimmer<00:01:14.500> at

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
a volume decrease during the shimmer at

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.820 
a volume decrease during the shimmer at
the<00:01:15.549> beginning<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.420> shimmer<00:01:16.720> with<00:01:17.170> driver<00:01:17.590> is

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
the beginning the shimmer with driver is

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.749 
the beginning the shimmer with driver is
pretty<00:01:18.100> loud<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:20.049> I<00:01:20.619> have<00:01:20.860> to<00:01:20.979> balance<00:01:21.190> out<00:01:21.580> the

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
pretty loud so I have to balance out the

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.480 
pretty loud so I have to balance out the
levels<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.330> I<00:01:22.630> do<00:01:22.690> that<00:01:22.990> by<00:01:23.290> turning<00:01:24.190> on<00:01:24.460> a

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
levels and I do that by turning on a

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.029 
levels and I do that by turning on a
filter<00:01:24.850> at<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.119> beginning<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:26.860> when<00:01:27.009> I

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
filter at the beginning and then when I

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.950 
filter at the beginning and then when I
go<00:01:27.250> into<00:01:27.399> the<00:01:27.550> main<00:01:27.759> riff<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.330> turn<00:01:28.600> off<00:01:28.750> the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
go into the main riff I turn off the

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.899 
go into the main riff I turn off the
filter<00:01:30.149> main<00:01:31.149> path<00:01:31.509> goes<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.869> a<00:01:32.140> delay<00:01:32.470> and

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
filter main path goes to a delay and

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.899 
filter main path goes to a delay and
then<00:01:33.909> reverb<00:01:34.330> and<00:01:34.869> then<00:01:35.140> out<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:36.490> then<00:01:36.789> this

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
then reverb and then out and then this

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.139 
then reverb and then out and then this
is<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:37.390> shimmer<00:01:37.659> path<00:01:37.990> right<00:01:38.409> here<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.850> goes

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
is the shimmer path right here it goes

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.930 
is the shimmer path right here it goes
to<00:01:40.479> the<00:01:40.509> multi<00:01:40.960> delay<00:01:41.409> unit<00:01:41.649> a<00:01:41.979> filter<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.789> get

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
to the multi delay unit a filter to get

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.149 
to the multi delay unit a filter to get
out<00:01:43.090> some<00:01:43.390> of<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.539> highs<00:01:44.130> basically<00:01:45.130> a

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
out some of the highs basically a

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.469 
out some of the highs basically a
low-pass<00:01:45.580> filter<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.500> reverb<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:49.119> let's<00:01:49.330> go

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
low-pass filter and reverb so let's go

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.169 
low-pass filter and reverb so let's go
through<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.750> details<00:01:50.170> of<00:01:50.380> those<00:01:50.619> I<00:01:51.090> didn't<00:01:52.090> I

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
through the details of those I didn't I

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:53.820 
through the details of those I didn't I
don't<00:01:52.270> even<00:01:52.479> think<00:01:52.720> I<00:01:52.810> used<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.140> FET<00:01:53.350> Drive<00:01:53.619> on

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
don't even think I used the FET Drive on

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.330 
don't even think I used the FET Drive on
the<00:01:54.000> cover<00:01:55.000> but<00:01:55.560> ideally<00:01:56.560> I<00:01:56.740> would<00:01:56.890> have<00:01:57.130> this

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
the cover but ideally I would have this

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:05.500 
the cover but ideally I would have this
FET<00:01:57.640> boost<00:01:57.939> in<00:01:58.210> here

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:13.650 

just<00:02:06.200> using<00:02:06.530> it<00:02:06.620> as<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.740> boost

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.130 

let's<00:02:13.930> go<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:15.240> sd1<00:02:16.240> drive<00:02:16.660> model

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.910 

this<00:02:20.710> is<00:02:20.860> key<00:02:21.069> to<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.310> tone<00:02:22.500> there's<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.560> super

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
this is key to the tone there's a super

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.770 
this is key to the tone there's a super
overdrive<00:02:24.810> drive<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:25.959> for<00:02:26.280> tone<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.780> just

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
overdrive drive it for tone it just

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.900 
overdrive drive it for tone it just
under<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.140> half<00:02:29.800> way<00:02:30.990> level<00:02:31.990> there<00:02:32.700> mix<00:02:33.700> I

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
under a half way level there mix I

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.250 
under a half way level there mix I
actually<00:02:34.060> brought<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.540> mix<00:02:34.750> down<00:02:34.900> just<00:02:35.170> a

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
actually brought the mix down just a

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.800 
actually brought the mix down just a
little<00:02:35.290> bit<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.950> kind<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:36.910> let<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.150> clean<00:02:37.420> come

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
little bit to kind of let the clean come

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.480 
little bit to kind of let the clean come
through<00:02:38.050> just<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.440> little<00:02:38.470> bit<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:38.980> sharpen<00:02:39.340> it

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.420 

and<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:44.290> get<00:02:44.440> out<00:02:44.560> those<00:02:44.770> bring<00:02:45.010> those<00:02:45.160> mitts

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
and to get out those bring those mitts

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.090 
and to get out those bring those mitts
together<00:02:45.640> on<00:02:46.570> page<00:02:46.930> two<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.230> can<00:02:47.590> adjust<00:02:47.920> the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
together on page two you can adjust the

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.000 
together on page two you can adjust the
high<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.459> low<00:02:48.580> cut<00:02:48.820> so<00:02:49.350> sixty<00:02:50.350> five<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.860> five

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
high and low cut so sixty five and five

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.320 
high and low cut so sixty five and five
thousand<00:02:51.550> I<00:02:51.610> was<00:02:51.700> giving<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.180> nice

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
thousand I was giving it a nice

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.420 
thousand I was giving it a nice
mid-range<00:02:53.250> kind<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.340> wha<00:02:54.550> like<00:02:54.850> punch<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.720> it

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
mid-range kind of wha like punch to it

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.860 
mid-range kind of wha like punch to it
clip<00:02:57.430> type<00:02:57.670> is<00:02:57.850> hard<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.390> was<00:02:58.510> giving<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.810> a

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
clip type is hard I was giving it a

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.380 
clip type is hard I was giving it a
little<00:02:59.019> more<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.410> a<00:02:59.610> just<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.760> one<00:03:00.910> that<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:01.090> I

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
little more of a just the one that I I

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.000 
little more of a just the one that I I
went<00:03:01.870> through<00:03:02.050> them<00:03:02.170> all<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.410> I<00:03:02.440> just<00:03:02.800> like

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
went through them all and I just like

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:10.470 
went through them all and I just like
that<00:03:03.220> one<00:03:03.370> best<00:03:08.430> EQ<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.489> punched<00:03:10.000> up<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.269> mids

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
that one best EQ I punched up the mids

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.640 
that one best EQ I punched up the mids
just<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.810> little<00:03:11.019> bit<00:03:11.140> here<00:03:13.320> trap<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:14.470> just

just a little bit here trap I just

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:24.180 
just a little bit here trap I just
dropped<00:03:14.890> just<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.310> little

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.440 

and<00:03:24.580> that's<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.060> drive

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.030 

I<00:03:27.480> think<00:03:27.840> I've<00:03:27.990> gone<00:03:28.170> through<00:03:28.230> my<00:03:28.500> amp<00:03:28.680> model

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
I think I've gone through my amp model

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:49.530 
I think I've gone through my amp model
before<00:03:29.190> let's<00:03:29.760> do<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.120> quickly<00:03:30.360> a<00:03:32.720> boost

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.440

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
master up on the axe-fx this is key to

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.509 
master up on the axe-fx this is key to
the<00:03:52.540> tone<00:03:52.780> when<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:53.590> crank<00:03:53.829> that<00:03:54.010> master<00:03:54.400> all

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
the tone when it crank that master all

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.009 
the tone when it crank that master all
the<00:03:54.640> way<00:03:54.760> up<00:03:54.969> and<00:03:55.239> if<00:03:55.299> your<00:03:55.450> volume<00:03:55.810> is<00:03:55.900> too

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
the way up and if your volume is too

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.929 
the way up and if your volume is too
loud<00:03:56.170> just<00:03:56.500> bring<00:03:57.189> the<00:03:57.310> vowel<00:03:57.489> at<00:03:57.579> the<00:03:57.700> level

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:57.939 
loud just bring the vowel at the level

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.110 
loud just bring the vowel at the level
down<00:03:58.230> so<00:03:59.230> I<00:03:59.260> just<00:03:59.560> brought<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.859> level<00:04:00.040> down<00:04:00.310> 6

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
down so I just brought the level down 6

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.270 
down so I just brought the level down 6
DB<00:04:01.420> to<00:04:01.659> make<00:04:01.810> sure<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:02.019> doesn't<00:04:02.200> clip<00:04:02.530> but<00:04:03.159> to

way up and then you saw over here the

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.530 
way up and then you saw over here the
drive<00:04:08.769> is<00:04:09.280> just<00:04:09.670> at<00:04:09.790> 3<00:04:10.000> 7

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
drive is just at 3 7

roughly

00:04:32.269 --> 00:04:32.279 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:34.149
