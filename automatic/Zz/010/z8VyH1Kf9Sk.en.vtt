let's talk about saltwater chlorination

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.349 
let's talk about saltwater chlorination
that's<00:00:25.160> a<00:00:25.250> really<00:00:25.490> popular<00:00:25.670> option<00:00:26.240> that's

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
that's a really popular option that's

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.580 
that's a really popular option that's
come<00:00:26.539> out<00:00:26.689> of<00:00:26.750> the<00:00:26.900> gate<00:00:27.050> with<00:00:27.199> that<00:00:27.230> one

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
come out of the gate with that one

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.470 
come out of the gate with that one
there's<00:00:27.980> a<00:00:28.039> misconception<00:00:28.640> about<00:00:28.880> saltwater

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
there's a misconception about saltwater

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.570 
there's a misconception about saltwater
pools<00:00:29.840> and<00:00:30.109> the<00:00:30.590> misconception<00:00:31.400> is<00:00:31.550> that

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
pools and the misconception is that

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.430 
pools and the misconception is that
people<00:00:32.059> think<00:00:32.239> that<00:00:32.360> number<00:00:32.750> one<00:00:32.780> that<00:00:33.290> is

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
people think that number one that is

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.020 
people think that number one that is
going<00:00:33.530> to<00:00:33.620> taste<00:00:33.830> like<00:00:33.949> the<00:00:34.190> ocean<00:00:34.220> and<00:00:34.640> it's

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
going to taste like the ocean and it's

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.660 
going to taste like the ocean and it's
okay<00:00:35.300> it's<00:00:35.660> only<00:00:35.840> 1/10<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.530> salinity<00:00:36.829> a<00:00:37.219> stood

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
okay it's only 1/10 the salinity a stood

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.370 
okay it's only 1/10 the salinity a stood
out<00:00:37.760> like<00:00:37.940> Visine<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:38.809> in<00:00:38.870> my<00:00:39.020> pool<00:00:39.230> I<00:00:39.350> can

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
out like Visine and in my pool I can

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.740 
out like Visine and in my pool I can
really<00:00:39.860> barely<00:00:40.489> taste<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.149> so<00:00:41.420> you<00:00:41.510> can<00:00:41.600> taste

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
really barely taste it so you can taste

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.170 
really barely taste it so you can taste
it<00:00:41.899> but<00:00:41.960> just<00:00:42.170> a<00:00:42.290> little<00:00:42.379> bit<00:00:42.760> assumed<00:00:43.760> I<00:00:44.030> knew

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
it but just a little bit assumed I knew

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.760 
it but just a little bit assumed I knew
that<00:00:44.420> if<00:00:44.540> someone<00:00:44.840> was<00:00:44.930> in<00:00:45.050> my<00:00:45.200> pool<00:00:45.440> they

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
that if someone was in my pool they

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.350 
that if someone was in my pool they
probably<00:00:46.010> wouldn't<00:00:46.309> recognize<00:00:46.640> that<00:00:47.059> it<00:00:47.210> was

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
probably wouldn't recognize that it was

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.510 
probably wouldn't recognize that it was
salt<00:00:47.600> interesting<00:00:48.260> oh<00:00:48.350> that's<00:00:48.950> one<00:00:49.250> thing

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
salt interesting oh that's one thing

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.310 
salt interesting oh that's one thing
number<00:00:49.910> two<00:00:50.120> people<00:00:50.570> say<00:00:50.870> well<00:00:51.020> I<00:00:51.050> definitely

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
number two people say well I definitely

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.560 
number two people say well I definitely
don't<00:00:51.559> want<00:00:51.829> chlorine<00:00:52.160> in<00:00:52.309> my<00:00:52.430> pool<00:00:52.670> and<00:00:52.910> I'm

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
don't want chlorine in my pool and I'm

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.060 
don't want chlorine in my pool and I'm
allergic<00:00:53.780> to<00:00:53.989> chlorine<00:00:54.230> well<00:00:54.949> you're

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
allergic to chlorine well you're

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.740 
allergic to chlorine well you're
probably<00:00:55.250> allergic<00:00:55.760> to<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:55.969> byproducts<00:00:56.629> of

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
probably allergic to the byproducts of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.720 
probably allergic to the byproducts of
chlorine<00:00:57.110> not<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.590> chlorine<00:00:57.920> itself<00:00:58.430> right

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
chlorine not to chlorine itself right

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.700 
chlorine not to chlorine itself right
because<00:00:59.180> salt<00:00:59.480> generates<00:01:00.050> a<00:01:00.170> chlorine<00:01:00.440> gas

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
because salt generates a chlorine gas

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.430 
because salt generates a chlorine gas
and<00:01:01.070> that<00:01:01.699> gas<00:01:01.760> is<00:01:02.390> injected<00:01:02.570> into<00:01:03.020> the<00:01:03.230> water

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
and that gas is injected into the water

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.560 
and that gas is injected into the water
and<00:01:03.680> that's<00:01:03.800> what<00:01:03.949> sanitizes<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.699> pool<00:01:05.030> can't

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
and that's what sanitizes the pool can't

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.719 
and that's what sanitizes the pool can't
taste<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:06.080> can't<00:01:06.410> smell<00:01:06.680> it<00:01:06.710> can't<00:01:07.160> see<00:01:07.430> it<00:01:07.549> you

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
taste it can't smell it can't see it you

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.910 
taste it can't smell it can't see it you
can't<00:01:07.760> feel<00:01:08.180> it<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:08.840> that's<00:01:09.350> really<00:01:09.470> how<00:01:09.890> it

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
can't feel it so that's really how it

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.500 
can't feel it so that's really how it
works<00:01:10.159> and<00:01:10.310> you<00:01:10.369> don't<00:01:10.580> end<00:01:10.729> up<00:01:10.820> with<00:01:11.000> any<00:01:11.180> core

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
works and you don't end up with any core

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.450 
works and you don't end up with any core
mines<00:01:11.780> because<00:01:12.260> of<00:01:12.439> it<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:12.740> what<00:01:13.340> you're

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
mines because of it so what you're

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.859 
mines because of it so what you're
saying<00:01:13.700> is<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:13.880> saltwater<00:01:14.240> pool<00:01:14.630> is<00:01:14.780> still

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
saying is a saltwater pool is still

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.219 
saying is a saltwater pool is still
actually<00:01:15.350> a<00:01:15.380> chlorine<00:01:15.740> pool<00:01:15.890> it<00:01:16.460> is<00:01:16.909> it<00:01:17.869> yes

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
actually a chlorine pool it is it yes

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.510 
actually a chlorine pool it is it yes
basically<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:18.830> is<00:01:18.920> it's<00:01:19.130> putting<00:01:19.310> chlorine

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
basically it is it's putting chlorine

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.640 
basically it is it's putting chlorine
into<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.119> pool<00:01:20.330> just<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:21.020> don't<00:01:21.229> feel<00:01:21.470> it

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
into the pool just you don't feel it

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.840 
into the pool just you don't feel it
taste<00:01:21.860> it<00:01:22.040> or<00:01:22.130> smell<00:01:22.189> it<00:01:22.430> there's<00:01:22.700> no

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
taste it or smell it there's no

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.730 
taste it or smell it there's no
by-product<00:01:23.509> so<00:01:23.570> it's<00:01:23.689> more<00:01:23.810> natural<00:01:24.259> so<00:01:24.560> it's

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
by-product so it's more natural so it's

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.100 
by-product so it's more natural so it's
a<00:01:25.070> better<00:01:25.610> version<00:01:26.270> of<00:01:26.509> a<00:01:26.630> chlorine<00:01:26.960> pool

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
a better version of a chlorine pool

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.990 
a better version of a chlorine pool
where<00:01:27.320> there's<00:01:27.470> none<00:01:27.680> of<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:27.860> negative<00:01:28.310> side

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
where there's none of the negative side

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.219 
where there's none of the negative side
effects<00:01:29.360> that<00:01:29.450> people<00:01:29.750> associate<00:01:30.170> with

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
effects that people associate with

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.289 
effects that people associate with
chlorine<00:01:30.680> exactly<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:31.700> don't<00:01:31.790> have<00:01:31.970> any<00:01:32.180> of

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
chlorine exactly you don't have any of

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.819 
chlorine exactly you don't have any of
the<00:01:32.390> side<00:01:32.630> effects<00:01:33.079> it's<00:01:33.200> all<00:01:33.320> of<00:01:33.409> a<00:01:33.470> sudden

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
the side effects it's all of a sudden

you have a pure chloride in the pool

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.600 
you have a pure chloride in the pool

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
another misconception is salts going to

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.790 
another misconception is salts going to
save<00:03:04.340> me<00:03:04.520> a<00:03:04.550> ton<00:03:04.850> of<00:03:04.910> money<00:03:05.120> so<00:03:05.420> I<00:03:06.140> can<00:03:06.470> save<00:03:06.680> you

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
save me a ton of money so I can save you
