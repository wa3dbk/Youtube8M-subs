00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.410
 Zircon's new Photoshop tutorials today the Euro is showing how we look 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.429
 create the classic Mac OS x Leopard Ex 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.990
 and we found that one and open photo varieties 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:20.369
 we have off 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.890
 and then could open over a background 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.849
 or and create a background yourself 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.749
 I take aim of this classic and Mac OS X will be in the reason today 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.460
 and 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.210
 So far that would be it for now 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.610
 As a next step, go for our textures 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.290
 and write more retro with the font 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.680
 with the style Bolt 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.530
 so concerns 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.530
 and the colors black 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.240
 as normal a big piece 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.540
 in guess and then you can sometimes with Copenhagen or control KEB 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.000
 the whole transform but hold Shift so that the proportions 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 stay the same 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.670
 yes I think so okay 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.950
 the ORF on the hook and 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.980
 then we have the kes here 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.210
 but in this text doctors are hiding many effects 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.070
 The first will now be done first by this level 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.520
 and handle the full out about Lara main camp 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.520
 and then we come here a leading road 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.460
 at angle give minus 90 degrees 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.190
 so he has black samples and that knows below 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.030
 the opacity we go up 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.110
 ten percent 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.320
 and 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.920
 the war then 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.960
 in the case 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.039
 we can also at YB 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.350
 the power up 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.460
 20 go 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.870
 can at 30 o'clock TuS you have to see for yourself 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.650
 because the rounds of fine Raich only the Fabio remains wet up 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.459
 and we want her down dark gray or I just have to decide 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.459
 Exactly 22 I think that's okay 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.279
 next to peace and its contours too 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.409
 there we have to continue Füllhardt just go on course 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:26.509
 and specify the angle one hundred and seventy-eight 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.529
 we come here 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:30.959
 lovely 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.549
 a nice overlays 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.909
 and Georg Misel Winkel 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.759
 choose and then you see here 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:42.349
 we have a really nice rounding off here 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.620
 that fits perfectly with the one he was with and with this line 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.109
 and I think that's okay 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.899
 in the case up 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:54.309
 Amrum Amrum Games can find the third point around here 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.709
 May adopted double-click on the color 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.809
 and do that in one 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:03.649
 yes in such a sad about 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:06.649
 and this white dot also darkens a bit 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.989
 about shopping like this 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.590
 the first sets Boonen we confirm the whole with okay 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:20.139
 March okay with her and then dar 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.289
 Océ next 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:25.379
 we see in this original here this the Letzigrund 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.099
 make the manufacturing Indiana and to a new level 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.659
 the purchase the 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.789
 Character piecework back 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:38.249
 and there he could let the templates by the way but I'll do it now 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:39.819
 let's go 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.239
 wet North so and we click once 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.849
 here about at the height of this one 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.429
 Brandt here 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:51.609
 then pretty much the rounds in half of the biscuit 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.029
 keep pushing China so a bit 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:56.159
 Schrage 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.999
 and then come here a few more times 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:00.909
 and join the whole selection 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.829
 then make a right click 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.819
 Create selection 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.190
 but only Bates only texts 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.639
 Rottenburg Latvians and okay 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.639
 if we filled that up now 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:18.430
 then there would be a catastrophe and if he background, too 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.509
 White 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.909
 but we do not want that because of that we keep coma and old and shift 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:23.749
 depressed 

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:26.749
 and then click on the text here 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.969
 and we see the selection has now adapted the text here and kids or 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:36.430
 to have friends 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.099
 because the more on our early tool 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.639
 while 1 before and I know and just feel 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:46.330
 they are like first now 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.409
 but it does not go that well yet 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.079
 We can except that you spend with Koman or control 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.199
 and then the craften ends up playing around 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.050
 I would suggest so 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.439
 65 66 like that 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.710
 it must be okay 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.749
 next 

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:11.080
 we need up here 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.319
 still this black racer 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.439
 that and that 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:19.520
 make the Cologne court a of etchings 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.110
 neither was it annetwork for Fun to Write the Honey 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.089
 Year 500 texts 

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:30.810
 click on one-time above 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.810
 and surgeons Lochmahr 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.379
 then it would actually be ready 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.919
 CDs here this 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:41.620
 fat with ours 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.009
 At present, tools still ripen rounding up 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.120
 he could do that to me 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.290
 draw and 2 but think that Munich will be so Kay if we have this time 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.349
 look at 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:57.499
 and hardly into the water 

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:00.219
 I already have a lot of similarity 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.009
 Here also the animals could 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.849
 edit this transition but that they are not so hard 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:08.860
 that's why it's supposed to be okay 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.139
 yes, have fun trying it out 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.419
 as I said, try here 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.439
 This one made something rounder 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:21.189
 and then I just saw please subscribe bit Mesic Jung v
