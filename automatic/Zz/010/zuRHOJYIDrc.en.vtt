00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
the button panels and whatever all right

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.670 
the button panels and whatever all right
so<00:00:26.670> here's<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.840> case<00:00:28.019> itself

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
so here's the case itself

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.010 
so here's the case itself

well now if you're like me you're gonna
get<00:00:49.740> a<00:00:49.800> new<00:00:49.980> case<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:51.620> you<00:00:52.620> decide<00:00:52.950> on

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
get a new case and if you decide on

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.290 
get a new case and if you decide on
getting<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.430> CPU<00:00:53.910> cooler<00:00:54.920> or<00:00:55.920> not<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> clearer

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
getting a CPU cooler or not a clearer

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.110 
getting a CPU cooler or not a clearer
you<00:00:57.510> think<00:00:58.160> you<00:00:59.160> might<00:00:59.610> want<00:00:59.880> to<00:00:59.970> reconsider

obviously and there's a little flashing
thing<00:02:30.940> pretty<00:02:31.660> nice<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.950> let's<00:02:33.130> turn<00:02:33.280> on

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
thing pretty nice so let's turn on

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.570 
thing pretty nice so let's turn on
lights<00:02:33.700> back<00:02:33.940> on<00:02:33.970> now<00:02:35.070> if<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:36.160> want<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.370> fuck

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
lights back on now if you want to fuck

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.180 
lights back on now if you want to fuck
with<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.790> color<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:38.500> got<00:02:38.710> a<00:02:38.740> little<00:02:38.980> switch

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
with the color it got a little switch

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.210 
with the color it got a little switch
right<00:02:39.220> here<00:02:39.610> for<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.880> color<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.860> this<00:02:42.040> will

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
right here for the color so this will

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.950 
right here for the color so this will
keep<00:02:42.400> cycling<00:02:42.970> through<00:02:43.330> all<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.630> colors<00:02:43.930> that

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
keep cycling through all the colors that

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.520 
keep cycling through all the colors that
this<00:02:44.320> can<00:02:44.590> do<00:02:45.160> by<00:02:46.060> flicking<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.540> switch<00:02:46.570> so<00:02:47.500> I

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
this can do by flicking the switch so I

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.860 
this can do by flicking the switch so I
just<00:02:47.710> flipped<00:02:47.950> right<00:02:48.010> there<00:02:48.660> we'll<00:02:49.660> take<00:02:49.690> a

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
just flipped right there we'll take a

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.670 
just flipped right there we'll take a
look<00:02:50.080> at<00:02:50.200> it

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.819 

so<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.280> can<00:02:57.430> see<00:02:57.610> it's<00:02:58.200> pretty<00:02:59.200> sweet

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
so you can see it's pretty sweet

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.699 
so you can see it's pretty sweet
it<00:02:59.890> changes<00:03:00.459> colors<00:03:00.879> and<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:02.290> can<00:03:02.439> leave<00:03:02.590> it

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
it changes colors and you can leave it

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:03.990 
it changes colors and you can leave it
like<00:03:02.739> that<00:03:02.860> if<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.250> like<00:03:03.430> or<00:03:03.700> if<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:03.849> just

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
like that if you like or if you just

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
like a particular color you can stop it

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.710 
like a particular color you can stop it
whenever<00:03:06.129> you<00:03:06.340> like<00:03:06.459> that<00:03:06.879> six<00:03:07.120> I<00:03:07.269> like<00:03:07.510> green

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
on that particular color it's a pretty

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.470 
on that particular color it's a pretty
cool<00:03:52.540> little<00:03:52.630> memory<00:03:53.110> feature<00:03:53.320> I<00:03:53.470> guess

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
cool little memory feature I guess

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.830 
cool little memory feature I guess
besides<00:03:55.480> that

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.100 

I<00:03:59.610> when<00:04:00.610> I<00:04:00.640> got<00:04:00.849> this<00:04:01.030> case<00:04:01.300> I<00:04:01.510> got<00:04:01.660> I<00:04:01.690> ordered

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
I when I got this case I got I ordered

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.890 
I when I got this case I got I ordered
it<00:04:02.230> from<00:04:02.319> new<00:04:02.500> egg<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:03.459> only<00:04:03.760> downside<00:04:04.599> I<00:04:04.629> have

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
it from new egg the only downside I have

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.460 
it from new egg the only downside I have
from<00:04:05.110> it

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
from it

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.160 
from it
is<00:04:05.860> that<00:04:06.099> it<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:06.640> got<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.239> received<00:04:07.660> it<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:07.989> all

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
is that it I got I received it and all

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.979 
is that it I got I received it and all
the<00:04:08.349> front<00:04:08.650> clips<00:04:08.920> on<00:04:09.099> this<00:04:09.220> case<00:04:10.030> were<00:04:10.690> broken

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
the front clips on this case were broken

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.160 
the front clips on this case were broken
so<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:11.620> had<00:04:11.920> a<00:04:11.950> glue<00:04:12.849> little<00:04:13.150> points<00:04:13.569> as<00:04:14.019> you<00:04:14.080> can

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
so I had a glue little points as you can

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.170 
so I had a glue little points as you can
see<00:04:14.470> right<00:04:14.620> there<00:04:14.849> with<00:04:15.849> a<00:04:15.879> plastic<00:04:16.840> weld

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
see right there with a plastic weld

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.460 
see right there with a plastic weld
that's<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.299> only<00:04:19.479> downside<00:04:19.660> I<00:04:19.900> had<00:04:20.109> is<00:04:20.440> that

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
that's the only downside I had is that

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.390 
that's the only downside I had is that
the<00:04:20.769> case<00:04:20.979> came<00:04:21.310> busted<00:04:22.030> up<00:04:22.150> probably<00:04:23.050> wasn't

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
the case came busted up probably wasn't

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.950 
the case came busted up probably wasn't
anything<00:04:24.400> with<00:04:24.639> new<00:04:24.790> egg<00:04:24.970> probably<00:04:25.750> most

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
anything with new egg probably most

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.300 
anything with new egg probably most
likely<00:04:26.169> was<00:04:26.500> with<00:04:26.680> shitty<00:04:27.220> ass<00:04:27.400> ups<00:04:28.949> but<00:04:29.949> I

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
likely was with shitty ass ups but I

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.480 
likely was with shitty ass ups but I
