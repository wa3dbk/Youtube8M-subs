00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
my last my last video where I gave a

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.570 
my last my last video where I gave a

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
prediction on it well I said that I felt

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.080 
prediction on it well I said that I felt
that<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:31.250> Ricky<00:00:32.250> hadn't<00:00:32.579> wanted<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.030> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that that Ricky hadn't wanted it a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.660 
that that Ricky hadn't wanted it a
little<00:00:33.270> bit<00:00:33.450> more<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:34.410> because<00:00:35.250> he<00:00:35.430> wanted

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
little bit more that because he wanted

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.490 
little bit more that because he wanted
to<00:00:35.790> get<00:00:35.910> his<00:00:36.059> revenge<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.780> avenge<00:00:37.260> his<00:00:37.469> loss

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
to get his revenge and avenge his loss

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.040 
to get his revenge and avenge his loss
against<00:00:38.100> Floyd<00:00:38.309> Mayweather<00:00:38.790> but<00:00:39.149> that's<00:00:39.870> not

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
against Floyd Mayweather but that's not

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.680 
against Floyd Mayweather but that's not
gonna<00:00:40.200> happen<00:00:40.350> now<00:00:40.739> because<00:00:41.239> Manny<00:00:42.239> Pacquiao

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
gonna happen now because Manny Pacquiao

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.799 
gonna happen now because Manny Pacquiao
just<00:00:43.350> took<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.879> right<00:00:44.879> right<00:00:45.149> away<00:00:45.329> from<00:00:45.450> him

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
just took that right right away from him

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.310 
just took that right right away from him
I<00:00:45.960> mean<00:00:47.059> Ricky<00:00:48.059> Hatton<00:00:48.390> probably<00:00:48.719> has<00:00:48.899> one

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
I mean Ricky Hatton probably has one

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.290 
I mean Ricky Hatton probably has one
more<00:00:49.559> shot<00:00:49.890> he<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.250> fight<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.640> loser<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
more shot he can fight the loser of the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.229 
more shot he can fight the loser of the
Marquez<00:00:52.280> mayweather<00:00:53.280> fight<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.789> even<00:00:54.030> if<00:00:54.120> he

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
Marquez mayweather fight but even if he

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.420 
Marquez mayweather fight but even if he
beats<00:00:54.510> one<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.899> them<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.289> don't<00:00:55.320> see<00:00:55.559> him

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
beats one of them I don't see him

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.610 
beats one of them I don't see him
you<00:00:57.360> know<00:00:57.449> let's<00:00:57.660> say<00:00:57.780> he<00:00:57.960> got<00:00:58.350> an<00:00:58.469> air<00:00:58.590> of

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
you know let's say he got an air of

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.119 
you know let's say he got an air of
Marquez<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.640> beats<00:01:00.570> him<00:01:00.780> which<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.140> which<00:01:01.859> I

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
Marquez and beats him which I which I

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.950 
Marquez and beats him which I which I
know<00:01:02.280> wouldn't<00:01:02.820> happen<00:01:02.969> I'm<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.539> would<00:01:03.780> roll

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
know wouldn't happen I'm I would roll

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.929 
know wouldn't happen I'm I would roll
with<00:01:04.199> Marquez<00:01:04.979> if<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.339> was<00:01:05.460> ever<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.760> happen

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
with Marquez if that was ever to happen

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.200 
with Marquez if that was ever to happen
but<00:01:06.299> let's<00:01:06.810> say<00:01:06.990> he<00:01:07.170> did<00:01:07.380> beat<00:01:07.619> him<00:01:08.000> he's<00:01:09.000> not

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
but let's say he did beat him he's not

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.840 
but let's say he did beat him he's not
gonna<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.659> Floyd<00:01:09.960> Mayweather<00:01:10.380> again<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.070> he's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
gonna be Floyd Mayweather again and he's

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.789 
gonna be Floyd Mayweather again and he's
not<00:01:12.180> gonna<00:01:12.390> beat<00:01:12.659> Manny<00:01:12.930> Pacquiao<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.500> he

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
not gonna beat Manny Pacquiao and he

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.350 
not gonna beat Manny Pacquiao and he
probably<00:01:14.010> doesn't<00:01:14.580> want<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.850> even<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.270> the
