feminine<00:01:52.619> face<00:01:52.799> shape<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:53.790> me

feminine face shape but that is just me

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.389 
feminine face shape but that is just me
and<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.200> basically<00:01:55.380> an<00:01:55.829> inverted

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
and this is just basically an inverted

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.639 
and this is just basically an inverted
triangle<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.090> your<00:01:57.299> jaw<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.869> right<00:01:58.140> pointed

triangle so your jaw is right pointed

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.410 
triangle so your jaw is right pointed
and<00:01:58.829> now<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.520> smallest<00:01:59.850> part<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.329> your

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
face and your forehead is wider so it's

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.700 
face and your forehead is wider so it's
basically<00:02:03.060> all<00:02:03.360> going<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.590> your

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
basically all going like this so your

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.959 
basically all going like this so your
cheekbones<00:02:05.100> are<00:02:05.280> somewhere<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.729> middle

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
cheekbones are somewhere in the middle

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.029 
cheekbones are somewhere in the middle
they<00:02:06.119> can<00:02:06.420> sometimes<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.229> same<00:02:07.590> width<00:02:07.829> as

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
they can sometimes be the same width as

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.100 
they can sometimes be the same width as
the<00:02:08.099> forehead<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:08.879> it's<00:02:09.060> mostly<00:02:09.509> all<00:02:09.629> going

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
the forehead but it's mostly all going

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.869 
the forehead but it's mostly all going
down<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.619> triangle<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.340> examples<00:02:11.790> of

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
down in a triangle so examples of

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.920 
down in a triangle so examples of
celebrities<00:02:12.390> there's

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
celebrities there's

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.080 
celebrities there's
with<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> spoon<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.860> Scarlett<00:02:14.370> Johansson<00:02:14.970> then

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
with a spoon and Scarlett Johansson then

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.789 
with a spoon and Scarlett Johansson then
there's<00:02:15.299> be<00:02:15.450> rectangular<00:02:16.110> face<00:02:16.319> shape<00:02:16.560> and

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
there's be rectangular face shape and

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.289 
there's be rectangular face shape and
that<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:17.040> sometimes<00:02:17.430> confused<00:02:17.939> with<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
that is sometimes confused with the

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.600 
that is sometimes confused with the
square<00:02:18.659> shape<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.620> oval<00:02:20.069> face<00:02:20.280> shape<00:02:20.310> as

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
square shape and the oval face shape as

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.399 
square shape and the oval face shape as
well<00:02:20.819> because<00:02:21.239> it's<00:02:21.360> kind<00:02:21.599> of<00:02:21.689> ambiguous<00:02:21.959> and

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
well because it's kind of ambiguous and

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.289 
well because it's kind of ambiguous and
somewhere<00:02:22.829> in<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.010> middle<00:02:23.280> but<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.730> think<00:02:24.209> the

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
somewhere in the middle but I think the

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:25.910 
somewhere in the middle but I think the
easiest<00:02:24.629> way<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.900> think<00:02:25.170> about<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.709> it's

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
easiest way to think about it is it's

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.800 
easiest way to think about it is it's
been<00:02:26.129> to<00:02:26.280> key<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.459> square<00:02:26.879> but<00:02:27.269> it's<00:02:27.390> just<00:02:27.599> a

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
been to key a square but it's just a

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.569 
been to key a square but it's just a
longer<00:02:28.049> and<00:02:28.439> it's<00:02:28.680> also<00:02:28.829> an<00:02:29.069> oval<00:02:29.370> face<00:02:29.519> shape

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
longer and it's also an oval face shape

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.729 
longer and it's also an oval face shape
but<00:02:30.060> it's<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.629> bit<00:02:30.870> more<00:02:31.109> angular<00:02:31.500> and

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
but it's just a bit more angular and

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.800 
but it's just a bit more angular and
basically<00:02:32.250> your<00:02:32.489> forehead<00:02:33.000> your<00:02:33.269> cheekbones

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
basically your forehead your cheekbones

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.199 
basically your forehead your cheekbones
and<00:02:34.019> your<00:02:34.260> jawline<00:02:34.560> are<00:02:35.010> all<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.700> same<00:02:35.909> lines

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
and your jawline are all the same lines

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.179 
and your jawline are all the same lines
they're<00:02:36.510> all<00:02:36.689> great<00:02:36.900> angular<00:02:37.409> and<00:02:37.680> your

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
they're all great angular and your

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.649 
they're all great angular and your
jawline<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.700> ready<00:02:38.939> to<00:02:39.060> find<00:02:39.329> it's<00:02:39.569> not

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
jawline is ready to find it's not

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.059 
jawline is ready to find it's not
rounded<00:02:40.140> at<00:02:40.260> all<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.769> your<00:02:40.859> face<00:02:41.040> is

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
rounded at all so your face is

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.069 
rounded at all so your face is
definitely<00:02:41.670> longer<00:02:41.939> than<00:02:42.299> it<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.510> why<00:02:42.720> and

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
definitely longer than it is why and

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.710 
definitely longer than it is why and
some<00:02:43.379> celebrities<00:02:43.829> are<00:02:44.129> Alexa<00:02:44.760> Chung<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.269> Liv

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
some celebrities are Alexa Chung and Liv

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.240 
some celebrities are Alexa Chung and Liv
Tyler<00:02:45.750> as<00:02:46.170> well<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.530> then<00:02:46.620> finally<00:02:46.980> there's

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
Tyler as well and then finally there's

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.399 
Tyler as well and then finally there's
the<00:02:47.430> diamond<00:02:47.700> face<00:02:48.120> shape<00:02:48.450> which<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.930> very

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
the diamond face shape which is very

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.170 
the diamond face shape which is very
confusing<00:02:49.620> because<00:02:50.129> it's<00:02:50.459> similar<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.879> the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
confusing because it's similar to the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.849 
confusing because it's similar to the
heart-shaped<00:02:51.690> face<00:02:51.780> but<00:02:52.139> basically<00:02:52.620> your

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
heart-shaped face but basically your

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.039 
heart-shaped face but basically your
hairline<00:02:53.280> or<00:02:53.639> your<00:02:53.849> forehead<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.659> a<00:02:54.690> little

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
hairline or your forehead is a little

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.080 
hairline or your forehead is a little
bit<00:02:55.170> more<00:02:55.349> narrow<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:56.010> it's<00:02:56.579> basically<00:02:57.000> a

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
bit more narrow so it's basically a

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.119 
bit more narrow so it's basically a
diamond<00:02:57.629> your<00:02:57.780> cheekbones<00:02:58.200> are<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.680> widest

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
diamond your cheekbones are the widest

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.190 
diamond your cheekbones are the widest
part<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.639> your<00:02:59.909> face<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.450> your<00:03:00.689> jaw<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.079> your

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
part of your face so your jaw and your

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.990 
part of your face so your jaw and your

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
forehead are some run between and then

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000 
forehead are some run between and then
your<00:03:03.180> cheekbones<00:03:03.599> are<00:03:03.810> wider<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:04.470> your<00:03:04.769> chin

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
your cheekbones are wider and your chin

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.369 
your cheekbones are wider and your chin
is<00:03:05.189> also<00:03:05.489> quite<00:03:05.790> pointed<00:03:06.209> so<00:03:06.450> it's<00:03:06.989> definitely

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
is also quite pointed so it's definitely

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.140

very<00:03:07.560> similar<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.159> hard<00:03:08.370> shaped<00:03:08.609> face<00:03:08.849> but
