waterfall after you beat the leaf or not

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.640 
waterfall after you beat the leaf or not
a<00:00:23.730> hundred<00:00:24.000> percent<00:00:24.180> sure<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:25.019> hopefully<00:00:25.380> we

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
a hundred percent sure but hopefully we

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.080 
a hundred percent sure but hopefully we
do<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> tutorial<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.340> how<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.490> get<00:00:26.670> waterfall

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090

soon so you don't want to need to get

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.040 
soon so you don't want to need to get
surf<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.820> waterfall<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.480> then<00:00:30.630> basically

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
surf in waterfall and then basically

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.530 
surf in waterfall and then basically
just<00:00:31.170> follow<00:00:31.439> where<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.710> go<00:00:31.980> um<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:33.090> kind<00:00:33.420> of

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
just follow where I go um I just kind of

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.350 
just follow where I go um I just kind of
guessed<00:00:33.930> actually<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.710> location<00:00:35.300> if<00:00:36.300> you

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
guessed actually on the location if you

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.030 
guessed actually on the location if you
look<00:00:36.570> at<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> little<00:00:37.230> mini-map<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.860> can

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
look at on the little mini-map you can

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.830 
look at on the little mini-map you can
kind<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.520> guess<00:00:38.820> where<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.510> basically

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
kind of guess where it is so basically

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.660 
kind of guess where it is so basically
just<00:00:40.079> follow<00:00:40.290> around<00:00:40.500> where<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> go<00:00:41.010> I'm<00:00:41.460> gonna

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
just follow around where I go I'm gonna

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.250 
just follow around where I go I'm gonna
have<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.879> battle<00:00:42.030> all<00:00:42.270> these<00:00:42.420> trainers<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:43.050> I

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.319 
have to battle all these trainers like I
did<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.860> obviously<00:00:44.160> skipped<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.030> edited

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
did but I obviously skipped and edited

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.709

some<00:00:45.510> footage<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.530> get<00:00:46.950> around<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.719> this

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
some footage to get around it so this

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.389

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.570 
regular grass which will be a 10% chance
of<00:01:25.229> finding<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.770> walk<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> thick

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
of finding it you can walk in the thick

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.179 
of finding it you can walk in the thick
grass<00:01:26.850> which<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.049> right<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.979> thick

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
grass which is right here this thick

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.399 
grass which is right here this thick
kind<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.490> grass<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.000> gives<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.079> 20%

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409

kind of grass that gives you a 20%
chance<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.979> finding<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.340> or<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.939> look<00:01:33.119> in

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
chance of finding it or you can look in

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.990 
chance of finding it or you can look in
the<00:01:33.479> hidden<00:01:33.869> grotto<00:01:34.229> hidden<00:01:34.829> grotto<00:01:35.009> I'm

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the hidden grotto hidden grotto I'm

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.370 
the hidden grotto hidden grotto I'm
actually<00:01:36.210> not<00:01:36.509> exactly<00:01:36.840> sure<00:01:37.020> where<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.229> is

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
actually not exactly sure where that is

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.929 
actually not exactly sure where that is
but<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.650> area<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.070> rather<00:01:38.250> small<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.729> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
but this area is rather small so you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.149 
but this area is rather small so you
shouldn't<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.390> problem<00:01:39.420> finding<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.159> but

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
shouldn't have a problem finding it but

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.039 
shouldn't have a problem finding it but
this<00:01:41.280> way<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> found<00:01:41.909> was<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> easiest<00:01:42.570> walking

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
this way I found was the easiest walking

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.020 
this way I found was the easiest walking
in<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> thick<00:01:43.470> grass<00:01:43.680> um<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.729> basically<00:01:44.820> just

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
in the thick grass um so basically just

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.249 
in the thick grass um so basically just
walk<00:01:45.270> back<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.630> forth<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.899> found<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.229> my

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
walk back and forth I found it on my

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.920 
walk back and forth I found it on my
first<00:01:46.470> try<00:01:46.740> which<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:46.979> really<00:01:47.220> easy<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:48.240> yeah

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
first try which is really easy so yeah

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.450 
first try which is really easy so yeah
this<00:01:49.229> Pokemon<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.799> hard<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.040> catch<00:01:50.250> at<00:01:50.340> all

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
this Pokemon is not hard to catch at all

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.819 
this Pokemon is not hard to catch at all
you<00:01:50.610> really<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:51.000> um<00:01:51.360> if<00:01:51.990> you're<00:01:52.170> using<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
you really just um if you're using the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.710 
you really just um if you're using the
tactic<00:01:53.340> or<00:01:53.490> whatever<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.240> do<00:01:54.420> where<00:01:54.689> we

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
tactic or whatever that we do where we

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.990 
tactic or whatever that we do where we
just<00:01:55.049> level<00:01:55.350> or<00:01:55.590> get<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> health<00:01:56.460> down<00:01:56.729> with

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
just level or get the health down with

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.120 
just level or get the health down with
fall<00:01:57.180> swipe<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:58.110> takes<00:01:58.350> one<00:01:58.590> hit<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.009> then

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
fall swipe just takes one hit and then

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.410 
fall swipe just takes one hit and then
you<00:01:59.369> should<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.759> able<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.000> catch<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.180> with

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
you should just be able to catch it with

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.789 
you should just be able to catch it with
the<00:02:00.570> ultra<00:02:00.840> ball<00:02:00.990> or<00:02:01.110> whatever<00:02:01.229> you're<00:02:01.469> using
