the<00:00:00.450> really<00:00:01.110> what<00:00:01.290> you<00:00:01.410> need<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.860> know<00:00:02.070> about

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
the really what you need to know about

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.240 
the really what you need to know about
ISO<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:03.090> it's<00:00:03.330> measuring<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:03.929> film

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.250 
ISO is it's measuring the film

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.380 
ISO is it's measuring the film
sensitivity<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.490> light<00:00:05.520> and<00:00:06.180> there's<00:00:06.330> a

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
sensitivity to light and there's a

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.000 
sensitivity to light and there's a
couple<00:00:06.540> phrases<00:00:06.839> that<00:00:07.140> are<00:00:07.200> used<00:00:07.290> around<00:00:07.799> this

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
couple phrases that are used around this

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.580 
couple phrases that are used around this
you'll<00:00:08.700> hear<00:00:08.820> somebody<00:00:09.450> say<00:00:09.690> oh<00:00:09.719> that's<00:00:10.320> a

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
you'll hear somebody say oh that's a

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.270 
you'll hear somebody say oh that's a
slow<00:00:10.920> film<00:00:11.400> well<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.090> slow<00:00:12.389> film<00:00:12.719> has<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> low<00:00:13.590> ISO

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
slow film well a slow film has a low ISO

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.109 
slow film well a slow film has a low ISO
rating<00:00:14.490> which<00:00:15.150> may<00:00:15.389> be<00:00:15.450> as<00:00:15.809> low<00:00:16.080> as<00:00:16.109> 50<00:00:16.770> or<00:00:17.119> 100

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
rating which may be as low as 50 or 100

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.599 
rating which may be as low as 50 or 100
those<00:00:18.720> are<00:00:18.869> typically<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.500> slowest<00:00:20.369> and

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
those are typically the slowest and

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.150 
those are typically the slowest and
those<00:00:20.939> are<00:00:21.090> for<00:00:21.270> portraits<00:00:21.750> or<00:00:21.990> still<00:00:22.890> lifes

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
those are for portraits or still lifes

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.220 
those are for portraits or still lifes
where<00:00:23.490> your<00:00:23.670> image<00:00:23.939> really<00:00:24.420> isn't<00:00:24.539> moving<00:00:25.019> and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
where your image really isn't moving and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.710 
where your image really isn't moving and
it's<00:00:25.380> extremely<00:00:25.830> well<00:00:26.130> lit<00:00:26.400> because<00:00:26.910> that

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
it's extremely well lit because that

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.349 
it's extremely well lit because that
film<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.320> not<00:00:28.650> as<00:00:28.920> sensitive<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.670> light<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.060> it

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
film is not as sensitive to light so it

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.690 
film is not as sensitive to light so it
needs<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.779> be<00:00:30.900> exposed<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.070> light<00:00:32.219> longer

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
needs to be exposed to the light longer

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.750 
needs to be exposed to the light longer
there<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> other<00:00:33.989> end<00:00:34.290> there's<00:00:35.219> fast

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
there on the other end there's fast

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.360 
there on the other end there's fast
films<00:00:36.360> now<00:00:36.840> fast<00:00:37.110> films<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> very<00:00:38.010> high

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
films now fast films have a very high

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.340 
films now fast films have a very high
ISO<00:00:38.969> rating<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.690> like<00:00:40.500> maybe<00:00:40.890> 800<00:00:41.780> 1600<00:00:42.780> and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
ISO rating so like maybe 800 1600 and

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.369 
ISO rating so like maybe 800 1600 and
some<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.950> even<00:00:43.980> go<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.370> high<00:00:44.520> as<00:00:44.660> 3200<00:00:45.660> those

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
some can even go as high as 3200 those

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.860 
some can even go as high as 3200 those
are<00:00:46.620> used<00:00:46.800> when<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.700> don't<00:00:48.390> have<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> lot<00:00:48.840> of

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
are used when you don't have a lot of

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.400 
are used when you don't have a lot of
light<00:00:49.399> and<00:00:50.399> you're<00:00:50.670> you're<00:00:51.090> needing<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
light and you're you're needing and you

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.590 
light and you're you're needing and you
need<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.800> exposure<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.399> be<00:00:53.489> quick<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.510> you

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
need the exposure to be quick so you

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.529 
need the exposure to be quick so you
can't<00:00:54.960> leave<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.890> shutter<00:00:56.760> open<00:00:56.910> for<00:00:57.390> long

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
can't leave the shutter open for long

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.260 
can't leave the shutter open for long
periods<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:57.989> time<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.640> use<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.000> higher

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
periods of time so you use this higher

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.240 
periods of time so you use this higher
speed<00:01:00.780> film<00:01:01.109> or<00:01:01.320> if<00:01:01.590> you're<00:01:01.739> shooting<00:01:01.980> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
speed film or if you're shooting a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.429 
speed film or if you're shooting a
sporting<00:01:02.579> event<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.660> want<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.960> stop

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
sporting event and you want to stop

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.130 
sporting event and you want to stop
someone<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.369> action<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.060> high<00:01:06.479> speed<00:01:06.869> film

kinds<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.200> things<00:01:58.259> happen<00:01:58.799> you'll<00:01:58.920> get<00:01:59.100> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
kinds of things happen you'll get a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.300 
kinds of things happen you'll get a
clearer<00:01:59.520> sharper<00:02:00.119> image<00:02:00.810> at<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.619> low<00:02:01.770> ISO

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
clearer sharper image at the low ISO

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.950 
clearer sharper image at the low ISO
under<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.820> right<00:02:02.969> lighting<00:02:03.180> conditions<00:02:03.689> and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
under the right lighting conditions and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.649 
under the right lighting conditions and
at<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.890> higher<00:02:05.130> ISO<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.670> may<00:02:06.060> start<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.420> get

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
at the higher ISO you may start to get

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.290 
at the higher ISO you may start to get
what's<00:02:06.899> called<00:02:07.110> noise<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:08.039> not<00:02:08.369> exactly<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
what's called noise it's not exactly the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.260 
what's called noise it's not exactly the
same<00:02:09.509> thing<00:02:09.869> as<00:02:10.140> grain<00:02:10.649> because<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:12.030> grain

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
same thing as grain because the grain

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.410 
same thing as grain because the grain
was<00:02:12.599> actually<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
was actually the

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.530 
was actually the
silver<00:02:14.110> halide<00:02:14.440> crystals<00:02:14.850> we're<00:02:15.850> now<00:02:16.180> it's

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
silver halide crystals we're now it's

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.500 
silver halide crystals we're now it's
more<00:02:16.900> of<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.820> disruption<00:02:18.820> with<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.150> way<00:02:19.300> that

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
more of a disruption with the way that

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.590 
more of a disruption with the way that
the<00:02:19.660> sensor<00:02:20.190> absorbs<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.340> light<00:02:21.550> so<00:02:22.240> it<00:02:22.450> can

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
the sensor absorbs the light so it can

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.410 
the sensor absorbs the light so it can
give<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:23.220> something<00:02:24.220> similar<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.730> green<00:02:24.970> but

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
give you something similar to green but

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.690 
give you something similar to green but
it's<00:02:26.290> not<00:02:26.470> exactly<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.950> same<00:02:27.130> thing<00:02:27.310> but

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
it's not exactly the same thing but

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.010 
it's not exactly the same thing but
there's<00:02:27.910> trade-offs<00:02:28.300> so<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.690> just<00:02:28.840> have<00:02:28.990> to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
there's trade-offs so you just have to

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.080 
there's trade-offs so you just have to
decide<00:02:29.440> what's<00:02:29.950> best<00:02:30.250> for<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.640> type<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:30.820> image

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
decide what's best for the type of image

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.660 
decide what's best for the type of image
that<00:02:31.300> you're<00:02:31.390> shooting
