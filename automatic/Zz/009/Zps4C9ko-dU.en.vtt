nice you might see more about check that
out<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.540> today<00:00:37.469> isn't<00:00:37.860> about<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.820> quadcopter

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
out but today isn't about the quadcopter

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.580 
out but today isn't about the quadcopter
itself<00:00:39.540> it's<00:00:40.140> about<00:00:40.440> how<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.829> did<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:42.590> see

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
itself it's about how I did this see

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.860 
itself it's about how I did this see
there's<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.070> video<00:00:44.730> getting<00:00:45.090> transmitted<00:00:45.719> from

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
there's a video getting transmitted from

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.690 
there's a video getting transmitted from
the<00:00:46.020> camera<00:00:46.350> they're<00:00:47.360> very<00:00:48.360> impressive<00:00:49.700> so

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
the camera they're very impressive so

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.310 
the camera they're very impressive so
let's<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> run-through<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:51.840> we've<00:00:52.110> got

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
let's do a run-through of what we've got

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.150 
let's do a run-through of what we've got
here<00:00:52.440> we've<00:00:52.469> got<00:00:52.860> orange<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.879> yellow<00:00:54.149> doing<00:00:54.899> a

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
here we've got orange and yellow doing a

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.740 
here we've got orange and yellow doing a
connection<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.520> wireless<00:00:57.149> transmission

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
connection to the wireless transmission

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.420 
connection to the wireless transmission
unit<00:00:58.199> there<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.770> see<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.070> very<00:00:59.129> small

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
unit there you can see it's very small

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.540 
unit there you can see it's very small
we're<00:01:00.000> talking<00:01:00.329> 0.6<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.079> gram<00:01:01.350> here<00:01:01.620> this

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
we're talking 0.6 of a gram here this

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.969 
we're talking 0.6 of a gram here this
cable<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.019> all<00:01:04.170> testing<00:01:04.680> kind

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
cable here so this is all testing kind

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.109 
cable here so this is all testing kind
of<00:01:05.159> stuff<00:01:05.630> runs<00:01:06.630> into<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.320> camera<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.700> an

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
of stuff runs into the camera this is an

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.440 
of stuff runs into the camera this is an
analogue<00:01:09.720> pal<00:01:10.140> based<00:01:10.830> camera<00:01:11.310> specs<00:01:12.150> aren't

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
analogue pal based camera specs aren't

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.359 
analogue pal based camera specs aren't
really<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.869> impressive<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:13.860> they<00:01:14.189> work

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
really that impressive but they work

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.359 
really that impressive but they work
well<00:01:14.610> when<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.380> one<00:01:16.770> gram<00:01:17.040> by<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
well when you this is one gram by the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.060 
well when you this is one gram by the
way<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.090> camera<00:01:18.330> itself<00:01:18.799> so<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:19.950> all

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
way the the camera itself so it's all

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.200 
way the the camera itself so it's all
been<00:01:20.250> wired<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.530> transmission

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
been wired up to the transmission

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.310 
been wired up to the transmission
transmitter<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.479> II<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.780> been<00:01:24.810> saying<00:01:25.170> that

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
transmitter so II have been saying that

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.109 
transmitter so II have been saying that
wrong<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.680> other<00:01:26.159> part<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.520> had<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.640> build<00:01:26.880> was

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
wrong the other part I had to build was

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.289 
wrong the other part I had to build was
this<00:01:27.299> receiver<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.650> receives<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.340> 2.4<00:01:29.670> gig

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
this receiver this receives on 2.4 gig

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.080 
this receiver this receives on 2.4 gig
it's<00:01:30.659> similar<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.439> your<00:01:32.130> Wi-Fi<00:01:32.490> kind<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.880> stuff

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
it's similar to your Wi-Fi kind of stuff

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.469 
it's similar to your Wi-Fi kind of stuff
the<00:01:33.479> big<00:01:34.200> picture<00:01:34.590> there<00:01:34.799> was<00:01:34.979> do<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:35.970> know<00:01:36.150> did

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the big picture there was do we know did

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.039 
the big picture there was do we know did
you<00:01:36.600> stop<00:01:37.729> yes<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.880> got<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.180> digispark<00:01:39.570> did<00:01:39.930> you

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
you stop yes I got the digispark did you

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.200 
you stop yes I got the digispark did you
stop<00:01:40.290> that's<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.250> portable<00:01:41.579> projector<00:01:42.180> over

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
stop that's a portable projector over

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.050 
stop that's a portable projector over
there<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.720> I'm<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.140> turn<00:01:43.409> this

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
there so I'm going to turn this

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.789 
there so I'm going to turn this
quadcopter<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.750> see<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.079> power<00:01:46.590> go

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
quadcopter on to see the power go

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.010 
quadcopter on to see the power go
through<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.189> now<00:01:47.399> again<00:01:47.909> I'll<00:01:48.090> iterate<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
through it now again I'll iterate the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.899 
through it now again I'll iterate the
connections<00:01:49.770> at<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.460> yellow<00:01:50.729> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
connections at like the yellow and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.399 
connections at like the yellow and
orange<00:01:51.030> cables<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> bottom<00:01:52.110> right<00:01:52.229> they

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
orange cables and the bottom right they

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.950 
orange cables and the bottom right they
were<00:01:52.470> held<00:01:52.799> there<00:01:53.040> by<00:01:53.100> gravity<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.869> can

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
were held there by gravity so you can

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.630 
were held there by gravity so you can
see<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> fair<00:01:55.680> bit<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.920> trouble<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:56.610> with

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
see a fair bit of trouble I have with

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.990 
see a fair bit of trouble I have with
our<00:01:57.000> trying<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.540> turn<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:59.280> powering<00:01:59.909> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
our trying to turn it on so powering the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.270 
our trying to turn it on so powering the
receiver<00:02:00.329> again<00:02:01.079> by<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.409> digi<00:02:01.829> stump<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.189> the

receiver again by the digi stump in the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.819 
receiver again by the digi stump in the
top<00:02:02.490> right<00:02:02.750> pretty<00:02:03.750> happier<00:02:04.079> for<00:02:04.290> working<00:02:04.649> by

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
top right pretty happier for working by

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.570 
top right pretty happier for working by
that<00:02:05.070> actually<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.840> portable<00:02:07.259> projector<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
that actually so portable projector the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.369 
that actually so portable projector the
graving<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.539> middle<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> screen<00:02:10.110> is

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
graving in the middle of the screen is

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.850 
graving in the middle of the screen is
sending<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.069> transmission

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
sending the transmission

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.860 
sending the transmission
wirelessly<00:02:13.860> over<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.520> her<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:15.210> OVA<00:02:15.510> signal

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
wirelessly over to her the OVA signal

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.380 
wirelessly over to her the OVA signal
there<00:02:16.190> blue<00:02:17.190> means<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.610> signals<00:02:17.970> drop<00:02:18.180> down

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
there blue means the signals drop down

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.570 
there blue means the signals drop down
which<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.350> more<00:02:19.710> my<00:02:19.890> fault<00:02:20.160> rather<00:02:20.370> than

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
which is a more my fault rather than

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.110 
which is a more my fault rather than
their<00:02:20.730> jeweler<00:02:20.940> transmitter<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.760> once<00:02:23.940> this

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
their jeweler transmitter so once this

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.780 
their jeweler transmitter so once this
is<00:02:24.180> running<00:02:24.890> everything<00:02:25.890> all<00:02:26.070> works<00:02:26.580> pretty

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
is running everything all works pretty

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.530 
is running everything all works pretty
well<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.450> draw<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.640> both<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.850> parts<00:02:30.210> is

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
well the draw of both of the parts is

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.930 
well the draw of both of the parts is
we're<00:02:30.930> looking<00:02:31.050> at<00:02:31.320> around<00:02:31.550> fingers<00:02:32.550> 20

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
we're looking at around fingers 20

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.490 
we're looking at around fingers 20
milliwatts<00:02:33.330> for<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.290> transmitter<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.960> 70<00:02:36.960> to

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
milliwatts for the transmitter and 70 to

milliwatts for the transmitter and 70 to
90<00:02:37.860> for<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.190> actual<00:02:38.550> camera<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:40.530> overall<00:02:40.830> it's

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
90 for the actual camera so overall it's

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.400 
90 for the actual camera so overall it's
a<00:02:41.280> decent<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:42.480> needs<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:42.870> pretty<00:02:43.200> low

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
a decent it needs to be pretty low

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.480 
a decent it needs to be pretty low
because<00:02:43.620> crazy<00:02:44.100> fly<00:02:44.400> itself<00:02:44.700> only<00:02:45.090> has<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.210> 170

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
because crazy fly itself only has a 170

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.210 
because crazy fly itself only has a 170
milliamp<00:02:47.490> hour<00:02:47.730> battery<00:02:47.880> on<00:02:48.810> him<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:49.220> that

milliamp hour battery on him and that

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.370 
milliamp hour battery on him and that
has<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.550> power<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:50.910> jewel<00:02:51.150> device<00:02:51.600> so<00:02:52.320> I'm

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
has to power that jewel device so I'm

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.290 
has to power that jewel device so I'm
thinking<00:02:52.800> of<00:02:52.950> putting<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.400> larger<00:02:53.850> battery<00:02:54.210> on

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
thinking of putting a larger battery on

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.300 
thinking of putting a larger battery on
there<00:02:54.450> just<00:02:55.230> testing<00:02:55.590> out<00:02:55.740> giving<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
there just testing out giving it the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.960 
there just testing out giving it the
thumbs<00:02:56.340> up<00:02:56.730> works<00:02:57.690> pretty<00:02:57.930> good<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.940> let's

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
thumbs up works pretty good so let's

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.000 
thumbs up works pretty good so let's
have<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.300> look<00:03:00.450> at<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.870> how<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.260> got<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.680> there<00:03:01.830> in

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
have a look at the how I got to there in

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.490 
have a look at the how I got to there in
the<00:03:02.040> first<00:03:02.310> place<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.750> test<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.140> out<00:03:04.260> I've

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
the first place so to test it out I've

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.250 
the first place so to test it out I've
been<00:03:05.030> sticky<00:03:06.030> taping<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.480> together<00:03:06.810> as<00:03:07.110> you

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
been sticky taping it together as you

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.930 
been sticky taping it together as you
can<00:03:07.380> see<00:03:07.590> here<00:03:07.830> at<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.010> moment<00:03:08.370> before<00:03:08.790> our

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
can see here at the moment before our

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.840 
can see here at the moment before our
doing<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.930> before<00:03:10.830> do<00:03:10.980> more<00:03:11.310> professional

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
doing a before do more professional

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.030 
doing a before do more professional
mounting<00:03:12.330> of<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.690> which<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.680> what<00:03:13.890> I'll<00:03:14.010> have

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
mounting of it which is what I'll have

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.060 
mounting of it which is what I'll have
to<00:03:14.160> look<00:03:14.400> into<00:03:14.580> further

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
to look into further

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.580 
to look into further
so<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.130> test<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.940> work<00:03:18.300> Dayan<00:03:18.780> sticky<00:03:19.350> taped

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
so to test the work Dayan sticky taped

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.890 
so to test the work Dayan sticky taped
it<00:03:19.980> all<00:03:20.130> together<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.700> before<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.540> had<00:03:21.750> to

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
it all together and before that I had to

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.110 
it all together and before that I had to
our<00:03:22.020> solder<00:03:22.470> all<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.709> parts<00:03:22.980> together<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.550> be

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
our solder all the parts together to be

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.460 
our solder all the parts together to be
at<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.360> gold<00:03:24.570> pedal<00:03:24.870> at<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.020> bottom<00:03:25.290> right

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
at the gold pedal at the bottom right

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.920 
at the gold pedal at the bottom right
there<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.250> antenna<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:27.000> had<00:03:27.570> a<00:03:27.630> horrible

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
there is the antenna I had a horrible

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.500 
there is the antenna I had a horrible
time<00:03:28.170> trying<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.830> put<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.130> together<00:03:29.510> but

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
time trying to put that together but

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.510 
time trying to put that together but
eventually<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:31.050> got<00:03:31.290> there<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.680> it's<00:03:32.040> barely

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
eventually I got there and it's barely

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.300 
eventually I got there and it's barely
sticking<00:03:32.820> this<00:03:33.150> at<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.510> bottom<00:03:33.720> there<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.560> have

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
sticking this at the bottom there I have

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.960 
sticking this at the bottom there I have
to<00:03:35.430> solder<00:03:35.820> on<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.420> channel<00:03:37.050> selectors

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
to solder on the channel selectors

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.220 
to solder on the channel selectors
eventually<00:03:38.970> got<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.300> alright<00:03:39.600> so<00:03:39.630> they<00:03:40.170> were

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
eventually got that alright so they were

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.770 
eventually got that alright so they were
working<00:03:40.650> on<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:40.980> same<00:03:41.190> signal<00:03:41.670> with<00:03:42.600> the

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
working on the same signal with the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.890 
working on the same signal with the
camera<00:03:43.590> he's<00:03:44.340> signal<00:03:44.880> its<00:03:45.120> own<00:03:45.360> it's<00:03:45.600> actually

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
camera he's signal its own it's actually

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.729 
camera he's signal its own it's actually
upside<00:03:46.170> down<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:47.430> that's<00:03:47.489> up<00:03:47.760> my<00:03:47.970> bad<00:03:48.209> but<00:03:49.110> not

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
upside down so that's up my bad but not

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:50.420 
upside down so that's up my bad but not
to<00:03:49.950> worry

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
to worry

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
to worry
I<00:03:50.459> left<00:03:51.300> a<00:03:51.450> while<00:03:52.220> floor<00:03:53.220> old<00:03:53.430> up<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.000> figure

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
I left a while floor old up to I figure

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.630 
I left a while floor old up to I figure
out<00:03:54.540> what's<00:03:54.720> going<00:03:54.989> on<00:03:55.110> in<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.260> future<00:03:55.610> so<00:03:56.610> I

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
out what's going on in the future so I

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.910 
out what's going on in the future so I
don't<00:03:56.850> get<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:57.360> same<00:03:57.510> kind<00:03:57.570> of<00:03:57.840> mishap<00:03:58.200> I'd

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
don't get the same kind of mishap I'd

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.340 
don't get the same kind of mishap I'd
love<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.280> have<00:03:59.400> some<00:03:59.580> kind<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.120> way<00:04:00.360> of<00:04:00.570> being

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
love to have some kind of way of being

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.140 
love to have some kind of way of being
able<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.620> adjust<00:04:01.770> the<00:04:02.220> mounting<00:04:02.610> once<00:04:02.790> it's<00:04:03.000> on

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
able to adjust the mounting once it's on

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.150 
able to adjust the mounting once it's on
there<00:04:03.300> at<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:03.989> moment<00:04:04.320> it's<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.800> good<00:04:05.010> old

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
there at the moment it's a good old

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.540 
there at the moment it's a good old
sticky<00:04:05.489> tape

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
sticky tape

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.780 
sticky tape
so<00:04:08.320> good<00:04:08.500> you<00:04:08.800> can<00:04:09.460> see<00:04:09.610> it's

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
so good you can see it's

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.950 
so good you can see it's
connected<00:04:10.570> there<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:12.540> it's<00:04:13.540> being<00:04:13.720> powered

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
connected there and it's being powered

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.229 
connected there and it's being powered
up<00:04:14.290> and<00:04:14.620> moving<00:04:15.250> around<00:04:15.340> and<00:04:15.640> looking<00:04:15.910> at<00:04:16.030> take

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
up and moving around and looking at take

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.840 
up and moving around and looking at take
off<00:04:16.450> yet<00:04:16.690> because<00:04:17.049> I<00:04:17.080> still<00:04:17.920> want<00:04:18.130> to<00:04:18.190> make<00:04:18.700> it

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
off yet because I still want to make it

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.370 
off yet because I still want to make it
a<00:04:18.880> bit<00:04:19.000> more<00:04:19.120> solid<00:04:19.390> because<00:04:19.600> that<00:04:19.959> own<00:04:20.049> figure

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
a bit more solid because that own figure

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.500 
a bit more solid because that own figure
would<00:04:20.530> survive<00:04:20.830> a<00:04:20.890> crash<00:04:21.250> in<00:04:22.000> this<00:04:22.150> kind<00:04:22.450> of

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
would survive a crash in this kind of

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.930 
would survive a crash in this kind of
state<00:04:22.750> this<00:04:23.470> is<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.770> crazy<00:04:24.010> fly<00:04:24.310> client<00:04:24.820> you

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
state this is the crazy fly client you

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.490 
state this is the crazy fly client you
can<00:04:25.000> see<00:04:25.330> I'm<00:04:25.420> sending<00:04:25.780> signals<00:04:26.200> so<00:04:26.350> they're

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
can see I'm sending signals so they're

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.140 
can see I'm sending signals so they're
fine<00:04:26.740> it's<00:04:27.070> not<00:04:27.250> interrupting<00:04:27.820> with<00:04:28.000> the

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
fine it's not interrupting with the

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.210 
fine it's not interrupting with the
actual<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:30.400> operation<00:04:31.000> of<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.180> camera<00:04:32.220> you

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
actual the operation of the camera you

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.520 
actual the operation of the camera you
can<00:04:33.280> see<00:04:33.370> there<00:04:33.700> working<00:04:34.180> fine<00:04:34.450> if<00:04:34.660> the<00:04:34.870> rotors

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
can see there working fine if the rotors

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.080 
can see there working fine if the rotors
powered<00:04:35.860> up<00:04:36.010> still<00:04:36.610> works<00:04:36.790> good<00:04:37.650> overall<00:04:38.650> as

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
powered up still works good overall as

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.630 
powered up still works good overall as
to<00:04:40.090> scope<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.570> success<00:04:41.110> so<00:04:41.320> far<00:04:41.590> very<00:04:41.860> proud<00:04:42.610> of

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
to scope a success so far very proud of

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.270 
to scope a success so far very proud of
it<00:04:42.880> working<00:04:43.060> like<00:04:43.360> that<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:43.950> next<00:04:44.950> step<00:04:45.100> will

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
it working like that and next step will

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.180 
it working like that and next step will
be<00:04:45.310> to<00:04:45.520> make<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.390> mounting<00:04:46.720> be<00:04:46.900> more<00:04:47.190> durable

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
be to make the mounting be more durable

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.340 
be to make the mounting be more durable
so<00:04:48.910> I<00:04:48.940> can<00:04:49.090> actually<00:04:49.210> do<00:04:49.480> proper<00:04:49.930> flying<00:04:50.200> with

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
so I can actually do proper flying with

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.320
