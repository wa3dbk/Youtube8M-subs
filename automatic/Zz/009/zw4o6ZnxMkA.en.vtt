00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 the emulator is here I'm also going to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.089
 leave in the link of the description and 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.089
 then the time they download it 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.130
 dolphin is an emulator for two consoles 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.510
 recent in attempt the gamecube and the wii 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.980
 allow to play pc players 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.590
 they enjoy games for these two 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.740
 consoles good as well as says here is the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.329
 game emulator with the wii in the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.849
 actually this game has some phases 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.550
 of bonus so I think they need a 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.640
 very good pc to play the games 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.340
 more that they require more graphics by 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.840
 example this one piece game some 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.060
 gave him a little slow so have a 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.460
 medium video card that of games 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.480
 very real so let's see if they have 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.310
 luck and gives the game very fluid to the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.760
 that have a good pc does not have to 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.560
 worry because if they are going to be able to play 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.780
 I for example if I can play it 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.150
 fights but in the intro is the only 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.010
 moment when it stops a bit but if 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.910
 I can play it is a matter of setting 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.650
 nothing more 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.070
 good after they downloaded the 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.110
 dolphin go in the part here goes to 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.479
 appear here on the desktop and 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.700
 adolfina can open and in the folder 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.700
 where is the iso can open 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.960
 and the game begins 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:29.820
 the game you can configure it to your 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.820
 I like the graphics the control the joystick 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:40.090
 and well now the game started 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.370
 only the video to put the links 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.140
 downloading game and now that 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.140
 it was proven that if it works 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.630
 yes
