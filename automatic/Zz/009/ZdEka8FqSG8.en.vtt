00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.860
 m 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.620
 asamoah 7/4 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.620
 at 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.000
 the room of the world so I found 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.250
 today in a video for you 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.379
 make the presentation of my box to 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.719
 side of this month so that it seems to me 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.100
 Christmas themed 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.690
 so I start right away I 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.940
 apologize for the brightness I'm going 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.320
 to have been blue but it's 16:30 and 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.690
 already our green city so the box gets 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.220
 present like every month like this 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:54.040
 so with logo the cap is really 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.980
 super super good so he's like those 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.510
 and this is where I read because everything 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.039
 time and it's very very very 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.109
 practice you when going on holiday 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.720
 or at weekends we put these little ones 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.250
 products in it and it's really great 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.050
 convenient 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:14.740
 then the menu is composed like this so 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:19.840
 there are five products I wanted 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:22.300
 orchestrate 110 so first product 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.600
 so this is from the brand of asome 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.369
 so I hope I pronounce it well 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.240
 it's a ropes with orange in butter 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.140
 organic shea 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.869
 so it smells great skis and flower 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.640
 of orange tree out there for for this 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.560
 winter period and great cold I 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.880
 find it very very nice so I 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.670
 think I will really appreciate it 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.320
 so he says this unique line of 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.810
 facial and body products 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.130
 edited by authenticity the natural and 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.820
 the respect of environment 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.469
 so in addition it's very good then 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.049
 second fault so that's the 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:58.719
 mark joves so sum that is said like 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.119
 this is a cleansing gel to remove for 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:05.140
 combination or oily skin 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:07.119
 ok like those which is 50 milliliters 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.160
 so that I will not be able to test it 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.470
 since I have normal skin 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.440
 I think one of you will be able to 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.090
 test it then read tell them 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.830
 cosmetics I'm going are entirely 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.110
 natural is composed of a mixture of 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.880
 fruit and mineral plants they 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.010
 are easy and fast use 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.470
 hygienic economy is luxury at the 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.330
 natural so I think that whoever 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.830
 can use will really have a lot 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.780
 of luck because he is really very 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.970
 well in those moments we are going to be 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.800
 to have a normal skin then 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:44.050
 third product is brand 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.330
 skin code it's written like that so 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.370
 it is a jet firmness around the eyes 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.080
 so it's really a product that I 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.690
 think I will love 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.260
 because I can not albacore 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.260
 bedtime and morning also do not put 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.960
 of eastern outline I had some great 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.680
 sensitive and I feel when I 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.660
 hydrates not and I think that I'm going 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.500
 really really really appreciated he has 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.230
 look great 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.000
 in addition the quantity she is huge 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.590
 fossard as the eye contour there are 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.260
 really do not need to put big 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.340
 quantity and look at the thing what so 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.770
 I think I really have for one 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.470
 good time and he looks really very 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.480
 very well then he says a range of 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.310
 revolutionary dermocosmetic care 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.130
 is luxurious designed to meet 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.300
 daily needs the female skins 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.680
 that's how I told you I think 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.350
 that I really really have to 12 meters 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.730
 above the memory you will see 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.470
 surely products arrive in the 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:45.070
 favorites next month next 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.650
 fourth product is a fragrance so 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:51.580
 it is at 2 rue billy believe that 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.080
 like that of salvador dali years old who 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.800
 present like this no I feel your 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.530
 other world and so the scent is to 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.420
 interior 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.220
 it's very good in Valais there was that 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.480
 on the right path to avoid this blow and 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.710
 so that they break during the 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.760
 transport and packaging is just too much 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.870
 Too beautiful is a mouth actually yeah 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.110
 I think he would see with the 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:21.450
 brightness is really bad but that's it 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:23.800
 and the smell but it smells super good 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.240
 I could have but that fraudsters 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.680
 remind me someone I will not be you 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.090
 tell who two winters ago someone who 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.920
 think sometimes because that 's me in vitro and 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.260
 thing but it's a really smell 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.620
 super super good sensation 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.300
 so it's saying the feminine fragance 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.240
 chosen by the master is an agreement 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.040
 voluptuous marrying the most 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.140
 noble and rarest jasmine the 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.250
 flower he often wore the ear 38 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:54.100
 so finishes finger during jasmine in all 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.320
 case if we really super nice and 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.780
 they were fifteen ministers and then 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.990
 last project that ferran sua who are at 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.760
 this box is from the alcoologie brand 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.630
 and so it's a melting cream 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.230
 moisturizing that's it and the quantity is 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.600
 just 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.880
 ouf there are 50 milliliters when you 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.220
 see your web visits we have for a 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.700
 moment 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.060
 so here it is really a big fat 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.240
 thing 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.600
 the class packaging painted in green as 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.920
 that I find it always super nice so 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.380
 here is there small operculum here for 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.870
 avoid that cream of this puts on the 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.030
 touch or so they are top ten 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.620
 plants appeared on earth algae 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.690
 have recognized benefits since 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.340
 centuries thanks to the wealth of the ocean 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.010
 your to regain his balance 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.230
 so I think with his great times 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.640
 I really loved this whole cream 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.020
 way as I tell you you the 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.460

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:56.140

 according to the seasons for example 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.290

 face of the eyes and the little perfume I 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.900

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.410
 I think it's good to have
