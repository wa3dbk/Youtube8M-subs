just gonna have to chill let me in
trouble<00:05:16.740> it's<00:05:16.950> gonna<00:05:17.070> get<00:05:17.220> killed<00:05:17.729> my<00:05:17.850> twist

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
trouble it's gonna get killed my twist

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.270 
trouble it's gonna get killed my twist
on<00:05:18.210> actually<00:05:18.600> died<00:05:18.840> too<00:05:19.020> I<00:05:19.050> think<00:05:19.280> explosive

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
on actually died too I think explosive

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.490 
on actually died too I think explosive
shot<00:05:20.490> so<00:05:21.000> I<00:05:21.030> guess<00:05:21.240> we<00:05:21.389> have<00:05:21.540> to<00:05:21.570> and<00:05:22.139> this<00:05:22.320> is

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
shot so I guess we have to and this is

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.140 
shot so I guess we have to and this is
