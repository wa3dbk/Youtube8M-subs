universe<00:01:15.470> that's<00:01:16.470> really<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.610> terrible

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
universe that's really just a terrible

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.160 
universe that's really just a terrible
argument<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.750> don't<00:01:18.900> want<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.080> read

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170
