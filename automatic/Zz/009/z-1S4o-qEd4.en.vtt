00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.100
 unemployed women with discs and tools 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.530
 vertical soil work provides a 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.460
 practical compromise between the plow and 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.010
 direct seeding 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.900
 it serves both to manage the residues of 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.960
 cultures and to prepare the ground 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.180
 the fidh and versatile it replaces 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.070
 advantageously several equipment 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.990
 for example in the spring 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.910
 he replaces the grower for 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.890
 accelerate the warming of the soil and 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.410
 prepare a good they often launch themselves 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.600
 in one pass machines all not 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.960
 time they were interested in will 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.109
 a minimal working method its 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.149
 crop management there are producers 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.340
 among others who used during 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.960
 number of years direct seeding are 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.640
 open with risk issues 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.219
 due to surface so it's a machine to 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.989
 10 kilos will have the goal of 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.850
 remit these residues the sizes and 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.199
 cuts and put them back in touch with 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.090
 the ground to be able 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.320
 why turns them into matter 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.270
 organic to have the best 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.380
 especially the unemployed at ten us 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.150
 comes mostly from europe 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.380
 so it's machines in 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.090
 knowledge that in addition were 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.110
 used for shows but disillusioned 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.000
 serial then make a kind of fertilizer 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.140
 thereafter while for the states 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.430
 united we do not want to talk about work anymore 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.560
 vertical or is really what we want 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.079
 to work the soil vertically without 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.030
 Too much disturb the soil surface 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:33.329
 necessarily we really want to sliced 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.140
 the risks of the soil in contact with that 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.729
 opo degradation of risks due to 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.380
 matter orient we recognize the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.840
 unemployed and discs then disc 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.219
 cancale placed in language in the sense 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.020
 progress 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.810
 it's crazy is adjustable and then the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.060
 big job will be aggressive behind 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.729
 two rows of discs found 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.189
 currently a bing card for 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.009
 spread and residues and a roll for 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.719
 equalize the ground in the fall the 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.399
 disc harrow used to cut 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.500
 crop residues and to 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.149
 mix slightly with the soil for 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.210
 accelerate their decomposition 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.400
 it is also used to incorporate smoke 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.620
 in the spring the preparatory work 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.900
 soil is greatly accelerated 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.170
 since it replaces the two passages of 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.030
 farmer rolling between 10 and 18 km 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.820
 on time and since he does work 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.680
 than at the surface 12 cm deep at 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.270
 the less they require less power 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.950
 therefore less fuel the tools of 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.840
 riscal work complete the 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.090
 same tasks they do not work the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.200
 only in the same way the ten are at 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.730
 right angle 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.710
 so that the earth has raised from 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.750
 huambo without necessarily having ventured 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.820
 some models allow you to adjust 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.430
 the angle of the discs up to 6 degrees 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.050
 for more aggressive work we 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.200
 recognizes a vertical working tool 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.300
 only to these two rows of 10.3 additionally 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.160
 the they are followed by an instrument 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.410
 to burst the ground and the parts 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.020
 residues and then a roll for the 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.910
 finish with a thousand discs the angle 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.430
 right and a working depth of 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.930
 only 5 and 6 cm labor 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.240
 Fiscal Soldiers still requires less of 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.080
 power that newspapers exists and in 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.720
 rolling between 6 and 16 km time have all 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.900
 a lot of ground in a day have 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.270
 started in the fall with a lack of 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.950
 disc is more aggressive so we 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.480
 goes but wide and better the residues with 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.310
 the ground the idea is always to have a 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.240
 deterioration in risk transformation 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.800
 in organic matter 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.860
 because as long as we want to summit we 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.250
 needs contact between the seed 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.320
 general one can directly so in 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.600
 doing a job in the fall that with 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.780
 a sharper angle at the 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.060
 record we are going we will turn over the ground 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.860
 the surface for really but the stake 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.480
 is incorporated our surface residues of 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.010
 soil we want close to know a layer 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.690
 of success on the surface that can leave 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.760
 with wine or with us we want 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.560
 really integrate it 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.620
 on the surface in the spring we are going 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.819
 work to warm the soil 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.079
 the moment we can go there with the 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.340
 more vertical language 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.019
 we need less strength that's what 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.849
 moment there to do the work our 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.120
 residues are already sliced what we want 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.459
 it's airy then on these dates bet a 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.980
 little bit the surface of the ground to have 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:17.010
 the finest grains at the height of 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.959
 sowing and the most notes 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.079
 big salaries surface to prevent 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.079
 erosion
