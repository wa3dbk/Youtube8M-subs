bit I added a few new pedals this in
particular<00:00:19.410> when<00:00:19.859> you're<00:00:20.010> using<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.430> wah-wah

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
particular when you're using a wah-wah

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.939 
particular when you're using a wah-wah
pedal<00:00:21.350> sometimes<00:00:22.350> what'll<00:00:22.710> happen<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
pedal sometimes what'll happen is the

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.390 
pedal sometimes what'll happen is the
the<00:00:25.949> highs<00:00:26.160> will<00:00:26.519> kind<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.880> jump<00:00:27.710> too<00:00:28.710> high<00:00:28.920> so

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
the highs will kind of jump too high so

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:45.860
