my friends is why we say this bike has a

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:17.340 
my friends is why we say this bike has a
penis

it<00:00:17.890> is<00:00:18.160> so<00:00:18.490> awesome<00:00:20.009> to<00:00:21.009> pull<00:00:21.279> like<00:00:21.519> that<00:00:21.759> with

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:22.269 
it is so awesome to pull like that with

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
it is so awesome to pull like that with
authority<00:00:22.949> from<00:00:23.949> that<00:00:24.220> speed<00:00:24.640> at<00:00:25.419> those<00:00:25.689> rpms

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
authority from that speed at those rpms

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.909 
authority from that speed at those rpms
which<00:00:26.470> are<00:00:26.710> not<00:00:26.919> that<00:00:27.989> crazy<00:00:28.989> I<00:00:29.470> think<00:00:29.800> it's

aggressive pull no not at all we're way

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.180 
aggressive pull no not at all we're way
too<00:00:34.570> high<00:00:35.079> right<00:00:35.290> here<00:00:35.530> to<00:00:35.649> be<00:00:35.739> pulling<00:00:35.950> like

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
too high right here to be pulling like

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.360 
too high right here to be pulling like
that<00:00:36.220> but<00:00:36.970> still<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:37.510> fact<00:00:37.750> remains<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:39.100> bike

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
that but still the fact remains the bike

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.850 
that but still the fact remains the bike
pulled<00:00:39.730> pretty<00:00:40.120> well<00:00:40.390> considering<00:00:40.840> the<00:00:41.380> RPMs

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
pulled pretty well considering the RPMs

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.470 
pulled pretty well considering the RPMs
and<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:43.300> gear<00:00:43.660> that<00:00:44.200> we're<00:00:44.380> in<00:00:44.530> but<00:00:45.480> it

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
and the gear that we're in but it

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.780 
and the gear that we're in but it
doesn't<00:00:46.840> end<00:00:47.020> there

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
doesn't end there

doesn't end there
what<00:00:48.790> happens<00:00:49.180> if<00:00:49.360> we<00:00:49.600> did<00:00:49.780> something<00:00:50.020> like

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
what happens if we did something like

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.970 
what happens if we did something like
this

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.510

or like this first of all those down
ships<00:00:56.880> are<00:00:57.030> super<00:00:57.330> smooth<00:00:57.630> we<00:00:58.290> love<00:00:58.530> it

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.609 

hang<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.560> a<00:01:01.590> second

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.550 

that's<00:01:06.219> a<00:01:06.310> sipper<00:01:06.520> collect<00:01:06.820> for<00:01:07.030> you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
this video is about to go to a slightly

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.219 
this video is about to go to a slightly
different<00:01:23.979> level<00:01:24.460> you<00:01:24.610> guys<00:01:25.510> may<00:01:25.780> not<00:01:25.960> want<00:01:26.170> to

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
different level you guys may not want to

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:45.870 
different level you guys may not want to
come<00:01:26.380> along<00:01:26.650> for<00:01:26.890> this<00:01:27.100> journey<00:01:44.580> just<00:01:45.580> keep<00:01:45.759> in

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
come along for this journey just keep in

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.969 
come along for this journey just keep in
mind<00:01:45.910> by<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.330> way<00:01:46.450> that<00:01:47.380> wasn't<00:01:47.740> even<00:01:47.800> a

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
mind by the way that wasn't even a

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.370 
mind by the way that wasn't even a
maximum<00:01:48.550> acceleration<00:01:48.850> I<00:01:49.509> could<00:01:50.229> actually

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
maximum acceleration I could actually

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.230 
maximum acceleration I could actually
pull<00:01:50.770> even<00:01:51.009> harder<00:01:51.280> than<00:01:51.399> that<00:01:51.580> as<00:01:51.820> you'll<00:01:52.030> see

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
pull even harder than that as you'll see

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.779 
pull even harder than that as you'll see
in<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.420> second<00:01:52.840> let's<00:01:53.320> go<00:01:53.440> again<00:01:53.680> third<00:01:53.950> gear<00:01:54.130> 65

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
in a second let's go again third gear 65

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:55.560 
in a second let's go again third gear 65
miles<00:01:55.000> per<00:01:55.149> hour

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
miles per hour

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.029 
miles per hour
second<00:01:56.229> gear<00:01:56.380> 65<00:01:57.130> miles<00:01:57.460> per<00:01:57.700> hour<00:01:57.789> and<00:01:59.039> run

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
second gear 65 miles per hour and run

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.070 
second gear 65 miles per hour and run
all<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.460> way<00:02:00.490> back<00:02:00.610> we're<00:02:01.390> in<00:02:01.479> position<00:02:01.750> right

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
all the way back we're in position right

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.240 
all the way back we're in position right
now<00:02:02.550> and<00:02:03.840> we're<00:02:04.840> right<00:02:05.020> at<00:02:05.170> our<00:02:05.289> max<00:02:05.770> torque<00:02:06.100> I

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
now and we're right at our max torque I

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.850 
now and we're right at our max torque I
think<00:02:06.460> of<00:02:06.520> ten<00:02:06.640> thousand<00:02:07.000> two<00:02:07.060> hundred<00:02:07.090> no

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
think of ten thousand two hundred no

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.380 
think of ten thousand two hundred no
12,600<00:02:08.860> anyway

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.530 

there<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.540> thing<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:18.000> was<00:02:19.000> strictly<00:02:19.300> using

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
there is a thing I was strictly using

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.770 
there is a thing I was strictly using
the<00:02:19.750> quick<00:02:19.930> shifter<00:02:20.110> on<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:21.280> run<00:02:21.550> or<00:02:22.450> that

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
the quick shifter on that run or that

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.300 
the quick shifter on that run or that
pull<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.290> little<00:02:26.560> lumpy<00:02:26.740> me

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
pull and it's a little lumpy me

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.720 
pull and it's a little lumpy me
reminiscence<00:02:28.500> every<00:02:29.500> gear<00:02:29.800> shift<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.520> can

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
reminiscence every gear shift you can

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.830 
reminiscence every gear shift you can
feel<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.330> man

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
feel it man

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.480 
feel it man
and<00:02:32.290> let<00:02:32.410> me<00:02:32.500> explain<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:32.980> guys<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.340> foot

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
and let me explain you guys the foot

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.830 
and let me explain you guys the foot
shift<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.820> maybe<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.060> guys<00:02:34.300> never<00:02:34.570> used<00:02:34.780> the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
shift and maybe you guys never used the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.450 
shift and maybe you guys never used the
quick<00:02:34.960> shifter<00:02:35.080> before<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:35.710> the<00:02:36.160> way<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.400> works

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
quick shifter before so the way it works

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.970 
quick shifter before so the way it works
is<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:38.640> simply<00:02:39.640> kick<00:02:40.420> off<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:41.110> shifter<00:02:41.590> at

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
is you simply kick off the shifter at

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.950 
is you simply kick off the shifter at
any<00:02:42.130> point<00:02:42.460> of<00:02:42.490> time<00:02:42.550> you<00:02:42.700> want<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.870> don't

difference<00:04:51.750> when<00:04:51.870> you<00:04:51.960> look<00:04:51.990> at<00:04:52.200> a<00:04:52.230> when<00:04:53.100> you

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
difference when you look at a when you

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.070 
difference when you look at a when you
look<00:04:53.340> at<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:55.010> typical<00:04:56.010> inline-four<00:04:56.820> like<00:04:57.390> they

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
look at a typical inline-four like they

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.100 
look at a typical inline-four like they
require<00:04:58.440> high<00:04:58.770> rpms<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.670> really<00:05:00.050> you<00:05:01.050> know

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
require high rpms to really you know

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.470 
require high rpms to really you know
give<00:05:01.590> you<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.890> full<00:05:02.160> deal<00:05:03.650> so<00:05:05.000> it's<00:05:06.000> nice<00:05:06.270> to

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
give you the full deal so it's nice to

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.700 
give you the full deal so it's nice to
know<00:05:06.570> that<00:05:06.750> this<00:05:06.870> bike<00:05:07.140> if<00:05:07.350> you<00:05:07.410> look<00:05:07.560> at<00:05:07.650> the

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
know that this bike if you look at the

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.310 
know that this bike if you look at the
torque<00:05:07.980> curve<00:05:08.190> it<00:05:09.180> almost<00:05:09.450> goes<00:05:09.750> straight<00:05:10.260> up

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
torque curve it almost goes straight up

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.500 
torque curve it almost goes straight up
like<00:05:10.800> in<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.280> beginning<00:05:11.430> I<00:05:11.940> mean<00:05:12.240> it's<00:05:12.420> a

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
like in the beginning I mean it's a

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.110 
like in the beginning I mean it's a
cliff<00:05:12.810> man<00:05:13.080> I<00:05:13.230> think<00:05:13.290> this<00:05:13.730> screams<00:05:14.730> for<00:05:15.030> the

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
cliff man I think this screams for the

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.760 
cliff man I think this screams for the
sky<00:05:15.390> right<00:05:16.320> away<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:17.610> that<00:05:18.360> is<00:05:18.570> just<00:05:18.870> so<00:05:19.290> so

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
sky right away and that is just so so

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.030 
sky right away and that is just so so
awesome<00:05:20.390> so<00:05:21.390> a<00:05:21.660> lot<00:05:21.960> of<00:05:22.080> low-end<00:05:22.290> grunt<00:05:22.770> enough

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
awesome so a lot of low-end grunt enough

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.490 
awesome so a lot of low-end grunt enough
to<00:05:23.190> get<00:05:23.340> a<00:05:23.370> symmetrical<00:05:24.170> engine

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.470 

the<00:05:28.500> power<00:05:28.770> curve<00:05:29.040> is<00:05:29.280> just<00:05:29.310> so<00:05:29.700> impressive<00:05:30.210> on

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
the power curve is just so impressive on

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.350 
the power curve is just so impressive on
you<00:05:30.690> getting<00:05:30.870> power<00:05:31.200> all<00:05:31.860> over<00:05:32.550> you<00:05:33.240> know

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
you getting power all over you know

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.910 
you getting power all over you know
there<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:33.930> power<00:05:34.530> banner<00:05:34.800> so<00:05:35.930> it's<00:05:36.930> just<00:05:37.290> it

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
there the power banner so it's just it

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.350 
there the power banner so it's just it
seems<00:05:38.190> like<00:05:38.370> you<00:05:38.490> have<00:05:38.610> power<00:05:38.880> whenever<00:05:39.180> you

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
seems like you have power whenever you

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.420 
seems like you have power whenever you
need<00:05:39.540> it<00:05:39.570> you<00:05:40.350> know<00:05:40.560> it's<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:40.860> most<00:05:41.040> except

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
need it you know it's the most except

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.730 
need it you know it's the most except
aside<00:05:41.700> life<00:05:41.940> compared<00:05:42.900> to<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.110> bigger<00:05:43.380> one

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
aside life compared to the bigger one

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.320 
aside life compared to the bigger one
without<00:05:43.890> like<00:05:44.550> you<00:05:45.240> know<00:05:45.360> whatever<00:05:45.650> and

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
without like you know whatever and

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.820 
without like you know whatever and
you<00:05:48.599> don't<00:05:48.960> need<00:05:49.110> a<00:05:49.169> ship<00:05:49.409> this<00:05:49.530> month's

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
you don't need a ship this month's

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.999 
you don't need a ship this month's
position<00:05:50.250> Torquay<00:05:50.580> bike<00:05:50.759> tour<00:05:51.360> P<00:05:51.479> side<00:05:51.690> and

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
position Torquay bike tour P side and

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.469 
position Torquay bike tour P side and
the<00:05:53.009> power<00:05:53.190> is<00:05:53.490> throughout<00:05:53.879> the<00:05:54.090> Ring<00:05:54.270> it's

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
the power is throughout the Ring it's

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.210 
the power is throughout the Ring it's
not<00:05:54.690> just<00:05:54.960> a<00:05:55.289> little<00:05:55.560> and<00:05:55.800> it<00:05:55.889> gets<00:05:56.009> too<00:05:56.099> high

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
not just a little and it gets too high

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.760 
not just a little and it gets too high
on<00:05:56.430> it<00:05:56.580> then<00:05:56.789> we<00:05:56.970> could<00:05:57.030> get<00:05:57.389> sweet<00:05:57.629> not<00:05:58.199> at<00:05:58.349> all

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
on it then we could get sweet not at all

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.540 
on it then we could get sweet not at all
so<00:05:59.840> that's<00:06:00.840> what<00:06:01.560> makes<00:06:01.770> this<00:06:01.889> bike<00:06:02.069> feel

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
so that's what makes this bike feel

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.700 
so that's what makes this bike feel
really<00:06:02.789> awesome<00:06:02.940> but<00:06:03.720> beyond<00:06:04.050> that<00:06:04.169> this<00:06:04.590> is

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
really awesome but beyond that this is

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.050 
really awesome but beyond that this is
one<00:06:04.830> thing<00:06:05.009> that<00:06:05.069> I<00:06:05.220> have<00:06:05.370> to<00:06:05.460> say<00:06:05.639> I'm<00:06:05.909> going

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
the fact that this bike is just

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:21.010 
the fact that this bike is just
who<00:06:15.699> delivers<00:06:16.699> on<00:06:17.540> all<00:06:18.010> accounts<00:06:19.630> on<00:06:20.630> all
