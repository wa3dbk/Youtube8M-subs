from<00:01:01.990> one<00:01:02.200> year<00:01:03.239> pretty<00:01:04.239> much<00:01:04.420> hated<00:01:04.660> that<00:01:04.870> and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
from one year pretty much hated that and

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.630 
from one year pretty much hated that and
ended<00:01:05.290> up<00:01:05.350> switching<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.800> the<00:01:05.890> oboe<00:01:06.220> in

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
ended up switching to the oboe in

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.140 
ended up switching to the oboe in
seventh<00:01:07.120> grade<00:01:07.150> mostly<00:01:07.990> thinking<00:01:08.260> that<00:01:08.440> oh<00:01:09.150> I

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
seventh grade mostly thinking that oh I

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.640 
seventh grade mostly thinking that oh I
didn't<00:01:10.600> really<00:01:10.780> know<00:01:10.900> what<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.080> was<00:01:11.260> so<00:01:11.620> I

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
didn't really know what it was so I

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.570 
didn't really know what it was so I
thought<00:01:11.740> I'd<00:01:12.130> be<00:01:12.250> cool<00:01:12.870> so<00:01:13.870> I<00:01:13.900> did<00:01:14.140> that

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
thought I'd be cool so I did that

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.969 
thought I'd be cool so I did that
7th<00:01:15.580> through<00:01:15.729> 10th<00:01:15.970> grade<00:01:16.210> and<00:01:16.390> then<00:01:16.920> was<00:01:17.920> very

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
7th through 10th grade and then was very

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.760 
7th through 10th grade and then was very
lucky<00:01:18.460> that<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.610> oboe<00:01:18.910> got<00:01:19.150> me<00:01:19.270> into<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
lucky that the oboe got me into the

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.020 
lucky that the oboe got me into the
North<00:01:20.979> Carolina<00:01:21.070> School<00:01:21.520> of<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:21.610> Arts<00:01:21.670> which

and it was a real revelation and I
really<00:03:59.540> from<00:03:59.959> that<00:04:00.110> moment<00:04:00.290> on<00:04:00.590> I<00:04:00.920> kind<00:04:01.400> of

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
really from that moment on I kind of

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.949 
really from that moment on I kind of
decided<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:01.910> want<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.180> do<00:04:02.300> a<00:04:02.330> project<00:04:02.570> with<00:04:02.780> him

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
decided I want to do a project with him

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.080 
decided I want to do a project with him
playing<00:04:03.140> sousaphone<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:04.610> just<00:04:04.790> took<00:04:04.910> me<00:04:05.060> a

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
playing sousaphone and it just took me a

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.250 
playing sousaphone and it just took me a
long<00:04:05.209> time<00:04:05.269> to<00:04:05.450> get<00:04:05.660> around<00:04:05.840> to<00:04:05.930> figuring<00:04:06.230> out

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
long time to get around to figuring out

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.590 
long time to get around to figuring out
how<00:04:06.350> to<00:04:06.440> do<00:04:06.590> it<00:04:06.769> but<00:04:06.950> in<00:04:07.790> between<00:04:08.090> that<00:04:08.360> I<00:04:08.390> moved

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
how to do it but in between that I moved

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.580 
how to do it but in between that I moved
to<00:04:08.660> New<00:04:08.750> York<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.170> I<00:04:09.200> did<00:04:09.350> a<00:04:09.410> whole<00:04:09.530> bunch

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
to New York and I did a whole bunch

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.199 
to New York and I did a whole bunch
other<00:04:09.739> things<00:04:10.040> but<00:04:10.250> I<00:04:10.459> always<00:04:10.850> had<00:04:11.000> that<00:04:11.030> in

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
other things but I always had that in

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.289 
other things but I always had that in
the<00:04:11.299> back<00:04:11.420> of<00:04:11.450> my<00:04:11.600> mind<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.820> at<00:04:13.820> some<00:04:14.030> point<00:04:14.239> I

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
the back of my mind and at some point I

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:15.490 
the back of my mind and at some point I
just<00:04:14.329> started<00:04:14.690> writing<00:04:14.930> a<00:04:15.019> bunch<00:04:15.140> of<00:04:15.230> music

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
just started writing a bunch of music

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.380 
just started writing a bunch of music
with<00:04:15.590> that<00:04:15.709> in<00:04:15.860> mind<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.220> got<00:04:16.609> Jake's<00:04:16.850> Marsalis

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
with that in mind I got Jake's Marsalis

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.520 
with that in mind I got Jake's Marsalis
to<00:04:17.450> play<00:04:17.600> drums<00:04:17.900> who<00:04:18.019> i've<00:04:18.140> been<00:04:18.260> playing<00:04:18.410> with

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
to play drums who i've been playing with

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.300 
to play drums who i've been playing with
for<00:04:18.620> many<00:04:19.100> years<00:04:19.250> and<00:04:20.079> I<00:04:21.079> was<00:04:21.890> thinking<00:04:22.190> maybe

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
for many years and I was thinking maybe

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.340 
for many years and I was thinking maybe
sousaphone<00:04:22.790> in<00:04:23.060> Oregon<00:04:23.570> would<00:04:23.810> be<00:04:23.930> an<00:04:24.020> amazing

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
sousaphone in Oregon would be an amazing

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.719 
sousaphone in Oregon would be an amazing
combination<00:04:24.560> because<00:04:25.070> they<00:04:25.310> can<00:04:25.460> both<00:04:25.610> play

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
combination because they can both play

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.360 
combination because they can both play
bass<00:04:26.030> I<00:04:26.300> think<00:04:27.080> of<00:04:27.169> both<00:04:27.290> be<00:04:27.500> soloists<00:04:28.070> and<00:04:28.160> you

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
bass I think of both be soloists and you

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.400 
bass I think of both be soloists and you
would<00:04:28.490> have<00:04:28.640> this<00:04:28.820> kind<00:04:29.060> of<00:04:29.090> double<00:04:29.360> bass<00:04:29.630> idea

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
would have this kind of double bass idea

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.380 
would have this kind of double bass idea
which<00:04:30.740> is<00:04:30.860> part<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:31.340> double<00:04:31.520> lies<00:04:31.760> about<00:04:32.060> in

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
which is part of a double lies about in

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.760 
which is part of a double lies about in
addition<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:32.780> being<00:04:32.900> about<00:04:33.140> a<00:04:33.169> double-wide

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
addition to being about a double-wide

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.600 
addition to being about a double-wide
trailer<00:04:34.210> so<00:04:35.210> I<00:04:36.080> really<00:04:36.919> wanted<00:04:37.100> music<00:04:37.250> and

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
because half of the band was in New
