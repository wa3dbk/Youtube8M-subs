00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
school gate so we were wanted to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.480 
school gate so we were wanted to
encourage<00:01:06.780> children<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.260> walk<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.920> school<00:01:07.950> and

and maybe with slogans to encourage
parents<00:01:17.970> not<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.540> park<00:01:18.810> at<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> school<00:01:19.350> so

yellow<00:01:30.390> lines<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.530> think<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.950> message<00:01:32.369> from

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
yellow lines and I think a message from

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.120 
yellow lines and I think a message from
a<00:01:32.909> child<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.570> parent<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:34.110> very<00:01:34.500> very<00:01:34.770> strong

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
a child to a parent is very very strong

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.899 
a child to a parent is very very strong
I<00:01:35.990> love<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> because<00:01:37.229> we're<00:01:38.070> told<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.790> see

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
I love it because we're told we can see

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.310 
I love it because we're told we can see
over<00:01:39.060> cars<00:01:39.390> when<00:01:39.780> you've<00:01:39.900> got<00:01:40.079> small<00:01:40.259> children

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
over cars when you've got small children

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.260 
over cars when you've got small children
coming<00:01:40.829> out<00:01:40.950> they<00:01:41.130> can't<00:01:41.340> see<00:01:41.460> over<00:01:41.579> care<00:01:41.880> so

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
coming out they can't see over care so

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.249 
coming out they can't see over care so
they<00:01:42.390> don't<00:01:42.570> know<00:01:42.630> what's<00:01:42.780> good<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.990> go<00:01:43.079> around

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
they don't know what's good to go around

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.380 
they don't know what's good to go around
the<00:01:43.350> corner<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.829> think<00:01:44.430> children<00:01:44.820> need<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.329> be

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the corner I think children need to be

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.880 
the corner I think children need to be
aware<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.750> they<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.350> actually<00:01:46.470> educate

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
aware and they can actually educate

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.179 
aware and they can actually educate
their<00:01:47.310> parents<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.820> knew<00:01:51.590> because<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.860> car<00:01:53.070> is

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
their parents I knew because the car is

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.300 
their parents I knew because the car is
a<00:01:53.220> park<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:53.880> W

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
a park and on W

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.910 
a park and on W
lines<00:01:54.640> and<00:01:54.970> some<00:01:55.240> huge<00:01:55.689> hitch<00:01:56.110> or<00:01:56.470> knock<00:01:56.680> down

the one is the crossing line and one is

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.120 
the one is the crossing line and one is
the<00:02:40.330> walking<00:02:40.660> nine<00:02:40.840> we<00:02:41.440> leave<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.709> crossers

the walking nine we leave the crossers
across<00:02:42.700> first<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.180> all<00:02:43.299> and<00:02:43.780> we<00:02:43.870> leave<00:02:44.049> the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
across first of all and we leave the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.229 
across first of all and we leave the
walkers<00:02:44.560> follow<00:02:45.190> on<00:02:45.370> after<00:02:45.670> pass<00:02:45.819> so<00:02:46.090> we're

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
walkers follow on after pass so we're

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.990 
walkers follow on after pass so we're
holding<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.630> traffic<00:02:46.989> for<00:02:47.200> about<00:02:47.709> maybe<00:02:48.430> five

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
holding the traffic for about maybe five

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.809 
holding the traffic for about maybe five
minutes<00:02:49.390> in<00:02:49.630> total<00:02:49.810> they<00:02:50.470> know<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.920> schedule

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
minutes in total they know the schedule

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.170 
minutes in total they know the schedule
now<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:52.299> they<00:02:52.480> just<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:53.290> just<00:02:53.349> flows<00:02:53.920> in<00:02:54.180> well

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
now so they just it just flows in well

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.360 
now so they just it just flows in well

or definitely very very easily once you

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.150 
or definitely very very easily once you
have<00:03:16.569> the<00:03:16.690> cooperation<00:03:16.840> of<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.410> school<00:03:17.739> and

really<00:03:31.750> good<00:03:32.049> I

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
really good I

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.309 
really good I
every<00:03:34.340> school<00:03:34.640> should<00:03:34.670> really<00:03:35.150> do<00:03:35.359> it<00:03:35.510> every

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
every school should really do it every

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.259 
every school should really do it every
school<00:03:36.560> should<00:03:36.590> be<00:03:36.920> doing<00:03:37.159> this<00:03:37.280> as<00:03:37.579> a<00:03:37.909> matter

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
school should be doing this as a matter

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.959 
school should be doing this as a matter
of<00:03:38.420> audience<00:03:38.810> II<00:03:39.340> because<00:03:40.340> there<00:03:40.730> is<00:03:40.849> the

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:40.969 
of audience II because there is the

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:42.459 
of audience II because there is the
practical<00:03:41.420> thing<00:03:41.629> of<00:03:41.780> leaving<00:03:42.139> the<00:03:42.260> school

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:42.469 
practical thing of leaving the school

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:43.869 
practical thing of leaving the school
but<00:03:42.709> again<00:03:42.950> is<00:03:43.099> what<00:03:43.249> I<00:03:43.280> said<00:03:43.579> you<00:03:43.760> know

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
but again is what I said you know

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.300 
but again is what I said you know
there's<00:03:44.209> educating<00:03:45.109> people<00:03:45.290> as<00:03:45.739> well<00:03:46.069> about

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
there's educating people as well about

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.580 
there's educating people as well about
road<00:03:46.730> safety<00:03:46.760> that's<00:03:47.659> a<00:03:47.780> big<00:03:47.930> aspect<00:03:48.109> of<00:03:48.409> it

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
road safety that's a big aspect of it

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.259 
road safety that's a big aspect of it
and<00:03:48.769> I<00:03:48.859> think<00:03:48.920> this<00:03:49.189> school<00:03:49.400> is<00:03:49.459> an<00:03:49.700> example<00:03:50.030> to

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
and I think this school is an example to

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.019 
and I think this school is an example to
every<00:03:50.510> school<00:03:50.750> in<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:50.989> country
