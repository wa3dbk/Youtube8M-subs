 the specifics of the work is the same 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.090
 Valery Yurievich in this depot at the station 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.460
 more on worked most of his

 head of the depot, he went back to work 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.540

 repair depot to ordinary passenger not 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.610
 get there but the one who came here once 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.930
 I could not part with the railway 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.450
 yourself under your own 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.610
 road builder my grandfather was a machinist father

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.509
 let's say 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.759
 love life dear to me 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.620
 work it is in repair they are in trouble 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.240
 workers from the dynasty who went on 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.100

 repair locomotive depot a lot of each 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.000
 the second can talk about how here 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.650
 he worked his father or grandfather oiled 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.360
 working clothes and fuel oil on hands from 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.010

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.040
 especially for labor and labor 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.660
 so that she does not miss may be 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.100
 tool wrench 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.930
 remove and install engines 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.030
 diesel locomotives they have to manually and and 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.030
 crane helps to lift heavy parts 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.769
 however, recently the staff of this depot 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.420
 figured out how to get close to 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.219
 hard-to-reach locomotive parts 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.599
 rationalization proposal now 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:04.930
 zest repair shop 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.030
 of this launcher snaps for 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.620
 at the same time these works of ours or 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.200
 briefly that answer 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.719
 to clearly all the jack worked 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.389
 at the same time there was no one 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:18.099
 8 jacks collected by local Kulibin 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.260
 we work as one only 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.879
 it is safe to lift 120 ton 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.739
 iron machine to work system 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.840
 the staff is preparing the whole shift true 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.939
 lifting itself takes no more than 5 minutes 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.590
 this installation can be called unique 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.750
 similar from only Petrozavodsk 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.370
 The main difference between the jacks in the market is they 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.109
 not purchased by developers but compiled and 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.329
 here by the hands of locksmiths and craftsmen 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.879
 electricians are amazing but during the shift 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.840
 they don't dream about rest about how else 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:46.319
 improve 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:49.959
 dream work process to accomplish 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:55.169
 could much still have butter works that 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.169
 can still be put down from time 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.030
 flowers on the windows and no smell 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.710
 fuel oil is probably the only difference 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.870
 workshops where engines are assembled 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.210
 Few people know that between 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.470
 a work locomotive depot 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.020
 railway workers are compared with those who 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.550
 sews and puts parachute and technical 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.010
 oddity locomotive pledge 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.520
 most security should sit down and 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.230
 to go 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.570
 that is, he should not think 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.640
 breaks down breaks electric locomotive he 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.800
 should sit down and drive an electric locomotive 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.460
 bring after all threw the train from point a to 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.050

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.350
 I could not imagine a profession for myself

 this is not house 2 at all 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.080
