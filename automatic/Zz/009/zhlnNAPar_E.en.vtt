take the foil and roll it down you can

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.310 
take the foil and roll it down you can
do<00:05:07.900> this<00:05:08.050> with<00:05:08.110> parchment<00:05:08.590> paper<00:05:08.950> also<00:05:10.320> and

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
do this with parchment paper also and

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.900 
do this with parchment paper also and
all<00:05:11.710> you're<00:05:11.920> doing<00:05:12.240> is<00:05:14.100> this<00:05:15.100> way<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.520> chicken

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
all you're doing is this way the chicken

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.930 
all you're doing is this way the chicken
will<00:05:16.630> seem<00:05:17.130> so<00:05:18.130> it<00:05:18.220> gives<00:05:18.370> it<00:05:18.610> just<00:05:18.640> a<00:05:18.910> little

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
will seem so it gives it just a little

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.450 
will seem so it gives it just a little
bit<00:05:19.270> of<00:05:19.540> a<00:05:19.630> different<00:05:19.660> flavor<00:05:20.230> it'll<00:05:21.100> cook<00:05:21.310> it

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
bit of a different flavor it'll cook it
