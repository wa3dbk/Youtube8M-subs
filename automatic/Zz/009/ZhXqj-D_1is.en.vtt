 fresh first ks also out by mine 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.389
 things chor met or so to speak 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.720
 I accidentally discovered in the organic store 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.060

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.680
 daily barley grass on powder to me 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.529
 just taken a bit of water 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.330
 interrogated and then drunk and how 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.210
 said I happened to be in one then 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.750
 bioladen barley juice guests grass 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.079
 discovered that is also offered to her like 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.040
 as different herbs have that too 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.870
 already suffered a bit 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.100
 He'll transport you a bit now 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.379
 it just looks like it kinked 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.120
 that's what I wanted you to do 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.750
 short and what do I tell you before 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.360
 show how I use it so first 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.250
 gras belongs to the family of the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.379
 sweet grasses it includes one 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.610
 incredible amount of nutrients 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.729
 vitamins minerals enzymes and 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.770
 antioxidants 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.140
 So I have read Japanese 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.549
 Scientist has over 200 greens 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.140
 examined leafy vegetables and thereby 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.030
 found that first grass more 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.700
 Minerals more for family more 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.240
 enzymes more trace elements more clear 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.820
 for what contains 199 ppm as the others 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.630
 leafy vegetables has examined and also 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.030
 so unbelievable, one of them 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.060
 incredible nutrient dense so it 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.119
 includes, for example, pascal team 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.490
 affects eleven times more than cow's milk and 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.829
 The value of the iron is 5 times 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.920
 higher than spinach or broccoli, too 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.290
 vitamin c managers thus have the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.680
 highest vitamin c content is my first 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.810
 Krass has more vitamin C than 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.880
 orange also in sync with the zinc content 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.439
 first circle has about the same 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.520
 amount like that like the zinc-containing one 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.640
 food of animal origin so 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.099
 really really great food 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.590
 a super food so to speak so it can 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:17.280
 but with the basic foods 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.379
 that there is at all regularly 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.780
 you can take with these guests 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.770
 cars or the barley juice powder even 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.970
 its minerals the premiums 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:32.010
 I already mentioned earlier 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:34.230
 have custom cars antioxidants ie the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.670
 Cells become free radical and 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.230
 also protected toxin and at all 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.000
 custom cars strengthen the cells of the whole 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.819
 protect the cells of the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.420
 immune system and there are many studies 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.640
 the on the health-promoting 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.599
 effects of the first grass or even that 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.700
 point first powder powder and there 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.330
 I've had bacon small itself 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.330
 I do not care much 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.690
 now ad hoc just go again 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.590
 That's why I just read it 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.750
 what study there is proven what 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.030
 what was the barley grade 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.440
 grass for a positive 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.810
 health promoting effect has to 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.970
 a stimulating and invigorating one 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.150
 activated effect on the immune system 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.330
 first casting metabolism it in poisons 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.370
 Blood and tissue promotes calcium in 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.379
 the bones are strongly vases 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.110
 licher already mentioned lowers the 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:34.379
 cholesterol levels stimulates the formation of blood 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.599
 is also a good prevention against 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:38.580
 cancer then as said the 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.220
 antioxidant effect of the enzymes 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.420
 activates self-healing powers 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.140
 improved main picture so it helps too 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.659
 against psoriasis neurodermatitis 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.819
 Helps only in hair loss builds stress 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.140
 and tensions listened to sleep 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.330
 increases the ability to concentrate 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.849
 So it has an absolute super food 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.129
 So far-reaching health 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.379
 detoxify effectively building the cell 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.599
 and detoxify and anti-inflammatory 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.620
 antibacterial relaxing 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.440

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.630
 over the streets crass powder 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.490
 Of course that also helps 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.540
 can also help you well 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.130
 acid-base balance of an organism 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.720
 balance or optimize so 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.990
 if you can do that over a longer period of time 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.990
 occupies 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.900
 Of course I do not know exactly what 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.400
 the japanese scientist 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.740
 examined which green leafy vegetables 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.470
 if as synonymous image reader here 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.030
 were or wild herbs because too straight 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.490
 the wild herbs are so incredible 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.800
 rich in nutrients the incredible there 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.400
 there is no actually no 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.199
 cultural plant so I am 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.690
 I use collect yes have more for 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.220
 smoothies or for procures that has 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.419
 Now let down the juices I do 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.340
 me again mainly green 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.100

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:24.060
 similar if similar he pens 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:27.180
 Nutrient density thus have to be used 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.610
 of the first casa forget racing you 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.099
 For example, you can get barley juice 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.760
 chop the salad when you close 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:38.669
 can it also be bold or green 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.500
 just mix with fruit as you like 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.250
 But there are no limits to fantasy 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.010
 set 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:48.120
 I'll show you something with it now 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.419
 Several times I have already done in

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.099
 something I do with it yet 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:24.190
 so i have the potty custom now 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:27.490
 Cars and you are liable the amount is 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.940
 very low but it is a high one 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:33.280
 Nutrient density is included 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:37.210
 powerful fresh green elixir and 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:49.690
 this i sign here now my mine 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:53.370
 glass book why drink beer? 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:56.860
 Drink coconuts and this combination 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.570
 Drink that is so awesome so while 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.460
 my father's pushed me that way 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:03.160
 that was so incredibly solidarized 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:13.770
 given a kick and I give the war 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:17.650

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.200
 mineral rich has many like david 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:30.610
 many vital substances and this combination 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:34.180
 that's I think that's hard to do 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:36.480
 with anything else so that's it 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.480
