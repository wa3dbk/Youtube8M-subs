00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.930 
out to be Star Wars related there are a
few<00:01:56.420> possibilities<00:01:56.870> of<00:01:57.140> what<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.620> could<00:01:57.860> be

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
few possibilities of what it could be

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.190 
few possibilities of what it could be
considering<00:01:58.940> ryan<00:01:59.330> Johnson<00:01:59.900> is<00:02:00.050> already

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
considering ryan Johnson is already

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.530 
considering ryan Johnson is already
attached<00:02:00.800> to<00:02:01.040> episode<00:02:01.430> 8<00:02:01.610> that's<00:02:01.820> obviously

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
attached to episode 8 that's obviously

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.810 
attached to episode 8 that's obviously
out<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.260> episode<00:02:03.710> 9<00:02:03.920> is<00:02:04.190> totally<00:02:04.790> a

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
out so episode 9 is totally a

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.510 
out so episode 9 is totally a
possibility<00:02:05.540> though<00:02:05.750> it<00:02:05.990> is<00:02:06.440> likely<00:02:06.770> that<00:02:07.010> JJ

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
possibility though it is likely that JJ

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.660 
possibility though it is likely that JJ
Abrams<00:02:07.940> would<00:02:08.330> have<00:02:08.630> first<00:02:09.350> dibs<00:02:09.680> on<00:02:09.950> that<00:02:10.040> one

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
Abrams would have first dibs on that one

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.970 
Abrams would have first dibs on that one

forward with the Star Wars storyline and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.250 
forward with the Star Wars storyline and
create<00:02:27.980> new<00:02:28.010> characters<00:02:28.790> instead<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.840> going

create new characters instead of going
back<00:02:30.560> another<00:02:31.190> possibility<00:02:31.760> would<00:02:32.180> be<00:02:32.300> the

back another possibility would be the
