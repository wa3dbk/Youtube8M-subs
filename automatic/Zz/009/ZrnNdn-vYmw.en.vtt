more<00:00:15.349> technology<00:00:16.340> so<00:00:17.000> if<00:00:17.210> we<00:00:17.240> don't<00:00:17.540> use

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779

feedback<00:03:45.440> is<00:03:45.770> so<00:03:45.890> important<00:03:46.340> if<00:03:46.460> you<00:03:46.580> have<00:03:46.610> to

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
feedback is so important if you have to

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.550 
feedback is so important if you have to
wait<00:03:46.970> two<00:03:47.480> days<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.930> grade<00:03:48.110> a<00:03:48.140> set<00:03:48.350> of<00:03:48.440> papers

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
wait two days to grade a set of papers

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.320 
wait two days to grade a set of papers
and<00:03:48.860> give<00:03:48.950> it<00:03:49.070> back<00:03:49.160> to<00:03:49.340> them<00:03:49.370> half<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.150> time

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
and give it back to them half the time

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.550 
and give it back to them half the time
they<00:03:50.510> have<00:03:50.660> forgotten<00:03:50.870> what<00:03:51.260> they<00:03:51.380> needed

they have forgotten what they needed
done<00:03:51.830> and<00:03:52.220> so<00:03:52.640> they<00:03:52.790> can't<00:03:53.060> apply<00:03:53.450> the

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
done and so they can't apply the

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.000 
done and so they can't apply the
mistakes<00:03:54.050> they've<00:03:54.260> made<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.650> sometimes<00:03:54.920> they

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
mistakes they've made and sometimes they

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.050 
mistakes they've made and sometimes they
don't<00:03:55.100> even<00:03:55.250> look<00:03:55.430> at<00:03:55.550> the<00:03:55.640> check<00:03:55.850> they<00:03:56.000> see

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
don't even look at the check they see

don't even look at the check they see
the<00:03:56.240> check<00:03:56.420> markets<00:03:56.750> wrong<00:03:56.930> they<00:03:57.110> move<00:03:57.260> on

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
the check markets wrong they move on

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.990 
the check markets wrong they move on
they<00:03:57.830> don't<00:03:58.010> look<00:03:58.160> to<00:03:58.310> see<00:03:58.460> what<00:03:58.670> they've<00:03:58.850> done

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
they don't look to see what they've done

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.450 
they don't look to see what they've done
incorrectly<00:03:59.300> but<00:04:00.020> having<00:04:00.410> that<00:04:00.440> immediate<00:04:01.190> oh

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
incorrectly but having that immediate oh

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.060 
incorrectly but having that immediate oh
I<00:04:02.120> was<00:04:02.420> wrong<00:04:02.600> see<00:04:03.290> if<00:04:03.380> I<00:04:03.440> can<00:04:03.560> figure<00:04:03.680> out<00:04:03.830> why

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
I was wrong see if I can figure out why

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.970 
I was wrong see if I can figure out why
I<00:04:04.100> was<00:04:04.250> wrong<00:04:04.580> we<00:04:05.450> know<00:04:05.720> that<00:04:06.050> if<00:04:06.230> they<00:04:06.470> involve

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
I was wrong we know that if they involve

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.350 
I was wrong we know that if they involve
themselves<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.880> they're<00:04:08.030> going<00:04:08.270> to

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
themselves that they're going to

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.420 
themselves that they're going to
remember<00:04:08.540> it<00:04:08.870> i<00:04:09.170> mean<00:04:09.320> it's<00:04:09.530> from<00:04:09.770> that<00:04:09.980> thing

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
remember it i mean it's from that thing

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.970 
remember it i mean it's from that thing
show<00:04:10.910> me<00:04:11.120> how<00:04:11.270> have<00:04:11.660> me<00:04:11.870> do<00:04:12.080> it<00:04:12.320> and<00:04:12.530> I'll

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
show me how have me do it and I'll

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.430 
show me how have me do it and I'll
remember<00:04:13.520> it<00:04:13.550> I'll<00:04:13.850> learn<00:04:14.120> it<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.570> with

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
remember it I'll learn it and with

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.470 
remember it I'll learn it and with
technology<00:04:16.220> they're<00:04:16.609> they're<00:04:17.060> willing

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
technology they're they're willing

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.720 
technology they're they're willing
participants<00:04:18.109> it

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
participants it

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.720 
participants it
a<00:04:19.050> fabulous<00:04:20.050> tool<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.980> be<00:04:21.100> able<00:04:21.130> to<00:04:21.400> integrate

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
a fabulous tool to be able to integrate

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.400 
a fabulous tool to be able to integrate
into<00:04:22.300> every<00:04:22.990> curricular<00:04:23.890> area<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:25.260> we<00:04:26.260> think

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
into every curricular area and we think

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.680 
into every curricular area and we think
it<00:04:26.590> has<00:04:26.950> a<00:04:27.310> ton<00:04:27.550> of<00:04:27.580> potential<00:04:27.940> in<00:04:28.240> classrooms

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
it has a ton of potential in classrooms

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.350 
it has a ton of potential in classrooms
to<00:04:28.870> help<00:04:29.020> students<00:04:29.500> become<00:04:29.680> better<00:04:29.830> learners

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
to help students become better learners

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.670 
to help students become better learners
it's<00:04:31.360> great<00:04:31.540> to<00:04:31.720> hear<00:04:31.870> kids<00:04:32.140> say<00:04:32.260> this<00:04:32.530> is

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
it's great to hear kids say this is

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.010 
it's great to hear kids say this is
awesome<00:04:33.190> this<00:04:33.400> is<00:04:33.550> cool<00:04:33.820> well<00:04:34.300> we're<00:04:34.720> doing

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
awesome this is cool well we're doing

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.230 
awesome this is cool well we're doing
this<00:04:35.140> prime<00:04:35.920> factorization<00:04:36.880> did<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.060> show

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
this prime factorization did you show

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.440 
this prime factorization did you show
the<00:04:37.420> pool<00:04:37.600> from<00:04:37.720> alpha<00:04:38.110> they<00:04:38.230> go<00:04:38.350> awesome<00:04:39.070> oh

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
the pool from alpha they go awesome oh

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.900 
the pool from alpha they go awesome oh
okay<00:04:40.450> and<00:04:41.260> and<00:04:41.770> I<00:04:41.860> have<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.190> fill<00:04:42.430> in<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.700> side

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
okay and and I have to fill in the side

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.430 
okay and and I have to fill in the side
is<00:04:43.120> that<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.300> composite<00:04:43.960> or<00:04:44.050> a<00:04:44.080> prime<00:04:44.410> number

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
is that a composite or a prime number

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.760 
is that a composite or a prime number
and<00:04:45.390> quickly<00:04:46.390> review<00:04:46.720> what<00:04:46.750> that<00:04:47.080> is<00:04:47.260> this<00:04:47.560> is

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
and quickly review what that is this is

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.350 
and quickly review what that is this is
so<00:04:48.040> cool<00:04:48.430> yeah<00:04:48.910> that<00:04:49.390> works<00:04:49.630> uh-huh
