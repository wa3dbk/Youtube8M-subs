like my party right so bubble tea was
one<00:05:53.900> example<00:05:54.169> where<00:05:54.350> we're<00:05:54.800> not<00:05:54.830> that's<00:05:55.340> a

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
one example where we're not that's a

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.490 
one example where we're not that's a
trend<00:05:55.610> entire<00:05:55.940> class<00:05:56.330> it's<00:05:57.020> more<00:05:57.400> like<00:05:58.400> coffee

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500
