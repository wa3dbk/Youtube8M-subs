00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.890
 for here is a very short video 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.370
 concerning but the in- country phase 'the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.110
 after 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.960
 in fact I said I'll stop there 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.490
 but I'm doing this little video 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.049
 extra because I received a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.270
 official mail with the little 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:24.960
 marianne about my eyes and poor's 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.840
 which is actually considered a site 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.920
 dangerous by the authorities 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.059
 so for the little story I had 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.360
 I had made a mail for for 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.579
 to alert the authorities a little 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.960
 asking if there really were 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.960
 risks if it was a site 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:50.010
 here is said a little bit how to say 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.910
 lake 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.940
 If they were known at the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.460
 their software etc 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.109
 so I got this answer an answer 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.430
 quite private so I can not the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.330
 communicate I do not want to make a copy 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.770
 mail screen of course but saying 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.920
 that this site is considered 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.200
 dangerous and that the fact that they are 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.430
 also hosted abroad that everything 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.369
 manage from abroad it's going to be very 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.710
 complicated to find money 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.170
 invested in case of failure so 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.290
 I strongly invite of course all 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.110
 participants in this site will do very 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.460
 watch out if you invest money 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.320
 because we do not know when it's going 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.930
 kept going off when it's going to close 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.210
 so as I'm already going to say that can 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.369
 last for a while what they are going 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.540
 win are the ones who will have invested 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.240
 a lot of money that will have arrived at 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.899
 famous 1900 easter that began to 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.130
 generate some income they get 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.470
 will certainly come out with a little 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.299
 quite obvious benefit for others 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.000
 it's more complicated because for 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.689
 to reach the 1200 steps that it is already necessary 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.840
 reinvest a lot a lot 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.250
 so it's going to take a lot of time 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.710
 that you see on the internet the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.090
 most of the people who are in this 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.500
 system 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.700
 actually looking for a lot of parents 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.649
 do a lot of advertising to get 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.120
 sponsorship because the money 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.420
 sponsorships allows them to reinvest 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.390
 faster 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.739
 the proportion that we give them for 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.080
 buying their pack and arrive well 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.989
 more quickly 1200 easter but that wants 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.950
 to say that the people behind all those who 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.849
 invest a few hundred euros 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.099
 here and there 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.280
 they are almost certain that they 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.900
 believe they ultimately have second 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.269
 something about mrs haidar usa 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.510
 weigh me my experience ends in 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:40.870
 the sense that I was not going to invest a lot 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.980
 and I arrived at the end of my period 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.650
 30-day trial to know that I have 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.130
 lost what I had invested but good 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.610
 no matter 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.739
 no matter why just for 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.519
 the good reason it takes after 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.410
 these 30 days take a subscription 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.120
 if you do not react in this 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.620
 subscription 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.519
 vopak does not bring you anything so in 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.260
 done you can not continue to 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.739
 how to say to generate income 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.709
 daily than slow that normally 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.359
 promise you so that means it takes 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.810
 again reinject something to 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.010
 subscription level 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.049
 Then you have to know that 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.950
 when you transfer money from even 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.440
 haidar teasing weighs at vx getaway on you 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.209
 take something and that when you 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.849
 want to get the money out of vix getaway on 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.340
 takes you on average three and a half 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.900
 three nights per cent so I believe the 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.870
 fresh so the fees are pretty 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.340
 important you still need to know 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.050
 It's okay 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.730
 if you do not have big money 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.890
 you have you are not going to feel 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.180
 spend if you have big money 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.980
 obviously a priori it's not a big 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.720
 big impact but I still tell you 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.540
 once on all of the people who 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.790
 them who are in my dying loses in this 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.560
 moment especially in France there is none 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.910
 enormously who are 1200 cadoule arnal 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.050
 of the court that made him a group this 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.870
 which normally is totally forbidden 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.350
 did a group to be able to arrive 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.880
 quickly to his 1200 easter between 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.830
 parentheses I contacted the management 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.920
 to meiser grabs weighs that in a 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.590
 first time replied that that 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.430
 actually he is looked at this after 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.900
 sedera it was not necessarily something 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.320
 authorize thing in my down under 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.000
 taipei except that in the meantime I had a 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.130
 little thyme bar saying I needed 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.290
 translate etc etc 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.370
 so I told them I could 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.530
 give them my help there was no 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.680
 sure problem that it looks like 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:48.910
 take a lot of time and I think 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.800
 that how to say salvation will come 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.080
 not on that side cian salvation 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.760
 will come rather in my opinion either from 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.940
 French authorities who will put the 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.440
 nose in and that will quickly make 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.220
 cleaning up and realizing that it's a 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.660
 nice scam or rather associations 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.810
 consumers who seem to be 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.330
 Virulent enough in the end of 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.860
 consumer and there are some 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.290
 there is only to choose but there are plenty 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.220
 others you go to the site 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.280
 I know since it's as if but a 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.070
 site that lists all the associations 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.550
 of consumers in France and at 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.080
 departments and 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.830
 I think that on this side there is some 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.110
 thing to do because um if he ever 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.670
 are scams that are triggered 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.440
 with procedures they will have 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:40.310
 a lot of work and so they prefer 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.050
 in my opinion see things upstream 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:47.310
 So that was it for the my part 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.600
 advertising paint last thing I 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.850
 think what is happening 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:56.430
 m to a paid magazine will certainly 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:06:00.330
 get to the kiwi casters 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.120
 that is to say that we made a small 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.960
 group on the internet we are in the process of 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.760
 build a record of engaging 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.010
 proceedings 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.350
 justice is long enough so it's 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.490
 complicated one makes play full of leverage 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.730
 that is to say that it is the 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.850
 consumer associations the CGCDC 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.570
 etc. 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.570
 finally a lot of things 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:25.560
 well, that's it takes a little while 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:27.750
 this is so in France but without any void 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.970
 doubt that it will eventually lead to 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:34.380
 simply because we have a lot 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:36.270
 of elements because the person of 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.360
 Kevin of the court is very controversial and 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:43.590
 there is frankly what we have not 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.669
 badly of proof is that in the end I think 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.690
 that when you have several 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:51.419
 associations or several institutions 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:54.389
 we will say legal in France who 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:57.240
 will interest me I think we have a good 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:58.229
 chance to succeed here as usual 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.810
 wait and see 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:02.130
 sometimes I have news 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.060
 contradictory I correct for 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.440
 the moment you've seen on all my 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.680
 videos i'm not going to have to be 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.650
 contradictory if there are comments 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.009
 contradictory but every time I 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.909
 answer so everything is transparent 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:16.500
 so that's it if it's new in a 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:16.830
 sense or in the other I give them to 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.310
 soon 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.310
 goodbye
