00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.620
 we're going to get out of the stalk 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.740
 sowing and called 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.840
 turn large 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.240
 so those are beautiful roses from below 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:24.930
 I mean outside in the garden we have 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:27.630
 a private prostitutes in the ground and 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.550
 from honey at about 15 centimeters 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.359
 from each other 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.359
 three is enough 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.390
 and we do a bit boring because 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.219
 it's a nice trick that you say 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.879
 that it is much easier child because that 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.149
 are just holding water well 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.149
 push a little 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.230
 we go we are not so very fine seed 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.469
 fortunately not too close sidewall the must 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.449
 way too many things because every one of you 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.580
 still needs a few inches of it 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.920
 next endured 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:14.400
 and they remain very small then we scatter 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.799
 just got very thin off those with the same 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:30.299
 they have soil that has feathers 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:33.200
 they've done a little pressing it 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.850
 board of the sun have the place weeks 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.100
 I don't care much so just a little bit 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:44.750
 the salt comes into good contact with crowds 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.750
 with those are grounds around it 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.350
 the most important thing is that it is late 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.350
 make to dirk 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.760
 do not spray the skin because it floats 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.360
 a lot away so you better have a few 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.720
 come back some new wetting top 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.830
 really well drenched and then with this 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.160
 warm weather 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.979
 sunny weather then it should do more often 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.970
 certainly a few more times in tomorrow 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.170
 a few times the day after tomorrow not a total shock 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.170
 because those things are so dried up 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.240
 stricter eggs are nicely grown 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.130
 on the big side 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.530
 so it 's time to go 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:33.480
 harvest whatever you want to know that you get 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.920
 like youth not all simultaneously 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.210
 to harvest 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:43.740
 Christian will let you stand for a while 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:46.530
 Of course the stem onions are called one 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.190
 save neighborhood 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:55.080
 my mother look twice as big 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.640
 city mia look a little bit 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.070
 made it taste natural all the way 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.540
 no matter maybe they have something too 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.540
 much in the shade 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.239
 but so whatever it is 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.239
 then they became
