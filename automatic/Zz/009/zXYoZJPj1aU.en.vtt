00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.690 

hello<00:00:01.020> guys<00:00:01.170> calculator<00:00:01.740> here<00:00:02.010> today<00:00:02.520> I<00:00:02.550> want

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
hello guys calculator here today I want

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.059 
hello guys calculator here today I want
to<00:00:02.760> show<00:00:02.879> you<00:00:02.939> guys<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.179> new<00:00:03.780> feature<00:00:04.680> or

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
to show you guys a new feature or

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.519 
to show you guys a new feature or
actually<00:00:05.700> it's<00:00:05.790> not<00:00:05.879> very<00:00:05.940> new<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.779> be<00:00:06.899> like

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
actually it's not very new to be like

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.770 
actually it's not very new to be like
about<00:00:07.770> week<00:00:08.069> old<00:00:08.280> or<00:00:08.490> so<00:00:08.610> it's<00:00:09.540> called<00:00:09.719> the

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
about week old or so it's called the

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.440 
about week old or so it's called the
custom<00:00:10.230> mode<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.130> custom<00:00:11.490> mode<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.969> a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
custom mode and the custom mode is a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.270 
custom mode and the custom mode is a
projection<00:00:12.960> mode<00:00:13.259> but<00:00:13.559> it's<00:00:13.740> different<00:00:14.130> from

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
projection mode but it's different from

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.799 
projection mode but it's different from
all<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.519> other<00:00:14.639> projection<00:00:15.089> modes<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.690> way

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
all the other projection modes in a way

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.380 
all the other projection modes in a way
that<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.740> define<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.220> shape<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
that you define the shape of the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.939 
that you define the shape of the
projection<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.050> basically<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.529> custom<00:00:19.800> mode

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
projection so basically the custom mode

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.810 
projection so basically the custom mode
is<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.609> mode<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.210> which<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.720> can<00:00:21.900> say<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.410> want<00:00:23.039> a

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
is a mode in which you can say I want a

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.300 
is a mode in which you can say I want a
sphere<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.109> want<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> triangle<00:00:25.859> or<00:00:25.980> whatever

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
sphere I want a triangle or whatever

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.670 
sphere I want a triangle or whatever
shape<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.670> want<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:28.109> can<00:00:28.349> define<00:00:28.619> your

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
shape you want and you can define your

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.640 
shape you want and you can define your
shape<00:00:28.859> by<00:00:29.369> simply<00:00:30.179> by<00:00:30.630> clicking<00:00:30.840> one<00:00:31.199> point<00:00:31.500> in

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
shape by simply by clicking one point in

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.560 
shape by simply by clicking one point in
the<00:00:31.710> world<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.550> right<00:00:32.759> clicking<00:00:33.000> another

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the world and right clicking another

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.560 
the world and right clicking another
point<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.930> world<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.440> then<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:36.059> go<00:00:36.239> ahead

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
point in the world and then you go ahead

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.130 
point in the world and then you go ahead
and<00:00:37.520> shift<00:00:38.520> right<00:00:38.670> click<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.210> then<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.750> save

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
and shift right click and then you save

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.040 
and shift right click and then you save
all<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.950> points<00:00:41.460> between<00:00:42.059> these<00:00:42.360> two<00:00:42.660> points

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
all the points between these two points

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.279 
all the points between these two points
into<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:44.100> custom<00:00:44.489> mode<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:46.110> kind<00:00:46.260> of

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
into the custom mode so it's kind of

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.650 
into the custom mode so it's kind of
like<00:00:46.550> brought<00:00:47.550> edit<00:00:47.879> where<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.180> define<00:00:48.300> two

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
like brought edit where you define two

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.830 
like brought edit where you define two
points<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.289> then<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.730> select<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.149> area

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
points and then you select the area

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.760 
points and then you select the area
within<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.469> two<00:00:52.620> points<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.690> now<00:00:54.690> now<00:00:55.620> that

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
within the two points and now now that

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.060 
within the two points and now now that
we<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.780> basically<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:57.989> saved<00:00:58.230> off<00:00:58.440> field

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
we have basically we saved off field

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.700 
we have basically we saved off field
points<00:00:59.489> into<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.789> custom<00:01:00.420> mode<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.500> can

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
points into the custom mode as you can

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.830 
points into the custom mode as you can
see<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.980> says<00:01:02.129> field<00:01:02.820> size<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.210> 55<00:01:03.570> blocks

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
see it says field size of 55 blocks

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.440 
see it says field size of 55 blocks
which<00:01:04.110> means<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.860> tree<00:01:05.159> there<00:01:05.369> takes<00:01:06.270> about

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
which means that tree there takes about

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.000 
which means that tree there takes about
about<00:01:07.200> 55<00:01:07.590> blocks

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
about 55 blocks

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.200 
about 55 blocks
space<00:01:09.229> now<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.590> put<00:01:10.740> them<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.310> mode<00:01:11.610> into

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
space now we can put them this mode into

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.330 
space now we can put them this mode into
the<00:01:12.510> projector<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.010> can<00:01:14.100> see<00:01:14.250> from

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the projector and as you can see from

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.260 
the projector and as you can see from
projector<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.030> will<00:01:15.180> protect<00:01:15.750> random<00:01:16.409> shapes

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
projector it will protect random shapes

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.340 
projector it will protect random shapes
specifying<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> custom<00:01:19.200> mode

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
specifying that this is a custom mode

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.859 
specifying that this is a custom mode
and<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.650> doesn't<00:01:19.920> know<00:01:20.040> which<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.970> know<00:01:21.060> what

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
and it doesn't know which you know what

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.719 
and it doesn't know which you know what
shape<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.890> actually<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.310> bug<00:01:23.549> a

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
shape it is this is actually not a bug a

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.640 
shape it is this is actually not a bug a
lot<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:23.970> people<00:01:24.180> asked<00:01:24.750> me<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.020> asked<00:01:25.500> me

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
lot of people asked me but asked me

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.160 
lot of people asked me but asked me
about<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.180> so<00:01:27.180> let's<00:01:28.130> turn<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.340> thing<00:01:29.400> on

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
about that so let's turn this thing on

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.230 
about that so let's turn this thing on
now<00:01:31.170> as<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:31.950> see<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.310> projected<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.939> tree

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
now as you can see it projected a tree

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.590 
now as you can see it projected a tree
and<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:34.619> top<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> bit<00:01:35.130> cut<00:01:35.520> off<00:01:35.640> because<00:01:35.880> I

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and the top is a bit cut off because I

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.690 
and the top is a bit cut off because I
should<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.290> placed<00:01:37.860> my<00:01:38.100> grass<00:01:38.400> block<00:01:38.670> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
should have placed my grass block a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.340 
should have placed my grass block a
little<00:01:38.909> bit<00:01:39.000> higher<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:40.229> this

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
little bit higher but for this

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.810 
little bit higher but for this
demonstration<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:41.189> don't<00:01:41.369> think<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.640> matters

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
demonstration I don't think that matters

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.620 
demonstration I don't think that matters
much

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
much

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.569 
much
as<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.380> see<00:01:43.500> here<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> tree<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.490> like

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
as you can see here is a tree just like

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.999 
as you can see here is a tree just like
that<00:01:44.820> tree<00:01:45.090> except<00:01:45.869> without<00:01:46.259> top<00:01:47.060> now<00:01:48.860> you<00:01:49.860> can

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
that tree except without top now you can

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.859 
that tree except without top now you can
use<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.820> project<00:01:51.119> anything<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.689> like

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
use this to project anything you like

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.289 
use this to project anything you like
anything<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.860> select<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:53.640> project<00:01:53.939> it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
anything you select it can project it

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.539 
anything you select it can project it
and<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:55.170> cool<00:01:55.380> thing<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.159> use<00:01:56.189> this

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
and the cool thing is you can use this

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.490 
and the cool thing is you can use this
to<00:01:56.880> build<00:01:57.060> structures<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.990> replicate

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
to build structures and replicate

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.520 
to build structures and replicate
different<00:01:59.250> buildings<00:01:59.880> if<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.869> have<00:02:01.110> any<00:02:01.350> done

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
different buildings if you have any done

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.730 
different buildings if you have any done
is<00:02:01.700> simply<00:02:02.700> place<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.659> field<00:02:04.229> stabilizer

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
is simply place in the field stabilizer

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.859 
is simply place in the field stabilizer
module<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.549> as<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.420> see<00:02:06.479> here<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.780> will

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
module and as you can see here it will

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.760 
module and as you can see here it will
start<00:02:06.960> building<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:08.220> actual<00:02:08.369> tree<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.770> what

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
start building the actual tree and what

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.010 
start building the actual tree and what
would<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.129> build<00:02:11.430> out<00:02:11.580> well<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.599> need<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.900> of

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
would it build out well you need to of

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.740 
would it build out well you need to of
course<00:02:13.050> apply

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
course apply

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.920 
course apply
resource<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:14.710> yet<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.950> place<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.400> chest<00:02:15.930> adjacent

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
resource so yet a place a chest adjacent

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.650 
resource so yet a place a chest adjacent
to<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.110> projector<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.820> it<00:02:18.820> needs<00:02:19.030> well<00:02:19.450> this

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
to the projector and it needs well this

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.860 
to the projector and it needs well this
is<00:02:19.780> pretty<00:02:19.990> loud<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:22.030> needs<00:02:22.210> to<00:02:22.420> have<00:02:22.600> the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
is pretty loud it needs to have the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.230 
is pretty loud it needs to have the
resource<00:02:23.380> so<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:23.800> had<00:02:24.040> oak<00:02:24.280> leaves<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:24.880> oak

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
resource so I had oak leaves and oak

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.210 
resource so I had oak leaves and oak
wood<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.870> as<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:26.530> can<00:02:26.620> see<00:02:26.710> here<00:02:26.800> is<00:02:26.950> using

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
wood and as you can see here is using

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.670 
wood and as you can see here is using
the<00:02:27.490> oak<00:02:27.640> leaves<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.030> oak<00:02:28.180> wood<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:29.140> build

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
the oak leaves and oak wood to build

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.199 
the oak leaves and oak wood to build
this<00:02:30.040> tree<00:02:31.560> yeah<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:33.610> is<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.760> very<00:02:33.970> nice

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
this tree yeah so this is a very nice

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.110 
this tree yeah so this is a very nice
way<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:34.840> can<00:02:35.290> possibly<00:02:35.770> duplicate<00:02:36.640> buildings

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
way you can possibly duplicate buildings

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.340 
way you can possibly duplicate buildings
or<00:02:38.010> build<00:02:39.010> stuff<00:02:39.280> some<00:02:40.150> easily<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:41.140> can<00:02:41.200> also

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
or build stuff some easily you can also

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.940 
or build stuff some easily you can also
use<00:02:41.800> things<00:02:42.610> like<00:02:42.790> let's<00:02:43.390> say<00:02:43.600> use<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.410> sphere

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
use things like let's say use a sphere

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.320 
use things like let's say use a sphere
module<00:02:46.230> which<00:02:47.230> we<00:02:47.350> can<00:02:47.470> find<00:02:47.709> here<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.520> if<00:02:49.180> you

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
module which we can find here and if you

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.210 
module which we can find here and if you
put<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.690> sphere<00:02:49.989> module<00:02:50.470> let's<00:02:50.800> say<00:02:50.890> we<00:02:51.040> want

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
put the sphere module let's say we want

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.550 
put the sphere module let's say we want
a<00:02:51.250> sphere<00:02:51.520> about<00:02:51.910> three<00:02:52.540> blocks<00:02:52.720> wide<00:02:53.170> you

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
a sphere about three blocks wide you

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.920 
a sphere about three blocks wide you
just<00:02:53.739> turn<00:02:53.920> this<00:02:54.040> off<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:56.130> let's<00:02:57.130> say<00:02:57.660> okay<00:02:58.660> no

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
just turn this off and let's say okay no

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.500 
just turn this off and let's say okay no
model<00:02:59.140> that's<00:02:59.260> like<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.440> bigger<00:02:59.620> six<00:03:00.510> blocks

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
model that's like a bigger six blocks

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.900 
model that's like a bigger six blocks
now<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.440> will<00:03:02.650> build<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:03.040> sphere<00:03:03.340> out<00:03:03.550> of<00:03:03.700> leaves

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
now it will build a sphere out of leaves

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.630 
now it will build a sphere out of leaves
and<00:03:06.900> it's<00:03:07.900> gonna<00:03:08.050> take<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.290> while<00:03:08.470> because<00:03:08.709> the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
and it's gonna take a while because the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.370 
and it's gonna take a while because the
stabilizer<00:03:10.090> module<00:03:10.480> slows<00:03:10.900> down<00:03:11.170> the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
stabilizer module slows down the

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.280 
stabilizer module slows down the
building<00:03:12.040> process<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.489> makes<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.290> actually

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
building process and makes it actually

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.070 
building process and makes it actually
it<00:03:14.410> makes<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.709> very<00:03:14.860> expensive

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
it makes it very expensive

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.300 
it makes it very expensive
now<00:03:17.080> let's<00:03:17.320> uh<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.620> think<00:03:17.799> we're<00:03:17.980> running<00:03:18.100> out

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
now let's uh I think we're running out

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.750 
now let's uh I think we're running out
of<00:03:18.340> wood<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:19.330> just<00:03:19.750> let<00:03:20.110> me<00:03:20.140> just<00:03:20.320> put<00:03:20.470> some

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
of wood so just let me just put some

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.620 
of wood so just let me just put some
wood<00:03:21.760> back<00:03:22.000> in<00:03:22.180> here<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.620> some<00:03:23.620> leaves<00:03:23.980> and

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.229 

the<00:03:28.630> point<00:03:28.840> is<00:03:28.959> oh<00:03:29.230> well<00:03:29.920> it<00:03:30.459> kind<00:03:30.940> of<00:03:30.970> looks<00:03:31.150> a

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
the point is oh well it kind of looks a

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.640 
the point is oh well it kind of looks a
bit<00:03:31.269> weird<00:03:31.690> right<00:03:31.780> now<00:03:32.080> because<00:03:32.290> it's<00:03:32.500> making

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
bit weird right now because it's making

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.630 
bit weird right now because it's making
a<00:03:32.860> I'm<00:03:33.070> wrecked<00:03:33.459> both<00:03:33.760> wood<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.420> leaves<00:03:35.640> the

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
a I'm wrecked both wood and leaves the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.430 
a I'm wrecked both wood and leaves the
thing<00:03:37.030> special<00:03:37.450> about<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:37.720> custom<00:03:38.140> mode<00:03:38.290> is

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
thing special about the custom mode is

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.550 
thing special about the custom mode is
that<00:03:38.910> if<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:40.090> use<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:40.420> custom<00:03:40.750> mode<00:03:40.930> it<00:03:41.230> will

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
that if you use the custom mode it will

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.890 
that if you use the custom mode it will
build<00:03:41.830> whatever<00:03:42.790> material<00:03:43.660> that<00:03:43.810> the

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
build whatever material that the

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.350 
build whatever material that the
original<00:03:44.440> structure<00:03:45.100> is<00:03:45.190> made<00:03:45.370> out<00:03:45.489> so<00:03:46.180> for

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
original structure is made out so for

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.390 
original structure is made out so for
example<00:03:46.630> that<00:03:46.720> tree<00:03:46.989> is<00:03:47.620> made<00:03:47.799> out<00:03:47.980> wooden

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
example that tree is made out wooden

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.710 
example that tree is made out wooden
leaves<00:03:48.579> is<00:03:48.880> gonna<00:03:49.120> build<00:03:49.360> out<00:03:49.480> of<00:03:49.510> water

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
leaves is gonna build out of water

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.970 
leaves is gonna build out of water
leaves<00:03:49.989> and<00:03:50.230> it's<00:03:50.410> gonna<00:03:50.530> place<00:03:50.709> it<00:03:50.860> in<00:03:50.920> the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
leaves and it's gonna place it in the

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.100 
leaves and it's gonna place it in the
correct<00:03:51.160> position<00:03:51.579> but<00:03:52.030> if<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.239> use<00:03:52.450> modes

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
correct position but if you use modes

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.880 
correct position but if you use modes
like<00:03:54.000> cube<00:03:55.000> sphere<00:03:55.450> or<00:03:55.690> generic<00:03:56.320> stuff<00:03:56.650> it

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
like cube sphere or generic stuff it

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.190 
like cube sphere or generic stuff it
will<00:03:57.100> make<00:03:57.670> it<00:03:57.820> randomly<00:03:58.269> out<00:03:58.390> of<00:03:58.660> whatever

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
will make it randomly out of whatever

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.490 
will make it randomly out of whatever
blocks<00:03:59.530> you<00:03:59.650> put<00:03:59.799> in<00:03:59.890> the<00:03:59.950> chest<00:04:00.160> so<00:04:01.500> custom

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
blocks you put in the chest so custom

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.740 
blocks you put in the chest so custom
mode<00:04:02.650> yeah<00:04:02.950> more<00:04:03.160> often<00:04:03.519> and<00:04:03.730> you<00:04:04.269> have<00:04:04.420> you

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
mode yeah more often and you have you

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.370 
mode yeah more often and you have you
can<00:04:04.870> specify<00:04:05.110> more<00:04:05.850> things<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:08.170> cool

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
can specify more things and the cool

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.560 
can specify more things and the cool
part<00:04:08.620> about<00:04:08.680> this<00:04:09.010> is<00:04:09.310> let<00:04:09.880> me<00:04:09.940> just<00:04:10.090> destroy

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
part about this is let me just destroy

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.390 
part about this is let me just destroy
this<00:04:10.750> tree<00:04:10.989> for<00:04:11.140> us<00:04:11.230> by<00:04:11.500> just<00:04:11.769> integrating<00:04:12.280> it

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
this tree for us by just integrating it

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.030 
this tree for us by just integrating it
and<00:04:13.060> gone<00:04:14.519> we<00:04:15.519> can<00:04:15.730> rotate<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.720> tree<00:04:17.079> so<00:04:17.739> let's

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
and gone we can rotate the tree so let's

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.539 
and gone we can rotate the tree so let's
rotate<00:04:18.430> about<00:04:18.760> 64<00:04:19.510> degrees<00:04:19.540> and<00:04:20.250> there<00:04:21.250> there

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
rotate about 64 degrees and there there

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.279 
rotate about 64 degrees and there there
will<00:04:21.729> be<00:04:21.760> some<00:04:22.030> holes<00:04:22.240> here<00:04:22.450> because<00:04:22.870> the

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
will be some holes here because the

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:23.760 
will be some holes here because the
rotation

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
rotation

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.969 
rotation
Algren<00:04:24.700> needs<00:04:25.479> a<00:04:25.570> bit<00:04:25.720> improvement<00:04:26.560> and<00:04:26.710> stuff

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
Algren needs a bit improvement and stuff

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:27.870 
Algren needs a bit improvement and stuff
but<00:04:27.220> for

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
but for

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.630 
but for
demonstration<00:04:28.480> I'm<00:04:28.750> just<00:04:29.470> gonna<00:04:29.560> show<00:04:29.770> you<00:04:29.830> so

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
demonstration I'm just gonna show you so

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.570 
demonstration I'm just gonna show you so
let's<00:04:31.360> put<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.920> stabilizers<00:04:32.920> module<00:04:33.280> in<00:04:33.370> and

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
let's put the stabilizers module in and

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.280 
let's put the stabilizers module in and
as<00:04:33.760> you<00:04:33.850> can<00:04:33.940> see<00:04:34.090> it's<00:04:34.300> gonna<00:04:34.390> start<00:04:34.690> building

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
as you can see it's gonna start building

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.440 
as you can see it's gonna start building
the<00:04:35.680> tree<00:04:36.210> rotated<00:04:37.210> by<00:04:37.510> 64<00:04:38.320> degrees

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
the tree rotated by 64 degrees

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.420 
the tree rotated by 64 degrees
horizontally<00:04:40.450> and<00:04:40.800> this<00:04:41.800> is<00:04:41.950> a<00:04:42.010> nice<00:04:42.190> feature

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
horizontally and this is a nice feature

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.580 
horizontally and this is a nice feature
for<00:04:42.970> let's<00:04:43.360> say<00:04:43.510> if<00:04:43.660> you<00:04:43.750> wanna<00:04:43.900> if<00:04:44.320> you<00:04:44.440> have<00:04:44.530> a

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
for let's say if you wanna if you have a

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.590 
for let's say if you wanna if you have a
castle<00:04:45.070> or<00:04:45.250> you<00:04:45.400> have<00:04:45.520> a<00:04:45.610> long<00:04:45.850> wall<00:04:46.270> or

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
castle or you have a long wall or

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.420 
castle or you have a long wall or
something<00:04:46.780> something<00:04:47.560> really<00:04:47.740> big<00:04:47.980> that<00:04:48.220> you

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
something something really big that you

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.860 
something something really big that you
don't<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:48.700> build<00:04:48.850> manually<00:04:49.270> you<00:04:49.840> can

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
don't to build manually you can

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.640 
don't to build manually you can
basically<00:04:50.560> scan<00:04:51.480> that<00:04:52.480> entire<00:04:52.960> wall<00:04:53.260> or

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
basically scan that entire wall or

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.650 
basically scan that entire wall or
whatever<00:04:53.830> it<00:04:54.070> is<00:04:54.160> and<00:04:54.430> you<00:04:54.820> can<00:04:54.910> rotate<00:04:55.090> it<00:04:55.480> by

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
whatever it is and you can rotate it by

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.870 
whatever it is and you can rotate it by
let's<00:04:55.960> say<00:04:56.020> 90<00:04:56.290> degrees<00:04:56.530> and<00:04:56.790> let's<00:04:57.790> say

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
let's say 90 degrees and let's say

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.370 
let's say 90 degrees and let's say
you're<00:04:58.030> building<00:04:58.180> for<00:04:58.510> okay<00:04:58.840> you<00:04:58.900> can<00:04:59.140> build

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
you're building for okay you can build

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.980 
you're building for okay you can build
like<00:04:59.830> a<00:05:00.070> one<00:05:00.370> wall<00:05:00.730> and<00:05:00.970> it<00:05:01.060> rotated<00:05:01.390> by<00:05:01.480> 90<00:05:01.510> and

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
like a one wall and it rotated by 90 and

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.870 
like a one wall and it rotated by 90 and
then<00:05:02.140> you<00:05:02.350> just<00:05:02.530> build<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.280> other<00:05:03.430> wall<00:05:03.670> and

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
then you just build the other wall and

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.810 
then you just build the other wall and
your<00:05:04.090> wall<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.450> so<00:05:04.600> on<00:05:04.750> so<00:05:05.260> it's<00:05:05.800> a<00:05:05.920> this

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
your wall and so on so it's a this

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.760 
your wall and so on so it's a this
feature<00:05:07.060> you<00:05:07.270> can<00:05:07.300> use<00:05:07.420> it<00:05:07.750> for<00:05:07.960> a<00:05:07.990> couple<00:05:08.560> of

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
feature you can use it for a couple of

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.280 
feature you can use it for a couple of
things<00:05:08.980> I<00:05:09.790> can<00:05:10.360> imagine<00:05:10.450> a<00:05:10.810> lot<00:05:10.840> of

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
things I can imagine a lot of

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.290 
things I can imagine a lot of
possibilities<00:05:11.920> especially<00:05:12.430> if<00:05:12.550> you<00:05:12.820> let's

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
possibilities especially if you let's

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.780 
possibilities especially if you let's
say<00:05:13.420> you<00:05:13.780> want<00:05:13.930> to<00:05:13.960> build<00:05:14.080> a<00:05:14.200> tree<00:05:14.470> and<00:05:14.790> you

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
say you want to build a tree and you

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.240 
say you want to build a tree and you
don't<00:05:15.970> want<00:05:16.210> any<00:05:16.510> leaves<00:05:16.780> at<00:05:16.930> all<00:05:17.080> so<00:05:17.620> let<00:05:18.160> me

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
don't want any leaves at all so let me

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.640 
don't want any leaves at all so let me
just<00:05:18.400> disintegrate<00:05:19.000> this<00:05:19.150> again<00:05:19.590> we<00:05:20.590> should

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
just disintegrate this again we should

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:21.120 
just disintegrate this again we should
be<00:05:20.770> gone

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
be gone

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.780 
be gone
and<00:05:21.780> now<00:05:22.780> a<00:05:22.810> builder<00:05:23.350> free<00:05:23.620> with<00:05:24.160> only<00:05:24.460> the

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
and now a builder free with only the

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:25.350 
and now a builder free with only the
woods

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
woods

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.800 
woods
only<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.110> would<00:05:26.290> not<00:05:26.920> woods<00:05:27.810> long

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
only the would not woods long

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.440 
only the would not woods long
grandmother<00:05:29.380> and<00:05:29.610> you<00:05:30.610> can<00:05:30.730> use<00:05:30.910> this<00:05:31.120> let's

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
grandmother and you can use this let's

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.220 
grandmother and you can use this let's
say<00:05:31.600> you<00:05:31.660> can<00:05:31.960> use<00:05:32.140> this<00:05:32.290> to<00:05:32.530> basically<00:05:33.210> select

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
say you can use this to basically select

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.650 
say you can use this to basically select
only<00:05:35.230> one<00:05:35.770> block<00:05:36.580> by<00:05:36.790> only<00:05:36.970> supplying<00:05:37.390> one

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
only one block by only supplying one

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.160 
only one block by only supplying one
block<00:05:37.870> and<00:05:38.110> it's<00:05:38.860> good<00:05:39.040> for<00:05:39.220> eliminating

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
block and it's good for eliminating

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.020 
block and it's good for eliminating
structures<00:05:41.170> or<00:05:41.860> any<00:05:42.250> type<00:05:42.460> of<00:05:42.490> building<00:05:42.850> and

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
structures or any type of building and

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.090 
structures or any type of building and
just<00:05:43.420> like<00:05:43.570> I<00:05:43.840> can<00:05:44.680> think<00:05:44.830> a<00:05:44.890> lot<00:05:45.040> of

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
just like I can think a lot of

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.670 
just like I can think a lot of
possibilities<00:05:45.700> for<00:05:45.730> this<00:05:46.090> thing<00:05:46.240> so<00:05:46.600> and<00:05:47.200> if

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
possibilities for this thing so and if

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.590 
possibilities for this thing so and if
you<00:05:47.740> have<00:05:47.860> any<00:05:48.010> suggestions<00:05:48.550> for<00:05:48.670> this<00:05:49.360> module

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
you have any suggestions for this module
