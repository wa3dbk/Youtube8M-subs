rituals<00:00:16.080> it's<00:00:17.080> funny<00:00:17.410> I<00:00:17.500> used<00:00:17.590> to<00:00:17.950> have<00:00:18.099> loads

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
rituals it's funny I used to have loads

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.490 
rituals it's funny I used to have loads
I<00:00:18.850> think<00:00:18.910> as<00:00:19.300> you<00:00:19.449> grow<00:00:19.660> older<00:00:19.690> you<00:00:20.199> sort<00:00:20.470> of

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
I think as you grow older you sort of

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.019 
I think as you grow older you sort of
ditched<00:00:20.710> them<00:00:20.949> because<00:00:21.130> you<00:00:21.220> know<00:00:21.369> doesn't

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
ditched them because you know doesn't

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.460 
ditched them because you know doesn't
really<00:00:22.090> affect<00:00:22.480> the<00:00:22.600> game<00:00:22.779> so<00:00:23.050> I<00:00:23.080> used<00:00:23.380> to

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
really affect the game so I used to

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.720 
really affect the game so I used to
start<00:00:23.650> thinking<00:00:23.890> about<00:00:23.949> a<00:00:24.070> game<00:00:24.310> on<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:24.550> first

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
start thinking about a game on the first

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.000 
start thinking about a game on the first
days<00:00:25.029> playing<00:00:25.539> some<00:00:25.779> day<00:00:25.960> but<00:00:26.320> now<00:00:26.590> I<00:00:26.619> start

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
to remember everything and all of that

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.110

from<00:00:53.260> Thursday<00:00:53.800> onwards<00:00:54.160> yeah<00:00:54.610> but<00:00:54.850> you<00:00:54.910> play

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
from Thursday onwards yeah but you play

from Thursday onwards yeah but you play
so<00:00:55.420> many<00:00:55.570> games<00:00:55.719> so<00:00:56.170> it<00:00:56.379> was<00:00:56.500> easy<00:00:56.680> to<00:00:56.829> get<00:00:56.949> into

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
so many games so it was easy to get into

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.160 
so many games so it was easy to get into
a<00:00:57.219> rhythm<00:00:57.399> I<00:00:57.610> could<00:00:57.730> tell<00:00:57.879> you<00:00:57.940> that<00:00:58.059> but<00:00:58.300> it

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
a rhythm I could tell you that but it

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.520 
a rhythm I could tell you that but it
was<00:00:59.289> also<00:01:00.090> took<00:01:01.090> away<00:01:01.300> a<00:01:01.329> bit<00:01:02.079> of<00:01:02.109> energy<00:01:02.289> I

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
was also took away a bit of energy I

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.840 
was also took away a bit of energy I
think<00:01:02.590> because<00:01:03.010> you<00:01:03.129> used<00:01:03.430> spend<00:01:03.670> too<00:01:03.760> much

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
think because you used spend too much

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.639 
think because you used spend too much
time<00:01:03.910> thinking<00:01:04.119> about<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:04.690> game<00:01:04.839> so<00:01:04.869> uh<00:01:05.140> yeah

remember that as well so we have

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.220 
remember that as well so we have
something<00:02:50.989> in<00:02:51.109> common<00:02:51.170> was<00:02:51.530> good<00:02:51.680> both<00:02:53.230> it's

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
something in common was good both it's

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.410 
something in common was good both it's
the<00:02:54.319> toughest<00:02:55.190> opponent<00:02:55.340> you've<00:02:55.970> ever<00:02:56.120> had<00:02:56.299> to

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
the toughest opponent you've ever had to

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.680 
the toughest opponent you've ever had to
play<00:02:56.540> against<00:02:57.639> if<00:02:58.639> I<00:02:58.790> had<00:02:58.879> to<00:02:58.970> pick<00:02:59.150> one<00:02:59.420> I

play against if I had to pick one I

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.050 
play against if I had to pick one I
would<00:02:59.959> probably<00:03:00.440> pick<00:03:00.889> Drogba<00:03:01.790> when<00:03:02.000> he

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
would probably pick Drogba when he

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.970 
would probably pick Drogba when he
played<00:03:02.239> for<00:03:02.269> Chelsea<00:03:02.810> because<00:03:03.409> he<00:03:03.680> was<00:03:03.799> the

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
played for Chelsea because he was the

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.490 
played for Chelsea because he was the
full<00:03:04.159> package<00:03:04.340> she<00:03:04.639> was<00:03:04.760> strong<00:03:05.060> quick<00:03:05.500> quite

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
full package she was strong quick quite

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.349 
full package she was strong quick quite
good<00:03:06.650> in<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.829> ball<00:03:07.040> played<00:03:07.790> for<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.000> good<00:03:08.180> team

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
good in the ball played for a good team

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:09.759 
good in the ball played for a good team
which<00:03:08.720> is<00:03:08.870> always<00:03:09.109> difficult<00:03:09.319> when<00:03:09.590> you're

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
which is always difficult when you're

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.970 
which is always difficult when you're
defending<00:03:10.069> against<00:03:10.430> him<00:03:10.549> so<00:03:10.760> uh<00:03:11.500> yeah<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.739> was

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
defending against him so uh yeah I was

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.930 
defending against him so uh yeah I was
quite<00:03:13.280> pleased<00:03:13.489> when<00:03:13.670> he<00:03:13.700> left<00:03:15.700> what<00:03:16.700> was<00:03:16.819> your

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
quite pleased when he left what was your

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.720 
quite pleased when he left what was your
favorite<00:03:17.389> subject<00:03:17.599> at<00:03:18.170> school<00:03:21.730> probably

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
favorite subject at school probably

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.909 
favorite subject at school probably
gymnast<00:03:23.359> or<00:03:23.629> what<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:23.959> call<00:03:24.079> a<00:03:24.139> PE<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:24.799> go

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919 
gymnast or what you call a PE you go

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:27.280 
gymnast or what you call a PE you go
over<00:03:25.069> here<00:03:25.280> although<00:03:26.239> I<00:03:26.419> enjoyed<00:03:26.810> school<00:03:27.079> I

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
over here although I enjoyed school I

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.150 
over here although I enjoyed school I
enjoyed<00:03:28.040> most<00:03:28.220> subjects<00:03:28.730> but<00:03:28.910> you<00:03:29.599> can't<00:03:30.160> lie

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
enjoyed most subjects but you can't lie

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.460 
enjoyed most subjects but you can't lie
I<00:03:31.359> always<00:03:32.359> enjoyed<00:03:32.690> training<00:03:33.139> and<00:03:33.260> running

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
I always enjoyed training and running

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.830 
I always enjoyed training and running
around<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:33.980> that<00:03:34.010> was<00:03:34.400> probably<00:03:34.810> what<00:03:35.810> I

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
around so that was probably what I

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.699 
around so that was probably what I
