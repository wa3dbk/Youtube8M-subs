so<00:00:01.110> the<00:00:01.530> new<00:00:01.680> controller<00:00:02.040> truly<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:02.850> very

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
so the new controller truly is a very

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.210 
so the new controller truly is a very
amazing<00:00:03.540> piece<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:04.020> kit<00:00:04.200> because<00:00:04.470> it<00:00:04.799> has<00:00:04.980> a

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
amazing piece of kit because it has a

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.130 
amazing piece of kit because it has a
lot<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.400> simple<00:00:06.000> inputs<00:00:06.359> but<00:00:06.600> when<00:00:06.810> we<00:00:06.930> combine

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
lot of simple inputs but when we combine

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.520 
lot of simple inputs but when we combine
them<00:00:07.440> together<00:00:07.589> it<00:00:08.069> becomes<00:00:08.189> really<00:00:08.639> rich<00:00:12.530> we

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
them together it becomes really rich we

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.860
