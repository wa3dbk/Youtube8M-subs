00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.170
 goodnight today we are going to solve them 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:08.349
 the exercise of many decisions 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:15.420
 we started we should every we have the 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:18.500
 numbers 9 17 25 and 33 and collections 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.690
 let's see nine jumps 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.830
 9 is equal 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.830
 1 x 7 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.550
 plus 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:35.640
 this is the same 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.420
 Well, we have 17 and 7 would be 2 x 7 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.329
 plus 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.309
 3 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.860
 27 14 37 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.880
 we have 25 19 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.790
 37 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:01:00.980
 + 43 x 7 21 24 25 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:05.990
 then we have 347 present 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.750
 5 47 28 5 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.960
 33 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:16.800
 and we have the last number 41 equal to 5 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.050
 for 7 more 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.090
 inequality above 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.539
 so 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.460
 to finish that would not follow me if this one 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:31.940
 it's 1234 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.450
 is 4 5 and 6 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:39.710
 and this is repeated 77 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.690
 17 plus 23 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.830
 456 plus 7 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:52.000
 who does not know if in the end if by 742 to 7 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:55.230
 is equal to 40 answer is going to close 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.230
 strength in the hunt 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.020
 we already have the number one solved and 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:07.049
 we passed at least 2 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.049
 number 2 says a classroom 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.220
 are the males 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.790
 80 percent is equal to the fourth 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.510
 part of women from another room not only to 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.550
 women if both rooms are 63 students 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.970
 find the number of males in 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.970
 the 1st 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.680
 so 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.750
 and we solve 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.920
 according to the information they give us 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.920
 we take the data 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.920
 says that 80% 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.320
 the other is equal to a quarter 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.320
 of the women's room 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.970
 so 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:10.790
 this 80% is equal 80 over 100 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:13.440
 men is equal to a women's room 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.390
 Here we take 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.890
 but top down we simplify 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.890
 fourth door 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.160
 we know that four fifths 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.160
 of men is equal to a quarter 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.490
 then we get what 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:41.040
 this we spend for the pay we know that 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:43.460
 men among women equals 5 16 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.460
 years 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.070
 but we also know what 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.360
 but we also know that if both 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.780
 classrooms total 63 students then 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.780
 we take out 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.050
 but we know that men plus women is 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.080
 equal to 63 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.060
 so 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.140
 we know from this 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.140
 we know the following 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.400
 men is the same 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.110
 more men 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.870
 16 fifths 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:38.560
 of men is equal to 63 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.560
 yes 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.630
 just fine we do not have 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.849
 five human men 16 men is 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.160
 equal to 63 for 5 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:55.840
 16 5 is 21 men 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.529
 is equal to 63 times 5 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.729
 twenty-one 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:03.729
 121 33 per 100 with 15 men equals 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.330
 fifteen 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:13.289
 and this is what the area asks us 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:16.309
 men this would be an answer 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.309
 that's all friends
