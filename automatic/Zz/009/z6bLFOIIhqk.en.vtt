00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.749
 in this video you will see how 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.380
 exercises need to do with a puppy 

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:08.940
 up to about 4 months of age 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.920
 the previous series was told by the crisis 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.690
 depending on the person in about 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.610
 age four and a half months 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.949
 the main task of educational 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.170
 dog training up to 4 months of age this 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.900
 preparing a puppy dependency crisis 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.840
 man is the first thing a puppy is usually taught 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.270
 this team sit hair give me a paw sometimes 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.519
 still teaches the command to lie and this 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.380
 wrong since at this moment 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.480
 a major mistake is made which 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.430
 is to put the head of the corner 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.890
 directly learning specific 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.690
 teams instead of developing y 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.450
 puppy readiness and ability to 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.800
 learning is readiness for learning 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.850
 determined by more common 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.710
 characteristics 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.750
 motivation of trust in a person 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.360
 switching focus 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.460
 the main positive motivations that 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.719
 used in dog training this 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.789
 food is the usual names darwin thought 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.800
 . 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.409
 it is important to understand that the physiological 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.779
 need for example hunger and motivation 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.179
 for example, food motivation is not one and 

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:11.100
 the same motivation is focus 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:13.380
 needs for a particular object or 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.270
 concrete action is just hungry 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.609
 the dog is looking for food everywhere 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.340
 dog with good food training 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:22.409
 motivation seeking food from a person or waiting 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.020
 his man here is a puppy 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.060
 labrador he is ready to eat food even sometimes 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.189
 can pass over the hand he is constantly 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.200
 distracted and jumps off hands like 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.789
 only a puppy eats or at least takes 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.590
 food from the master's hand , he immediately 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.439
 distracted from the master and switch 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.639
 attention to extraneous stimuli 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.649
 mistakenly think that not enough 

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:42.659
 feed the dog and now she is ready for 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.159
 Dog training sometimes so but very 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.749
 often before training just 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.669
 need to develop food 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:49.439
 motivation and develop food 

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:51.239
 need motivation just puppy 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.279
 aged they are with an adult dog 

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:55.049
 the very first and main exercise is 

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.939
 just moving the hand with the feed 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.069
 you need to ensure that you can 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.809
 easy to steer to manipulate the dog in 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:04.950
 space give it different positions 

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:07.530
 and stimulate different types of movement 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.360
 these different dog manipulations and smoothly 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.250
 flows into an exercise close to 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.560
 regulatory training that is, we 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.700
 put the dog put put put next 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.739
 it is very important to understand what it is 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.440
 preliminary development of a dog 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.480
 you learn to steer a puppy puppy to learn 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.849
 understand what he must do in response to 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.069
 your manipulations are the most common 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.349
 the error at this stage is an attempt to link 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.360
 puppy actions with teams until then 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.610
 until you started these warm-ups 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.380
 exercises to enter commands you just 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.610
 have fun warming yourself 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.730
 knead puppy 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.709
 learn to analyze your actions 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.260
 see what your movements lead 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.090
 what movement of the puppy after you 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.940
 enter the voice command process 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.010
 2 unpleasant things happen first 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.840
 verbal communication is blocking your 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.579
 attention to own actions in general 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.069
 to all factors that affect 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.079
 puppy behavior in our modern world 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.720
 for many people talking this already 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.120
 work therefore as soon as the poor fellow puppy 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.950
 executed the command of a man several times 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.230
 immediately diagnosed that he is on 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.269
 the team knows if he is from a team not 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.220
 performs means he mocks or 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.260
 shows his dominance or he 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.540
 we are stubborn or he doesn't like at all 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.579
 obey people or he needs to understand 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.329
 what does a man want from him and without 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.519
 of understanding 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.950
 dogs of this breed cannot work and 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.840
 these meaningless fantasies translate 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.220
 all further work on completely not 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.380
 right rails on perfectly 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.910
 wrong way 2 is a nuisance which 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.739
 waiting for us when trying 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.350
 premature communication team with 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.329
 dog action is what if we 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.700
 We believe that the dog performs with us 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:45.700
 voice command then it means we must 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.099
 ensure that she always and and performed 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.950
 if you let the dog ignore 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.230
 command is bad if you try 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.660
 make the dog execute any commands 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.000
 the price is bad too and if you donâ€™t 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.069
 want the dog to ignore the command 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.769
 then you need to stimulate after the team 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:07.300
 her to perform 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:10.410
 idea idea idea put a piece of dues 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.410
 put him in a piece 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.600
 all and gave him how can you 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.910
 encourage the dog to perform 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.489
 teams if you didn't develop yourself 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.010
 have developed a dog at ease 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.260
 hand manipulation with food will let you down 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.760
 small subtotal regular 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.760
 repetition development exercises 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.680
 food motivation flows smoothly into 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.440
 working out actions which subsequently 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.320
 we will associate with teams that is 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.790
 action appropriate regulatory 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.470
 exercise now i will briefly list 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.360
 exercise based on food 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.000
 motivations that make sense to do in 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.470
 first period of educational training 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.330
 first of all this hand movement with 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.010
 there is no limit to food 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.229
 improvement needs to be increased 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.050
 distance time and complicate the trajectory 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.750
 This exercise is useful to start any 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.580
 puppy training session just on 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.770
 this exercise you teach a puppy not 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.750
 jump for hands and not bite them he 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.820
 must understand that the pocket will only get 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.100
 if he is actively running for his hand but 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.840
 This does not bite her first basic 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.060
 exercise hand movement with food 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.190
 smoothly flows into the second base 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.650
 exercise hand movement with food and 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.930
 no touch distraction 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.850
 the other arm this exercise also has 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.460
 their development touch become 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.169
 more intense and sometimes goes into 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.639
 interference which the puppy must actively 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.650
 overcome and not pay on them 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.810
 attention and it should be taken as 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:37.050
 the game they are the same reason 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.050
 and one more time too 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.560
 here we throw as well and the third base 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.199
 puppy exercise is good 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.060
 the right reaction to a jerk 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.699
 puppy should not be afraid of jerks jerk 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.770
 should focus his attention and 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.479
 be associated with positive reinforcements 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.460
 here's a slightly more compact option 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.710
 same exercise reaction to 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.300
 jerk is also valid useful to teach 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.919
 puppy switch attention in this 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.919
 hand touching situations 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.050
 The next topic for practice with a puppy is 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.150
 formation of motor stereotypes 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.219
 normative exercises in muscle memory 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.289
 well, simply put it driving a puppy in 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:19.770
 positions near the law of left and right 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:23.340
 hand change positions sit lie stand 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:26.910
 and stop sitting puppy laying 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.740
 out of movement movement behind the hand with food 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.320
 separate topics are different 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.430
 developing exercises including 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.230
 frontal movement of eight between the legs 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.430
 depending on your preferences 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.530
 exercise opportunities may be more 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.070
 and less anyway they can be broken 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.840
 categories basic exercises 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.490
 developing regulatory ask 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.710
 questions write critical comments 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.440
 if you disagree with something we will 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.700
 just happy 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.460
 the next series we will work with 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.390
 ordinary motivation and the question when you need 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:04.120
