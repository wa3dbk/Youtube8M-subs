thought of a couple different things but
for<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.890> most<00:01:53.100> part<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.700> Lucy<00:01:54.570> she's<00:01:55.500> lying

she's keeping some things to herself but
also<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.570> think<00:02:00.869> she's<00:02:01.259> misinformed<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.310> I

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
about her risking her life Natsu knows

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.290 
about her risking her life Natsu knows
and<00:04:50.440> be<00:04:50.560> like<00:04:50.680> no<00:04:50.830> no<00:04:50.860> knows<00:04:51.340> I'll<00:04:51.550> do<00:04:51.730> it<00:04:51.880> so

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
and be like no no knows I'll do it so

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.110 
and be like no no knows I'll do it so
she's<00:04:52.510> probably<00:04:52.720> keeping<00:04:53.680> some<00:04:54.130> things<00:04:54.160> for

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
she's probably keeping some things for

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.060 
she's probably keeping some things for
the<00:04:55.210> simple<00:04:55.510> fact<00:04:55.540> that<00:04:55.960> she<00:04:56.230> wants<00:04:56.620> to<00:04:56.650> risk

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
the simple fact that she wants to risk

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.920 
the simple fact that she wants to risk
her<00:04:57.280> life<00:04:57.310> give<00:04:57.700> her<00:04:57.850> life<00:04:58.030> in<00:04:58.270> order<00:04:58.600> to<00:04:58.720> save

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
her life give her life in order to save

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.080 
her life give her life in order to save
everyone<00:04:59.350> whether<00:04:59.680> that<00:04:59.860> means<00:04:59.920> using<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:00.790> 12

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
everyone whether that means using the 12

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.360 
everyone whether that means using the 12
keys<00:05:01.300> and<00:05:01.540> a<00:05:01.600> 13<00:05:02.170> keys<00:05:02.380> in<00:05:02.560> a<00:05:02.620> different<00:05:02.920> way<00:05:03.070> I

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
keys and a 13 keys in a different way I

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.130 
keys and a 13 keys in a different way I
don't<00:05:03.610> know<00:05:03.760> exactly<00:05:03.880> what<00:05:04.330> it<00:05:04.420> is<00:05:04.450> but<00:05:04.960> that

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
don't know exactly what it is but that

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.440 
don't know exactly what it is but that
could<00:05:05.320> be<00:05:05.350> also<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:06.280> thing<00:05:06.550> of<00:05:06.790> what's<00:05:07.240> going

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
could be also the thing of what's going

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.320 
could be also the thing of what's going
on<00:05:07.630> there<00:05:07.960> now<00:05:08.590> we<00:05:09.370> seen<00:05:09.640> you<00:05:09.940> know<00:05:10.030> I<00:05:10.060> thought

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
on there now we seen you know I thought

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.240 
on there now we seen you know I thought
it<00:05:10.570> was<00:05:10.840> a<00:05:10.870> possibility<00:05:11.050> that<00:05:11.380> Yukino<00:05:12.040> could

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
it was a possibility that Yukino could

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.220 
it was a possibility that Yukino could
have<00:05:12.370> been<00:05:12.490> somewhat<00:05:12.940> behind<00:05:13.300> this<00:05:13.510> but<00:05:14.050> you

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
have been somewhat behind this but you

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.840 
have been somewhat behind this but you
ki<00:05:14.410> know<00:05:14.560> we<00:05:14.740> saw<00:05:14.920> like<00:05:15.100> a<00:05:15.130> thoughts<00:05:15.490> of<00:05:15.670> her

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
ki know we saw like a thoughts of her

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.090 
ki know we saw like a thoughts of her
feeling<00:05:16.420> bad<00:05:16.600> so<00:05:16.630> it's<00:05:17.020> probably<00:05:17.410> not<00:05:17.530> having

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
feeling bad so it's probably not having

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.440 
feeling bad so it's probably not having
anything<00:05:18.460> do<00:05:18.730> it<00:05:18.850> because<00:05:19.030> originally<00:05:19.240> I

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
anything do it because originally I

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.280 
anything do it because originally I
thought<00:05:19.600> maybe<00:05:19.780> she<00:05:19.990> could<00:05:20.110> have<00:05:20.170> been

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
thought maybe she could have been

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.900 
thought maybe she could have been
somebody<00:05:20.770> from<00:05:21.010> the<00:05:21.130> future<00:05:21.460> I<00:05:21.490> had<00:05:21.670> an<00:05:21.790> idea

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
somebody from the future I had an idea

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.850 
somebody from the future I had an idea
of<00:05:22.420> all<00:05:22.930> you<00:05:23.170> know<00:05:23.290> maybe<00:05:23.440> she<00:05:23.620> could<00:05:23.770> be

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
of all you know maybe she could be

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.920 
of all you know maybe she could be
lisanna<00:05:24.280> from<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.640> future<00:05:25.030> but<00:05:25.210> judging<00:05:25.810> from

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
lisanna from the future but judging from

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.840 
lisanna from the future but judging from
we<00:05:26.290> got<00:05:26.620> to<00:05:26.770> actually<00:05:27.070> see<00:05:27.490> it<00:05:27.610> you<00:05:27.700> know<00:05:27.820> a

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
we got to actually see it you know a

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.970 
we got to actually see it you know a
panel<00:05:28.420> /<00:05:28.600> thinking<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:29.320> she's<00:05:29.500> feeling<00:05:29.800> bad

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
panel / thinking and she's feeling bad

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.180 
panel / thinking and she's feeling bad
so<00:05:30.340> you<00:05:31.060> know<00:05:31.240> III<00:05:31.540> don't<00:05:31.810> think<00:05:32.080> it's<00:05:32.530> Yukino

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
so you know III don't think it's Yukino

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.100 
so you know III don't think it's Yukino
maybe<00:05:33.520> she<00:05:34.060> still<00:05:34.330> could<00:05:34.570> have<00:05:34.690> something<00:05:34.930> to

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
maybe she still could have something to

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.420 
maybe she still could have something to
do<00:05:35.170> with<00:05:35.230> it<00:05:35.350> but<00:05:35.440> as<00:05:35.620> of<00:05:35.890> right<00:05:35.920> now<00:05:36.040> I<00:05:36.370> don't

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
do with it but as of right now I don't

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.400 
do with it but as of right now I don't
know<00:05:36.640> it<00:05:37.030> doesn't<00:05:37.180> seem<00:05:37.420> like<00:05:37.480> her<00:05:37.720> whoever<00:05:38.080> it

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
know it doesn't seem like her whoever it

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.140 
know it doesn't seem like her whoever it
is<00:05:38.530> though<00:05:38.770> they're<00:05:39.370> messing<00:05:39.760> with<00:05:39.790> things<00:05:39.970> I

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
is though they're messing with things I

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.840 
is though they're messing with things I
wanted<00:05:40.420> clips<00:05:40.630> -<00:05:40.840> Lucy<00:05:41.680> is<00:05:41.800> confused<00:05:42.400> maybe

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
wanted clips - Lucy is confused maybe

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.120 
wanted clips - Lucy is confused maybe
she<00:05:43.150> she<00:05:43.660> has<00:05:43.810> some<00:05:44.050> facts<00:05:44.380> wrong<00:05:44.650> from<00:05:44.980> when

she she has some facts wrong from when

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.800 
she she has some facts wrong from when

she woke up whoever was there tell her

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.270 
she woke up whoever was there tell her

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.070 
and there's a other person walking
around<00:05:48.490> who<00:05:48.640> could<00:05:48.820> that<00:05:48.970> be<00:05:49.030> I<00:05:49.360> don't<00:05:49.780> know

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
around who could that be I don't know

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.020 
around who could that be I don't know
but<00:05:50.680> either<00:05:50.770> way<00:05:51.040> this<00:05:51.250> chapter<00:05:51.610> was<00:05:51.730> really

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
but either way this chapter was really

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.880 
but either way this chapter was really
really<00:05:52.270> interesting<00:05:52.780> kept<00:05:53.410> my<00:05:53.530> interest<00:05:53.740> the

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
really interesting kept my interest the

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.470 
really interesting kept my interest the
entire<00:05:54.160> time<00:05:54.400> I<00:05:54.430> really<00:05:54.730> got<00:05:54.820> me<00:05:54.970> excited<00:05:55.180> that

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
entire time I really got me excited that

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.210 
entire time I really got me excited that
it's<00:05:55.930> not<00:05:56.140> predictable<00:05:56.380> it's<00:05:56.680> not<00:05:56.800> like<00:05:57.010> now

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
it's not predictable it's not like now

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.680 
it's not predictable it's not like now
hero<00:05:57.880> make<00:05:58.090> things<00:05:58.360> a<00:05:58.450> little<00:05:58.570> more

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
hero make things a little more

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 
complicated the plot is a little more

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.250 
complicated the plot is a little more
thickened<00:06:01.060> now<00:06:01.240> and<00:06:01.540> it's<00:06:01.930> like<00:06:02.020> wait<00:06:02.140> a

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
thickened now and it's like wait a

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.520 
thickened now and it's like wait a
minute

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530

where is this leading to and that's
really<00:06:06.520> exciting<00:06:06.910> you<00:06:07.180> know<00:06:07.270> we<00:06:07.780> didn't<00:06:07.960> get

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
really exciting you know we didn't get

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.290 
really exciting you know we didn't get
arrows<00:06:08.380> and<00:06:08.530> we<00:06:08.800> didn't<00:06:09.010> get<00:06:09.100> lastest<00:06:09.580> but<00:06:09.790> the
