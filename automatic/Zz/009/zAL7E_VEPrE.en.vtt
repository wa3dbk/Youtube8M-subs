Houdini don't need his legs at all and

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.480 
Houdini don't need his legs at all and
the<00:01:23.869> game<00:01:24.049> also<00:01:24.080> comes<00:01:24.590> with<00:01:24.680> ropes<00:01:25.039> these<00:01:25.310> are

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
the game also comes with ropes these are

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.520 
the game also comes with ropes these are
these<00:01:25.610> nice<00:01:26.000> stretchy<00:01:26.659> ropes<00:01:26.960> they<00:01:27.140> can<00:01:27.320> still

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
these nice stretchy ropes they can still

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.499 
these nice stretchy ropes they can still
get<00:01:27.680> tangled<00:01:28.159> these<00:01:28.280> ropes<00:01:28.549> but<00:01:28.789> they're<00:01:29.390> not

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
get tangled these ropes but they're not

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.660 
get tangled these ropes but they're not
yarn<00:01:29.930> they're<00:01:30.170> pretty<00:01:30.350> good<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:30.920> again<00:01:31.550> they

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
yarn they're pretty good and again they

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.550 
yarn they're pretty good and again they
have<00:01:31.789> that<00:01:31.880> nice<00:01:32.060> spring<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:32.659> them<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:32.960> then

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
have that nice spring to them and then

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.859 
have that nice spring to them and then
you<00:01:33.679> get<00:01:33.830> this<00:01:34.070> ring<00:01:34.399> here<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.000> then<00:01:35.630> this

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
you get this ring here and then this

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.680 
you get this ring here and then this
barrel<00:01:36.380> which<00:01:36.979> acts<00:01:37.280> as<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.550> ring<00:01:37.850> there<00:01:38.479> is<00:01:38.659> a

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
barrel which acts as a ring there is a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.440 
barrel which acts as a ring there is a
lock<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:39.560> then<00:01:40.190> there<00:01:40.429> is<00:01:40.520> this<00:01:40.759> base<00:01:41.060> here

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
lock and then there is this base here

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.109 
lock and then there is this base here
and<00:01:41.630> then<00:01:42.440> finally<00:01:42.950> we<00:01:43.250> have<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.490> book<00:01:43.909> which

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
and then finally we have a book which

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.389 
and then finally we have a book which
gives<00:01:44.149> us<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.600> instructions<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.380> shows<00:01:46.130> you

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
gives us the instructions and shows you

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.480 
gives us the instructions and shows you
how<00:01:46.580> you<00:01:46.909> can<00:01:47.090> tie<00:01:47.479> Houdini<00:01:47.960> up<00:01:48.170> now<00:01:48.979> actually

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
how you can tie Houdini up now actually

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.910 
how you can tie Houdini up now actually
there<00:01:49.640> are<00:01:49.759> two<00:01:49.970> things<00:01:50.210> first<00:01:50.509> of<00:01:50.630> all<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:51.649> in

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
there are two things first of all and in

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.460 
there are two things first of all and in
the<00:01:52.069> rules<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.460> tells<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:52.880> online<00:01:53.450> are<00:01:53.750> a

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
the rules it tells you online are a

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.800 
the rules it tells you online are a
weight<00:01:55.119> basically<00:01:56.119> there's<00:01:56.270> a<00:01:56.360> video<00:01:56.600> that

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
weight basically there's a video that

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.020 
weight basically there's a video that
shows<00:01:57.080> you<00:01:57.110> how<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.560> do<00:01:57.830> it<00:01:57.979> okay<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:58.610> shows<00:01:58.850> you

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
shows you how to do it okay it shows you

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.330 
shows you how to do it okay it shows you
how<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.690> hook<00:02:00.020> them<00:02:00.350> up<00:02:00.380> there's<00:02:00.979> also<00:02:01.130> a<00:02:01.250> video

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
how to hook them up there's also a video

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.850 
how to hook them up there's also a video
that<00:02:01.640> shows<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:02.209> the<00:02:02.360> solution<00:02:02.929> which<00:02:03.140> don't

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
that shows you the solution which don't

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.960 
that shows you the solution which don't
look<00:02:03.979> at<00:02:04.099> those<00:02:04.220> unless<00:02:04.459> you're<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.670> cheater

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
look at those unless you're a cheater

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.300 
look at those unless you're a cheater
and<00:02:05.179> I<00:02:05.390> would<00:02:05.750> never<00:02:05.929> do<00:02:06.170> that<00:02:06.319> so<00:02:06.560> for<00:02:06.800> example

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
and I would never do that so for example

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.580 
and I would never do that so for example
in<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:08.060> very<00:02:08.239> first<00:02:08.660> one<00:02:08.899> here<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.349> I'm<00:02:09.440> not

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
in the very first one here and I'm not

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.749 
in the very first one here and I'm not
going<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.890> show<00:02:10.009> you<00:02:10.069> how<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.250> do<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.550> but<00:02:10.640> I'm

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
going to show you how to do it but I'm

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.339 
going to show you how to do it but I'm
going<00:02:10.879> to<00:02:10.940> show<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.150> little<00:02:11.239> bit<00:02:11.360> here<00:02:11.599> we

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
going to show you a little bit here we

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.990 
going to show you a little bit here we
need<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.530> get<00:02:12.650> Houdini's<00:02:13.099> legs<00:02:13.459> back<00:02:13.760> on

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
need to get Houdini's legs back on

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.059 
need to get Houdini's legs back on
because<00:02:14.569> no<00:02:14.870> one<00:02:15.050> should<00:02:15.080> walk<00:02:15.739> around

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
because no one should walk around

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.150 
because no one should walk around
without<00:02:16.280> their<00:02:16.580> legs<00:02:16.819> it's<00:02:17.540> kind<00:02:17.870> of<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:18.160> bad

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
without their legs it's kind of a bad

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.430 
without their legs it's kind of a bad
thing<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.489> do<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.730> forget<00:02:19.940> them<00:02:20.239> so<00:02:21.050> we<00:02:21.200> have

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
thing to do to forget them so we have

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.220 
thing to do to forget them so we have
these<00:02:21.590> here<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.069> then<00:02:22.760> we<00:02:22.879> attach<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.989> one

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
these here and then we attach the one

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.970 
these here and then we attach the one
here<00:02:24.830> like<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.349> then<00:02:27.349> we<00:02:27.530> put<00:02:27.830> this

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
here like this and then we put this

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.059 
here like this and then we put this
through<00:02:28.250> his<00:02:28.459> legs<00:02:28.819> like<00:02:29.300> that<00:02:29.680> through<00:02:30.680> here

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
through his legs like that through here

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.000 
through his legs like that through here
and<00:02:32.019> attach<00:02:33.019> this<00:02:33.260> wing<00:02:33.590> here<00:02:33.890> on<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.459> end<00:02:34.610> and

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
and attach this wing here on the end and

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.320 
and attach this wing here on the end and
now<00:02:37.010> this<00:02:37.400> ring<00:02:37.700> here<00:02:38.000> as<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:39.709> see<00:02:40.120> keeps<00:02:41.120> that

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
now this ring here as you see keeps that

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.390 
now this ring here as you see keeps that
from<00:02:41.569> coming<00:02:41.870> through<00:02:42.080> there<00:02:42.319> and<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.280> the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
from coming through there and so the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.520 
from coming through there and so the
goal<00:02:43.610> this<00:02:43.819> is<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.330> get<00:02:44.629> Houdini<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.290> goal<00:02:45.440> is

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
goal this is to get Houdini the goal is

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.619 
goal this is to get Houdini the goal is
always<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.769> free<00:02:46.069> Houdini<00:02:46.459> now<00:02:47.360> in<00:02:47.510> this

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
always to free Houdini now in this

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.360 
always to free Houdini now in this
instance<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.200> can<00:02:48.379> free<00:02:48.560> them<00:02:48.680> out<00:02:48.800> obviously

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
instance you can free them out obviously

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.740 
instance you can free them out obviously
you<00:02:49.489> could<00:02:49.610> unhook<00:02:49.910> these<00:02:50.030> clasps<00:02:50.360> but<00:02:50.629> you're

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
you could unhook these clasps but you're

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.420 
you could unhook these clasps but you're
not<00:02:50.810> allowed<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.170> do<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:52.040> free<00:02:52.280> him

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
not allowed to do that to free him

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.399 
not allowed to do that to free him
without<00:02:52.670> hooking<00:02:53.120> these<00:02:53.300> clasps<00:02:53.629> now<00:02:53.930> you

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
without hooking these clasps now you

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:55.660 
without hooking these clasps now you
might<00:02:54.560> be<00:02:54.590> looking<00:02:54.680> at<00:02:54.980> this<00:02:55.069> already<00:02:55.310> knowing

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
might be looking at this already knowing

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.880 
might be looking at this already knowing
how<00:02:55.879> to<00:02:55.909> do<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.510> took<00:02:57.050> a<00:02:57.110> little<00:02:57.260> much<00:02:57.440> longer

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
how to do it I took a little much longer

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.119 
how to do it I took a little much longer
time<00:02:58.159> than<00:02:58.849> that<00:02:59.230> you<00:03:00.230> can<00:03:00.440> squish<00:03:00.800> them<00:03:00.950> up

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
time than that you can squish them up

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.979 
time than that you can squish them up
you<00:03:01.340> can<00:03:01.370> twist<00:03:01.760> them<00:03:01.909> around<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.780> can<00:03:02.930> do

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
you can twist them around you can do

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.420 
you can twist them around you can do
whatever<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.290> want<00:03:03.440> but<00:03:03.530> he<00:03:03.560> never<00:03:03.800> has<00:03:04.069> to<00:03:04.280> be

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
whatever you want but he never has to be

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.760 
whatever you want but he never has to be
forced<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.239> so<00:03:05.870> each<00:03:06.200> one<00:03:06.230> will<00:03:06.620> get

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
forced and so each one will get

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.940 
forced and so each one will get
progressively<00:03:07.210> more<00:03:08.210> challenging<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:09.680> here

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
progressively more challenging so here

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.300 
progressively more challenging so here
we<00:03:10.040> have

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
we have

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.920 
we have
some<00:03:10.430> of<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.580> advanced<00:03:10.880> ones<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.750> can<00:03:11.900> see

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
some of the advanced ones you can see

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.890 
some of the advanced ones you can see
here<00:03:12.290> now<00:03:12.319> that<00:03:12.680> he<00:03:12.830> has<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.099> two<00:03:13.280> ropes<00:03:13.550> and

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
here now that he has the two ropes and

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.360 
here now that he has the two ropes and
this<00:03:14.900> string<00:03:15.380> goes<00:03:15.500> through<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.160> tire

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
this string goes through that the tire

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.740 
this string goes through that the tire
over<00:03:16.610> here<00:03:16.849> goes<00:03:17.030> through<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.300> ring<00:03:17.510> and

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
over here goes through the ring and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.089 
over here goes through the ring and
there's<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:17.959> lock<00:03:18.170> attached<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.800> end<00:03:18.950> and

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
there's a lock attached to the end and

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.809 
there's a lock attached to the end and
he<00:03:19.280> has<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:19.880> get<00:03:20.030> off<00:03:20.180> of<00:03:20.209> all<00:03:20.510> of<00:03:20.630> them<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:20.930> so

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
he has to get off of all of them and so

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.400 
he has to get off of all of them and so
you<00:03:22.819> know<00:03:22.910> they<00:03:23.090> get<00:03:23.209> much<00:03:23.599> harder<00:03:23.959> but<00:03:24.110> even

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
you know they get much harder but even

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.070 
you know they get much harder but even
the<00:03:24.530> beginning<00:03:24.739> ones<00:03:25.190> aren't<00:03:25.580> that<00:03:26.090> easy<00:03:26.390> so

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
the beginning ones aren't that easy so

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.220 
the beginning ones aren't that easy so
that's<00:03:27.560> how<00:03:27.769> it<00:03:27.920> works<00:03:28.450> this<00:03:29.450> is<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.750> most

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
that's how it works this is the most

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.979 
that's how it works this is the most
unique<00:03:30.950> puzzle<00:03:31.459> that<00:03:31.880> I've<00:03:32.030> gotten<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:32.540> think<00:03:32.569> I

unique puzzle that I've gotten I think I

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.300 
unique puzzle that I've gotten I think I
mean<00:03:33.380> I've<00:03:33.470> seen<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.769> lot<00:03:34.010> of<00:03:34.069> different
