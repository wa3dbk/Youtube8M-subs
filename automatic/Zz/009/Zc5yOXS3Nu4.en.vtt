off welcome back guys I'm going to be

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.610 
off welcome back guys I'm going to be
testing<00:00:11.280> today<00:00:11.400> core<00:00:12.000> parking<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.780> vs.<00:00:13.469> no

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
testing today core parking and vs. no

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.029 
testing today core parking and vs. no
core<00:00:13.889> parking<00:00:14.280> on<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.549> 8<00:00:14.700> core<00:00:15.089> FX<00:00:15.570> 8320<00:00:16.410> now

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
core parking on the 8 core FX 8320 now

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.010 
core parking on the 8 core FX 8320 now
I'm<00:00:17.250> also<00:00:17.430> going<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.730> throw<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.270> for<00:00:18.570> module

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
I'm also going to throw in a for module

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.920 
I'm also going to throw in a for module
4<00:00:19.199> core<00:00:19.529> vs.<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.310> module<00:00:20.760> 8<00:00:20.939> core<00:00:21.330> comparison

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
4 core vs. for module 8 core comparison

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.509 
4 core vs. for module 8 core comparison
so<00:00:22.050> some<00:00:22.260> people<00:00:22.380> have<00:00:22.619> said<00:00:22.890> if<00:00:23.220> you're

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
so some people have said if you're

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.450 
so some people have said if you're
disabled<00:00:23.970> for<00:00:24.330> cause<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.380> games<00:00:25.920> some

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
disabled for cause the games some

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.189 
disabled for cause the games some
single-threaded<00:00:27.060> or<00:00:27.269> dual<00:00:27.630> threaded<00:00:27.990> games

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
single-threaded or dual threaded games

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.480 
single-threaded or dual threaded games
might<00:00:28.470> run<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> little<00:00:28.740> bit<00:00:28.949> faster<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.369> I'm

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
might run a little bit faster so I'm

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.400 
might run a little bit faster so I'm
going<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.670> test<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.150> well<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.539> anyway

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
going to test that as well and anyway

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.049 
going to test that as well and anyway
let's<00:00:32.009> get<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.250> with<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.550> results<00:00:32.940> so

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
let's get on with the results so

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.400 
let's get on with the results so
basically<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> reason<00:00:33.630> I'm<00:00:33.750> doing<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.050> also

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
basically the reason I'm doing this also

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.160 
basically the reason I'm doing this also
is<00:00:34.800> because<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.219> want<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> get<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.030> want<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.020> find

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
is because I want to get I want to find

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.840 
is because I want to get I want to find
out<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:37.440> works<00:00:37.680> best<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.399> 8<00:00:38.550> core

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
out what works best for the 8 core

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.459 
out what works best for the 8 core
before<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.329> get<00:00:39.600> into<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.079> head-to-head

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
before I get into the head-to-head

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.190 
before I get into the head-to-head
benchmarks<00:00:41.190> with<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.520> Intel<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.960> anyway

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
benchmarks with the Intel so anyway

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.650 
benchmarks with the Intel so anyway
let's<00:00:43.379> get<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.559> with<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.739> results<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:45.239> first

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
let's get on with the results the first

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.560 
let's get on with the results the first
was<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.379> first<00:00:46.739> result<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.430> core<00:00:48.090> parking

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
was the first result is core parking

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.139 
was the first result is core parking
with<00:00:48.809> battlefield<00:00:49.260> 4<00:00:49.530> now<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.160> 1440p<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
with battlefield 4 now this is 1440p and

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.600 
with battlefield 4 now this is 1440p and
ultra<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:52.050> had<00:00:52.230> first<00:00:52.649> off<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:53.039> turned<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.370> core

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
ultra we had first off we turned to core

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.119 
ultra we had first off we turned to core
parking<00:00:54.000> off<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:55.050> average<00:00:55.469> was<00:00:55.710> 101

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
parking off and the average was 101

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.729 
parking off and the average was 101
point<00:00:56.820> 6<00:00:57.120> 8<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.510> then<00:00:57.719> turned<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.469> which<00:00:58.710> is

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
point 6 8 we then turned it on which is

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.380 
point 6 8 we then turned it on which is
the<00:00:58.980> default<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.579> turned<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.879> back<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the default so we turned it back on and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.599 
the default so we turned it back on and
it<00:01:00.840> was<00:01:00.960> 102<00:01:01.530> point<00:01:01.980> zero<00:01:02.219> eight<00:01:02.340> frames

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
it was 102 point zero eight frames

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.789 
it was 102 point zero eight frames
basically<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.600> made<00:01:03.809> no<00:01:04.140> difference<00:01:04.409> at<00:01:04.710> all

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
basically it made no difference at all

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.560 
basically it made no difference at all
in<00:01:05.040> battlefield<00:01:05.519> 4<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.119> game<00:01:06.510> that

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
in battlefield 4 and this is a game that

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.440 
in battlefield 4 and this is a game that
utilizes<00:01:07.229> 8<00:01:07.590> threads<00:01:07.950> by<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.280> way<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.549> let's

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
utilizes 8 threads by the way so let's

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.050 
utilizes 8 threads by the way so let's
move<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.780> now<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.960> skyrim<00:01:10.799> core<00:01:11.580> parking<00:01:11.939> with

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
move on now to skyrim core parking with

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.359 
move on now to skyrim core parking with
skyrim<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> CPU<00:01:13.260> intensive<00:01:13.619> game<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.340> I

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
skyrim this is a CPU intensive game so I

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.340 
skyrim this is a CPU intensive game so I
really<00:01:14.729> wanted<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.060> test<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.630> well<00:01:15.840> so

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
really wanted to test this as well so

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.550 
really wanted to test this as well so
between<00:01:17.360> battlefield<00:01:18.360> 4<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.689> Skyrim<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.350> kind

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
between battlefield 4 and Skyrim we kind

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.020 
between battlefield 4 and Skyrim we kind
of<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> best<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.130> both<00:01:20.340> worlds<00:01:20.369> one<00:01:20.880> that

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
of get the best of both worlds one that

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.210 
of get the best of both worlds one that
uses<00:01:21.180> 8<00:01:21.450> threads<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.350> CPU<00:01:22.920> intensive

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
uses 8 threads one that is CPU intensive

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.070 
uses 8 threads one that is CPU intensive
and<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.820> had<00:01:24.030> here<00:01:24.270> was<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.659> had<00:01:24.900> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and what we had here was we had a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.980 
and what we had here was we had a
hundred<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.619> nine<00:01:25.860> point<00:01:26.280> zero<00:01:26.600> 4<00:01:27.600> frames

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
hundred and nine point zero 4 frames

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.380 
hundred and nine point zero 4 frames
with<00:01:28.439> core<00:01:28.710> parking<00:01:29.070> off<00:01:29.250> versus<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.150> hundred

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
with core parking off versus a hundred

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.390 
with core parking off versus a hundred
and<00:01:30.720> eight<00:01:30.780> point<00:01:31.140> nine<00:01:31.200> two<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:31.920> there's<00:01:32.130> just

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
and eight point nine two so there's just

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.170 
and eight point nine two so there's just
absolutely<00:01:32.610> no<00:01:33.119> difference<00:01:33.689> between<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.710> two

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
absolutely no difference between the two

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.840 
absolutely no difference between the two
honestly<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.840> leave<00:01:37.229> core<00:01:37.770> parking<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.400> it

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
honestly just leave core parking on it

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.550 
honestly just leave core parking on it
the<00:01:39.150> default<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.659> makes<00:01:39.869> no<00:01:40.079> difference<00:01:40.229> at

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the default it makes no difference at

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.850 
the default it makes no difference at
all<00:01:40.970> it's<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.299> placebo<00:01:42.509> thing<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.530> maybe

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
all it's just a placebo thing and maybe

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.499 
all it's just a placebo thing and maybe
some<00:01:44.100> websites<00:01:44.520> want<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> make<00:01:44.939> money<00:01:45.180> off<00:01:45.360> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
some websites want to make money off you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.539 
some websites want to make money off you
by<00:01:45.659> selling<00:01:45.899> your<00:01:46.110> program<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.920> don't<00:01:47.399> know

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
by selling your program I don't know

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.609 
by selling your program I don't know
anyway<00:01:48.060> let's<00:01:48.240> look<00:01:48.299> at<00:01:48.450> now<00:01:48.600> four<00:01:48.899> modules<00:01:49.110> 4

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
anyway let's look at now four modules 4

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.249 
anyway let's look at now four modules 4
cores<00:01:49.979> versus<00:01:50.640> 4<00:01:51.060> modules<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.689> 8<00:01:51.780> cores<00:01:52.020> so

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
cores versus 4 modules and 8 cores so

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.539 
cores versus 4 modules and 8 cores so
some<00:01:52.470> people<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.740> said<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> internet

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
some people have said on the internet

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.910 
some people have said on the internet
that<00:01:53.700> if<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.909> disable<00:01:54.270> 4<00:01:54.720> cores<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.770> only

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
that if you disable 4 cores and you only

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.340 
that if you disable 4 cores and you only
use<00:01:56.009> 4<00:01:56.399> modules<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:56.880> 4<00:01:57.119> cores<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.170> get

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
use 4 modules with 4 cores you can get

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.230 
use 4 modules with 4 cores you can get
better<00:01:58.590> results<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:59.250> some<00:01:59.460> CPU<00:01:59.969> intensive

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
better results in some CPU intensive

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.600 
better results in some CPU intensive
games<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.110> tested<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.590> was<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:02.189> with

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
games so we tested it was with with

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.899 
games so we tested it was with with

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
fort with the default setting of 4 cause

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.369 
fort with the default setting of 4 cause
Forks<00:02:08.310> are<00:02:08.459> four<00:02:08.819> modules<00:02:09.000> 8<00:02:09.390> cores<00:02:09.660> we<00:02:10.229> had

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
Forks are four modules 8 cores we had

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.809 
Forks are four modules 8 cores we had
one<00:02:10.530> hundred<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:10.830> eight<00:02:10.920> point<00:02:11.160> nine<00:02:11.220> two<00:02:11.550> and

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
one hundred and eight point nine two and

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.600 
one hundred and eight point nine two and
then<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:12.660> turned<00:02:12.930> off

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
then we turned off

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.520 
then we turned off
four<00:02:13.910> of<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.120> cause<00:02:14.300> I<00:02:14.540> think<00:02:14.720> was<00:02:14.870> called<00:02:15.230> to

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
four of the cause I think was called to

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.940 
four of the cause I think was called to
call<00:02:16.190> for<00:02:16.700> call<00:02:17.090> six<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.810> core<00:02:18.020> eight<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.380> we

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
call for call six and core eight and we

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.680 
call for call six and core eight and we
had<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.160> hundred<00:02:19.490> and<00:02:19.760> four<00:02:19.970> point<00:02:20.240> four<00:02:20.540> eight

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
had a hundred and four point four eight

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.990 
had a hundred and four point four eight
frames<00:02:20.930> per<00:02:21.200> second<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.610> basically<00:02:22.610> you<00:02:22.850> want

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
frames per second so basically you want

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.460 
frames per second so basically you want
to<00:02:23.060> leave<00:02:23.210> this<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:23.600> I<00:02:23.810> mean<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:24.110> don't<00:02:24.260> to

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
to leave this on I mean you don't to

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.340 
to leave this on I mean you don't to
fiddle<00:02:24.650> with<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:25.100> way<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.550> CPU<00:02:25.760> works<00:02:26.210> as<00:02:27.200> we

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
fiddle with the way the CPU works as we

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.720 
fiddle with the way the CPU works as we
saw<00:02:27.500> there<00:02:27.680> we<00:02:27.800> saw<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.950> little<00:02:28.160> bit<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.520> drop

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
saw there we saw a little bit of a drop

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.210 
saw there we saw a little bit of a drop
in<00:02:28.880> fps<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:29.420> then<00:02:29.990> we<00:02:30.080> look<00:02:30.290> at<00:02:30.350> Star<00:02:30.830> Wars<00:02:31.100> a

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
in fps and then we look at Star Wars a

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.310 
in fps and then we look at Star Wars a
game<00:02:31.460> that<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.790> think<00:02:31.820> actually<00:02:32.660> utilizes

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
game that I think actually utilizes

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.140 
game that I think actually utilizes
eight<00:02:33.470> threads<00:02:33.770> I'm<00:02:33.920> not<00:02:34.070> too<00:02:34.250> busy<00:02:34.430> showing

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
eight threads I'm not too busy showing

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.850 
eight threads I'm not too busy showing
this<00:02:35.390> but<00:02:35.600> I<00:02:35.660> know<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:35.930> is<00:02:36.020> a<00:02:36.050> CPU<00:02:36.620> intensive

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
this but I know it is a CPU intensive

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.890 
this but I know it is a CPU intensive
multiplayer<00:02:37.580> game<00:02:37.850> or<00:02:38.420> it's<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.600> little<00:02:38.810> bit

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
multiplayer game or it's a little bit

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.930 
multiplayer game or it's a little bit
CPU<00:02:39.080> intensive<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.860> what<00:02:40.370> we<00:02:40.430> have<00:02:40.580> here<00:02:40.790> with

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
CPU intensive and what we have here with

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.520 
CPU intensive and what we have here with
four<00:02:41.180> modules<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.750> eight<00:02:41.870> cores<00:02:42.170> we<00:02:42.350> had

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
four modules and eight cores we had

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.590 
four modules and eight cores we had
eighty<00:02:42.800> point<00:02:43.130> five<00:02:43.459> two<00:02:43.760> frames<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:44.300> this<00:02:44.450> is

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
eighty point five two frames so this is

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.320 
eighty point five two frames so this is
at<00:02:44.750> 1080p<00:02:45.140> on<00:02:45.470> ultra<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.490> we<00:02:47.030> had<00:02:47.150> eighty

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
at 1080p on ultra and we had eighty

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.970

point<00:02:47.600> five<00:02:47.750> two<00:02:47.990> friends<00:02:48.350> with<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.620> default

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
point five two friends with the default

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.830 
point five two friends with the default
settings<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.490> then<00:02:49.580> with<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.390> disabled

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.400 
settings and then with the disabled
cause<00:02:51.050> we<00:02:51.260> had<00:02:51.440> 73<00:02:51.890> point<00:02:52.430> three<00:02:52.730> six<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:53.570> we

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
cause we had 73 point three six so we

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.280 
cause we had 73 point three six so we
had<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.830> drop<00:02:55.190> in<00:02:55.400> fps<00:02:56.000> again<00:02:56.570> as<00:02:56.720> well<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.140> let's

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
had a drop in fps again as well so let's

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.470 
had a drop in fps again as well so let's
pull<00:02:57.410> up<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:58.010> in<00:02:58.220> conclusion<00:02:58.400> if<00:02:58.910> anyone's

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
pull up so in conclusion if anyone's

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.360 
pull up so in conclusion if anyone's
telling<00:02:59.900> you<00:03:00.020> that<00:03:00.170> core<00:03:00.440> parking<00:03:00.980> makes<00:03:01.220> a

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
telling you that core parking makes a

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.250 
telling you that core parking makes a
difference<00:03:01.790> then<00:03:02.060> just<00:03:02.420> just<00:03:02.840> point<00:03:03.080> them<00:03:03.170> to

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
difference then just just point them to

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.780 
difference then just just point them to
