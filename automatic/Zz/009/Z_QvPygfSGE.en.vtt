00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
hydrogen generator is like 30 amps does

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.609 
hydrogen generator is like 30 amps does
the<00:01:18.920> that's<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.490> thing<00:01:19.729> 30<00:01:20.660> amps<00:01:21.200> I<00:01:21.320> need

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619

the that's the thing 30 amps I need
those<00:01:21.890> Syrians<00:01:22.520> for<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.030> a<00:01:23.210> Trojan<00:01:23.690> generator

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
those Syrians for the a Trojan generator

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.789 
those Syrians for the a Trojan generator
you<00:01:25.520> can<00:01:25.729> see<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.060> fuse<00:01:27.700> very<00:01:28.700> amps<00:01:29.560> I'm<00:01:30.560> not

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
you can see the fuse very amps I'm not

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.660 
you can see the fuse very amps I'm not
even<00:01:32.140> putting<00:01:33.140> that<00:01:33.320> right<00:01:33.770> now<00:01:33.920> as<00:01:34.159> a<00:01:34.190> load<00:01:35.020> so

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
even putting that right now as a load so

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.950 
even putting that right now as a load so
you<00:01:37.670> just<00:01:37.850> check<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.240> batteries<00:01:38.720> the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
you just check the batteries the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.380 
you just check the batteries the

original but is the one that it goes
with<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.510> car<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.930> alternator<00:01:48.500> is<00:01:48.830> right

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
with the car the alternator is right

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:55.679 
with the car the alternator is right
here<00:01:50.049> over<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.140> same<00:01:51.320> is<00:01:51.500> fine
