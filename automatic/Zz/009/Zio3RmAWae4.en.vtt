00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
for you to demonstrate a new app I've

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.709 
for you to demonstrate a new app I've
recently<00:00:07.950> found<00:00:08.280> which<00:00:09.150> enables<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.690> to

this<00:00:22.260> add-on<00:00:22.619> or<00:00:23.100> app<00:00:24.019> it's<00:00:25.019> very<00:00:25.080> easy<00:00:25.470> but

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
this add-on or app it's very easy but

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.070 
this add-on or app it's very easy but
I'm<00:00:26.430> just<00:00:26.609> demonstrating<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.900> video

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
I'm just demonstrating you in this video

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.209 
I'm just demonstrating you in this video
how<00:00:28.439> how<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.490> works<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.269> how<00:00:30.390> easy<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.140> for

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
how how it works and how easy it is for

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.040 
how how it works and how easy it is for
especially<00:00:32.219> vets<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.880> pilots<00:00:33.239> because<00:00:33.600> of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
especially vets and pilots because of

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.090 
especially vets and pilots because of
course<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.380> need<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.680> switch<00:00:34.920> between

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
course you need to switch between

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.619 
course you need to switch between
frequencies<00:00:35.880> quite<00:00:36.750> often<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:39.480> this

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
frequencies quite often and and this

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.569 
frequencies quite often and and this
tool<00:00:39.809> enables<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> do<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.770> fire<00:00:41.040> iPhone

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
tool enables you to do that fire iPhone

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.940 
tool enables you to do that fire iPhone
instead<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.059> clicking<00:00:42.329> those<00:00:43.260> radio<00:00:43.620> stacks

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
instead of clicking those radio stacks

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.270 
instead of clicking those radio stacks
in<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.850> spiritual<00:00:45.719> cockpits<00:00:46.140> which<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:47.100> be<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
in the spiritual cockpits which can be a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.330 
in the spiritual cockpits which can be a
bit<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.610> hassle<00:00:47.760> sometimes<00:00:49.100> so<00:00:50.100> I'm<00:00:50.160> just

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
bit of a hassle sometimes so I'm just

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.160 
bit of a hassle sometimes so I'm just
assuming<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> radio<00:00:51.149> stack<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
assuming on the radio stack here on the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.189 
assuming on the radio stack here on the
I<00:00:52.199> find<00:00:52.559> 737<00:00:53.399> I'm<00:00:54.270> going<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.600> switch<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.989> at

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
I find 737 I'm going to switch this at

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.160 
I find 737 I'm going to switch this at
all<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.559> basically<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.670> connects<00:00:57.210> apply<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
all on basically it connects apply a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.020 
all on basically it connects apply a
little<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.100> install<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.609> windows

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
little to you have to install on windows

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.920 
little to you have to install on windows
it<00:01:01.039> connects<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> iPhone<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.539> flight

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
it connects on the iPhone with a flight

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.160 
it connects on the iPhone with a flight
simulator<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:05.299> basically<00:01:06.299> all<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
simulator and basically all you have to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.910 
simulator and basically all you have to
do<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:08.220> change<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.270> frequency<00:01:09.770> in<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
do is change the frequency in the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.750 
do is change the frequency in the
standby<00:01:11.250> box<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.540> very<00:01:13.439> easily<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:14.070> rotates<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
standby box and very easily it rotates a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.300 
standby box and very easily it rotates a
big<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.299> small<00:01:15.330> knob<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.979> want<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
big and a small knob and if you want to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.070 
big and a small knob and if you want to
switch<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.880> another<00:01:17.939> frequency<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.689> simply

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
switch to another frequency you simply

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.560 
switch to another frequency you simply
press<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> transfer<00:01:20.490> button<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.299> as<00:01:21.450> you

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
press on the transfer button and as you

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.350 
press on the transfer button and as you
can<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.310> transfers<00:01:23.310> its<00:01:23.549> frequency<00:01:24.090> into

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
can see it transfers its frequency into

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
can see it transfers its frequency into
the<00:01:24.479> active<00:01:25.250> Channel<00:01:26.250> also<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> i-5<00:01:27.630> 737

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the active Channel also in the i-5 737

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.289 
the active Channel also in the i-5 737
and<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:29.310> very<00:01:29.549> easy<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.880> course<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.920> also

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
and it's very easy of course it also

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.789 
and it's very easy of course it also
changes<00:01:33.299> frequencies<00:01:33.869> very<00:01:34.140> quickly<00:01:34.380> as<00:01:34.650> you

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
changes frequencies very quickly as you

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.080 
changes frequencies very quickly as you
can<00:01:34.950> see<00:01:35.130> there's<00:01:35.340> absolutely<00:01:35.689> no<00:01:36.689> delay<00:01:38.090> you

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
can see there's absolutely no delay you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.179 
can see there's absolutely no delay you
can<00:01:39.119> also<00:01:39.360> switch<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.189> second

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
can also switch to the second

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.350 
can also switch to the second
communication<00:01:41.790> radio<00:01:42.060> which<00:01:42.329> you'll<00:01:42.540> find

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
communication radio which you'll find

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.680 
communication radio which you'll find
your<00:01:43.750> rights<00:01:44.050> to<00:01:45.040> show<00:01:45.280> you<00:01:45.340> here<00:01:46.150> on<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.330> i-95

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
737 starting to change the frequencies

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.730 
737 starting to change the frequencies
there<00:01:50.770> as<00:01:50.920> well<00:01:51.130> very<00:01:51.490> easily<00:01:51.760> just<00:01:52.740> with

drawback<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.280> found<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.900> doesn't

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200

synchronize<00:02:14.740> when<00:02:15.490> you're<00:02:15.640> changing<00:02:16.000> the
