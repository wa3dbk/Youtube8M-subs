00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
and the jacket pulling over those

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.840 
and the jacket pulling over those
throwing<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.220> yellow<00:03:27.410> color<00:03:28.500> KBD<00:03:29.310> frog<00:03:29.640> I'm

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
throwing the yellow color KBD frog I'm

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.580 
throwing the yellow color KBD frog I'm
just<00:03:30.030> throwing<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.390> that's<00:03:31.320> right<00:03:31.470> here

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
just throwing this that's right here

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.550 
just throwing this that's right here
it's<00:03:31.710> been<00:03:31.830> producing<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.520> far<00:03:33.320> much<00:03:34.320> better

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
it's been producing so far much better

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.620 
it's been producing so far much better
than<00:03:34.770> both<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.190> frogs<00:03:35.460> right<00:03:35.670> now<00:03:35.850> get<00:03:36.600> a

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
than both the frogs right now get a

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.730 
than both the frogs right now get a
little<00:03:36.750> Randall<00:03:37.110> in<00:03:37.200> there<00:03:37.320> too<00:03:37.530> which<00:03:37.680> I

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
little Randall in there too which I

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.870 
little Randall in there too which I
think<00:03:37.770> helps<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.220> lot<00:03:38.370> with<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.640> fact<00:03:38.820> that

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
think helps a lot with the fact that

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.790 
think helps a lot with the fact that
there's<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.150> lot<00:03:39.270> of<00:03:39.390> wind<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.780> lot<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.380> noise<00:03:40.560> hit

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
there's a lot of wind a lot of noise hit

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.400 
there's a lot of wind a lot of noise hit
the<00:03:40.890> lake<00:03:41.010> right<00:03:41.190> now<00:03:41.870> that<00:03:42.870> little<00:03:43.080> rattle

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
the lake right now that little rattle

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.540 
the lake right now that little rattle
kind<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.650> gets<00:03:43.830> their<00:03:43.950> attention

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
kind of gets their attention

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.170 
kind of gets their attention
super<00:03:44.940> soft<00:03:45.120> plastics<00:03:45.690> so<00:03:46.620> that<00:03:46.830> fish<00:03:47.180> it's

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
super soft plastics so that fish it's

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.280
