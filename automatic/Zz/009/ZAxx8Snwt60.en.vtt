shut<00:01:37.710> down<00:01:37.740> all<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.490> way<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.180> don't<00:01:39.570> need<00:01:39.600> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
shut down all the way you don't need to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.270 
shut down all the way you don't need to
do<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.960> off<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.380> eject<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.100> I'm<00:01:41.159> gonna

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
do that off you eject it and I'm gonna

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.460 
do that off you eject it and I'm gonna
do<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.460> right<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.689> will<00:01:42.810> disappear<00:01:43.380> it

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
do it right here it will disappear it

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.780 
do it right here it will disappear it
takes<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.710> second<00:01:44.070> there<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.250> see<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.670> it's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
takes a second there you see and it's

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.120 
takes a second there you see and it's
gone<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.390> don't<00:01:45.540> see<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.899> anywhere<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.950> that

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
gone you don't see it anywhere and that

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.760 
gone you don't see it anywhere and that
means<00:01:47.369> now<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.939> safe<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.540> remove<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.020> now

means now it is safe to remove it now

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.080 
means now it is safe to remove it now
the<00:01:49.829> reason<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.909> make

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the reason for this is you want to make

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.060 
the reason for this is you want to make
sure<00:01:51.119> your<00:01:51.810> Mac<00:01:52.229> isn't<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.770> middle<00:01:53.009> of

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
doing something with the drive at the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.319 
doing something with the drive at the
moment<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.899> physically<00:01:55.619> remove<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.219> now<00:01:56.939> you

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
moment you physically remove it now you

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.609 
moment you physically remove it now you
might<00:01:57.600> say<00:01:57.780> well<00:01:57.960> I'm<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.229> doing<00:01:58.439> anything
