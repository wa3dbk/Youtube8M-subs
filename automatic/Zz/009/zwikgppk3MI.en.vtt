very<00:00:12.250> often<00:00:12.460> what<00:00:12.760> happens<00:00:12.790> is<00:00:13.240> why<00:00:13.420> I<00:00:13.450> hear<00:00:13.630> a

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
very often what happens is why I hear a

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.710 
very often what happens is why I hear a
lick<00:00:13.930> that<00:00:14.080> really<00:00:14.380> inspires<00:00:14.830> me<00:00:15.060> I<00:00:16.710> love

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
lick that really inspires me I love

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.390 
lick that really inspires me I love
a way<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.900> play<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.320> lick<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.740> then<00:00:20.009> it<00:00:20.160> and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
a way to play the lick and then it and

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.189 
a way to play the lick and then it and
then<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.910> really<00:00:21.240> feel<00:00:21.449> creative<00:00:21.930> at<00:00:22.050> that

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
then I really feel creative at that

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.589 
then I really feel creative at that
point<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.740> turned<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.640> around<00:00:23.789> I'll<00:00:24.180> invert

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
point and I turned it around I'll invert

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.240 
point and I turned it around I'll invert
it<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.779> find<00:00:25.289> different<00:00:25.650> shapes<00:00:25.919> and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
it and find different shapes and

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.550 
it and find different shapes and
different<00:00:26.310> applications<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.300> know

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
different applications you know

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.960 
different applications you know
different<00:00:28.560> keys<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.399> it's<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.759> in<00:00:29.880> a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
different keys so it's like in a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.389 
different keys so it's like in a
different<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:31.230> know<00:00:31.380> like<00:00:32.070> for<00:00:32.279> instance

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
different you know like for instance

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.759 
different you know like for instance
this<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.120> one<00:00:33.329> like<00:00:33.629> this<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> double<00:00:34.320> double

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:34.769 
this this one like this a double double

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.950 
this this one like this a double double
Bend<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:38.150> that's<00:00:39.150> kind<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.480> lick<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.870> I

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
Bend like that's kind of a lick that I

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.860 
Bend like that's kind of a lick that I
learned<00:00:40.470> by<00:00:40.650> mistake<00:00:41.100> actually<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:42.360> was<00:00:42.839> just

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
learned by mistake actually I was just

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.590 
learned by mistake actually I was just
bending<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.409> string<00:00:43.710> down<00:00:43.949> and<00:00:44.339> usually<00:00:45.300> this

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
bending a string down and usually this

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.390 
bending a string down and usually this
the<00:00:45.900> other<00:00:46.019> adjacent<00:00:46.650> strings<00:00:46.949> sort<00:00:47.159> of<00:00:47.250> get

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
the other adjacent strings sort of get

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.360 
the other adjacent strings sort of get
pushed<00:00:47.670> away<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.690> allow<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.769> you<00:00:50.250> know

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
pushed away to allow for the you know

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.920 
pushed away to allow for the you know
you're<00:00:50.579> borrowing<00:00:50.820> their<00:00:51.119> space<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.659> they<00:00:51.780> get

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
you're borrowing their space so they get

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.380 
you're borrowing their space so they get
out<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.229> way<00:00:52.350> but<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.189> instance<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
out of the way but in this instance the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.049 
out of the way but in this instance the
the<00:00:54.720> B<00:00:54.900> string<00:00:55.260> I'm<00:00:55.530> bending<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.400> g<00:00:56.580> string<00:00:56.909> up

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the B string I'm bending the g string up

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.210 
the B string I'm bending the g string up
a<00:00:57.180> tone<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:57.839> down<00:00:58.229> toward<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.650> floor<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.949> was

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
a tone but down toward the floor I was

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.740 
a tone but down toward the floor I was
found<00:00:59.400> it<00:00:59.549> easier<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.330> case<00:01:00.479> of<00:01:00.659> my

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
found it easier just in the case of my

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.259 
found it easier just in the case of my
index<00:01:01.049> to<00:01:01.229> bend<00:01:01.559> away<00:01:01.830> from<00:01:02.040> myself<00:01:02.269> whereas

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
index to bend away from myself whereas

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.820 
index to bend away from myself whereas
with<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.540> other<00:01:03.570> string<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.199> know<00:01:04.320> fingers

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
with the other string you know fingers

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.969 
with the other string you know fingers
I'm<00:01:05.150> towards<00:01:06.150> my<00:01:06.299> towards<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> ceiling<00:01:07.229> but

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
I'm towards my towards the ceiling but

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.070 
I'm towards my towards the ceiling but
in<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.850> case<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> B<00:01:09.420> string<00:01:09.720> slipped

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
in this case the B string slipped

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.870 
in this case the B string slipped
underneath<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.530> ball<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.890> my<00:01:11.130> finger<00:01:11.580> instead

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
underneath the ball of my finger instead

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.660 
underneath the ball of my finger instead
of<00:01:11.970> being<00:01:12.119> pushed<00:01:12.360> out<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.780> way<00:01:13.490> so<00:01:14.490> when<00:01:14.640> I

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
of being pushed out of the way so when I

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.600 
of being pushed out of the way so when I
returned<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.420> pitch<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> g<00:01:16.200> string

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
returned the pitch of the g string

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.520 
returned the pitch of the g string
I<00:01:17.760> was<00:01:18.300> dragging<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> B<00:01:18.960> string<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.410> a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
I was dragging the B string up a

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.130 
I was dragging the B string up a
semitone<00:01:19.890> as<00:01:20.250> well<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.420> reminded<00:01:21.930> me<00:01:21.960> of

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
semitone as well and that reminded me of

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.460 
semitone as well and that reminded me of
a<00:01:23.090> little<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.510> steel<00:01:24.870> guitar<00:01:25.050> Lac

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
a little it's like a steel guitar Lac

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.770 
a little it's like a steel guitar Lac
and<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.740> thought<00:01:25.980> I<00:01:26.250> wonder<00:01:27.090> if<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.330> could<00:01:27.390> do<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
and I thought I wonder if I could do the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.390 
and I thought I wonder if I could do the
other<00:01:27.900> part<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.350> phrase<00:01:28.800> you<00:01:29.100> know<00:01:29.220> with

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
other part of that phrase you know with

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.910 
other part of that phrase you know with
it<00:01:29.580> if<00:01:30.330> I<00:01:30.570> could<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:30.870> that<00:01:31.020> Bend<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.620> hold<00:01:31.830> that

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
it if I could do that Bend and hold that

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.580 
it if I could do that Bend and hold that
in<00:01:32.040> place<00:01:32.370> while<00:01:33.180> I'm<00:01:33.360> executing<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.350> other

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
in place while I'm executing this other

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.490 
in place while I'm executing this other
little<00:01:34.890> accident<00:01:35.460> like

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.950 

and<00:01:38.890> just<00:01:39.280> release<00:01:39.790> everything<00:01:40.150> at<00:01:40.420> once<00:01:40.630> you

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
and just release everything at once you

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.980 
and just release everything at once you
know<00:01:41.110> that<00:01:41.800> would<00:01:41.950> be<00:01:41.980> kind<00:01:42.280> of<00:01:42.370> cool<00:01:42.580> but<00:01:43.420> when

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
know that would be kind of cool but when

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.960 
know that would be kind of cool but when
I<00:01:44.050> talk<00:01:44.260> about<00:01:44.380> other<00:01:44.620> applications<00:01:45.520> you<00:01:45.820> know

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
I talk about other applications you know

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.600 
I talk about other applications you know
it's<00:01:46.090> like<00:01:46.380> that's<00:01:47.380> for<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:47.920> that's<00:01:48.190> a<00:01:48.340> very

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
it's like that's for that that's a very

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.690 
it's like that's for that that's a very
country<00:01:49.060> but<00:01:49.240> if<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:49.420> do<00:01:49.570> it<00:01:49.690> and<00:01:50.490> that's<00:01:51.490> in

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
country but if you do it and that's in

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.790 
country but if you do it and that's in
the<00:01:51.790> key<00:01:51.970> of<00:01:52.000> E<00:01:52.210> but<00:01:52.600> if<00:01:52.720> I<00:01:53.110> make<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.650> key

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
the key of E but if I make that the key

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.109 
the key of E but if I make that the key
of<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:54.040> and<00:01:54.220> do<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.460> same<00:01:54.670> thing

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.570 

like<00:01:58.310> over<00:01:59.310> there

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.600 

you<00:02:02.510> can<00:02:02.690> do<00:02:02.810> like<00:02:03.350> a<00:02:03.410> whole<00:02:03.680> other<00:02:04.040> thing<00:02:04.220> it's

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
you can do like a whole other thing it's

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.880 
you can do like a whole other thing it's
becomes<00:02:04.970> more<00:02:05.210> bluesy<00:02:05.690> than<00:02:05.900> rather<00:02:06.740> than

becomes more bluesy than rather than

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.999 
becomes more bluesy than rather than
country<00:02:07.460> so<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:08.930> started<00:02:09.229> doing<00:02:09.350> on<00:02:09.560> other

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
country so and I started doing on other

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.110 
country so and I started doing on other
other<00:02:10.369> strings<00:02:10.790> too<00:02:11.060> like<00:02:11.270> low<00:02:11.480> strings

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
other strings too like low strings

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.360 
other strings too like low strings
[Music]

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.870 

yeah

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
yeah

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.300 

and<00:02:19.450> being<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:19.810> it's<00:02:20.080> not<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> major<00:02:20.920> third

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
and being that it's not a major third

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.030 
and being that it's not a major third
apart<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:23.260> know<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:23.440> get<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.650> different

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
apart the you know you get a different

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.380 
apart the you know you get a different
sound<00:02:24.190> altogether<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:25.390> know<00:02:27.240> it's<00:02:28.240> like

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
sound altogether you know it's like

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.170 
sound altogether you know it's like
becomes<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.840> d7<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.680> know<00:02:29.830> in<00:02:30.100> this<00:02:30.640> case<00:02:30.880> I'm

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
becomes a d7 you know in this case I'm

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.550 
becomes a d7 you know in this case I'm
using<00:02:31.210> the<00:02:31.570> middle<00:02:31.780> finger<00:02:32.140> because<00:02:32.230> that's

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
using the middle finger because that's

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.650 
using the middle finger because that's
just<00:02:32.800> easier<00:02:33.220> for<00:02:33.280> me<00:02:33.550> at<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:34.060> particular<00:02:34.270> on

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
just easier for me at that particular on

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:41.780 
just easier for me at that particular on
the<00:02:34.750> low<00:02:34.870> strings

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.970 

when<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:42.819> was<00:02:43.030> first<00:02:43.689> starting<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.590> course

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
when I was first starting of course

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.179 
when I was first starting of course
would<00:02:45.430> land<00:02:45.819> on<00:02:45.969> a<00:02:46.030> specific<00:02:46.719> hero<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:48.159> I

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189 
would land on a specific hero that I

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.940 
would land on a specific hero that I
would<00:02:48.879> concentrate<00:02:49.629> on<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.260> thank<00:02:50.469> God<00:02:50.680> he's

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
would concentrate on and thank God he's

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.830 
would concentrate on and thank God he's
just<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.340> best<00:02:51.370> guitar<00:02:52.150> player<00:02:52.359> I<00:02:52.450> think<00:02:52.480> ever

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
just the best guitar player I think ever

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.349 
just the best guitar player I think ever
lived<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.319> know<00:02:53.469> and<00:02:53.620> I'd<00:02:53.709> try<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.359> emulate

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
lived you know and I'd try to emulate

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.830 
lived you know and I'd try to emulate
that<00:02:55.719> as<00:02:55.900> much<00:02:56.079> as<00:02:56.230> possible<00:02:56.470> but<00:02:56.950> then<00:02:57.840> you

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
that as much as possible but then you

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.970 
that as much as possible but then you
know<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.019> realize<00:02:59.260> you're<00:02:59.620> never<00:02:59.799> going<00:02:59.950> to

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
know you realize you're never going to

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.399 
know you realize you're never going to
be<00:03:00.129> as<00:03:00.310> good<00:03:00.609> at<00:03:00.760> he<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.120> at<00:03:01.420> what<00:03:01.629> he<00:03:01.810> does<00:03:02.019> you

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
be as good at he is at what he does you

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.250 
be as good at he is at what he does you
know<00:03:02.739> so<00:03:03.489> it's<00:03:03.939> a<00:03:04.090> much<00:03:04.269> better<00:03:04.480> idea<00:03:04.629> in<00:03:05.140> any

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
know so it's a much better idea in any

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.640 
know so it's a much better idea in any
case<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:07.239> borrow<00:03:07.510> from<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:08.019> lot<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.620> know

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
case to to borrow from a lot of you know

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.679 
case to to borrow from a lot of you know
to<00:03:08.769> draw<00:03:09.219> inspiration<00:03:09.549> from<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.269> wide<00:03:10.480> variety

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
to draw inspiration from a wide variety

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.619 
to draw inspiration from a wide variety
of<00:03:11.079> players<00:03:11.469> because<00:03:12.340> at<00:03:12.519> that<00:03:12.639> point<00:03:12.970> nobody

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
of players because at that point nobody

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.270 
of players because at that point nobody
can<00:03:13.959> really<00:03:14.200> pinpoint<00:03:14.439> you<00:03:14.829> as<00:03:14.950> being<00:03:15.189> a

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
can really pinpoint you as being a

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.759 
can really pinpoint you as being a
lesser<00:03:15.639> version<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.209> so-and-so<00:03:16.500> it's<00:03:17.500> like

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
lesser version of so-and-so it's like

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.860 
lesser version of so-and-so it's like
man<00:03:18.430> where<00:03:18.669> did<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:18.849> get<00:03:18.970> that<00:03:19.209> style<00:03:19.629> you

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
man where did you get that style you

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.750 
man where did you get that style you
know<00:03:20.019> you<00:03:20.079> create<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.530> new<00:03:20.829> style<00:03:21.099> by<00:03:21.400> doing

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
know you create a new style by doing

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.809 
know you create a new style by doing
that<00:03:21.909> and<00:03:22.120> so<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:22.930> when<00:03:23.200> people<00:03:23.379> hear<00:03:23.889> here

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
that and so that when people hear here
