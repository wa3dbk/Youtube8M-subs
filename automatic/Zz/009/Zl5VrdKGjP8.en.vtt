pretty much all class types and can be
acquired<00:01:42.080> from<00:01:42.320> quite<00:01:42.650> a<00:01:42.680> few<00:01:42.770> sources<00:01:43.370> but<00:01:43.550> I

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
acquired from quite a few sources but I

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.220 
acquired from quite a few sources but I
personally<00:01:44.000> go<00:01:44.090> with<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.270> pumpkin<00:01:44.600> pie<00:01:44.750> since

personally go with the pumpkin pie since

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.230 
personally go with the pumpkin pie since

thing<00:01:47.360> I<00:01:47.450> would<00:01:47.510> recommend<00:01:47.660> is<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.200> archery

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
thing I would recommend is the archery

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.350 
thing I would recommend is the archery

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
out with combat for a range character

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.310 
out with combat for a range character
would<00:01:55.820> be<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.030> iron<00:01:56.210> skin<00:01:56.480> potion<00:01:56.900> since<00:01:57.230> it

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
would be the iron skin potion since it

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.690 
would be the iron skin potion since it
can<00:01:57.410> provide<00:01:57.650> some<00:01:57.860> more<00:01:58.010> defense<00:01:58.400> that<00:01:58.580> the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
can provide some more defense that the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.400 
can provide some more defense that the
Shrew<00:01:58.910> my<00:01:59.060> armor<00:01:59.360> doesn't<00:01:59.570> really<00:01:59.780> do<00:01:59.990> much<00:02:00.170> of

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
Shrew my armor doesn't really do much of

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.900 
Shrew my armor doesn't really do much of
the<00:02:00.680> last<00:02:01.010> few<00:02:01.220> potions<00:02:01.580> that<00:02:01.700> could<00:02:01.820> be

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
the last few potions that could be

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.490 
the last few potions that could be
useful<00:02:02.090> since<00:02:02.480> they<00:02:02.540> provide<00:02:02.630> light<00:02:03.050> in<00:02:03.260> some

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
useful since they provide light in some

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.240 
useful since they provide light in some
way<00:02:03.620> over<00:02:03.800> another

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250

same<00:02:49.930> ammo<00:02:50.169> pool<00:02:50.439> so<00:02:50.829> while<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:51.040> do<00:02:51.189> acknowledge

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
same ammo pool so while I do acknowledge

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.369 
same ammo pool so while I do acknowledge
that<00:02:51.669> the<00:02:51.849> candy<00:02:52.180> corn<00:02:52.299> rifle<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:52.959> coin<00:02:53.169> gun

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
that the candy corn rifle and coin gun

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.990 
that the candy corn rifle and coin gun
are<00:02:53.530> extremely<00:02:53.919> powerful<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.609> coin<00:02:54.819> gun

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
are extremely powerful the coin gun

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.280 
are extremely powerful the coin gun
literally<00:02:55.450> shoots<00:02:55.659> money<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.049> that's<00:02:56.139> not

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
literally shoots money so that's not

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.960 
literally shoots money so that's not
very<00:02:56.349> ideal<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:57.129> the<00:02:57.280> candy<00:02:57.489> corn<00:02:57.639> rifle

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
very ideal and the candy corn rifle

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.520 
very ideal and the candy corn rifle
requires<00:02:58.329> once<00:02:58.569> again<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.930> carry<00:02:59.079> separate

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
requires once again to carry separate

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.110 
requires once again to carry separate
ammo<00:02:59.829> which<00:03:00.129> I<00:03:00.219> just<00:03:00.430> don't<00:03:00.579> want<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.760> do<00:03:00.909> and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
ammo which I just don't want to do and

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.250 
ammo which I just don't want to do and
that's<00:03:01.569> another<00:03:01.750> thing<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:01.989> I<00:03:02.109> should

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
that's another thing that I should

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.599 
that's another thing that I should
probably<00:03:02.379> touch<00:03:02.709> on<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:03.159> that<00:03:03.370> I'm<00:03:03.489> using

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
probably touch on is that I'm using

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.250 
probably touch on is that I'm using
chlorophyll<00:03:04.359> it's<00:03:04.540> simply<00:03:04.810> because<00:03:04.959> they<00:03:05.230> are

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
chlorophyll it's simply because they are

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.110 
chlorophyll it's simply because they are
easy<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.799> use<00:03:05.829> since<00:03:06.519> you<00:03:06.609> can<00:03:06.730> home<00:03:06.909> in<00:03:06.939> on

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
easy to use since you can home in on

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.640 
easy to use since you can home in on
enemies<00:03:07.510> but<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.989> two<00:03:08.139> other<00:03:08.349> viable

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
enemies but the two other viable

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.409 
enemies but the two other viable
alternatives<00:03:09.370> are<00:03:09.519> crystal<00:03:10.030> bullets<00:03:10.269> and

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:10.419 
alternatives are crystal bullets and

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.929 
alternatives are crystal bullets and
Iker<00:03:10.870> bullets<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.439> don't<00:03:12.310> use<00:03:12.489> arrow<00:03:12.730> type

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939 
Iker bullets I don't use arrow type

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.369 
Iker bullets I don't use arrow type
weapons<00:03:13.329> simply<00:03:13.540> because<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.810> find<00:03:14.109> it<00:03:14.230> too

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
weapons simply because I find it too

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:15.659 
weapons simply because I find it too
slow<00:03:14.680> but<00:03:14.919> they<00:03:15.010> are<00:03:15.129> of<00:03:15.250> course<00:03:15.370> a<00:03:15.519> very

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:15.669 
slow but they are of course a very

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.399 
slow but they are of course a very
viable<00:03:15.939> way<00:03:16.239> to<00:03:16.299> play<00:03:16.569> as<00:03:16.719> a<00:03:16.750> range<00:03:16.989> character

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
viable way to play as a range character

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:18.659 
viable way to play as a range character
so<00:03:17.769> for<00:03:17.950> those<00:03:18.010> who<00:03:18.129> want<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.310> know<00:03:18.430> some<00:03:18.639> of

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:20.229 
the best arrow type weapons as I

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:22.170 
the best arrow type weapons as I
mentioned<00:03:20.680> earlier<00:03:20.979> to<00:03:21.010> clarify<00:03:21.370> shop<00:03:21.760> oh<00:03:21.909> and

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
mentioned earlier to clarify shop oh and

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.819 
mentioned earlier to clarify shop oh and
alder<00:03:22.510> repeater<00:03:22.750> are<00:03:22.930> pretty<00:03:23.199> good<00:03:23.379> and<00:03:23.620> I

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
alder repeater are pretty good and I

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:24.990 
alder repeater are pretty good and I
know<00:03:23.889> that<00:03:24.099> the<00:03:24.190> stick<00:03:24.400> launcher<00:03:24.699> doesn't

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
know that the stick launcher doesn't

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.610 
know that the stick launcher doesn't
technically<00:03:25.329> shoot<00:03:25.599> arrows<00:03:25.840> but<00:03:26.379> I<00:03:26.409> would

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
technically shoot arrows but I would

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.770 
technically shoot arrows but I would
also<00:03:26.769> categorize<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.549> under<00:03:27.819> that<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:28.269> do

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
also categorize it under that I do

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.270 
also categorize it under that I do
believe<00:03:29.109> that<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.379> best<00:03:29.500> modifier<00:03:29.979> for<00:03:30.129> all

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
believe that the best modifier for all

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.740 
believe that the best modifier for all
these<00:03:30.489> weapons<00:03:30.729> with<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.180> exception<00:03:31.540> of<00:03:31.629> the

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
these weapons with the exception of the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.780 
these weapons with the exception of the
coin<00:03:31.930> gun<00:03:32.139> and<00:03:32.349> maybe<00:03:32.470> another<00:03:32.829> is<00:03:33.129> the<00:03:33.400> unreal

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
coin gun and maybe another is the unreal

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.399 
coin gun and maybe another is the unreal
modifier<00:03:34.269> so<00:03:34.689> when<00:03:34.810> your<00:03:34.989> forge<00:03:35.169> them<00:03:35.319> you

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
modifier so when your forge them you

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.199 
modifier so when your forge them you
should<00:03:35.560> aim<00:03:35.680> for<00:03:35.709> that<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.280> think<00:03:37.000> that<00:03:37.120> pretty

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
should aim for that I think that pretty

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.610 
should aim for that I think that pretty
much<00:03:37.329> covers<00:03:37.449> everything<00:03:38.019> I<00:03:38.229> wanted<00:03:38.439> to<00:03:38.500> go

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
much covers everything I wanted to go

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.199 
much covers everything I wanted to go

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
over for the items so now let's talk

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.000 
over for the items so now let's talk
about<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.629> strategy<00:03:41.139> and<00:03:41.169> the<00:03:41.560> explain<00:03:41.889> my

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
about the strategy and the explain my

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.830 
about the strategy and the explain my
arena<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.370> little<00:03:42.579> bit<00:03:42.729> even<00:03:43.389> if<00:03:43.629> you<00:03:43.689> don't

have an arena like mine it is still

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.439 
have an arena like mine it is still
possible<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.519> do<00:03:45.669> although<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.120> will<00:03:46.419> be

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
possible to do although I will be

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.449 
possible to do although I will be

drop<00:04:05.889> and<00:04:06.129> a<00:04:06.220> quicker<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.609> round<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.939> ances

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
drop and a quicker the round of ances

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.360 
drop and a quicker the round of ances
now<00:04:07.840> is<00:04:07.989> for<00:04:08.169> marina<00:04:08.530> it's<00:04:08.709> quite<00:04:08.919> simple<00:04:09.280> but

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
now is for marina it's quite simple but

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.309 
now is for marina it's quite simple but
also<00:04:09.669> works<00:04:09.849> really<00:04:10.120> well<00:04:10.359> I<00:04:10.659> have<00:04:11.109> a<00:04:11.169> thin

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
also works really well I have a thin

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.929 
also works really well I have a thin
layer<00:04:11.470> of<00:04:11.530> lava<00:04:11.889> on<00:04:12.009> the<00:04:12.159> ground<00:04:12.400> that<00:04:12.549> damages

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:12.939 
layer of lava on the ground that damages

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.789 
layer of lava on the ground that damages
any<00:04:13.180> enemies<00:04:13.540> that<00:04:13.750> touches<00:04:14.079> it<00:04:14.229> and<00:04:14.379> that's

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
any enemies that touches it and that's

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.259 
any enemies that touches it and that's
really<00:04:14.979> the<00:04:15.129> only<00:04:15.310> trap<00:04:15.519> I<00:04:15.639> have<00:04:15.849> but<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.180> way

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
really the only trap I have but the way

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.909 
really the only trap I have but the way
it<00:04:16.389> works<00:04:16.599> is<00:04:16.750> what<00:04:16.900> makes<00:04:17.079> it<00:04:17.199> so<00:04:17.289> awesome<00:04:17.320> I

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
it works is what makes it so awesome I

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.979 
it works is what makes it so awesome I
have<00:04:18.669> two<00:04:18.789> platforms<00:04:19.030> set<00:04:19.389> up<00:04:19.479> that<00:04:19.599> alternate

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
have two platforms set up that alternate

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.870 
have two platforms set up that alternate
between<00:04:20.079> active<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:20.829> inactive<00:04:21.039> at<00:04:21.400> opposite

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
between active and inactive at opposite

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.940 
between active and inactive at opposite
times<00:04:22.150> so<00:04:22.539> there's<00:04:22.870> always<00:04:23.020> a<00:04:23.169> large<00:04:23.380> area<00:04:23.680> for

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
times so there's always a large area for

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.409 
times so there's always a large area for
enemies<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.279> spawn<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:24.820> thus<00:04:25.060> keeping<00:04:25.330> the

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
enemies to spawn and thus keeping the

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.360 
enemies to spawn and thus keeping the
spawn<00:04:25.599> rates<00:04:25.810> as<00:04:25.930> high<00:04:26.080> as<00:04:26.200> possible<00:04:26.370> the

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
spawn rates as high as possible the

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.260 
spawn rates as high as possible the
other<00:04:27.550> benefit<00:04:27.909> of<00:04:27.940> the

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
other benefit of the

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.969 
other benefit of the
platform<00:04:28.750> is<00:04:28.900> that<00:04:28.930> it's<00:04:29.169> easy<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:29.500> maintain

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
platform is that it's easy to maintain

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.499 
platform is that it's easy to maintain
two<00:04:30.099> groups<00:04:30.340> of<00:04:30.490> parts<00:04:30.729> drops<00:04:30.940> as<00:04:31.120> you<00:04:31.449> should

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
two groups of parts drops as you should

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.270 
two groups of parts drops as you should
only<00:04:31.780> be<00:04:31.960> dipping<00:04:32.169> down<00:04:32.410> to<00:04:32.470> low<00:04:32.800> platform

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
only be dipping down to low platform

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.890 
only be dipping down to low platform
when<00:04:33.400> you<00:04:33.490> need<00:04:33.639> health<00:04:33.849> and<00:04:34.090> just<00:04:34.629> fly<00:04:34.780> around

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
when you need health and just fly around

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.629 
when you need health and just fly around
while<00:04:35.289> the<00:04:35.440> upper<00:04:35.650> platform<00:04:35.860> is<00:04:36.099> not<00:04:36.250> active

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
while the upper platform is not active

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.909 
while the upper platform is not active
by<00:04:37.210> using<00:04:37.419> this<00:04:37.659> arena<00:04:37.870> easily<00:04:38.319> get<00:04:38.470> the<00:04:38.590> final

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
by using this arena easily get the final

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.439 
by using this arena easily get the final
wave<00:04:39.039> for<00:04:39.250> three<00:04:39.400> to<00:04:39.580> four<00:04:39.789> minutes<00:04:39.940> left<00:04:40.270> in

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
wave for three to four minutes left in

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.119 
wave for three to four minutes left in
the<00:04:40.539> night<00:04:40.690> which<00:04:41.259> would<00:04:41.349> be<00:04:41.530> great<00:04:41.740> but<00:04:41.979> as

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:42.129 
the night which would be great but as

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:43.559 
the night which would be great but as
the<00:04:42.280> rain<00:04:42.460> jury<00:04:42.699> there's<00:04:42.909> nothing<00:04:43.240> to<00:04:43.389> heal

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 
the rain jury there's nothing to heal

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:44.700 
the rain jury there's nothing to heal
you<00:04:43.750> effectively<00:04:44.199> while<00:04:44.440> you're<00:04:44.560> being

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
you effectively while you're being

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.469 
you effectively while you're being
chased<00:04:45.069> and<00:04:45.220> hit<00:04:45.490> by<00:04:45.639> so<00:04:45.819> many<00:04:45.879> pumpkin<00:04:46.270> Kings

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
chased and hit by so many pumpkin Kings

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:47.939 
chased and hit by so many pumpkin Kings
so<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:46.840> probably<00:04:46.990> want<00:04:47.259> to<00:04:47.289> buy<00:04:47.470> very<00:04:47.710> long

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
so you probably want to buy very long

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.219 
so you probably want to buy very long
into<00:04:48.159> the<00:04:48.250> night<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:49.360> just<00:04:49.389> to<00:04:49.629> reiterate<00:04:49.780> I'm
