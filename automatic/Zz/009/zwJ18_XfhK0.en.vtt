00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
review on the Reaper several years ago I

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.600 
review on the Reaper several years ago I
did<00:00:12.990> not<00:00:13.139> have<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.530> great<00:00:13.740> results<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.370> I

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
did not have the great results that I

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.070 
did not have the great results that I
thought<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.849> was<00:00:15.000> gonna<00:00:15.150> have<00:00:15.389> as<00:00:15.599> there<00:00:15.750> was<00:00:15.900> no

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
thought I was gonna have as there was no

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.310 
thought I was gonna have as there was no
support<00:00:16.500> for<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.859> wings<00:00:17.390> like<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.449> spar<00:00:18.900> which

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
support for the wings like a spar which

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.130 
support for the wings like a spar which
they<00:00:19.560> include<00:00:19.949> now<00:00:20.220> because<00:00:21.210> one<00:00:21.449> snapped<00:00:21.840> and

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
they include now because one snapped and

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.380 
they include now because one snapped and
it<00:00:22.289> crashed<00:00:22.859> while<00:00:23.670> they<00:00:23.760> put<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.060> all<00:00:24.210> back

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
it crashed while they put it all back

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.240 
it crashed while they put it all back
together<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.170> time<00:00:25.470> use<00:00:25.680> rear<00:00:26.010> facing

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
together and this time use rear facing

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.609 
together and this time use rear facing
camera<00:00:26.849> just<00:00:27.269> like<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.539> did<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.019> Raven<00:00:28.410> it

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
camera just like I did on the Raven it

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.710 
camera just like I did on the Raven it
was<00:00:28.800> also<00:00:29.010> made<00:00:29.340> by<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.580> same<00:00:29.730> company<00:00:29.970> as<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
was also made by the same company as the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.139 
was also made by the same company as the
Reaper<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.309> how<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.460> discovered<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
Reaper and this is how I discovered the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.420 
Reaper and this is how I discovered the
extreme<00:00:33.480> flutter<00:00:34.410> with<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.950> rear<00:00:35.190> facing

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
extreme flutter with the rear facing

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.940 
extreme flutter with the rear facing
camera<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.840> know<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.350> perspective

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
camera you know I like the perspective

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.920 
camera you know I like the perspective
and<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.219> ability<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.700> analyze<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.540> control

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
and the ability to analyze the control

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.810 
and the ability to analyze the control
surfaces<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.590> not<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.100> fly<00:00:41.280> straight<00:00:41.610> at

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
surfaces and not have to fly straight at

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.260 
surfaces and not have to fly straight at
myself<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.420> take<00:00:42.600> any<00:00:42.809> pictures<00:00:43.230> selfies<00:00:44.270> on

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
myself to take any pictures selfies on

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.690 
myself to take any pictures selfies on
airplanes<00:00:45.809> have<00:00:46.110> PV<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.680> mostly<00:00:47.070> clouds<00:00:47.340> for

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
airplanes have PV is mostly clouds for

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.700 
airplanes have PV is mostly clouds for
me<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.149> not<00:00:48.420> as<00:00:48.539> much<00:00:48.750> fun<00:00:48.989> for<00:00:49.320> me<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> watch

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
me so not as much fun for me to watch

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.110 
me so not as much fun for me to watch
when<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.280> home<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.579> see<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:50.969> all<00:00:51.090> was

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
when I get home to see what it all was

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.990 
when I get home to see what it all was
like<00:00:51.510> from<00:00:51.690> above<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.160> landing<00:00:53.610> was<00:00:53.820> sure

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
like from above but the landing was sure

00:00:54.000 --> 00:02:48.679 
like from above but the landing was sure
a<00:00:54.030> surprise<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.840> me

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.440 

all<00:02:49.689> right<00:02:49.900> I'm<00:02:50.079> gonna<00:02:50.939> see<00:02:51.939> if<00:02:51.999> I<00:02:52.090> could<00:02:52.269> drop

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
all right I'm gonna see if I could drop

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:06.830 
all right I'm gonna see if I could drop
it<00:02:52.510> in

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.350 

only<00:03:07.470> pointing<00:03:07.830> out<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.160> no<00:03:08.370> matter<00:03:08.400> how<00:03:08.910> I

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
only pointing out that no matter how I

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.449 
only pointing out that no matter how I
have<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.840> control<00:03:10.170> set<00:03:10.440> with<00:03:10.590> maximum<00:03:11.160> throw

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
have the control set with maximum throw

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.880 
have the control set with maximum throw
since<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.360> radio<00:03:12.630> is<00:03:12.810> not<00:03:12.840> programmable<00:03:13.709> boy

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
since the radio is not programmable boy

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.070 
since the radio is not programmable boy
at<00:03:14.099> all<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.520> came<00:03:14.730> without<00:03:15.030> radio<00:03:15.390> I<00:03:15.690> could

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
at all it came without radio I could

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.410 
at all it came without radio I could
change<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.500> yes<00:03:16.739> but<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.370> can't<00:03:17.640> mix<00:03:17.940> or<00:03:18.120> do<00:03:18.209> much

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
change it yes but I can't mix or do much

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.030 
change it yes but I can't mix or do much
with<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.780> rudder<00:03:19.020> or<00:03:19.290> or<00:03:19.470> try<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.770> make

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
with the rudder or or try to make

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.940 
with the rudder or or try to make
el-amin's<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:20.970> have<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.050> use<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.260> rudder<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.800> kick

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
el-amin's I have to use a rudder to kick

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.640 
el-amin's I have to use a rudder to kick
it<00:03:23.099> over<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.459> it's<00:03:23.610> tiny<00:03:24.019> but<00:03:25.019> it<00:03:25.140> does<00:03:25.349> it's

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
it over that it's tiny but it does it's

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.990 
it over that it's tiny but it does it's
the<00:03:25.709> only<00:03:25.890> thing<00:03:26.099> that<00:03:26.280> will<00:03:26.370> actually<00:03:26.580> kick

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
the only thing that will actually kick

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.729 
the only thing that will actually kick
it<00:03:27.120> over<00:03:27.300> and<00:03:27.599> then<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:27.840> use<00:03:28.019> elevator<00:03:28.560> to

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
it over and then I use elevator to

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.070 
it over and then I use elevator to
complete<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.250> turn<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:30.420> wind<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.930> was<00:03:31.019> a

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
complete the turn and this wind it was a

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.559 
complete the turn and this wind it was a
pretty<00:03:31.349> good<00:03:31.590> challenge<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:32.819> on<00:03:33.060> landing

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
pretty good challenge and so on landing

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.320 
pretty good challenge and so on landing
note<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:34.019> steering<00:03:34.650> in<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.220> nose<00:03:35.400> also<00:03:36.030> turns

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
note the steering in the nose also turns

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.979 
note the steering in the nose also turns
with<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.569> rudder

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
with the rudder

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:53.700 
with the rudder
hence<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.800> surprise<00:03:38.310> landing

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:03.550 

whoa<00:03:56.590> nice<00:03:57.590> breaks<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:02.540> wasn't<00:04:02.900> exactly<00:04:02.990> the

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
whoa nice breaks that wasn't exactly the

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:47.399 
whoa nice breaks that wasn't exactly the
smoothest<00:04:04.010> landing<00:04:04.220> air<00:04:04.700> ever<00:04:04.970> was

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:47.409
