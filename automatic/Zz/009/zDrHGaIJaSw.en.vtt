00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 it has come to him to save gÃ©las point 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.100
 today I would like us to 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.870
 talk about vegetable proteins 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.220
 light bulbs go back what I saw that 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.599
 many of you with this one in 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.920
 wondering what it is that the 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.630
 vegetable protein in beam it makes a 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.089
 little vegetable proteins in 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.850
 powder is to use in two cases 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.140
 mainly 6-1 you are athletic and 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.170
 that you want to increase your 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.330
 protein consumption without eating 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.769
 more products of animal origin or 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.420
 two if you are for example vegetarian 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.070
 you tried to eat less 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.189
 meat but you still want 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.160
 have in your diet 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:39.079
 a good deal of protein these 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.000
 products can help you in that sense 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.200
 without further ado I will show you 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.450
 the three poutine that I use 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.800
 daily and that I know it in 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.879
 exist others do not hesitate to leave 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.010
 a little comment to tell me what 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.690
 what you think of us only from 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.780
 that there but for others than you 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.059
 could test it 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.390
 firstly protein and hemp 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.190
 and nutty goes multi-vas which is the most 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.359
 great brand for everything 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.600
 possible chance a Canadian brand 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.159
 so the real canada field if you can 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.590
 order other brands of hemp 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.060
 on French sites and singing 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.740
 come back soon in europe 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.689
 if you have a soul of ecologists and 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.450
 do you like what comes from 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.979
 corner it may be useful to know but 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.509
 this is the longest of the most 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.500
 great brand of room protein 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.880
 particularity of the chamber proteins 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.479
 they only contain 50% 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.340
 of proteins 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.570
 so it is a bit odd for a 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.000
 product there are labeled proteins on it 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.619
 but the maximum we can do for 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.310
 a chamber powder with proteins 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.600
 it's 50% the rest it's a fiber 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.860
 who to digest and lipids 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.720
 especially omega 3 1 that was good 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.060
 lipids that inside that here at 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.090
 consume without moderation 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.480
 you will also find magnesium 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.910
 iron and zinc 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.680
 in these proteins which is also very 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.540
 useful if you do not eat meat anymore 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.530
 this is important element oligo 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.420
 for vegetarians 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.010
 second, the proteins you 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.810
 maybe already know the proteins 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.270
 this black hjorth and the best known is 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.840
 why is that a brand? 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.840
 American 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.720
 they are very good proteins 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.520
 the taste is not bad for proteins 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.720
 plants I agree that this 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.430
 are the breaks and will not impose 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.040
 always super good taste but that's the one 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.180
 there are in the best and it is by 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.100
 example the only ones that I come to 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.330
 to have just with water like that it's 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.740
 not easy at first but we get used 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.080
 well so that's pretty good taste of 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.900
 good quality protein there are also 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.660
 calcium and iron in my case 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.160
 as important if you are a vegetarian 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.190
 the only downside for these proteins 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.360
 there it is that they are worth 45 or 50 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.530
 euro a pack and makeup or like that 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.530
 it's knowing what we're doing so here we go 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.330
 voted in by weight here a brand 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.730
 French but there are also other 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.520
 other brands cdc very good 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.230
 quality point of view proteins at 80 for 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.700
 its 85 % protein in the powder 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.920
 but in addition the proteins are very 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.380
 good quality with an acid profile 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.140
 amines very well balanced for those 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.970
 who know a little about 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.670
 so here are some very good ones 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.330
 proteins but the small flat is 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.070
 they have a bad blow 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.880
 it's time for the benefits of these 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.580
 handshakes is that they 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.780
 really bad taste it's a shame 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.230
 because it's cheap was good 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.150
 quality 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.740
 this is a little weigh on the taste 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.380
 really find something for them 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.360
 to camouflage to me I use them use 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.040
 especially for cooking actually because 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.360
 that I can not see how 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.860
 consume them apart which some 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.840
 worries or really there are other things 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.360
 other flavors of other fruits that 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.890
 will you be able to hide the tastes but 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.750
 here as such it's really not 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.820
 good that we really have to find out how 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.210
 consume them me I still use a 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.850
 only once to cook small 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.230
 reminder small summary of the situation 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.190
 the chamber of proteins with 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.080
 proteins but not that the proteins of 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:14.060
 brown rice that are the rolls royce of 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.650
 proteins with the price that goes with and 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.660
 to finish the weight shops that I 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.340
 only recommend for cooking 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.859
 but I invite you to try other 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.120
 brands and our fragrance ea mean this 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.280
 as you think in the comments 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.200
 just below the video it exists 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.540
 with chocolate or vanilla maybe 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.490
 that it's good it's not here for the 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.210
 three proteins that I still use a 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.020
 time do not hesitate but it's a 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.630
 comment if you know 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.830
 others it was my first video so 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.120
 do not hesitate to put a 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.660
 comment to tell me what you 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.340
 think of all that I find you 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.660
 soon on vg point fr a live small 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.760
 on facebook or on youtube is done 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.210
 always so much fun and then I will 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.690
 see you soon 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.690
 Hi
