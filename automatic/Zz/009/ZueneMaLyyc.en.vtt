00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
bowl stabilizer I start with a very

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.929 
bowl stabilizer I start with a very
small<00:00:27.720> amount<00:00:28.020> of<00:00:28.439> salt<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.010> then<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.550> add<00:00:29.880> a

little bit of lemon juice mustard become

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.369 
little bit of lemon juice mustard become
one<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:44.670> really<00:00:44.700> matters<00:00:45.300> at<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.050> beginning

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
one what really matters at the beginning

one what really matters at the beginning
of<00:00:46.500> mayonnaise<00:00:46.649> making<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.460> add<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
of mayonnaise making is that you add the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.540 
of mayonnaise making is that you add the
oil<00:00:48.059> incredibly<00:00:48.960> slowly<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.920> slowly<00:00:49.950> you

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
oil incredibly slowly so slowly you

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.369 
oil incredibly slowly so slowly you
almost<00:00:51.059> can't<00:00:51.420> believe<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.230> really

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379
