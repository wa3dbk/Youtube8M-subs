review of a product that I can't figure

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.470 
review of a product that I can't figure
out<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.710> reason<00:00:20.130> for<00:00:20.430> its<00:00:20.580> existence<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.330> is

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
out the reason for its existence this is

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.370 
out the reason for its existence this is
the<00:00:21.630> r9<00:00:22.250> 270<00:00:23.250> from<00:00:23.580> AMD<00:00:24.150> in<00:00:24.510> particular<00:00:25.199> we

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the r9 270 from AMD in particular we

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.890 
the r9 270 from AMD in particular we
have<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.890> MSI<00:00:26.519> gaming<00:00:26.760> Edition<00:00:27.599> with<00:00:27.750> their

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
twin frozer cooler their military spec

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.440 
twin frozer cooler their military spec
military<00:00:31.830> class<00:00:32.130> design<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.000> means<00:00:33.180> very

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
military class design so that means very

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.120 
military class design so that means very
robust<00:00:33.930> components<00:00:34.500> great<00:00:34.680> for<00:00:34.829> overclocking

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
robust components great for overclocking

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.920 
robust components great for overclocking
and<00:00:35.610> running<00:00:35.820> cool<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.239> lasting<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> long<00:00:36.719> time

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and running cool and lasting a long time

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.560 
and running cool and lasting a long time
and<00:00:37.140> all<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.350> stuff<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:37.890> well<00:00:38.670> as<00:00:38.969> well

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
and all that stuff as well as well

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.389 
and all that stuff as well as well
that's<00:00:39.989> pretty<00:00:40.350> much<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> cooler<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
that's pretty much it the cooler and the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.760 
that's pretty much it the cooler and the
better<00:00:41.760> designed<00:00:42.390> PCB<00:00:43.200> are<00:00:43.350> kind<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
better designed PCB are kind of the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.040 
better designed PCB are kind of the
benefits<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.489> gaming<00:00:44.940> class<00:00:45.180> card<00:00:45.510> from<00:00:45.690> MSI

benefits of a gaming class card from MSI

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.709 
benefits of a gaming class card from MSI
alright<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.340> why<00:00:47.579> can't<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.090> figure<00:00:48.149> out<00:00:48.510> why<00:00:48.660> it

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
alright so why can't I figure out why it

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.260 
alright so why can't I figure out why it
exists<00:00:49.230> well<00:00:49.379> because<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.309> pretty<00:00:50.700> similar

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
exists well because it's pretty similar

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.680 
exists well because it's pretty similar
to<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.570> 270<00:00:52.260> X<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.340> comes<00:00:53.489> with<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:54.420> 2

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
to the 270 X so it comes with a do 2

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.959 
to the 270 X so it comes with a do 2
molex<00:00:55.020> 2<00:00:55.199> single<00:00:55.500> PCIe<00:00:55.890> 6<00:00:56.280> pin<00:00:56.460> adapter<00:00:56.850> it's

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
molex 2 single PCIe 6 pin adapter it's

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.299 
molex 2 single PCIe 6 pin adapter it's
150<00:00:57.750> watt<00:00:57.899> TDP<00:00:58.109> card<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.920> only<00:00:59.100> need<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
150 watt TDP card so you only need a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.830 
150 watt TDP card so you only need a
single<00:00:59.579> 6<00:00:59.879> pin<00:01:00.090> connector

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
single 6 pin connector

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.959 
single 6 pin connector
you've<00:01:01.140> got<00:01:01.350> some<00:01:01.649> user<00:01:01.980> guidance<00:01:02.340> driver

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
you've got some user guidance driver

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.219 
you've got some user guidance driver
disks<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.449> all<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.690> don't<00:01:03.840> worry<00:01:03.960> about<00:01:04.049> it

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
disks and all that don't worry about it

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.070 
disks and all that don't worry about it
alright<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> graphics<00:01:05.519> card<00:01:05.790> itself<00:01:06.180> has

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
alright so the graphics card itself has

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.990 
alright so the graphics card itself has
a<00:01:07.409> fully<00:01:08.070> featured<00:01:08.640> core<00:01:09.479> which<00:01:09.960> means<00:01:11.000> 1280

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
a fully featured core which means 1280

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.050 
a fully featured core which means 1280
stream<00:01:12.360> processors<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.909> 256-bit<00:01:14.909> memory

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
stream processors a 256-bit memory

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.740 
stream processors a 256-bit memory
interface<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.680> only<00:01:16.920> real<00:01:17.580> difference

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
interface and the only real difference

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.270 
interface and the only real difference
between<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.259> its<00:01:19.650> bigger<00:01:19.890> brother<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
between this and its bigger brother the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.960 
between this and its bigger brother the
270x<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:22.080> slightly<00:01:22.650> lower<00:01:23.040> frequency<00:01:23.759> on

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
270x is the slightly lower frequency on

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.200 
270x is the slightly lower frequency on
the<00:01:24.119> GPU<00:01:24.450> core<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> reference<00:01:26.000> 270<00:01:27.000> would<00:01:27.119> be

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the GPU core so a reference 270 would be

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.300 
the GPU core so a reference 270 would be
clocked<00:01:27.450> at<00:01:27.540> around<00:01:27.689> 925<00:01:28.650> megahertz

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
clocked at around 925 megahertz

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.999 
clocked at around 925 megahertz
whereas<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.970> reference<00:01:30.329> 270<00:01:30.869> X<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.409> going<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.860> be

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009

this<00:01:35.460> msi<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:36.090> comes<00:01:36.329> clocked<00:01:36.540> at<00:01:36.659> 975

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
this msi one comes clocked at 975

anyway<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.009> performance<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.729> very<00:01:42.090> very

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
anyway so the performance is very very

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.139 
anyway so the performance is very very
close<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.259> costs<00:01:43.649> about<00:01:43.740> 10<00:01:44.130> percent<00:01:44.579> less

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
close and it costs about 10 percent less

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.030 
close and it costs about 10 percent less
now<00:01:45.420> all<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> usual<00:01:46.320> features<00:01:46.530> with<00:01:46.950> the

at<00:02:17.280> Ultra<00:02:17.820> details<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:19.290> performance<00:02:19.920> is

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
at Ultra details the performance is

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.610 
at Ultra details the performance is
going<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.520> be<00:02:20.730> everything<00:02:21.540> for<00:02:21.960> this<00:02:22.080> now<00:02:22.350> our

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
going to be everything for this now our

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.400 
going to be everything for this now our
usual<00:02:22.920> thing<00:02:23.520> is<00:02:23.760> we<00:02:24.000> take<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.420> cards<00:02:24.810> oh<00:02:25.020> yeah

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
usual thing is we take the cards oh yeah

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.540 
usual thing is we take the cards oh yeah
I<00:02:25.440> guess<00:02:25.620> we<00:02:25.740> should<00:02:25.890> do<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> bit<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.280> tour<00:02:26.490> of

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
I guess we should do a bit of a tour of

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.280 
I guess we should do a bit of a tour of
the<00:02:26.670> cards<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.060> we've<00:02:27.180> got<00:02:27.390> MSI<00:02:27.810> 100

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
the cards so we've got MSI 100

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.050 
the cards so we've got MSI 100
millimeter<00:02:28.710> propeller<00:02:29.190> blade<00:02:29.460> fans<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.030> they

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
millimeter propeller blade fans so they

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.360 
millimeter propeller blade fans so they
have<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.570> coating<00:02:31.200> on<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.470> edges<00:02:31.860> they<00:02:32.100> spin

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
have the coating on the edges they spin

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.890 
have the coating on the edges they spin
backwards<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:33.000> order<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.390> prevent<00:02:33.660> dust

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
backwards in order to prevent dust

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.470 
backwards in order to prevent dust
buildup<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.620> all<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.310> noise<00:02:35.550> at<00:02:36.150> speaking

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
buildup and all that noise at speaking

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.480 
buildup and all that noise at speaking
of<00:02:36.630> noise<00:02:36.810> it's<00:02:37.110> very<00:02:37.440> very<00:02:37.740> very<00:02:37.950> quiet

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
of noise it's very very very quiet

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.400 
of noise it's very very very quiet
then<00:02:38.880> we've<00:02:39.030> got<00:02:39.270> some<00:02:39.300> heat<00:02:39.690> pipes<00:02:39.930> down<00:02:40.110> here

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
then we've got some heat pipes down here

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.200 
then we've got some heat pipes down here
so<00:02:40.560> we've<00:02:40.680> got<00:02:40.710> two<00:02:41.100> heat<00:02:41.340> pipes<00:02:41.580> leading<00:02:42.000> out

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
so we've got two heat pipes leading out

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.420 
so we've got two heat pipes leading out
to<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> pretty<00:02:43.110> large<00:02:43.440> actually<00:02:44.010> aluminium

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
to a pretty large actually aluminium

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.040 
to a pretty large actually aluminium
thinner<00:02:44.670> right<00:02:44.880> so<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.360> can<00:02:45.600> see<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:45.930> there

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
thinner right so you can see that there

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.200 
thinner right so you can see that there
is<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.230> bit<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.620> peanut<00:02:46.890> PCB<00:02:47.490> extension<00:02:48.060> right

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
is a bit of a peanut PCB extension right

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.910 
is a bit of a peanut PCB extension right
here<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:48.960> actually<00:02:49.110> longer<00:02:49.560> than<00:02:49.710> the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
here so it's actually longer than the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.890 
here so it's actually longer than the
PCB<00:02:50.310> itself<00:02:50.400> but<00:02:51.090> for<00:02:51.270> good<00:02:51.450> reason<00:02:51.780> because

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
PCB itself but for good reason because

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.300 
PCB itself but for good reason because
they've<00:02:52.200> actually<00:02:52.230> got<00:02:52.680> more<00:02:52.860> cooling

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
they've actually got more cooling

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.949 
they've actually got more cooling
potential<00:02:53.670> there<00:02:53.970> they've<00:02:54.330> also<00:02:54.510> got<00:02:54.780> their

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
potential there they've also got their

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.740 
potential there they've also got their
usual<00:02:55.440> rigidity<00:02:56.040> enhancing<00:02:56.760> piece<00:02:57.510> right

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
usual rigidity enhancing piece right

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.360 
usual rigidity enhancing piece right
here<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:58.170> actually<00:02:58.320> does<00:02:58.740> help<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.160> card

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
here that actually does help the card

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.430 
here that actually does help the card
sag<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.910> droop<00:03:00.120> last<00:03:00.360> we've<00:03:00.780> got<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.990> crossfire

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
sag and droop last we've got a crossfire

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
matte black PCB on the back we've also

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.880 
matte black PCB on the back we've also
got<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.560> PCI<00:03:07.920> Express<00:03:08.060> 3.0<00:03:09.060> 16<00:03:09.540> X<00:03:09.750> interface<00:03:10.650> and

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
got a PCI Express 3.0 16 X interface and

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.580 
got a PCI Express 3.0 16 X interface and
the<00:03:11.550> aforementioned<00:03:11.880> 6<00:03:12.660> pin<00:03:12.870> PCI<00:03:12.900> Express

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
the aforementioned 6 pin PCI Express

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.550 
the aforementioned 6 pin PCI Express
plug<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.670> will<00:03:15.480> be<00:03:15.930> yeah<00:03:16.230> that's<00:03:16.380> pretty

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
plug so you will be yeah that's pretty

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.050 
plug so you will be yeah that's pretty
much<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.800> ok<00:03:17.190> so<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.550> comes<00:03:17.760> down<00:03:17.910> to

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
much it ok so it comes down to

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.670 
much it ok so it comes down to
performance<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.900> price<00:03:19.200> so<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.470> price<00:03:19.650> is

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
performance and price so the price is

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.130 
performance and price so the price is
better<00:03:20.010> than<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.250> 270<00:03:20.760> X<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.570> performance

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
better than a 270 X and the performance

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.600 
better than a 270 X and the performance
once<00:03:22.320> we<00:03:22.440> overclocked<00:03:22.890> this<00:03:23.100> thing<00:03:23.310> we<00:03:23.430> got

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
once we overclocked this thing we got

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.640 
once we overclocked this thing we got
this<00:03:23.790> thing<00:03:23.850> just<00:03:24.420> absolutely<00:03:25.019> Rocking

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
this thing just absolutely Rocking

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.710 
this thing just absolutely Rocking
because<00:03:26.340> it's<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.580> non<00:03:26.760> reference<00:03:27.209> card<00:03:27.510> it

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
because it's a non reference card it

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.199 
because it's a non reference card it
does<00:03:28.260> overclock<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.430> cooled<00:03:29.790> better

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
does overclock and it is cooled better

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.360 
does overclock and it is cooled better
than<00:03:30.480> our<00:03:30.600> reference<00:03:31.050> 270<00:03:31.620> X<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:32.040> we<00:03:32.130> actually

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
than our reference 270 X and we actually

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.979 
than our reference 270 X and we actually
got<00:03:32.730> pretty<00:03:33.060> much<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.269> same<00:03:33.630> performance

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
got pretty much the same performance

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.920 
got pretty much the same performance
with<00:03:34.680> max<00:03:34.950> overclocks<00:03:35.550> on<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:35.970> card<00:03:36.269> and<00:03:36.480> the

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
with max overclocks on this card and the

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.509 
with max overclocks on this card and the
other<00:03:37.080> one<00:03:37.320> so<00:03:37.739> we're<00:03:37.890> looking<00:03:38.160> at<00:03:38.250> something

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
other one so we're looking at something

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.340 
other one so we're looking at something
like<00:03:38.610> this<00:03:38.790> going<00:03:39.000> holy<00:03:39.390> crap<00:03:39.840> well<00:03:40.230> this

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
like this going holy crap well this

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.900 
like this going holy crap well this
thing's<00:03:40.560> fantastic<00:03:41.340> it's<00:03:41.489> basically<00:03:41.820> just

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
thing's fantastic it's basically just

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.120 
thing's fantastic it's basically just
cheaper<00:03:42.360> so<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.600> is<00:03:42.750> why<00:03:42.870> I'm<00:03:43.019> saying<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.410> the

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
cheaper so this is why I'm saying I the

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.680 
cheaper so this is why I'm saying I the
hold<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.610> don't<00:03:44.640> know<00:03:44.910> why<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.090> exists<00:03:45.570> thing

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
hold I don't know why it exists thing

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.630 
hold I don't know why it exists thing
because<00:03:45.989> AMD<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:46.709> basically<00:03:47.100> undercutting

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
because AMD is basically undercutting

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.150 
because AMD is basically undercutting
the<00:03:47.850> 270x<00:03:48.540> by<00:03:49.080> bringing<00:03:49.410> this<00:03:49.530> card<00:03:49.800> to<00:03:50.010> us

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
the 270x by bringing this card to us

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.610 
the 270x by bringing this card to us
only<00:03:50.550> a<00:03:50.580> couple<00:03:50.910> weeks<00:03:51.060> later<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.840> it's

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
only a couple weeks later and it's

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.590 
only a couple weeks later and it's
performed<00:03:53.280> great<00:03:53.489> so<00:03:53.700> without<00:03:53.940> further<00:03:54.180> ado

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
performed great so without further ado

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.630 
performed great so without further ado
I'm<00:03:54.810> going<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.230> hand<00:03:55.470> things<00:03:55.530> off<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:55.920> slick

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
I'm going to hand things off to slick

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.910 
I'm going to hand things off to slick
and<00:03:56.910> he<00:03:57.750> can<00:03:57.930> let<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.170> guys<00:03:58.320> know<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:58.650> the

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
and he can let you guys know that the

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.380 
and he can let you guys know that the
performance<00:03:59.190> is<00:03:59.489> awesome<00:03:59.820> with<00:04:00.030> actual

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
performance is awesome with actual

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.390 
performance is awesome with actual
graphs<00:04:00.570> whoa<00:04:01.350> hey<00:04:01.560> hold<00:04:01.680> on<00:04:01.860> ok<00:04:02.100> I'm<00:04:02.220> back<00:04:02.250> now

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
graphs whoa hey hold on ok I'm back now

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.860 
graphs whoa hey hold on ok I'm back now
I<00:04:02.550> missed<00:04:02.790> something<00:04:02.940> ok<00:04:03.300> so<00:04:03.330> they've<00:04:03.660> got

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
I missed something ok so they've got

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.330 
I missed something ok so they've got
their<00:04:03.989> zero<00:04:04.290> core<00:04:04.590> technology<00:04:05.190> which

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
their zero core technology which

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.490 
their zero core technology which
basically<00:04:05.700> turns<00:04:06.060> off<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.450> GPU<00:04:06.959> when<00:04:07.380> your

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
basically turns off the GPU when your

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.930 
basically turns off the GPU when your
system<00:04:07.769> goes<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:07.980> sleep<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.580> display

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
system goes to sleep and the display

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.580 
system goes to sleep and the display
goes<00:04:08.970> off<00:04:09.390> so<00:04:09.570> you<00:04:09.630> can<00:04:09.780> actually<00:04:09.930> save<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.320> lot

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
goes off so you can actually save a lot

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.350 
goes off so you can actually save a lot
of<00:04:10.709> power<00:04:10.890> that<00:04:10.980> way<00:04:11.250> not<00:04:11.430> full<00:04:11.700> sleep<00:04:11.970> display

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
of power that way not full sleep display

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.509 
of power that way not full sleep display
off<00:04:12.510> sleep<00:04:12.810> just<00:04:13.019> to<00:04:13.200> be<00:04:13.260> clear<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:13.650> I<00:04:14.280> wanted

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
off sleep just to be clear and I wanted

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.830 
off sleep just to be clear and I wanted
to<00:04:14.580> talk<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.760> little<00:04:14.970> bit<00:04:15.120> about<00:04:15.150> our<00:04:15.420> testing

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
to talk a little bit about our testing

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.080 
to talk a little bit about our testing
methodology<00:04:16.560> for<00:04:16.979> our<00:04:17.250> graphics<00:04:17.729> cards<00:04:17.970> we

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
methodology for our graphics cards we

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.170 
methodology for our graphics cards we
overclocked<00:04:18.600> every<00:04:19.049> card<00:04:19.350> so<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.700> cold<00:04:20.940> hard

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
overclocked every card so the cold hard

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.210 
overclocked every card so the cold hard
truth<00:04:21.269> is<00:04:21.660> yes<00:04:21.900> designs<00:04:22.350> like<00:04:22.590> this<00:04:22.800> will<00:04:23.039> do

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
truth is yes designs like this will do

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.010 
truth is yes designs like this will do
better<00:04:23.400> than<00:04:23.640> reference<00:04:24.000> designs<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:24.630> lot<00:04:24.840> of

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
better than reference designs a lot of

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.710 
better than reference designs a lot of
the<00:04:25.080> time<00:04:25.289> but<00:04:25.620> then<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.729> breaks<00:04:26.940> I<00:04:27.210> guess

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
the time but then the breaks I guess

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.360 
the time but then the breaks I guess
is<00:04:27.930> a<00:04:27.990> lesson<00:04:28.410> about<00:04:28.530> buying<00:04:28.920> non-reference

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
is a lesson about buying non-reference

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.400 
is a lesson about buying non-reference
cards<00:04:29.910> versus<00:04:30.300> buying<00:04:30.450> reference<00:04:30.870> cards<00:04:31.200> if

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
cards versus buying reference cards if

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.930 
cards versus buying reference cards if
you<00:04:31.890> want<00:04:31.920> the<00:04:32.160> absolute<00:04:32.400> maximum

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
you want the absolute maximum

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.220 
you want the absolute maximum
performance<00:04:33.090> when<00:04:33.510> you're<00:04:33.600> overclocking<00:04:34.110> you

performance when you're overclocking you

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.900 
performance when you're overclocking you
can<00:04:34.380> see<00:04:34.560> all<00:04:34.710> of<00:04:34.740> our<00:04:34.890> overclocking<00:04:35.550> settings

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270

although<00:05:09.900> in<00:05:10.140> this<00:05:10.260> situation<00:05:10.680> is<00:05:10.800> slightly

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
although in this situation is slightly

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.040 
although in this situation is slightly
different<00:05:11.370> because<00:05:11.520> our<00:05:11.700> 270<00:05:12.450> has<00:05:12.870> an

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
different because our 270 has an

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.680 
different because our 270 has an
aftermarket<00:05:13.440> cooler<00:05:13.770> where<00:05:14.520> our<00:05:14.730> 270x<00:05:15.390> did

aftermarket cooler where our 270x did

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.210 
aftermarket cooler where our 270x did
not<00:05:15.960> so<00:05:16.200> there's<00:05:16.350> a<00:05:16.410> slight<00:05:16.620> difference<00:05:16.980> there

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
not so there's a slight difference there

for overclocking with this card o is
actually<00:05:19.440> quite<00:05:19.650> simple<00:05:19.920> you<00:05:20.130> take<00:05:20.160> all<00:05:20.490> the

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
actually quite simple you take all the

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.330 
actually quite simple you take all the
sliders<00:05:21.030> to<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.360> very<00:05:21.630> end<00:05:21.870> click<00:05:22.590> apply<00:05:22.950> and

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
sliders to the very end click apply and

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.030 
sliders to the very end click apply and
you're<00:05:24.000> done<00:05:24.210> it's<00:05:25.050> completely<00:05:25.560> stable<00:05:25.740> we

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
you're done it's completely stable we

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.740 
you're done it's completely stable we
had<00:05:26.190> a<00:05:26.220> core<00:05:26.490> clock<00:05:26.610> of<00:05:26.820> 10:50<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.450> entire

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
had a core clock of 10:50 the entire

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.270 
had a core clock of 10:50 the entire
time<00:05:28.020> no<00:05:28.200> matter<00:05:28.290> what<00:05:28.560> I<00:05:28.590> threw<00:05:28.860> out<00:05:28.890> it<00:05:29.160> was

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
time no matter what I threw out it was

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.610 
time no matter what I threw out it was
completely<00:05:29.760> stable<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.330> this<00:05:30.780> was<00:05:30.990> awesomely

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
completely stable and this was awesomely

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.980 
completely stable and this was awesomely
boring<00:05:32.550> it<00:05:32.730> was<00:05:32.880> awesome<00:05:33.270> because<00:05:33.419> you<00:05:33.600> get<00:05:33.840> to

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
boring it was awesome because you get to

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.360 
boring it was awesome because you get to
just<00:05:34.140> take<00:05:34.410> all<00:05:34.560> the<00:05:34.650> sliders<00:05:34.980> and<00:05:35.100> put<00:05:35.250> them

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
just take all the sliders and put them

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.860 
just take all the sliders and put them
up<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.580> end<00:05:35.730> which<00:05:36.030> is<00:05:36.180> always<00:05:36.330> kind<00:05:36.570> of<00:05:36.660> fun

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
up the end which is always kind of fun

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.780 
up the end which is always kind of fun
but<00:05:37.470> then<00:05:37.620> it<00:05:37.740> was<00:05:37.830> boring<00:05:38.190> because<00:05:38.340> it<00:05:38.610> just

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
but then it was boring because it just

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.990 
but then it was boring because it just
kind<00:05:39.450> of<00:05:39.480> worked<00:05:39.720> and<00:05:40.370> had<00:05:41.370> no<00:05:41.820> issue

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
kind of worked and had no issue

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.700 
kind of worked and had no issue
whatsoever<00:05:42.390> and<00:05:42.750> there<00:05:42.840> was<00:05:42.930> no<00:05:43.080> fine-tuning

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
whatsoever and there was no fine-tuning

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.810 
whatsoever and there was no fine-tuning
or<00:05:43.830> anything<00:05:43.980> like<00:05:44.160> that<00:05:44.220> was<00:05:44.400> just<00:05:44.550> put<00:05:44.669> them

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
or anything like that was just put them

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.430 
or anything like that was just put them
all<00:05:44.910> at<00:05:44.970> the<00:05:45.030> end<00:05:45.090> and<00:05:45.450> you're<00:05:45.780> good<00:05:45.930> to<00:05:46.050> go<00:05:46.080> and

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
all at the end and you're good to go and

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.500 
all at the end and you're good to go and
only<00:05:46.770> got<00:05:46.950> a<00:05:46.980> 63<00:05:47.580> degrees<00:05:47.880> and<00:05:47.910> the<00:05:48.120> fan<00:05:48.300> speed

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
only got a 63 degrees and the fan speed

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.630 
only got a 63 degrees and the fan speed
only<00:05:48.630> went<00:05:48.840> up<00:05:48.870> to<00:05:49.020> 27%<00:05:49.590> on<00:05:50.040> the<00:05:50.130> heaviest<00:05:50.430> load

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
only went up to 27% on the heaviest load

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.400 
only went up to 27% on the heaviest load
I<00:05:50.760> put<00:05:50.940> it<00:05:51.030> on<00:05:51.150> so<00:05:51.690> it<00:05:51.720> seems<00:05:52.080> like<00:05:52.230> there<00:05:52.380> might

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
I put it on so it seems like there might

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.020 
I put it on so it seems like there might
be<00:05:52.560> some<00:05:52.800> extra<00:05:53.040> power<00:05:53.280> there<00:05:53.580> that<00:05:53.730> I<00:05:53.760> could

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
be some extra power there that I could

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.060 
be some extra power there that I could
harness<00:05:54.300> but<00:05:54.660> it<00:05:54.750> just<00:05:54.930> isn't<00:05:55.169> other<00:05:55.800> than

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
harness but it just isn't other than

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.250 
harness but it just isn't other than
that<00:05:56.220> it<00:05:56.490> performs<00:05:56.820> really<00:05:57.000> well<00:05:57.419> and<00:05:57.690> as

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
that it performs really well and as

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.960 
that it performs really well and as
