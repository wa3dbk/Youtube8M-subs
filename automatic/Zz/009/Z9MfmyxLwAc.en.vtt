00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
very futuristic alpha and I think it's

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.989 
very futuristic alpha and I think it's
just<00:01:11.229> just<00:01:11.649> absolutely<00:01:12.159> ashamed<00:01:12.579> that<00:01:12.789> the

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:12.999 
just just absolutely ashamed that the

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:16.169 
just just absolutely ashamed that the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
market the interesting thing is even

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.099 
market the interesting thing is even
though<00:01:19.869> the<00:01:20.259> cars<00:01:20.530> are<00:01:20.829> very<00:01:21.039> futuristic<00:01:22.109> they

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
though the cars are very futuristic they

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:26.340 
though the cars are very futuristic they
are<00:01:23.439> they<00:01:24.039> had<00:01:24.340> 50<00:01:24.850> s<00:01:24.909> alpha<00:01:25.240> engines<00:01:25.990> in<00:01:26.200> them

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
are they had 50 s alpha engines in them
