00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.840 
this yeah right here there's a drain for
the<00:02:01.799> gasket<00:02:02.340> there's<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.329> drain<00:02:03.600> right<00:02:03.780> there

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
the gasket there's a drain right there

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.039 
the gasket there's a drain right there
another<00:02:05.850> one<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:06.479> got<00:02:06.600> about<00:02:06.689> six

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
another one I think it's got about six

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.320 
another one I think it's got about six
drains<00:02:07.350> all<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.619> way<00:02:07.770> down<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.819> they<00:02:09.270> were

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
drains all the way down and they were

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.080 
drains all the way down and they were
plugged<00:02:09.660> up<00:02:09.890> so<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.220> simple<00:02:11.430> test<00:02:11.730> for<00:02:11.970> that

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
plugged up so in a simple test for that

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.080 
plugged up so in a simple test for that
was<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.599> just<00:02:12.780> pulled<00:02:12.989> this<00:02:13.140> out<00:02:13.349> here

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
was I just pulled this out here

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.090 
was I just pulled this out here
and<00:02:15.090> poured<00:02:15.540> water<00:02:15.720> down<00:02:16.020> there<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.890> wasn't

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
and poured water down there and I wasn't

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.570 
and poured water down there and I wasn't
seeing<00:02:17.400> anything<00:02:17.970> come<00:02:18.720> out<00:02:18.750> those<00:02:19.080> drains

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
seeing anything come out those drains

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.460 
seeing anything come out those drains
okay

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
okay

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.880 
okay
now<00:02:22.470> I've<00:02:22.710> seen<00:02:23.120> people<00:02:24.120> silicone<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:24.930> here

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
now I've seen people silicone this here

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.410 
now I've seen people silicone this here
thinking<00:02:26.280> that's<00:02:26.400> gonna<00:02:26.490> stop<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.360> it

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
thinking that's gonna stop it and it

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.060 
thinking that's gonna stop it and it
might<00:02:27.570> stop<00:02:27.840> some<00:02:28.020> water<00:02:28.200> from<00:02:28.350> coming<00:02:28.710> in<00:02:28.830> but

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
might stop some water from coming in but

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.380 
might stop some water from coming in but
you<00:02:29.280> know<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.460> have<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.610> split<00:02:29.820> window<00:02:30.060> so

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
you know you have a split window so

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.510 
you know you have a split window so
water<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:31.470> always<00:02:31.740> going<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.950> go<00:02:32.100> down<00:02:32.280> in<00:02:32.460> the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
water is always going to go down in the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.360 
water is always going to go down in the
channel<00:02:32.790> whether<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.270> silicone<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.960> or<00:02:34.080> not

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
channel whether you silicone it or not

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.830 
channel whether you silicone it or not
they<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.670> know<00:02:35.760> it's<00:02:35.880> meant<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.180> get<00:02:36.360> water<00:02:36.570> in

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
they you know it's meant to get water in

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.060 
they you know it's meant to get water in
here<00:02:37.050> but<00:02:37.230> we<00:02:37.470> just<00:02:37.590> got<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.740> get<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.890> water

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
here but we just got to get the water

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.420 
here but we just got to get the water
out<00:02:38.220> all<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.450> did<00:02:39.690> was<00:02:39.870> pull<00:02:40.590> back<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.950> gasket

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
out all I did was pull back the gasket

through<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:49.350> cleaned<00:02:49.680> out<00:02:49.800> each<00:02:49.980> train<00:02:50.310> I

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
through it that cleaned out each train I

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.920 
through it that cleaned out each train I
went<00:02:50.640> repeated<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.210> on<00:02:51.390> each<00:02:51.570> one<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.870> the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
went repeated that on each one of the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.710 
went repeated that on each one of the
drain<00:02:52.110> holes<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:53.190> just<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.640> test<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.060> just

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
drain holes and just to test it just

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.210 
drain holes and just to test it just
pulled<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.050> back<00:02:56.840> toward<00:02:57.840> water<00:02:58.050> down<00:02:58.350> I'm<00:02:58.620> not

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220
