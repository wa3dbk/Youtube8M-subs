 new video grand theft auto 5 in which 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.309
 I bring you some new information 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.560
 about gta online and is that for example 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.660
 let's have a menu while we play 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.980
 that will allow us to customize 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.250
 our player with for example 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.849
 changing the mask even the clothes or 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.289
 things for the style of appearance 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.019
 we also go for example to be able 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.010

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.020
 to help us in our facet online 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.809
 we are going to have a table of results 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.430
 once we finish a mission we are going to 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.920
 have a results table with the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.410
 statistics and such in which he will have 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.690
 a kind of ranking the first one is the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.399
 what is the most obvious score and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.899
 then from there to below , there will be more 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.910
 people when you do the mission 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.430
 you will appear in that list automatically 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.129
 and also going to have we are told that it's going 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.680
 to have many missions already said 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.769
 TibÃ¡n based around 500 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.330
 created by them for not being and you can 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.220
 play them again when you want or 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.770
 whether you finish it does not take away 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.890
 do it again you can improve your 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.530
 shooting skills you can also 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.660
 improve the stamina and which almost 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.880
 anything that is done in the single 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.130
 You can also improve it in the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.690
 multiplayer of course there's going to be 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.240
 different types of career for example 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.210
 will be the fast races quit 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.640
 Race calls them that simply because 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.930
 there will be an end point the finish line and 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.759
 from where you are you have to get there 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.860
 until there are no check points 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.530
 simply the end point would not be a 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.970
 wii crazy and we will also have the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.700
 races for laps of all life 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.830
 the classic gt a reid that are the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.229
 races also with laps and such but 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.820
 shooting trying to shoot the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.500
 otherwise we are going to have careers 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.500
 rally and we are told that there will be more 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.509
 although we are not specified what 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.369
 We also know that the way of driving 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.369
 the car will be very realistic in the 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.170
 this runs more or less 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.070
 I would talk about the controversy that 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.750
 the driving 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.100
 They confirm that it will be 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.660
 very realistic 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.910
 Mayor appeared to us if he is 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.800
 true but if they tell us that 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.800
 realistic and they have touched the command 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.140
 Well, we have to cool down, not us 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.400
 we carry I do not know how you see it too 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.870
 we know that we are going to be able to 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.800
 hood and take it off also money 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.140

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.209
 We call to locate our car 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.660

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.980
 customize our house by putting others 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.220
 furniture televisions and things like that 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.260

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.090
 in at once we will only be able to have one 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.670
 it's not being able to have two houses at a time 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.830
 only one if we want to buy another 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.390
