and<00:00:33.790> for<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:34.690> first<00:00:34.899> time<00:00:35.200> ever<00:00:35.500> we've

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
and for the first time ever we've

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.660 
and for the first time ever we've
increased<00:00:36.790> the<00:00:37.090> size<00:00:37.300> of<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:37.660> display<00:00:38.670> by

designed<00:02:33.420> for<00:02:33.600> today's<00:02:33.959> uses<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.739> we<00:02:35.400> made<00:02:35.610> it

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
designed for today's uses and we made it

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.320 
designed for today's uses and we made it
reversible<00:02:36.300> so<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.870> fits<00:02:37.140> either<00:02:37.350> way<00:02:38.150> we<00:02:39.150> also
