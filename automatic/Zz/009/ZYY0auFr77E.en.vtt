 Hello, I 'm ferdinando from farmex, I'm 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.260
 making this video according to 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.970
 request from a customer who wants to 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.189
 stitch 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.820
 then this is a knitted fabric type 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.280
 mesh cap and sew using 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.550
 the foot presser foot 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.850
 so here I am already the placeholder, right? 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.420
 while a strip of knitted fabric 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.809
 I'll be there, I'll put people here. 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.899
 keep the tongue making the fold 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.760
 all behind to facilitate 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:58.879
 So I'm going to set up here and I'll use a 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:01.160
 helper to pass the fabric position 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.519
 the fabric will not put on pain I'll go 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.560
 slowly because the mesh is too difficult for her 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.300
 stay running so I'll go slowly 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.300
 have not tried sewing unit 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.060
 everything was an aid in parking the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.579
 back here in order to facilitate the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.229
 If you can do it, I'm doing a 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.229
 fold every six stitches 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.829
 Look here 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.109
 so you're connected 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.530
 Good, I hope I have helped with this.
