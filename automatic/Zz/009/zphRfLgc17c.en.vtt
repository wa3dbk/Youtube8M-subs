00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.180 
well so I'm wondering what you guys
think<00:00:54.870> let<00:00:55.199> me<00:00:55.320> know<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.710> comments<00:00:56.100> below

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
think let me know in the comments below

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.760 
think let me know in the comments below
what<00:00:56.760> do<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.940> think<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.600> age<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.199> extinction

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
what do you think that age of extinction

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.189 
what do you think that age of extinction
could<00:00:59.250> mean<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.850> think<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.570> possibly<00:01:01.050> has

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
could mean I think it possibly has

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.959 
could mean I think it possibly has
something<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.680> with<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.980> other<00:01:02.190> reveal<00:01:02.730> of

Dinobots in transformers for that for

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.020

the internets but I'm not sure if this

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.100 
the internets but I'm not sure if this
is<00:01:18.960> real<00:01:19.590> or<00:01:19.920> if<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> fake<00:01:21.270> King<00:01:21.810> but

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
is real or if this is a fake King but

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.210 
is real or if this is a fake King but
I'll<00:01:22.200> show<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> screen<00:01:22.740> regardless

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
think the concept art is real or fake

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.420 
think the concept art is real or fake
and<00:01:27.720> then<00:01:27.840> for<00:01:28.049> our<00:01:28.080> last<00:01:28.200> piece<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.829> news<00:01:28.979> here

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
and then for our last piece of news here

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.730 
and then for our last piece of news here
now<00:01:29.610> these<00:01:29.759> ones<00:01:30.180> are<00:01:30.420> big<00:01:30.750> time<00:01:30.990> rumors<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
now these ones are big time rumors and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.649 
now these ones are big time rumors and
there<00:01:32.340> has<00:01:32.460> been<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.670> picture<00:01:33.000> revealed<00:01:33.390> of

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
there has been a picture revealed of

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.420 
there has been a picture revealed of
Megatron's<00:01:34.320> head<00:01:34.560> or<00:01:34.799> what<00:01:34.979> looks<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.340> be

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
Megatron's head or what looks to be

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.090 
Megatron's head or what looks to be
Megatron's<00:01:36.060> head<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.869> very<00:01:37.200> low<00:01:37.439> quality<00:01:37.740> so

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
Megatron's head it's very low quality so

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.530 
Megatron's head it's very low quality so
you<00:01:38.189> can't<00:01:38.400> make<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.700> out<00:01:38.790> too<00:01:39.030> much<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.420> it

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
you can't make it out too much but it

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.450 
you can't make it out too much but it
looks<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:39.869> Megatron's<00:01:40.380> battle<00:01:40.770> damaged<00:01:41.159> tad

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
looks like Megatron's battle damaged tad

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.530 
looks like Megatron's battle damaged tad
so<00:01:42.000> there<00:01:42.600> might<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.079> return<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.710> Megatron

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
so there might be a return of Megatron

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.999 
so there might be a return of Megatron
also<00:01:45.540> there<00:01:45.750> was<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.079> poster<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.740> says

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
also there was this poster that says

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.560 
also there was this poster that says

he's watching you with a different

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.630 
he's watching you with a different
Decepticon<00:01:49.229> face<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.460> lot<00:01:50.579> of

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
Decepticon face on it and a lot of

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.280 
Decepticon face on it and a lot of
people<00:01:50.939> are<00:01:51.030> thinking<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.600> could<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:51.930> psych

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
people are thinking that could be psych
