00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:15.870
 four years paolo discovered this time 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.570
 we are in the car with a guest 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.279
 particular even in a moment 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:34.559
 particular because alex de angelis is 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:36.120
 finally returned to the motorcycle gp last but 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.800
 even today you had fun because you 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.410
 we saw that in the first round 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.000
 in short, you have struggled a little bit but in 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.610
 reality the future I did not enjoy 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.450
 much and opposition on how calmly 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.469
 then it started after 0 and in the end I have to say 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:01:01.190
 was happy because I managed to 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:01:01.190
 do also on the first day 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.790
 engaged in that case seen by the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.710
 fans do not manage to make 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.409
 account of what difference there may be 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.500
 between a motorcycle we say derivative of series 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.590
 like a moto2 it's a gp bike what it is 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.899
 really try when you climb on a 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.990
 monster of that type but they know that a 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.310
 big lines we can give numbers 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.190
 that there will be those high the truth not 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.119
 But we know the one moto2 to 120 horses 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:34.420
 approximately of the motogp obviously appears 260 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.819
 horses and in the end weigh only 10 c is 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.850
 a monstrous power 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:42.550
 we know you are a pilot 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.470
 extraordinary but radio paddock and says 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.530
 also that you are extraordinary in others 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.569
 things to get here in the car 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.860
 we were practically attacked by the 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:55.450
 from the girls for us exact girls 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.789
 all of which was looking for a theme with this 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.560
 history but according to which luck 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.640
 surely this is enough to say then of 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.160
 go to the ass but the motogp is better and 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.869
 moto2 for girls then for le 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.180
 girls at the end what they see 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.269
 the important thing is really the ass pasta 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.769
 nobody understood you have to try and 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.049
 highlight the wife in the end are 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.489
 single case in the diffuser life are 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.019
 single and consequently 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.159
 I'm looking for a soul mate is that not 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.930
 I find it will give a mess but the second is 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:34.569
 particularly complicated in this 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:39.840
 no case to follow because it is hunted 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:42.340
 well surely setup killed seven alex 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.150
 another indiscretion seems to us that you 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.400
 now have changed managers have us 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.159
 said he fired the legendary Carlo 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.829
 verna first lime got attention 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.930
 as a season then why don't I have 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.489
 changed manager but no longer work with 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.010
 therefore we got separated but 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:06.700
 absolutely with a hug then 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:10.719
 they asked for food also because 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.549
 they are forgotten about 20 in length 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.379
 like you, he is a great manager 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.180
 done so much for me I take the opportunity 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.769
 also to thank him but I believe that 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.479
 in the end we want to get dressed or not 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.569
 things at the time did only as evoked 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:24.430
 with title and already has some ideas for 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.260
 next year because we want to 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.239
 review often in this machine 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.650
 maybe with some great wins 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.120
 prize with some podiums 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.609
 then maybe we take a car more 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.769
 big but actually look into the last ones 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.909
 years I changed a lot both in a year and 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.709
 the other is also known as this year 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:40.299
 during the season actually on the way 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.620
 it would be to find a team that can 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.810
 give the possibility to make a contract 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.569
 of 2 3 years or otherwise to continue one 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.170
 career then would not be at the moment 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.580
 limited 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.590
 in shaping maybe do another year 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.680
 with the yamaha capital that as it does 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.810
 see spanish was superbike like it or not 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.910
 I've never tried the superbike then 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.160
 I can't say I like it or I don't like it 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.470
 certainly make a contract with a house 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.690
 mother also in superbike could be 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.910
 surely an aprilia road is 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.690
 looking for pilots because they will return on 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.290
 next year 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.819
 why not why not 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.370
 I do not know I have not yet made contact e 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.859
 I believe that by now everyone knows they are 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.530
 come back a lot of city and I feel that I have 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.240
 I don't have a lot of eyes on him 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.949
 time because in my opinion in September 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.009
 all the bikes will be already before they were 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.210
 be occupied then maximum misano e 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.460
 I have to show that he did anyway 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.070
 definitely party stand by step 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.419
 feel because you're wearing a nice 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.660
 responsibility 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:41.530
 10 how will you spend this weekend here a 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.110
 brno in the absolute chastity a 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.720
 in short, something has marked the cart 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.120
 something also to understand and read 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.870
 motogp and loved very powerful a little 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.870
 you have to eat 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.729
 among other things, luckily we will also remain 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.979
 Monday has injuries for me is one 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.470
 great thing fine with this bike 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.520
 then consequently fourth Tuesday 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.919
 morning 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.349
 certain admission ones we want a 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.289
 last thing to greet your numerous 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:14.330
 ngm forward team press officers who 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.430
 I wanted to come with us but what 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.620
 expert naturalist explained for 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.060
 this time I got a 500 we were 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.840

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.840
