hey<00:00:00.659> YouTube<00:00:01.050> spider<00:00:01.350> 0:04<00:00:02.159> here<00:00:02.460> and<00:00:02.850> I<00:00:02.909> just

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
hey YouTube spider 0:04 here and I just

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.519 
hey YouTube spider 0:04 here and I just
wanted<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.419> show<00:00:03.600> something<00:00:03.990> that<00:00:04.020> I<00:00:04.259> made

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
wanted to show something that I made

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.980 
wanted to show something that I made
today<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:05.270> don't<00:00:06.270> particularly<00:00:06.750> like

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
today I don't particularly like

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.350 
today I don't particularly like
helicopters<00:00:07.589> but<00:00:08.189> I<00:00:08.220> joined<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.670> server<00:00:09.120> today

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
helicopters but I joined a server today

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.320 
helicopters but I joined a server today
that<00:00:09.840> my<00:00:09.960> friend<00:00:10.230> XXX<00:00:10.830> mags<00:00:11.130> was<00:00:11.340> on<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:12.210> he

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
that my friend XXX mags was on and he

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.770 
that my friend XXX mags was on and he
was<00:00:12.450> trying<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.929> do<00:00:13.080> an<00:00:13.259> RC<00:00:13.950> helicopter<00:00:14.849> rotor

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
was trying to do an RC helicopter rotor

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.990 
was trying to do an RC helicopter rotor
and<00:00:16.199> he<00:00:16.350> was<00:00:16.470> basing<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:16.980> off<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.760> picture

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
and he was basing it off of a picture

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.150 
and he was basing it off of a picture
that<00:00:18.180> he<00:00:18.480> had<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.529> he<00:00:19.619> showed<00:00:19.800> me<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> picture

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
that he had and he showed me the picture

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.140 
that he had and he showed me the picture
so<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.880> had<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> go<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:22.220> I<00:00:23.220> think<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.820> turned<00:00:24.029> out

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
so I had a go and I think it turned out

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.880 
so I had a go and I think it turned out
pretty<00:00:24.330> good<00:00:24.720> I've<00:00:25.109> never<00:00:25.260> actually<00:00:25.470> done

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
pretty good I've never actually done

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
pretty good I've never actually done
anything<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:27.720> goal<00:00:27.900> was<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.910> have

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
anything like this the goal was to have

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.659 
anything like this the goal was to have
everything<00:00:30.570> connected<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:32.309> tube

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
everything connected like this this tube

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.290 
everything connected like this this tube
here<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.000> connected<00:00:33.890> to<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.219> gear<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.969> gear

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
here is connected to this gear this gear

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.770 
here is connected to this gear this gear
is<00:00:36.870> connected<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.680> gear<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:39.360> gear

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
is connected to this gear and this gear

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.700 
is connected to this gear and this gear
is<00:00:41.059> spins<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.390> pipe<00:00:43.700> which<00:00:44.930> turns<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.350> and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
is spins this pipe which turns this and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
is spins this pipe which turns this and
this<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.410> this<00:00:49.410> length<00:00:49.860> is

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
this is this is this length is

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.420 
this is this is this length is
determined<00:00:51.000> by<00:00:51.510> where<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:53.190> kind<00:00:53.399> of

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
determined by where this is it's kind of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:02.360 
determined by where this is it's kind of
complex<00:00:53.789> but<00:01:00.379> all<00:01:01.379> right<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.039> should<00:01:02.070> be

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
complex but all right so you should be

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.490 
complex but all right so you should be
able<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.609> see<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.940> motion<00:01:05.060> you<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.180> see<00:01:06.500> this

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
able to see the motion you can see this

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.149 
able to see the motion you can see this
pulls<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.189> down<00:01:08.930> that<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.740> also<00:01:10.890> turn

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
pulls that down that this can also turn

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.530 
pulls that down that this can also turn
now<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.520> very<00:01:14.760> good<00:01:14.939> system<00:01:15.330> because

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
now it's not a very good system because

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.560 
now it's not a very good system because
there's<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.930> many<00:01:16.790> constraints<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.299> that

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
there's so many constraints in this that

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.480 
there's so many constraints in this that
it<00:01:18.689> makes<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:19.650> pretty<00:01:19.920> much<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.130> really

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
it makes it it's pretty much a really

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.600 
it makes it it's pretty much a really
bad<00:01:20.759> way<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.030> build<00:01:21.330> something<00:01:21.710> but<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:23.400> kind

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
bad way to build something but it's kind

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.580 
bad way to build something but it's kind
of<00:01:23.640> neat<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.150> all<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.900> constraints<00:01:25.320> are

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
of neat that all the constraints are

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.320 
of neat that all the constraints are
there<00:01:25.619> yeah<00:01:26.189> well<00:01:26.340> there's<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.729> pole<00:01:27.030> with

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
there yeah well there's this pole with

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.130 
there yeah well there's this pole with
an<00:01:27.479> axis<00:01:27.900> here<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.350> that's<00:01:29.159> welded<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.759> this

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
an axis here and that's welded to this

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:39.569 
an axis here and that's welded to this
which<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:32.180> connected<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.420> blades

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.510 

and<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:41.320> should<00:01:41.500> be<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.710> right<00:01:41.859> pitch<00:01:42.130> and

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
and it should be the right pitch and

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.819 
and it should be the right pitch and
then<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:43.359> can<00:01:43.479> also<00:01:43.630> spin<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:47.380> it'll<00:01:47.679> never

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
then it can also spin like it'll never

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.980 
then it can also spin like it'll never
actually<00:01:48.130> do<00:01:48.700> something<00:01:49.149> like<00:01:49.570> you<00:01:49.840> won't

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
actually do something like you won't

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.469 
actually do something like you won't
ever<00:01:50.140> actually<00:01:50.409> fly<00:01:51.009> because<00:01:51.939> the<00:01:52.210> the

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
ever actually fly because the the

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.059 
ever actually fly because the the
constraints<00:01:53.020> are<00:01:53.140> way<00:01:53.319> too<00:01:53.380> weak<00:01:53.770> for<00:01:54.009> that

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
constraints are way too weak for that

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.029 
constraints are way too weak for that
you<00:01:54.880> can<00:01:54.969> see<00:01:55.179> it's<00:01:55.329> it's<00:01:55.600> got<00:01:55.869> its<00:01:56.350> got<00:01:56.409> wobble

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
you can see it's it's got its got wobble

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:03.870 
you can see it's it's got its got wobble
yeah<00:01:57.789> look<00:01:58.149> at<00:01:58.240> that<00:01:58.360> wobble<00:01:58.750> okay<00:02:02.189> still<00:02:03.189> it's

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
yeah look at that wobble okay still it's

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.219 
yeah look at that wobble okay still it's
kind<00:02:04.030> of<00:02:04.149> eye<00:02:04.299> candy<00:02:04.600> just<00:02:05.049> kind<00:02:05.229> of<00:02:05.289> neat

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
kind of eye candy just kind of neat

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.340 
kind of eye candy just kind of neat
anyway<00:02:08.229> just<00:02:08.649> wanted<00:02:08.799> to<00:02:09.009> show<00:02:09.190> it
