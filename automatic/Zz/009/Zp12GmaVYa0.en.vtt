00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.300

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.780
 m 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.029

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:59.290
 now I'm going to add but pepper 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.290
 in grain here 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.310
 this Malian does not have to crush the 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.960
 pigments that inside 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.480
 here I add a little water 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.950
 still just a little bit of water and we 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.950
 cover the flat minutes 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.389

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.699
 Here at the end of the crisis we add 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.180
 a little bit of everywhere to make the 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.940
 greenery 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.800
 that's how it makes us beautiful 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.800
 color on the chu 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:45.310
 put it there to your plate eyes is 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:45.310
 ready 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.630
 nicolas i saw you m sylvain father 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.550
 falls there but I have another idea of 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.260
 parsley appears that parsley would have 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.290
 aphrodisiac virtues 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.850
 do you agree with listening 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.130
 I do not really believe it but it's 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.170
 possible but otherwise it's more or less 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.610
 to put a little bit of greenery eps 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.590
 Perhaps his side a little supply 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.140
 said I do not know but who knows 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.840
 I leave it to each person 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.730
 to appreciate here is for the guinea fowl to 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.170
 punta sauerkraut cabbage if you 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.960
 so prefer to prepare your 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:21.770
 guinea fowl with cabbage you need to 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:24.230
 guinea fowl of course to make that cabbage 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.020
 laurel peppercorn oil 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:30.130
