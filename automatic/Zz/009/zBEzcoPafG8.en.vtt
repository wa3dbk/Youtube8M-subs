you've<00:00:04.270> got<00:00:04.540> these<00:00:04.720> the<00:00:05.110> wood<00:00:05.530> panel<00:00:05.950> doors

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:06.190 
you've got these the wood panel doors

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.820 
you've got these the wood panel doors
and<00:00:06.580> they're<00:00:06.760> drying<00:00:07.029> out<00:00:07.330> I<00:00:07.660> don't<00:00:08.590> know<00:00:08.800> if

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:08.830 
and they're drying out I don't know if

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.500 
and they're drying out I don't know if
you<00:00:09.010> can<00:00:09.160> see<00:00:09.519> but<00:00:09.790> you<00:00:10.290> can<00:00:11.290> see<00:00:11.320> this<00:00:11.650> cracks

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.510 
you can see but you can see this cracks

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.180 
you can see but you can see this cracks
you<00:00:13.510> like<00:00:13.840> to<00:00:14.050> the<00:00:14.170> crack<00:00:14.470> the<00:00:14.680> panels<00:00:15.040> are

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
you like to the crack the panels are

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.700 
you like to the crack the panels are
drying<00:00:15.430> out<00:00:16.140> and<00:00:17.910> down<00:00:18.910> there<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:20.470> what<00:00:20.619> I'm

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
drying out and down there so what I'm

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.249 
drying out and down there so what I'm
going<00:00:20.890> to<00:00:20.919> do<00:00:21.070> is<00:00:21.749> I'm<00:00:22.749> going<00:00:22.869> to<00:00:22.929> fill<00:00:23.140> those

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
going to do is I'm going to fill those

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.050 
going to do is I'm going to fill those
cracks<00:00:23.320> this<00:00:24.039> technique<00:00:24.460> works<00:00:24.759> for<00:00:25.029> a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
cracks this technique works for a

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.579 
cracks this technique works for a
painted<00:00:25.509> door<00:00:25.689> it<00:00:25.779> won't<00:00:25.900> work<00:00:26.079> for<00:00:26.140> a<00:00:26.409> door

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:26.589 
painted door it won't work for a door

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.729 
painted door it won't work for a door
then<00:00:26.949> clear<00:00:27.699> varnish<00:00:27.880> on<00:00:28.269> it<00:00:28.359> but<00:00:29.199> you<00:00:29.349> can<00:00:29.499> see

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
then clear varnish on it but you can see

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.080 
then clear varnish on it but you can see
one<00:00:29.919> here<00:00:30.339> what<00:00:30.849> I've<00:00:30.999> done<00:00:31.060> in<00:00:31.359> the<00:00:31.419> past<00:00:33.090> what

one here what I've done in the past what
I'm<00:00:34.210> going<00:00:34.390> to<00:00:34.480> do<00:00:34.570> is<00:00:34.750> I'm<00:00:34.900> going<00:00:35.079> to<00:00:35.140> use<00:00:35.350> a

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
I'm going to do is I'm going to use a

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.389 
I'm going to do is I'm going to use a
technique<00:00:36.190> that<00:00:36.219> boat<00:00:36.609> builders<00:00:37.090> use<00:00:37.390> and<00:00:38.399> I'm

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
technique that boat builders use and I'm

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.990 
technique that boat builders use and I'm
going<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.609> take<00:00:39.760> a<00:00:40.530> natural<00:00:41.530> fiber<00:00:42.129> string<00:00:42.730> and

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
going to take a natural fiber string and

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.599 
going to take a natural fiber string and
put<00:00:43.600> wood<00:00:43.840> glue<00:00:44.140> on<00:00:44.320> it<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.620> pack<00:00:45.160> it<00:00:45.190> into<00:00:45.430> the

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
put wood glue on it and pack it into the

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:51.660 
put wood glue on it and pack it into the
cracks

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.070 

so<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:53.210> first<00:00:53.450> thing<00:00:53.630> you<00:00:53.690> want<00:00:53.810> to<00:00:53.840> do<00:00:53.960> is

so the first thing you want to do is

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.800 
so the first thing you want to do is
clean<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.470> crack<00:00:54.710> out<00:00:54.950> this<00:00:55.520> was<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.330> doors

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
clean the crack out this was the doors

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.860 
clean the crack out this was the doors
put<00:00:57.110> together<00:00:57.230> in<00:00:57.560> multiple<00:00:58.280> panels<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:59.060> when

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
put together in multiple panels and when

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.150 
put together in multiple panels and when
they<00:00:59.960> put<00:01:00.140> it<00:01:00.200> together<00:01:00.290> use<00:01:00.710> some<00:01:00.860> kind<00:01:01.040> of<00:01:01.070> a

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
they put it together use some kind of a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.620 
they put it together use some kind of a
filler<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:01.550> I<00:01:01.670> need<00:01:01.820> to<00:01:01.880> get<00:01:01.970> that<00:01:02.150> filler<00:01:02.420> all

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
filler and I need to get that filler all

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.490 
filler and I need to get that filler all
the<00:01:02.750> way<00:01:02.840> out<00:01:02.960> of<00:01:03.080> there<00:01:03.200> so<00:01:03.320> I've<00:01:03.410> been

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
the way out of there so I've been

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.590 
the way out of there so I've been
working<00:01:03.650> out<00:01:03.920> with<00:01:03.980> a<00:01:04.190> with<00:01:04.940> a<00:01:04.970> plain<00:01:05.449> old

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
working out with a with a plain old

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.190 
working out with a with a plain old
utility<00:01:05.840> knife<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.530> then<00:01:07.430> I<00:01:07.930> cleaned<00:01:08.930> it<00:01:09.050> out

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
utility knife and then I cleaned it out

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.440 
utility knife and then I cleaned it out
with<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:09.580> hacksaw<00:01:10.580> blade<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.090> it's<00:01:11.210> kind<00:01:11.420> of

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
with a hacksaw blade so it's kind of

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.390 
with a hacksaw blade so it's kind of
whatever<00:01:11.600> will<00:01:11.810> fit<00:01:12.080> in<00:01:12.230> there<00:01:12.440> to<00:01:12.980> clean<00:01:13.220> all

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
whatever will fit in there to clean all

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.070 
whatever will fit in there to clean all
that<00:01:13.430> out<00:01:13.730> get<00:01:14.120> some<00:01:14.180> nice<00:01:14.480> good<00:01:14.660> wood

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
that out get some nice good wood

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.070 
that out get some nice good wood
services<00:01:15.620> on<00:01:15.770> each<00:01:15.890> side<00:01:16.130> of<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.280> crack<00:01:17.080> the

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
services on each side of the crack the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.990 
services on each side of the crack the
next<00:01:18.380> step<00:01:18.590> is<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:19.280> use<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:20.270> plain<00:01:20.750> piece<00:01:21.170> of

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
next step is to use a plain piece of

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.300 
next step is to use a plain piece of
natural<00:01:23.000> fiber<00:01:23.300> string<00:01:23.869> this<00:01:24.320> is<00:01:24.470> just<00:01:24.650> a<00:01:24.800> ball

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
natural fiber string this is just a ball

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.250 
natural fiber string this is just a ball
of<00:01:25.550> string<00:01:25.790> I<00:01:25.940> bought<00:01:26.150> for<00:01:26.450> on<00:01:26.600> whatever<00:01:27.050> it

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
of string I bought for on whatever it

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
and you want to make the string a little

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.240 
and you want to make the string a little
bit<00:01:32.840> longer<00:01:33.140> at<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.470> top<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:33.920> at<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.070> bottom

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.350 
start pulling the string down as you
pack<00:01:51.740> it<00:01:51.890> in<00:01:52.009> there<00:01:52.160> and<00:01:52.340> you'll<00:01:52.910> leave<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.090> gap

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
pack it in there and you'll leave a gap

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.270 
pack it in there and you'll leave a gap
at<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.600> top<00:01:53.660> so<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.740> just<00:01:54.920> leave<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.130> little

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
at the top so you just leave a little

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.890 
at the top so you just leave a little
bit<00:01:55.460> hanging<00:01:55.520> out<00:01:55.909> you<00:01:56.090> hold<00:01:56.270> on<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.690> it<00:01:56.720> you

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
bit hanging out you hold on to it you

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.320 
bit hanging out you hold on to it you
pack<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.290> in<00:01:57.409> there<00:01:57.590> usually<00:01:58.520> I<00:01:58.760> use<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:59.150> back

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
pack it in there usually I use the back

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.250 
pack it in there usually I use the back
of<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.570> knife<00:01:59.750> to<00:02:00.320> pack<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:01.030> this<00:02:02.030> door<00:02:02.510> is

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
of the knife to pack it this door is

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.200 
of the knife to pack it this door is
going<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.530> take<00:02:03.740> two<00:02:03.980> strings<00:02:04.370> one<00:02:04.670> on<00:02:04.790> top<00:02:05.060> of

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
going to take two strings one on top of

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.700 
going to take two strings one on top of
the<00:02:05.300> other<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.930> only<00:02:06.110> trick<00:02:06.380> here<00:02:06.590> is<00:02:06.620> you

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
the other and the only trick here is you

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.960 
the other and the only trick here is you
don't<00:02:06.920> want<00:02:07.070> to<00:02:07.130> push<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.490> string<00:02:07.729> all<00:02:07.940> the

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
don't want to push the string all the

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.370 
don't want to push the string all the
way<00:02:08.090> out<00:02:08.269> to<00:02:08.510> the<00:02:08.630> other<00:02:08.810> side<00:02:09.019> of<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.170> door

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
way out to the other side of the door

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.449 
way out to the other side of the door
you<00:02:09.590> know<00:02:09.709> what<00:02:09.830> it's<00:02:09.950> sticking<00:02:10.220> out<00:02:10.340> the

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
you know what it's sticking out the

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.890 
you know what it's sticking out the
other<00:02:10.640> side<00:02:10.790> of<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:10.970> door

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.750 

here<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.020> see<00:02:17.200> where<00:02:17.350> I'm<00:02:17.470> getting<00:02:18.160> done<00:02:18.400> I've

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
here you see where I'm getting done I've

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.760 
here you see where I'm getting done I've
gotten<00:02:19.120> this<00:02:19.240> part<00:02:19.630> in<00:02:19.900> there<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.260> it's<00:02:20.590> not

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
gotten this part in there and it's not

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.920 
gotten this part in there and it's not
consistent<00:02:21.610> yet<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:22.120> switched<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.630> flat

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
consistent yet I switched to a flat

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.450 
consistent yet I switched to a flat
bladed<00:02:23.200> screwdriver<00:02:23.320> because<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.130> found<00:02:24.310> that

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
bladed screwdriver because I found that

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.730 
bladed screwdriver because I found that
the<00:02:24.640> tip<00:02:24.820> of<00:02:24.850> this<00:02:25.060> fifth<00:02:26.050> is<00:02:26.200> crack<00:02:26.530> much

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
the tip of this fifth is crack much

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.820 
the tip of this fifth is crack much
better<00:02:27.570> if<00:02:28.570> you<00:02:28.720> use<00:02:28.840> something<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.380> narrow<00:02:29.620> it

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
better if you use something to narrow it

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.980 
better if you use something to narrow it
tries<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.070> pop<00:02:30.430> all<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.700> way<00:02:30.880> through<00:02:31.240> view

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
tries to pop all the way through view

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.660 
tries to pop all the way through view
something<00:02:32.410> too<00:02:32.620> wide<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:33.010> won't<00:02:33.190> go<00:02:33.310> in<00:02:33.340> there

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
something too wide it won't go in there

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.910 
something too wide it won't go in there
so<00:02:34.300> anyway<00:02:34.750> this<00:02:34.900> tool<00:02:35.290> will<00:02:35.380> happen<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.740> turn

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
so anyway this tool will happen to turn

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.860 
so anyway this tool will happen to turn
out<00:02:36.070> to<00:02:36.370> be<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.700> best<00:02:36.850> thing<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.270> of<00:02:37.360> course<00:02:37.600> I

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
out to be the best thing and of course I

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.500 
out to be the best thing and of course I
have<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.290> clean<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.530> up<00:02:38.680> when<00:02:38.800> I'm<00:02:38.950> done<00:02:39.130> but

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
have to clean it up when I'm done but

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.300 
have to clean it up when I'm done but
that's<00:02:40.510> part<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.020> so<00:02:41.590> anyway<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:41.980> can<00:02:42.010> see

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
that's part of it so anyway you can see

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.880 
that's part of it so anyway you can see
going<00:02:42.850> in<00:02:43.030> there<00:02:43.240> I've<00:02:44.140> got<00:02:44.320> lots<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:44.650> wet<00:02:44.860> rags

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
going in there I've got lots of wet rags

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.490 
going in there I've got lots of wet rags
around<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.640> help<00:02:45.820> clean<00:02:46.420> up<00:02:46.570> excess<00:02:47.020> glue<00:02:47.320> and

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
around to help clean up excess glue and

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.140 
around to help clean up excess glue and
so<00:02:47.620> on<00:02:47.940> okay

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
so on okay

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.810 
so on okay
so<00:02:49.590> I'll<00:02:50.590> continue<00:02:50.860> on<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.490> I'll<00:02:51.610> show<00:02:51.790> you

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
so I'll continue on and I'll show you

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.729 
so I'll continue on and I'll show you
when<00:02:52.060> it's<00:02:52.090> done

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.849 

a<00:02:58.060> bit<00:02:59.060> of<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.239> side<00:02:59.510> note<00:02:59.540> here<00:03:00.140> when<00:03:00.680> you're

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
a bit of a side note here when you're

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.979 
a bit of a side note here when you're
doing<00:03:01.129> this<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.849> crack<00:03:02.150> will<00:03:02.359> change<00:03:02.629> width

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
doing this the crack will change width

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.130 
doing this the crack will change width
from<00:03:03.560> thicker<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.730> no<00:03:05.090> wider<00:03:05.540> crack<00:03:05.959> the

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
from thicker to no wider crack the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.050 
from thicker to no wider crack the
narrow<00:03:06.349> to<00:03:06.469> crack<00:03:06.739> what<00:03:07.489> you<00:03:07.640> can<00:03:07.790> do<00:03:07.939> to

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
narrow to crack what you can do to

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.059 
narrow to crack what you can do to
control<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.599> width<00:03:08.750> of<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.019> string<00:03:09.379> is<00:03:09.560> if

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
control the width of the string is if

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.550 
control the width of the string is if
you<00:03:10.189> twist<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.730> string<00:03:11.000> tighter

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
you twist the string tighter

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.300 
you twist the string tighter
string<00:03:12.829> is<00:03:12.950> narrower<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.959> if<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:15.500> untwist<00:03:16.040> it

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
string is narrower and if you untwist it

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.250 
string is narrower and if you untwist it
it<00:03:16.549> gets<00:03:16.730> fatter<00:03:17.000> so<00:03:17.389> you<00:03:17.840> can<00:03:17.959> do<00:03:18.079> that

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
it gets fatter so you can do that

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.809 
it gets fatter so you can do that
technique<00:03:18.799> as<00:03:18.980> you're<00:03:19.129> going<00:03:19.250> along<00:03:19.639> as

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
technique as you're going along as

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.580 
technique as you're going along as
you're<00:03:19.969> applying<00:03:20.209> it<00:03:20.420> in<00:03:20.569> here<00:03:20.810> twist<00:03:21.469> the

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
you're applying it in here twist the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.410 
you're applying it in here twist the
tire<00:03:21.829> to<00:03:22.010> make<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.250> narrower<00:03:22.579> and<00:03:22.909> looser<00:03:23.269> to

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
tire to make it narrower and looser to

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.379 
tire to make it narrower and looser to
make<00:03:23.569> it<00:03:23.719> wider<00:03:24.340> also<00:03:25.340> if<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:25.969> string<00:03:26.239> that

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
make it wider also if the string that

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.330 
make it wider also if the string that
turns<00:03:26.629> out<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:26.840> be<00:03:26.989> too<00:03:27.230> wide<00:03:27.439> you<00:03:27.500> can<00:03:27.829> undo

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
turns out to be too wide you can undo

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.520 
turns out to be too wide you can undo
the<00:03:28.730> strain<00:03:29.060> like<00:03:29.239> this<00:03:29.450> has<00:03:29.659> the<00:03:30.049> string<00:03:30.349> has

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
the strain like this has the string has

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.970 
the strain like this has the string has
three<00:03:31.480> sub<00:03:32.480> parts<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:33.019> it<00:03:33.139> you<00:03:33.290> can<00:03:33.409> remove<00:03:33.680> one

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
three sub parts to it you can remove one

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.500

the<00:04:11.260> panel's<00:04:11.830> out<00:04:12.010> of<00:04:12.130> flatness<00:04:12.610> you<00:04:12.730> want<00:04:12.880> to

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
the panel's out of flatness you want to

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.280 
the panel's out of flatness you want to
make<00:04:13.060> sure<00:04:13.240> that<00:04:13.360> you<00:04:13.450> don't<00:04:13.540> push<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.870> panel

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.850 
make sure that you don't push the panel
like<00:04:14.500> this

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
like this

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.460 
like this
if<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:15.460> do<00:04:15.640> it's<00:04:16.510> pretty<00:04:16.810> simple<00:04:17.109> you<00:04:17.170> just

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
if you do it's pretty simple you just

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.229 
if you do it's pretty simple you just
push<00:04:17.920> them<00:04:18.070> back<00:04:18.220> in<00:04:18.400> alignment<00:04:18.700> they'll<00:04:19.000> stay

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
push them back in alignment they'll stay

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.560 
push them back in alignment they'll stay
there<00:04:19.269> and<00:04:19.600> once<00:04:19.780> that<00:04:19.959> glue<00:04:20.170> sets<00:04:20.910> they<00:04:21.910> will

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
there and once that glue sets they will

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.930 
there and once that glue sets they will
stay<00:04:22.780> there<00:04:22.960> this<00:04:23.680> site<00:04:23.950> is<00:04:24.130> done<00:04:24.310> flat<00:04:26.940> pretty

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
stay there this site is done flat pretty

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.580 
stay there this site is done flat pretty
much<00:04:28.120> there<00:04:28.360> but<00:04:28.990> you've<00:04:29.170> got<00:04:29.320> an<00:04:29.410> airtight

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
much there but you've got an airtight

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.560 
much there but you've got an airtight
watertight<00:04:30.190> seal<00:04:30.820> once<00:04:31.120> this<00:04:31.330> has<00:04:31.540> been

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
watertight seal once this has been

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.210 
watertight seal once this has been
cocked<00:04:32.140> and<00:04:32.410> painted<00:04:32.740> so<00:04:33.840> yeah<00:04:34.840> that's<00:04:35.350> that's

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
cocked and painted so yeah that's that's

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.400 
cocked and painted so yeah that's that's
it<00:04:36.520> for<00:04:36.730> now<00:04:36.820> I'll<00:04:37.030> show<00:04:37.240> you<00:04:37.270> when<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.660> second

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
it for now I'll show you when the second

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.990 
it for now I'll show you when the second
string<00:04:38.620> is<00:04:38.740> in<00:04:38.920> there<00:04:39.070> and<00:04:39.250> we'll<00:04:39.400> go<00:04:39.580> on<00:04:39.760> from

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
string is in there and we'll go on from

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.589 
string is in there and we'll go on from
there

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.989 

so<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.139> second<00:04:45.469> piece<00:04:45.529> is<00:04:45.589> in<00:04:45.919> same<00:04:46.399> processes

00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:46.999 
so the second piece is in same processes

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.389 
so the second piece is in same processes
the<00:04:47.119> first<00:04:47.270> lay<00:04:47.659> the<00:04:47.689> string<00:04:48.110> down<00:04:48.289> push<00:04:49.099> it<00:04:49.279> in

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:49.399 
the first lay the string down push it in

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:52.089 
the first lay the string down push it in
there<00:04:49.839> go<00:04:50.839> back<00:04:51.050> over<00:04:51.379> it<00:04:51.469> and<00:04:51.529> make<00:04:51.740> sure<00:04:51.770> it's

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
there go back over it and make sure it's

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:53.769 
there go back over it and make sure it's
at<00:04:52.189> the<00:04:52.339> consistent<00:04:53.029> depth<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:53.569> I<00:04:53.629> always

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:53.779 
at the consistent depth and I always

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:55.449 
at the consistent depth and I always
make<00:04:54.080> sure<00:04:54.199> it's<00:04:54.379> below<00:04:54.649> the<00:04:54.679> top<00:04:55.039> of<00:04:55.189> the<00:04:55.249> wood

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:55.459 
make sure it's below the top of the wood

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:58.119 
make sure it's below the top of the wood
that<00:04:56.059> way<00:04:56.209> when<00:04:56.419> you<00:04:56.809> it<00:04:57.050> or<00:04:57.199> I<00:04:57.529> guess<00:04:58.009> you

00:04:58.119 --> 00:04:58.129 
that way when you it or I guess you

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:59.980 
that way when you it or I guess you
could<00:04:58.249> use<00:04:58.279> putty<00:04:59.029> in<00:04:59.209> their<00:04:59.240> matching<00:04:59.749> putty

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
could use putty in their matching putty

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.999 
could use putty in their matching putty
and<00:05:00.580> hide<00:05:01.580> them<00:05:01.729> crack<00:05:01.939> all<00:05:02.149> together<00:05:02.300> but<00:05:03.009> you

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009 
and hide them crack all together but you

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:05.469 
and hide them crack all together but you
need<00:05:04.159> to<00:05:04.309> have<00:05:04.459> some<00:05:04.699> space<00:05:04.969> in<00:05:05.149> there<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.389> get

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
need to have some space in there to get

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.059 
need to have some space in there to get
the<00:05:05.659> putty<00:05:06.110> your<00:05:06.259> caulking<00:05:06.709> whatever<00:05:06.949> you're

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:07.069 
the putty your caulking whatever you're

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.669 
the putty your caulking whatever you're
going<00:05:07.159> to<00:05:07.219> do<00:05:07.369> in<00:05:07.550> there<00:05:08.289> okay<00:05:09.289> so<00:05:09.349> make<00:05:09.649> sure

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:09.679 
going to do in there okay so make sure

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:12.969 
going to do in there okay so make sure
that<00:05:09.800> the<00:05:10.039> consistent<00:05:10.610> depth<00:05:11.649> make<00:05:12.649> sure<00:05:12.830> your

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
that the consistent depth make sure your

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.589 
that the consistent depth make sure your
panels<00:05:13.429> are<00:05:13.550> still<00:05:13.789> flat<00:05:14.089> that<00:05:14.300> you<00:05:14.330> haven't

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
panels are still flat that you haven't

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:17.139 
panels are still flat that you haven't
pushed<00:05:14.749> them<00:05:14.929> out<00:05:14.990> of<00:05:15.110> flat<00:05:15.319> and<00:05:15.589> then<00:05:16.219> clean

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:17.149 
pushed them out of flat and then clean

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:21.790 
pushed them out of flat and then clean
it<00:05:17.270> up<00:05:17.889> trim<00:05:18.889> off<00:05:19.069> the<00:05:19.309> ends<00:05:19.610> up<00:05:19.729> here<00:05:20.619> just<00:05:21.619> use

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
it up trim off the ends up here just use

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.600 
it up trim off the ends up here just use
a<00:05:21.830> knife<00:05:22.279> trim<00:05:22.879> off<00:05:23.029> the<00:05:23.209> end<00:05:23.330> up<00:05:23.479> there<00:05:23.749> and

a knife trim off the end up there and

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:31.059 
a knife trim off the end up there and
that's<00:05:25.610> pretty<00:05:25.819> much<00:05:25.939> it<00:05:26.089> so<00:05:29.379> you<00:05:30.680> it<00:05:30.709> or
