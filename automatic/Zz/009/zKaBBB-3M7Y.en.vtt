now really this this this is going to
sound<00:00:05.609> silly<00:00:05.879> but<00:00:06.029> this<00:00:06.299> is<00:00:06.450> really<00:00:06.839> really

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
sound silly but this is really really

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.259

was they've also been able to compare
human<00:01:10.439> genomes<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.250> ask<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.760> question<00:01:12.119> of

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
human genomes and ask the question of

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.750 
human genomes and ask the question of
whether<00:01:12.390> there's<00:01:12.689> any<00:01:12.840> evidence<00:01:13.049> of

Neanderthal genes in the human genome

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.640 
Neanderthal genes in the human genome
and<00:01:17.780> they<00:01:18.780> found<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.500> there<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:21.650> that's

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
and they found that there is and that's

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.620 
and they found that there is and that's
and<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.189> amount<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.729> quite<00:01:23.970> significant

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
and the amount is quite significant

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.170 
and the amount is quite significant
upwards<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.619> five<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.280> seven<00:01:26.580> percent

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.210 
the Denisovans they lived up here in
Siberia<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.090> they<00:02:06.780> have<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> their<00:02:07.770> genome<00:02:08.099> has

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
Siberia and they have a their genome has

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.919 
Siberia and they have a their genome has
been<00:02:08.250> sequenced<00:02:08.399> they<00:02:09.000> were<00:02:09.060> distinct<00:02:09.720> from

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
been sequenced they were distinct from

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.070 
been sequenced they were distinct from
the<00:02:10.080> Neanderthals<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.629> can<00:02:12.780> find

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
the Neanderthals and you so you can find

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.570 
the Neanderthals and you so you can find

Neanderthals we've been separated from

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.560 
Neanderthals we've been separated from

the some of the tribes in Papua New

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.360 
the some of the tribes in Papua New
Guinea<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:35.540> those<00:02:36.230> Islands<00:02:36.740> out<00:02:37.010> there

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
Guinea and those Islands out there

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.730 
Guinea and those Islands out there
there's<00:02:37.910> evidence<00:02:38.240> for<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.570> for<00:02:39.170> for<00:02:39.560> a

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
there's evidence for it for for a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.990 
there's evidence for it for for a
different<00:02:40.160> kind<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.400> genome<00:02:40.730> which<00:02:40.880> is

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
different kind of genome which is

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.090 
different kind of genome which is
probably<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.450> Denisovan<00:02:42.020> genome<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.620> they

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
probably the Denisovan genome and they

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.690 
probably the Denisovan genome and they
might<00:02:43.280> have<00:02:43.460> 7%<00:02:44.210> Neanderthal<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.230> 5%

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
might have 7% Neanderthal and 5%

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.190 
might have 7% Neanderthal and 5%
Denisovan<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:47.180> they<00:02:47.270> might<00:02:47.480> be<00:02:47.630> 12<00:02:47.900> or<00:02:48.080> 15

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
Denisovan so they might be 12 or 15

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.910 
Denisovan so they might be 12 or 15
percent<00:02:49.060> different<00:02:50.060> from<00:02:50.300> us<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.560> in<00:02:51.680> fact

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
percent different from us and in fact

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.140 
percent different from us and in fact
the<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:54.080> Africans<00:02:54.620> who<00:02:55.610> came<00:02:55.850> out<00:02:55.970> from

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
the the Africans who came out from

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.570 
the the Africans who came out from
Africa<00:02:56.660> have<00:02:56.990> no<00:02:57.350> evidence<00:02:58.040> of<00:02:58.280> any

Africa have no evidence of any
Neanderthal<00:02:59.380> genes<00:03:00.380> in<00:03:00.590> them<00:03:00.770> no<00:03:01.550> evidence<00:03:01.880> of

Neanderthal genes in them no evidence of

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.970 
Neanderthal genes in them no evidence of
admixture<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:03.260> they're<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.560> real<00:03:03.709> pure

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
admixture so they're the real pure

interesting<00:03:10.130> it<00:03:10.220> gives<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.520> a<00:03:10.550> lot<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.880> think

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
interesting it gives you a lot to think

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.690 
interesting it gives you a lot to think
about

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
about
