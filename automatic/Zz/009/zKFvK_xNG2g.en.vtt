battlefield<00:00:58.289> 3<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.620> QB<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.160> 88<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.879> by<00:01:00.180> far

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
battlefield 3 the QB you 88 is by far

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.650 
battlefield 3 the QB you 88 is by far
the<00:01:00.809> most<00:01:01.440> underused<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.270> reason

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the most underused one and the reason

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.380 
the most underused one and the reason
for<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.379> really<00:01:04.739> doesn't<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.400> any<00:01:05.760> one

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
for that is it really doesn't do any one

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.480 
for that is it really doesn't do any one
thing<00:01:06.450> better<00:01:07.229> than<00:01:07.979> any<00:01:08.220> other

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
thing better than any other

260 which is tied for the mark 11 and
the<00:01:16.110> SVD<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.400> slower<00:01:17.759> than<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.150> SKS<00:01:18.840> m4

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500

another bad thing about the QB you 88 is

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.080 
another bad thing about the QB you 88 is
its<00:02:37.840> aim<00:02:38.049> down<00:02:38.349> sights<00:02:38.709> accuracy<00:02:39.459> is<00:02:39.489> worse

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
I don't know maybe I'm just being stupid

I don't know maybe I'm just being stupid
with<00:02:54.069> my<00:02:54.220> reasoning<00:02:54.640> for<00:02:54.790> what<00:02:54.940> for<00:02:55.239> why<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.420> use

this gun but in my mind it makes it

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
makes sense to me of the semi-automatic

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
shorter damage range I find that

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.710 
shorter damage range I find that
actually<00:03:28.810> using<00:03:29.650> this<00:03:29.829> to<00:03:30.099> my<00:03:30.250> advantage

this<00:03:34.150> gun<00:03:34.420> well<00:03:34.989> actually<00:03:35.200> it's<00:03:35.530> turning<00:03:35.769> into

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
this gun well actually it's turning into

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.520 
this gun well actually it's turning into
a<00:03:36.190> bit<00:03:36.459> of<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.670> hit<00:03:36.910> firebeast<00:03:37.630> now<00:03:38.079> it's<00:03:38.319> by<00:03:38.500> no

about the fore grip on semi-automatic
sniper<00:04:25.120> rifles<00:04:25.719> believe

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
sniper rifles believe

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.820 
sniper rifles believe
the<00:04:26.300> foregrip<00:04:26.630> actually<00:04:27.110> reduces<00:04:27.680> your

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
the foregrip actually reduces your

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.250 
the foregrip actually reduces your
vertical<00:04:28.400> recoil<00:04:28.880> which<00:04:29.240> is<00:04:29.419> very<00:04:29.720> varies

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
vertical recoil which is very varies

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.050 
vertical recoil which is very varies
it's<00:04:30.889> not<00:04:31.040> really<00:04:31.160> surprising<00:04:31.400> but<00:04:31.790> it's<00:04:31.940> very

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
it's not really surprising but it's very

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.720 
it's not really surprising but it's very
very<00:04:32.360> good<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.750> have<00:04:32.960> but<00:04:33.620> there's<00:04:33.950> a<00:04:34.160> kind<00:04:34.550> of

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
very good to have but there's a kind of

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.370 
very good to have but there's a kind of
trade-off<00:04:35.060> that<00:04:35.240> comes<00:04:35.600> with<00:04:35.750> it<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:35.990> this<00:04:36.139> is

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
trade-off that comes with it and this is

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.720 
trade-off that comes with it and this is
mainly<00:04:36.620> having<00:04:36.980> to<00:04:37.070> deal<00:04:37.250> with<00:04:37.370> when<00:04:37.550> you're

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
mainly having to deal with when you're

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.970 
mainly having to deal with when you're
under<00:04:38.120> suppression<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.380> guys<00:04:39.560> know<00:04:39.800> in

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
under suppression you guys know in

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.770 
under suppression you guys know in
suppression<00:04:40.400> your<00:04:40.760> recoil<00:04:41.180> amounts<00:04:41.630> are

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
suppression your recoil amounts are

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.950 
suppression your recoil amounts are
increased<00:04:42.380> as<00:04:42.590> well<00:04:43.010> as<00:04:43.220> your<00:04:43.610> spread<00:04:44.180> so<00:04:44.720> if

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
increased as well as your spread so if

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.600 
increased as well as your spread so if
you<00:04:45.080> get<00:04:45.260> into<00:04:45.410> an<00:04:45.620> engagement<00:04:45.889> once<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:46.430> are

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
you get into an engagement once you are

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.700 
you get into an engagement once you are
heavily<00:04:46.820> suppressed<00:04:47.630> having<00:04:48.260> the<00:04:48.350> fore<00:04:48.560> grip

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
heavily suppressed having the fore grip

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.980 
heavily suppressed having the fore grip
on<00:04:48.919> will<00:04:49.130> help<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:49.490> control<00:04:49.910> your<00:04:50.060> weapon<00:04:50.840> a

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
on will help you control your weapon a

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.230 
on will help you control your weapon a
little<00:04:51.320> bit<00:04:51.440> better<00:04:51.680> at<00:04:51.919> but<00:04:52.730> at<00:04:52.850> the<00:04:52.970> same

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
little bit better at but at the same

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.379 
little bit better at but at the same
time<00:04:53.630> it<00:04:54.139> also<00:04:54.410> will<00:04:55.100> increase<00:04:55.520> your<00:04:55.639> 80s

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
time it also will increase your 80s

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.900 
time it also will increase your 80s
spread<00:04:56.960> so<00:04:57.560> it's<00:04:57.770> kind<00:04:57.980> of<00:04:58.070> a<00:04:58.190> trade-off<00:04:58.550> when

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
spread so it's kind of a trade-off when

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.450 
spread so it's kind of a trade-off when
using<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.330> fore<00:04:59.570> grip<00:04:59.720> on<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.080> QB<00:05:00.410> you<00:05:00.650> 88<00:05:01.160> or
