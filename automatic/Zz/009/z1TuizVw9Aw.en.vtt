 I hope you are super well today 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.980
 I come with a hyper-ordered video I 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.769
 you have left in almost all 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.440
 comments of the videos and is the mix up 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.029
 makeup sounds I have seen this video in a 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.680
 heap of channels and said I also what 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.630
 I want to do it looks fun in addition 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.939
 crust you think I do and here I am 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.410
 that's why I have but makeup and it's to the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.779
 once seen this video of what it is 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.420
 is to take two pieces of paper one of each 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.430
 boat in which there are arkadin parts 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.829
 the other in makeup and put it on 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.930
 where it comes out so at the end of the video 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.520
 Most likely, you 're horrible and 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.110
 that he can not go out with the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.329
 Makeup you have your face because 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.559
 it usually comes out disastrous so nothing 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.690
 let's see where it is 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.950
 ok here I'm going to take a piece of paper 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.190
 this and put this glass and put cheeks 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.149
 and now I'm going to take a paper from this one and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.820
 put your bronzer on the cheeks ok 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.680
 I knew how to put basically I do not get 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.680
 always because I wear the fabrics 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.710
 we get it right to me it does not come out great 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.240
 it comes out perfect 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.890
 in the cheeks 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.890
 I like I like 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.969
 the next 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.969
 put eyebrows 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.479
 when it gets into sorrows and chosen this 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.880
 blusher because it's a new one that I want 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.469
 try and only one they had a lot of 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:40.460
 makeup on my makeup stuff and 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:44.120
 red colors in those of 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.500
 we're going more, but there's not much left 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.530
 you know I always wanted to have my hair 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.940
 I was a little girl when I was 23 years old 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.270
 make the tips of those that we know 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.450
 where fashion the tips discolour fabrics and 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.210
 connect the pink tips 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.640
 that was my dream to always leave roses 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.240
 and finished 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.610
 Eyelids powder for eyebrows and property 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.110
 of hashish caught this brown nix well 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.110
 they come to me because you see yourself you tell me 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.740
 in the end I'll be that is brown 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.660
 in the arcs 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:23.620
 this is the best I've seen a lot of 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:27.070
 videos of people doing and be 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.070
 I'm having 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.610
 we blend very very very very well for 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.400
 to mix 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.400
 and we already have the eyes outline 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.940
 and lips 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.700
 where control what is 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.700
 Oh 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.620
 and then where do I put the winner 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.800
 it's also part of the part of 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.480
 above the front of the bridge 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.690
 my nose seems to be super 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.140
 nice and a little bit in the three and now 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.140
 we go 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.020
 when I finish I will go to you 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.020
 mystery is our skin 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.050
 7 but now it goes well dark circles of base 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.460
 makeup 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:30.240
 makeup base in the choose 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.460
 I talked to them a lot because they often do not 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.050
 I have, I do not want to take everything with me 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.700
 be very clear and I put a base of 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.300
 makeup so that you look better with the 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.350
 skin on the face please make it 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.320
 very good 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.740
 eyeshadow is worth it is shadow of 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:51.710
 eyes I will choose what I will choose 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.710
 good shade purple 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:00.200
 good good 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:03.660
 start well and I have it 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.970
 you see very little already used is but you 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.970
 go super super super super little 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:18.190
 it does not have to be pigmentation 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.190
 eyelash mask lips 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.199
 how do you wear mascara 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.340
 good 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.340
 goodbye gothic 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.050
 ok I think to stay the tip bell and 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.820
 let's see that I know I'm missing the 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.170
 hopes and they want to make dark circles 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.630
 with no tabs, so I have to 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.950
 put the rector on the tracks and corrector 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.950
 I have this 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.730
 at least 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.039
 under 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.150
 between the red eyebrows the eyelashes of 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:10.070
 corrector 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.070
 the fact a death 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.569
 and it was over as you can see the 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.699
 makeup look that has remained is 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:20.639
 ideal that you can put it both for a 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.289
 appointment to go to work in the 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.289
 day by day we go for all occasions 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.180
 I started well but then in the end if the 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.490
 audio that was going to go from bad to worse 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.960
 that's how it ended though 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.419
 there is the mind I think it has not been 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.580
 as ugly as I have seen other people 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.740
 that has left them also ran blÃ© and 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.300
 nothing what requires advice for nothing 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.220
 is that you put on mascara on 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.560
 your lips because you have the 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.690
 hard lips will cost to talk that you 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.880
 they are going to break the lips of the neighbors 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.460
 that have been taken care of so I do not expect anything 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.430
 that this video very many times 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.650
 I send a lot of prices do not give them a 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.240
 assistant in this video as always 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.650
 I ask and leave me in the comments if 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.650
 do you want me to make other tags
