00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.450 

it<00:03:17.470> didn't<00:03:17.710> handle<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:18.100> very<00:03:18.280> well<00:03:20.460> let's

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
it didn't handle that very well let's

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:36.390 
it didn't handle that very well let's
take<00:03:21.640> a<00:03:21.670> look<00:03:21.880> at<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.060> engine<00:03:34.500> so<00:03:35.500> what<00:03:36.160> would

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
take a look at the engine so what would

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.350 
take a look at the engine so what would
put<00:03:36.850> some<00:03:37.000> ups<00:03:37.210> so<00:03:37.930> let's<00:03:38.110> take<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.320> look<00:03:39.360> good

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
put some ups so let's take a look good

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.720 
put some ups so let's take a look good
go<00:03:41.020> ahead<00:03:41.050> and<00:03:41.290> fill<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.620> filming<00:03:42.010> all<00:03:42.550> right

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
go ahead and fill it filming all right

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.710 
go ahead and fill it filming all right
so<00:03:43.000> that's<00:03:43.990> real<00:03:44.440> testing<00:03:45.100> okay<00:03:45.850> let's<00:03:46.510> take<00:03:46.660> a

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
so that's real testing okay let's take a

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.090 
so that's real testing okay let's take a
look<00:03:46.780> at<00:03:46.990> the<00:03:47.080> engine<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.530> how<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.680> engine

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
look at the engine and how the engine

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.490 
look at the engine and how the engine
handles<00:03:48.430> that<00:03:48.780> that's<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.960> guts<00:03:50.170> of<00:03:50.350> this

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
handles that that's the guts of this

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.700 
handles that that's the guts of this
back<00:03:51.690> let's<00:03:52.690> take<00:03:52.900> this<00:03:53.080> out<00:03:53.320> and<00:03:53.440> take<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.620> look

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
back let's take this out and take a look

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.070 
back let's take this out and take a look
at<00:03:53.980> how<00:03:54.070> she<00:03:54.130> handle<00:03:54.640> we're<00:03:54.760> gonna<00:03:54.850> pump<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:55.930> up

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
at how she handle we're gonna pump it up

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.900 
at how she handle we're gonna pump it up
and<00:03:56.200> see<00:03:56.320> if<00:03:56.470> we've<00:03:56.680> still<00:03:56.950> got<00:03:57.100> a<00:03:57.130> car<00:03:57.640> fully

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
and see if we've still got a car fully

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.700 
and see if we've still got a car fully
fully<00:03:58.210> functional<00:03:58.840> engine<00:03:59.080> after<00:03:59.320> a<00:03:59.350> bomb

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:09.140 
fully functional engine after a bomb
goes<00:04:00.040> off<00:04:00.250> inside<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.730> back

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.119 

we<00:04:09.420> literally<00:04:09.810> had<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.140> put<00:04:10.260> it<00:04:10.530> inside<00:04:10.680> the

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
we literally had to put it inside the

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.740 
we literally had to put it inside the
pack<00:04:11.370> with<00:04:11.640> a<00:04:11.670> bomb<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.930> test<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.440> see<00:04:14.480> how<00:04:15.480> well

well still spraying the geigerrig
hydration<00:05:08.789> engine<00:05:09.330> you<00:05:09.569> can<00:05:09.690> literally<00:05:09.960> put

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
hydration engine you can literally put

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.040 
hydration engine you can literally put
it<00:05:10.380> inside<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:11.099> pack<00:05:11.430> a<00:05:11.729> ballistic<00:05:12.419> pack<00:05:12.630> with

when we put a bomb inside of it with
this<00:05:32.610> hydration<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:33.270> to<00:05:33.479> see<00:05:33.659> how<00:05:33.780> well<00:05:33.960> our

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
this hydration and to see how well our

this hydration and to see how well our
hydration<00:05:34.380> engines<00:05:34.830> held<00:05:35.009> up<00:05:35.190> of<00:05:35.729> course<00:05:36.030> it

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
hydration engines held up of course it

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.360 
hydration engines held up of course it
blows<00:05:36.389> up<00:05:36.630> to<00:05:36.870> give<00:05:37.289> you<00:05:37.409> an<00:05:37.590> idea<00:05:37.740> of<00:05:38.159> the
