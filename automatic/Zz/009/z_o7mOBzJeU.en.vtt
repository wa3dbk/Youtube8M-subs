if you look at this bedrock layer here

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.720 
if you look at this bedrock layer here
it's<00:00:59.570> not<00:00:59.720> holding<00:00:59.990> gravels<00:01:00.680> that<00:01:01.280> tells<00:01:01.550> you

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
it's a low-pressure zone and up this

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.230 
it's a low-pressure zone and up this
high<00:01:11.450> on<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:11.870> bedrock<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:13.700> only<00:01:13.910> way<00:01:14.030> you're

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
high on the bedrock the only way you're

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.940 
high on the bedrock the only way you're
really<00:01:14.270> going<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:14.690> find<00:01:14.900> gold<00:01:15.200> is<00:01:15.440> this<00:01:15.590> up<00:01:15.770> in

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
really going to find gold is this up in

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.490 
really going to find gold is this up in
the<00:01:16.070> hill<00:01:16.220> here<00:01:16.580> there's<00:01:17.540> an<00:01:17.690> old<00:01:17.840> bench<00:01:18.110> and

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
the hill here there's an old bench and

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.800 
the hill here there's an old bench and
it's<00:01:18.590> gradually<00:01:19.070> washing<00:01:19.490> across<00:01:19.729> here<00:01:20.240> other

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
it's gradually washing across here other

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.500 
it's gradually washing across here other
than<00:01:20.930> that<00:01:21.790> anything<00:01:22.790> that<00:01:22.970> came<00:01:23.180> from<00:01:23.330> up

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
than that anything that came from up

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.960 
than that anything that came from up
upriver<00:01:25.090> it's<00:01:26.090> going<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:26.300> be<00:01:26.420> in<00:01:26.510> this<00:01:26.720> trough

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
upriver it's going to be in this trough

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.999 
upriver it's going to be in this trough
I'm<00:01:28.970> going<00:01:29.300> basically<00:01:29.930> this<00:01:30.229> straight<00:01:30.979> line

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
I'm going basically this straight line

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.730 
I'm going basically this straight line
from<00:01:31.610> one<00:01:31.820> corner<00:01:31.850> down<00:01:32.780> to<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.170> next<00:01:33.500> is

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
from one corner down to the next is

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.130 
from one corner down to the next is
usually<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.670> way<00:01:34.790> it<00:01:34.910> works<00:01:35.090> oh<00:01:37.600> yes<00:01:38.600> this<00:01:38.990> is

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
usually the way it works oh yes this is

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.609 
usually the way it works oh yes this is
a<00:01:39.200> perfect<00:01:39.619> spot<00:01:40.420> it's<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.479> great<00:01:41.750> example<00:01:41.900> of

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
a perfect spot it's a great example of

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.749 
a perfect spot it's a great example of
how<00:01:43.300> to<00:01:44.300> increase<00:01:44.690> your<00:01:44.960> chances<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:46.430> can<00:01:46.580> see

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
how to increase your chances you can see

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.830 
how to increase your chances you can see
we<00:01:46.910> got<00:01:47.030> an<00:01:47.210> old<00:01:47.560> river<00:01:48.560> tucked<00:01:48.979> away<00:01:49.720> in<00:01:50.720> this

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
we got an old river tucked away in this

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.700 
we got an old river tucked away in this
Bank<00:01:51.400> very<00:01:52.400> jagged<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:54.530> your<00:01:56.259> bedrock<00:01:57.259> phone

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
Bank very jagged and your bedrock phone

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.430 
Bank very jagged and your bedrock phone
so<00:01:58.610> not<00:01:58.790> only<00:01:58.940> do<00:01:59.090> you<00:01:59.180> have<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.479> gold<00:02:00.050> coming

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
so not only do you have the gold coming

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.000 
so not only do you have the gold coming
from<00:02:00.620> upriver<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:02.030> got<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.210> gold<00:02:02.860> reaching<00:02:03.860> out

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
from upriver you got a gold reaching out

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.400 
from upriver you got a gold reaching out
of<00:02:04.130> this<00:02:04.250> Bank<00:02:04.580> across<00:02:05.390> this<00:02:05.630> bedrock<00:02:08.410> so

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
of this Bank across this bedrock so

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.199 
of this Bank across this bedrock so
basically<00:02:09.800> guys<00:02:10.160> should<00:02:10.429> almost<00:02:10.580> double<00:02:11.090> his

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
basically guys should almost double his

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.180 
basically guys should almost double his
chances<00:02:11.780> on<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.290> stretch<00:02:12.799> like<00:02:13.489> this<00:02:13.790> here<00:02:15.190> we

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
chances on a stretch like this here we

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.990 
chances on a stretch like this here we
get<00:02:16.489> up<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:18.040> get<00:02:19.040> in<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.250> water<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.610> see<00:02:19.880> what

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
get up and get in the water and see what

00:02:20.000 --> 00:03:30.009 
get up and get in the water and see what
we<00:02:20.120> find<00:02:20.299> here

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.119
