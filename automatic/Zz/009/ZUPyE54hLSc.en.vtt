00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
hopefully I'm gonna get into the big uns

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.509 
hopefully I'm gonna get into the big uns
when<00:02:16.500> they're<00:02:16.709> when<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.129> weather's<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> little

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
when they're when the weather's a little

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.240 
when they're when the weather's a little
bit<00:02:17.849> more<00:02:18.000> consistent<00:02:18.860> I'm<00:02:19.860> gonna<00:02:20.010> put<00:02:20.220> a

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
bit more consistent I'm gonna put a

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.670 
bit more consistent I'm gonna put a
little<00:02:20.459> bit<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.760> bait<00:02:20.909> in<00:02:20.939> now<00:02:21.420> just<00:02:21.659> before<00:02:22.470> I

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
little bit of bait in now just before I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.300 
little bit of bait in now just before I
leave

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
leave

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.630 
leave
it's<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.790> few<00:02:23.970> bubblers<00:02:24.360> out<00:02:24.510> there<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.870> know

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
it's a few bubblers out there you know

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.399 
it's a few bubblers out there you know
some<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.670> them<00:02:26.819> are<00:02:26.939> gas<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.989> way<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.170> can

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
some of them are gas the way you can

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.039 
some of them are gas the way you can
tell<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:28.769> is<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.450> gas<00:02:30.450> bubbles<00:02:30.810> come<00:02:31.019> up

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
tell that is that gas bubbles come up

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.619 
tell that is that gas bubbles come up
really<00:02:31.920> consistently<00:02:32.489> in<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.790> same<00:02:33.030> area<00:02:33.420> and

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
really consistently in the same area and

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.259 
really consistently in the same area and
quickly<00:02:34.189> whereas<00:02:35.189> a<00:02:35.220> carp<00:02:35.519> bubbles<00:02:35.879> tend<00:02:36.150> to

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
quickly whereas a carp bubbles tend to

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.830 
quickly whereas a carp bubbles tend to
be<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:38.700> know<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.819> little<00:02:39.030> bit<00:02:39.150> more<00:02:39.209> all<00:02:39.540> over

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
be you know a little bit more all over

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.149 
be you know a little bit more all over
the<00:02:39.930> place<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.439> that<00:02:40.500> they<00:02:40.709> tend<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.010> be

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
the place and that they tend to be

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.770 
the place and that they tend to be
smaller<00:02:41.220> bubbles<00:02:41.939> as<00:02:42.060> well<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:42.659> know

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
smaller bubbles as well you know

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.509 
smaller bubbles as well you know
different<00:02:43.260> consistency<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.280> if<00:02:44.370> you're

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
different consistency so if you're

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:45.710 
different consistency so if you're
looking<00:02:44.670> for<00:02:44.940> bubblers<00:02:45.299> look<00:02:45.510> for

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
looking for bubblers look for

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.430 
looking for bubblers look for
inconsistent<00:02:46.650> bubbles<00:02:47.639> rather<00:02:47.909> than

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
inconsistent bubbles rather than

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.470 
inconsistent bubbles rather than
consistent<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:50.430> know<00:02:50.549> gas<00:02:50.819> bubbles<00:02:51.209> will<00:02:51.329> be

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
consistent you know gas bubbles will be

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.089 
consistent you know gas bubbles will be
of<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.659> same<00:02:51.930> shape<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:52.620> they'll<00:02:52.709> come<00:02:52.889> up<00:02:52.920> in

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
of the same shape and they'll come up in

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.710 
of the same shape and they'll come up in
the<00:02:53.220> same<00:02:53.459> spot<00:02:53.819> where<00:02:53.970> as<00:02:54.030> carp<00:02:54.329> bubbles

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
the same spot where as carp bubbles

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.720 
the same spot where as carp bubbles
won't<00:02:54.930> be<00:02:55.109> and<00:02:55.349> they'll<00:02:56.099> be<00:02:56.220> all<00:02:56.370> over<00:02:56.639> the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
won't be and they'll be all over the

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.240 
won't be and they'll be all over the
place<00:02:56.849> so<00:02:57.329> that's<00:02:58.230> an<00:02:58.439> easy<00:02:58.560> way<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.829> tell

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
place so that's an easy way to tell

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.610 
place so that's an easy way to tell
whether<00:02:59.670> it's<00:02:59.879> a<00:02:59.909> carp<00:03:00.150> or<00:03:00.299> gas<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:01.409> just

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
whether it's a carp or gas so just

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.869 
whether it's a carp or gas so just
because<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:01.859> see<00:03:01.889> bubbles<00:03:02.430> doesn't<00:03:02.760> mean

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
because you see bubbles doesn't mean

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.399 
because you see bubbles doesn't mean
it's<00:03:03.060> cut<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.750> know<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:03.959> could<00:03:04.139> just<00:03:04.170> be<00:03:04.379> the

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
it's cut you know it could just be the

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.460 
it's cut you know it could just be the
bottom<00:03:04.769> so<00:03:05.730> always<00:03:05.939> look<00:03:06.299> for<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.629> anyway

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
bottom so always look for that anyway

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.720 
bottom so always look for that anyway
I'm<00:03:07.680> gonna<00:03:07.769> go<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:07.980> put<00:03:08.069> some<00:03:08.280> bait<00:03:08.430> out<00:03:08.579> in

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
I'm gonna go and put some bait out in

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.970 
I'm gonna go and put some bait out in
the<00:03:08.790> boat<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.260> it's<00:03:10.260> time<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.620> go<00:03:10.739> home

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
the boat and it's time to go home

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.110 
the boat and it's time to go home
because<00:03:11.189> I've<00:03:11.310> got<00:03:11.430> loads<00:03:11.609> of<00:03:11.700> work<00:03:11.849> to<00:03:12.030> do

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
because I've got loads of work to do

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.700 
because I've got loads of work to do
today<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:12.569> I'll<00:03:13.109> be<00:03:13.230> back<00:03:13.349> next<00:03:13.379> week<00:03:13.700> Cheers
