on<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.539> inner<00:01:30.689> intestine<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.259> therefore

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
on the inner intestine so therefore

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.349 
on the inner intestine so therefore
you're<00:01:31.710> getting<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:32.159> steady<00:01:32.399> state<00:01:32.819> for<00:01:33.090> up<00:01:33.240> to

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
you're getting a steady state for up to

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.179 
you're getting a steady state for up to
six<00:01:33.600> hours<00:01:33.719> so<00:01:34.049> one<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.409> these<00:01:34.590> little<00:01:34.829> pills

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
six hours so one of these little pills

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.179 
six hours so one of these little pills
here<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.700> zoom<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.389> as<00:01:37.189> multiple

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
here you can zoom in on this as multiple

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.029 
here you can zoom in on this as multiple
layers<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.539> it<00:01:40.319> releases<00:01:40.560> at

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
layers to it so that it releases at

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.469 
layers to it so that it releases at
different<00:01:41.340> times<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.850> probably<00:01:42.149> has<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> much

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
different times it probably has a much

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.149 
different times it probably has a much
more<00:01:42.630> sustained<00:01:43.049> action<00:01:43.259> everything<00:01:43.740> correct

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
more sustained action everything correct

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.599 
more sustained action everything correct
absolutely<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.770> in<00:01:46.770> addition<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.459> fact

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609

the Guinness of Henry may have there's

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.209 
the Guinness of Henry may have there's
different<00:01:52.350> three<00:01:52.530> different<00:01:52.649> kinds<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.100> your

different three different kinds of your
hand<00:01:53.399> being<00:01:53.549> obviously<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.030> predominate

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
hand being obviously this predominate

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:55.699 
hand being obviously this predominate
fat<00:01:54.719> burning<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.079> greeting<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.409> there<00:01:55.560> but

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
fat burning and greeting in there but

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:57.440 
fat burning and greeting in there but
that<00:01:55.829> also<00:01:56.039> you<00:01:56.280> know<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.880> gives<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.240> some

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
that also you know it gives you some

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.120 
that also you know it gives you some
stimulants<00:01:57.810> involved<00:01:58.679> there<00:01:58.829> there's<00:01:59.069> some

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
stimulants involved there there's some

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.160 
stimulants involved there there's some
nephron<00:01:59.639> so<00:02:00.060> join<00:02:00.270> him<00:02:00.389> in<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> oil<00:02:00.659> obviously

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
nephron so join him in the oil obviously

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.510 
nephron so join him in the oil obviously
which<00:02:01.319> is<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> big<00:02:01.649> thing<00:02:01.799> right<00:02:01.979> now<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.340> for

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
which is a big thing right now just for

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.029 
which is a big thing right now just for
all<00:02:03.060> its<00:02:03.509> really<00:02:03.899> sure<00:02:04.079> obviously<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.889> know

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
all its really sure obviously you know

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.919 
all its really sure obviously you know
loves<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.549> right<00:02:05.729> now<00:02:05.880> that's<00:02:06.179> big<00:02:06.389> so<00:02:06.689> that

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
loves that right now that's big so that

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.520 
loves that right now that's big so that
also<00:02:07.170> gives<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.529> a<00:02:07.590> nice<00:02:07.709> little<00:02:07.979> push

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
also gives you a nice little push

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.229 
also gives you a nice little push
given<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> fact<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.190> does<00:02:11.370> really<00:02:11.970> amp

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
given the fact that it does really amp

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.000 
given the fact that it does really amp
you<00:02:12.420> up<00:02:12.480> when<00:02:12.989> would<00:02:13.200> be<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.380> best<00:02:13.500> time<00:02:13.860> to

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
you up when would be the best time to

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.440 
you up when would be the best time to
take<00:02:14.220> these<00:02:14.370> I'm<00:02:14.520> assuming<00:02:14.910> earlier<00:02:15.239> in<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
take these I'm assuming earlier in the
