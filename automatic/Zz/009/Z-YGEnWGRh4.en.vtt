00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
before on the channel we were building a

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.650 
before on the channel we were building a
kayak<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:07.040> this<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.220> my<00:00:08.400> uh<00:00:08.429> my<00:00:09.000> cousin<00:00:09.150> Jesse

kayak and this is my uh my cousin Jesse

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.970 
kayak and this is my uh my cousin Jesse
here<00:00:09.840> he<00:00:10.320> helped<00:00:10.500> me<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.620> construct

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
here he helped me to construct

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.700 
here he helped me to construct
everything<00:00:11.450> so<00:00:12.450> we<00:00:12.870> just<00:00:13.019> got<00:00:13.170> done<00:00:13.380> with<00:00:13.650> a

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
everything so we just got done with a

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.230 
everything so we just got done with a
test<00:00:14.519> run<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:15.240> liked<00:00:15.630> what<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:16.020> seen<00:00:16.350> and

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
test run and we liked what we seen and

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.750 
test run and we liked what we seen and
here's<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.359> boat<00:00:18.510> here<00:00:18.779> we<00:00:19.080> wrapped<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.500> in

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
here's the boat here we wrapped it in

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.290 
here's the boat here we wrapped it in
plastic<00:00:21.529> for<00:00:22.529> now<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:23.519> try<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.789> get<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:23.970> feel<00:00:24.269> of

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
plastic for now to try to get a feel of

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.050 
plastic for now to try to get a feel of
where<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.080> was<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.439> I'll<00:00:25.680> post<00:00:25.890> pictures<00:00:26.310> at

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
where it was and I'll post pictures at

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.620 
where it was and I'll post pictures at
the<00:00:27.269> end<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.510> video<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:29.599> what<00:00:30.599> we

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
the end of this video on it so what we

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.080 
the end of this video on it so what we
did<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:31.170> I'll<00:00:31.619> let<00:00:32.070> Jesse<00:00:32.399> talk<00:00:32.579> about<00:00:32.820> what<00:00:32.969> we

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
did is I'll let Jesse talk about what we

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
did and then after we get this unwrapped

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.440 
did and then after we get this unwrapped
so<00:00:38.040> we're<00:00:38.190> gonna<00:00:38.280> wrap<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.820> real<00:00:38.969> quick<00:00:39.210> and

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
then I will go through the construction

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.690 
then I will go through the construction
of<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:42.510> case<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.989> are<00:00:43.170> interested<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.980> what

about what we did on this and how we

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:18.880 
about what we did on this and how we
constructed<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:14.600> we<00:01:15.600> used<00:01:15.810> 3/4<00:01:16.740> piping<00:01:17.220> in

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
constructed it we used 3/4 piping in

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.730 
constructed it we used 3/4 piping in
half<00:01:19.890> inch<00:01:20.189> piping

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
half inch piping

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.219 
half inch piping
to<00:01:22.740> tie<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> frame<00:01:23.900> we<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.049> took<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
to tie in the frame we just took a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.740 
to tie in the frame we just took a
regular<00:01:25.470> hole<00:01:25.830> saw<00:01:26.100> drilled<00:01:26.729> holes<00:01:26.970> cutter

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
regular hole saw drilled holes cutter

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.429 
regular hole saw drilled holes cutter
pipes<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.290> our<00:01:28.380> links<00:01:29.060> we<00:01:30.060> got<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.439> basically

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
pipes to our links we got a basically

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.950 
pipes to our links we got a basically
figured<00:01:31.829> out<00:01:31.950> how<00:01:32.100> wide<00:01:32.369> we<00:01:32.579> wanted<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.299> we

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
figured out how wide we wanted it and we

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.249 
figured out how wide we wanted it and we
started<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.530> work<00:01:34.680> our<00:01:34.890> way<00:01:35.040> down<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:36.079> we<00:01:37.079> just

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
started to work our way down and we just

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.310 
started to work our way down and we just
drilled<00:01:37.500> holes<00:01:37.740> put<00:01:38.040> our<00:01:38.159> piping<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:39.200> where<00:01:40.200> it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
drilled holes put our piping in where it

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.760 
drilled holes put our piping in where it
should<00:01:40.560> be

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
should be

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.370 
should be
we<00:01:41.700> put<00:01:41.939> pipes<00:01:42.180> every<00:01:42.570> foot<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.350> good

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
we put pipes every foot for good

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.510 
we put pipes every foot for good
disability<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:45.860> then<00:01:47.420> we<00:01:48.420> did<00:01:48.630> our<00:01:49.220> chine<00:01:50.250> or

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
disability and then we did our chine or

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.100 
disability and then we did our chine or
not<00:01:50.790> our<00:01:50.820> joins<00:01:51.119> our<00:01:51.420> ribs<00:01:53.720> we<00:01:54.720> figured<00:01:55.020> out

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
not our joins our ribs we figured out

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.050 
not our joins our ribs we figured out
our<00:01:55.140> depth<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.009> our<00:01:56.159> width<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:56.579> wanted<00:01:56.939> for

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
our depth and our width we wanted for

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.740 
our depth and our width we wanted for
the<00:01:57.119> bottom<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:59.100> get<00:01:59.250> our<00:01:59.369> bends<00:01:59.759> for<00:02:00.570> this

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
the bottom and to get our bends for this

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.560 
the bottom and to get our bends for this
we<00:02:01.200> heat<00:02:01.409> them<00:02:01.560> up<00:02:01.740> using<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.790> candle<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.420> can

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
we heat them up using a candle you can

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.319 
we heat them up using a candle you can
use<00:02:03.810> other<00:02:03.990> whatever<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.890> need<00:02:05.299> and<00:02:06.299> just

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
use other whatever you need and just

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.710 
use other whatever you need and just
basically<00:02:07.429> bend<00:02:08.429> them<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.580> whatever<00:02:09.060> angle<00:02:09.420> we

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
basically bend them to whatever angle we

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.080 
basically bend them to whatever angle we
needed<00:02:10.080> once<00:02:10.590> they<00:02:10.800> cool<00:02:11.069> they<00:02:11.280> Harden

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
needed once they cool they Harden

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.380 
needed once they cool they Harden
so<00:02:15.800> so<00:02:16.800> then<00:02:16.980> we<00:02:17.099> took<00:02:17.280> three<00:02:17.819> quarter<00:02:18.150> pipe

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
so so then we took three quarter pipe

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
so so then we took three quarter pipe
run<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.230> into<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:20.010> give<00:02:20.160> our<00:02:20.340> sheep<00:02:21.410> its

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
run it into to give our sheep its

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.729 
run it into to give our sheep its
ability<00:02:23.099> hold<00:02:23.550> everything<00:02:23.819> in<00:02:24.060> place<00:02:24.620> then<00:02:25.620> we

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
ability hold everything in place then we

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.600 
ability hold everything in place then we
have<00:02:25.860> our<00:02:26.099> quarter<00:02:27.090> inch<00:02:27.120> PVC<00:02:27.810> piping<00:02:28.519> for<00:02:29.519> our

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
have our quarter inch PVC piping for our

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.670 
have our quarter inch PVC piping for our
chines<00:02:29.879> on<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.269> side<00:02:30.510> we're<00:02:31.290> actually<00:02:31.440> going

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
chines on the side we're actually going

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.670 
chines on the side we're actually going
to<00:02:31.739> add<00:02:31.920> another<00:02:32.129> one<00:02:32.400> on<00:02:33.090> each<00:02:33.330> side<00:02:33.629> here<00:02:34.019> to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
to add another one on each side here to

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.509 
to add another one on each side here to
give<00:02:34.799> it<00:02:34.950> more<00:02:35.099> stability<00:02:38.450> more<00:02:39.450> uniform

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
give it more stability more uniform

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.069 
give it more stability more uniform
bottom<00:02:41.519> so<00:02:42.420> it's<00:02:42.599> more<00:02:42.810> stable<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.900> we<00:02:45.900> use

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
bottom so it's more stable and we use

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.620 
bottom so it's more stable and we use
twist<00:02:46.560> ties<00:02:46.829> or<00:02:47.190> zip<00:02:47.489> ties<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.450> tie

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
twist ties or zip ties and tie

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.610 
twist ties or zip ties and tie
everything<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.950> it's<00:02:50.130> solid<00:02:50.579> and<00:02:51.620> it's

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
everything in so it's solid and it's

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.280 
everything in so it's solid and it's
pretty<00:02:52.860> soft<00:02:53.420> yeah<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.599> like<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.930> zip<00:02:55.110> ties

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
pretty soft yeah so like the zip ties

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.729 
pretty soft yeah so like the zip ties
for<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.620> pretty<00:02:55.860> good<00:02:56.010> idea<00:02:57.440> mainly<00:02:58.440> because<00:02:58.530> we

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
for a pretty good idea mainly because we

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.680 
for a pretty good idea mainly because we
could<00:02:58.950> replace<00:02:59.430> parts<00:02:59.910> as<00:03:00.030> we<00:03:00.150> needed<00:03:00.420> them<00:03:00.540> if

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
could replace parts as we needed them if

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.860 
could replace parts as we needed them if
we<00:03:01.260> realized<00:03:01.620> we<00:03:01.950> messed<00:03:02.190> up<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:03.660> now<00:03:03.780> that

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
we realized we messed up so so now that

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.470 
we realized we messed up so so now that
like<00:03:04.170> we<00:03:04.349> got<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:05.099> idea<00:03:05.280> down<00:03:05.640> we<00:03:06.120> plan<00:03:06.329> on

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
like we got the idea down we plan on

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.440 
like we got the idea down we plan on
maybe<00:03:06.930> building<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.410> couple<00:03:07.709> more<00:03:07.920> and

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
maybe building a couple more and

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.660 
maybe building a couple more and
customizing<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:10.079> ones<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:11.489> we're<00:03:11.610> gonna

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
customizing the ones that we're gonna

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.940 
customizing the ones that we're gonna
build<00:03:11.910> later<00:03:12.150> but<00:03:12.959> uh<00:03:12.989> so<00:03:13.410> all's<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:13.650> got<00:03:13.799> left

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
build later but uh so all's we got left

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.509 
build later but uh so all's we got left
to<00:03:14.040> do<00:03:14.190> now<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.400> think<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.920> combing

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
to do now I think is the is the combing

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.610 
to do now I think is the is the combing
around<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.850> seat<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.329> then<00:03:19.170> we<00:03:19.380> need<00:03:19.530> to

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
around the seat and then we need to

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.009 
around the seat and then we need to
figure<00:03:19.799> out<00:03:20.359> where<00:03:21.359> that's<00:03:21.480> going<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.720> go<00:03:21.870> and

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
figure out where that's going to go and

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.990 
figure out where that's going to go and
then<00:03:22.170> figure<00:03:22.530> out<00:03:22.590> how<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.799> put<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.310> maybe<00:03:23.880> a

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
then figure out how to put in a maybe a

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.990 
then figure out how to put in a maybe a
little<00:03:24.239> pocket<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.900> back<00:03:25.340> so<00:03:26.340> that's<00:03:26.850> what

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
little pocket in the back so that's what

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.449 
little pocket in the back so that's what
we're<00:03:27.120> working<00:03:27.239> on<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:27.829> all<00:03:28.829> we<00:03:29.099> have<00:03:29.190> left<00:03:29.220> to

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
we're working on so all we have left to

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.640 
we're working on so all we have left to
do<00:03:29.609> is<00:03:29.639> put<00:03:30.000> in<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.900> two<00:03:31.049> clothings<00:03:31.470> on<00:03:31.560> the

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
do is put in the two clothings on the

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.210 
do is put in the two clothings on the
side<00:03:31.889> and<00:03:33.079> put<00:03:34.079> in<00:03:34.139> a<00:03:34.200> canvas<00:03:34.620> on<00:03:34.739> now<00:03:35.160> the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
side and put in a canvas on now the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.660 
side and put in a canvas on now the
canvas<00:03:35.790> we<00:03:36.299> didn't<00:03:36.480> talk<00:03:36.569> to<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.900> about<00:03:37.260> that

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
canvas we didn't talk to that about that

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.099 
canvas we didn't talk to that about that
we're<00:03:38.670> gonna<00:03:38.760> use<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.000> cotton<00:03:39.420> canvas<00:03:39.780> just

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
we're gonna use a cotton canvas just

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.659 
we're gonna use a cotton canvas just
because<00:03:40.380> it's<00:03:40.530> cheaper<00:03:40.889> like<00:03:41.099> we<00:03:41.250> wanted

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
because it's cheaper like we wanted

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:45.110 
because it's cheaper like we wanted
low-cost<00:03:42.120> lightweight<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.880> waterproof<00:03:44.880> so

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
low-cost lightweight and waterproof so

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.670 
low-cost lightweight and waterproof so
as<00:03:45.239> long<00:03:45.389> as<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.599> thing<00:03:45.810> floated<00:03:46.319> and<00:03:46.560> it

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
as long as the thing floated and it

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.610 
as long as the thing floated and it
wasn't<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:46.980> big<00:03:47.160> problem<00:03:47.579> like<00:03:48.569> we<00:03:49.260> figured

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
wasn't a big problem like we figured

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.520 
wasn't a big problem like we figured
we'd<00:03:49.799> do<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:50.430> we've<00:03:51.269> seen<00:03:51.450> stretch<00:03:51.989> kayaks

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
we'd do it so we've seen stretch kayaks

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.259 
we'd do it so we've seen stretch kayaks
from<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:53.040> Greenland<00:03:53.400> stretch<00:03:53.639> kayaks<00:03:54.030> which

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
from the Greenland stretch kayaks which

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.390 
from the Greenland stretch kayaks which
gave<00:03:54.480> us<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:54.690> idea<00:03:54.750> so<00:03:55.200> we<00:03:55.739> got<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:56.040> 10<00:03:56.220> ounce

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
gave us the idea so we got the 10 ounce

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.890 
gave us the idea so we got the 10 ounce
blue<00:03:56.880> hawk<00:04:00.200> drop<00:04:01.200> cloth<00:04:01.470> yeah<00:04:01.889> and<00:04:02.900> that

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
blue hawk drop cloth yeah and that

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.569 
blue hawk drop cloth yeah and that
worked<00:04:04.109> out<00:04:04.260> really<00:04:04.500> well<00:04:04.769> because<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.400> 10

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
worked out really well because the 10

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.150 
worked out really well because the 10
ounce<00:04:05.700> like<00:04:06.299> really<00:04:06.599> heavy<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.079> we<00:04:07.709> got<00:04:07.859> some

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
ounce like really heavy and we got some

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.080 
ounce like really heavy and we got some
interior<00:04:08.489> exterior<00:04:09.650> oil-based<00:04:10.650> paint<00:04:11.090> we're

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
interior exterior oil-based paint we're

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.580 
interior exterior oil-based paint we're
gonna<00:04:12.209> put<00:04:12.359> on<00:04:12.450> us<00:04:12.569> now<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.780> guys<00:04:12.989> who<00:04:13.260> do<00:04:13.440> this

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
gonna put on us now the guys who do this

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.039 
gonna put on us now the guys who do this
like<00:04:13.980> all<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.459> time<00:04:14.720> they<00:04:15.720> use<00:04:15.900> the

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
like all the time they use the

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.240 
like all the time they use the
polyurethane<00:04:18.470> satin

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
polyurethane satin

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.040 
polyurethane satin
staying<00:04:22.250> varnish<00:04:22.880> kind<00:04:23.270> of<00:04:23.389> stuff<00:04:23.600> he<00:04:23.750> put<00:04:23.960> out

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
staying varnish kind of stuff he put out

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.140 
staying varnish kind of stuff he put out
a<00:04:24.080> little<00:04:24.440> like<00:04:25.190> Indiana<00:04:25.520> it<00:04:25.699> looks<00:04:25.880> almost

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
a little like Indiana it looks almost

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.270 
a little like Indiana it looks almost
like<00:04:26.360> an<00:04:26.600> animal's<00:04:26.960> skin<00:04:27.080> over<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:27.800> a

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
like an animal's skin over it and a

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.740 
like an animal's skin over it and a
little<00:04:28.400> bit<00:04:28.520> translucent<00:04:28.940> which<00:04:29.360> is<00:04:29.479> kind<00:04:29.690> of

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
little bit translucent which is kind of

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.750 
little bit translucent which is kind of
nice<00:04:29.870> but<00:04:30.169> we<00:04:30.949> just<00:04:31.130> decided<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.490> go<00:04:31.550> with

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
nice but we just decided to go with
