00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
torque but as the highest winding or the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.160 
torque but as the highest winding or the
highest<00:01:43.920> top-end<00:01:44.340> speed<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.179> it<00:01:45.780> will<00:01:45.959> go

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
highest top-end speed and it will go

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.309 
highest top-end speed and it will go
approximately<00:01:47.100> 12<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.149> 13<00:01:48.659> miles<00:01:48.929> an<00:01:49.139> hour

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
approximately 12 to 13 miles an hour

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.489 
approximately 12 to 13 miles an hour
faster<00:01:49.649> than<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.759> striker<00:01:51.090> motor<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:52.170> this

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:52.499 
faster than the striker motor so this

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:54.679 
faster than the striker motor so this
actual<00:01:52.859> motor<00:01:53.069> here<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.429> the<00:01:53.670> black<00:01:54.389> lightning
