we'll be needing them later now that
we've<00:00:43.630> got<00:00:43.809> our<00:00:43.840> two<00:00:44.110> halves<00:00:44.350> let's<00:00:44.890> take<00:00:45.100> the

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
we've got our two halves let's take the

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.799 
we've got our two halves let's take the
side<00:00:45.460> that<00:00:45.670> still<00:00:45.940> has<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.239> bottom<00:00:46.510> attached

and<00:00:47.110> place<00:00:47.470> it<00:00:47.680> face<00:00:47.920> down<00:00:47.950> on<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.400> cutting

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
and place it face down on a cutting

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.700 
and place it face down on a cutting
board<00:00:48.790> we'll<00:00:49.750> need<00:00:49.780> to<00:00:49.960> place<00:00:50.200> to<00:00:50.470> butter

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710

bottom<00:00:52.780> of<00:00:53.020> the<00:00:53.140> Apple<00:00:53.500> now<00:00:54.070> we<00:00:54.129> can<00:00:54.309> carefully

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
bottom of the Apple now we can carefully

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.430 
bottom of the Apple now we can carefully
cut<00:00:54.940> down<00:00:55.120> along<00:00:55.360> one<00:00:55.660> side<00:00:55.690> of<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.140> apple

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
cut down along one side of the apple

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.410 
cut down along one side of the apple
corer<00:00:56.680> until<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.250> knife<00:00:57.430> bottoms<00:00:57.910> out<00:00:58.059> on<00:00:58.300> our

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
corer until the knife bottoms out on our

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.570 
corer until the knife bottoms out on our
makeshift<00:00:58.780> spacers<00:00:59.350> then<00:00:59.800> use<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.160> spacers

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
makeshift spacers then use the spacers

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.250 
makeshift spacers then use the spacers
as<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:00.760> guide<00:01:01.030> to<00:01:01.269> gently<00:01:01.540> cut<00:01:01.809> in<00:01:01.960> from<00:01:02.170> the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
as a guide to gently cut in from the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.590 
as a guide to gently cut in from the
side<00:01:02.500> when<00:01:03.339> the<00:01:03.430> two<00:01:03.580> cuts<00:01:03.820> meet<00:01:04.059> you'll<00:01:04.420> have

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
side when the two cuts meet you'll have

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.540 
side when the two cuts meet you'll have
an<00:01:04.720> apple<00:01:05.050> wedge<00:01:05.230> that<00:01:05.500> pops<00:01:05.740> right<00:01:06.010> out<00:01:06.070> and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
an apple wedge that pops right out and

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.280 
an apple wedge that pops right out and
while<00:01:07.120> we're<00:01:07.270> here<00:01:07.420> let's<00:01:07.600> cut<00:01:07.900> a<00:01:07.930> piece<00:01:08.140> from

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
while we're here let's cut a piece from

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.890 
while we're here let's cut a piece from
the<00:01:08.470> other<00:01:08.590> side<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:09.070> same<00:01:09.310> way<00:01:09.550> now<00:01:10.540> our<00:01:10.690> goal

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
the other side the same way now our goal

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.450 
the other side the same way now our goal
with<00:01:11.020> these<00:01:11.200> is<00:01:11.440> to<00:01:11.560> cut<00:01:11.740> out<00:01:11.830> three<00:01:12.220> more

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
with these is to cut out three more

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.310 
with these is to cut out three more
l-shaped<00:01:13.000> wedges<00:01:13.480> about<00:01:13.930> a<00:01:13.960> quarter<00:01:14.170> inch

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
l-shaped wedges about a quarter inch

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.440 
l-shaped wedges about a quarter inch
thick<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:14.980> this<00:01:15.430> time<00:01:15.670> rather<00:01:15.940> than<00:01:16.090> cutting

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
thick and this time rather than cutting

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.570 
thick and this time rather than cutting
in<00:01:16.630> sideways<00:01:17.080> toward<00:01:17.470> your<00:01:17.620> fingers<00:01:18.010> try

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
in sideways toward your fingers try

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.100 
in sideways toward your fingers try
turning<00:01:18.790> the<00:01:18.940> piece<00:01:19.180> over<00:01:19.510> so<00:01:19.690> you<00:01:19.780> can<00:01:19.900> cut

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
turning the piece over so you can cut

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.810 
turning the piece over so you can cut
downward<00:01:20.620> and<00:01:20.800> meet<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.220> first<00:01:21.460> cut<00:01:21.670> at<00:01:21.700> the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
downward and meet the first cut at the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.090 
downward and meet the first cut at the
bottom<00:01:22.210> now<00:01:22.900> with<00:01:23.080> a<00:01:23.110> little<00:01:23.320> wiggle<00:01:23.560> a<00:01:23.800> new

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
bottom now with a little wiggle a new

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.340 
bottom now with a little wiggle a new
apple<00:01:24.430> wedge<00:01:24.610> should<00:01:24.820> break<00:01:25.030> free<00:01:25.360> if<00:01:25.570> you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
apple wedge should break free if you

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.440 
apple wedge should break free if you
repeat<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.770> process<00:01:26.979> two<00:01:27.490> more<00:01:27.670> times<00:01:27.970> then

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
repeat the process two more times then

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.420 
repeat the process two more times then
stagger<00:01:28.870> the<00:01:29.080> pieces<00:01:29.409> back<00:01:29.440> together<00:01:29.770> the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
stagger the pieces back together the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.389 
stagger the pieces back together the
effect<00:01:30.850> is<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.270> beautifully<00:01:31.899> layered<00:01:32.140> wing<00:01:32.469> now

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
effect is a beautifully layered wing now

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:34.889 
effect is a beautifully layered wing now
just<00:01:33.670> cut<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:33.939> other<00:01:34.030> piece<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.479> same<00:01:34.689> way

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
just cut the other piece the same way

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.569 
just cut the other piece the same way
and<00:01:35.140> your<00:01:35.409> swans<00:01:35.740> body<00:01:36.070> should<00:01:36.369> look<00:01:36.549> like

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
and your swans body should look like

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.660 
and your swans body should look like
this<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:38.049> make<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.229> place<00:01:38.560> for<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.890> head<00:01:39.159> all<00:01:39.430> we

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
deep groove at this point we can go

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.020 
deep groove at this point we can go
ahead<00:01:47.649> and<00:01:47.890> grab<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.310> other<00:01:48.520> half<00:01:48.820> of<00:01:48.939> the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.859 
Apple and place it between the butter
knives<00:01:50.920> like<00:01:51.159> before<00:01:51.549> but<00:01:52.090> this<00:01:52.240> time<00:01:52.299> we're

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
knives like before but this time we're

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.749 
knives like before but this time we're
just<00:01:53.049> going<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.229> use<00:01:53.350> them<00:01:53.500> as<00:01:53.680> spacers<00:01:54.189> to<00:01:54.460> cut

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
just going to use them as spacers to cut

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.149 
just going to use them as spacers to cut
an<00:01:54.880> even<00:01:55.180> slice<00:01:55.509> off<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.780> bottom<00:01:56.229> you<00:01:56.979> can<00:01:57.009> see

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
an even slice off the bottom you can see

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.740 
an even slice off the bottom you can see
that<00:01:57.430> repeating<00:01:57.789> this<00:01:57.909> process<00:01:58.149> three<00:01:58.659> or

that repeating this process three or

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.749 
that repeating this process three or
four<00:01:58.960> times<00:01:59.170> gives<00:01:59.770> us<00:01:59.920> a<00:02:00.039> nice<00:02:00.159> variety<00:02:00.399> of

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
four times gives us a nice variety of

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.450 
four times gives us a nice variety of
shapes<00:02:01.149> and<00:02:01.329> sizes<00:02:01.829> now<00:02:02.829> look<00:02:03.039> for<00:02:03.189> a<00:02:03.250> piece

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460
