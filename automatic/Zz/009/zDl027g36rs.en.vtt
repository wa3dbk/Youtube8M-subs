00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
here is a peer that's on Lake Michigan

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.210 
here is a peer that's on Lake Michigan
and<00:00:35.580> the<00:00:36.360> plan<00:00:36.989> for<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.320> flight<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.830> actually

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
and the plan for this flight is actually

take off from the beach fly out to the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.680 
take off from the beach fly out to the
end<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> pier<00:00:41.670> where<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.970> lighthouse<00:00:42.210> is

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
end of the pier where the lighthouse is

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.030 
end of the pier where the lighthouse is
and<00:00:44.300> photograph<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.540> lighthouse<00:00:45.960> while<00:00:46.860> we

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
and photograph the lighthouse while we

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.430 
and photograph the lighthouse while we
fly<00:00:47.460> around<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.150> come<00:00:48.510> back<00:00:48.540> and<00:00:48.900> land<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.130 
fly around and come back and land on the
beach<00:00:49.790> so<00:00:50.790> now<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.000> old<00:00:51.330> way<00:00:51.540> you<00:00:51.989> would

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
beach so now the old way you would

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.399 
beach so now the old way you would
simply<00:00:52.620> touch<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> map<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.059> lay<00:00:54.960> out<00:00:55.140> your

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
simply touch on the map and lay out your

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.160 
simply touch on the map and lay out your
waypoints<00:00:56.040> and<00:00:56.480> then<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.629> could<00:00:57.809> define

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
waypoints and then you could define

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.860 
waypoints and then you could define
those<00:00:58.379> waypoints<00:00:59.129> later<00:00:59.400> using<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.420> Waypoint

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
those waypoints later using the Waypoint

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.380 
those waypoints later using the Waypoint
editor<00:01:01.519> now<00:01:02.519> I<00:01:02.580> want<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.790> show<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.089> cool<00:01:03.360> new

feature that we want to talk about today
is<00:01:29.220> region<00:01:30.120> of<00:01:30.210> interest<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.290> I'm<00:01:31.440> going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.680> go

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
is region of interest so I'm going to go

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.890 
is region of interest so I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.040> edit<00:01:32.190> Waypoint<00:01:32.730> 4<00:01:33.300> I'm<00:01:33.750> gonna

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
ahead and edit Waypoint 4 I'm gonna

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.670 
ahead and edit Waypoint 4 I'm gonna
change<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> region<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.100> interest<00:01:35.220> and

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
change that to a region of interest and

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.560 
change that to a region of interest and
now<00:01:37.680> you're<00:01:37.920> gonna<00:01:38.010> notice<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.430> Waypoint<00:01:39.270> 4

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
now you're gonna notice that Waypoint 4

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.570 
now you're gonna notice that Waypoint 4
is<00:01:39.810> actually<00:01:40.050> sitting<00:01:40.560> out<00:01:40.770> there<00:01:41.010> on<00:01:41.070> its<00:01:41.400> own

so I'm gonna go ahead and touch on

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.850 
so I'm gonna go ahead and touch on
Waypoint<00:01:43.800> form<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.660> drag<00:01:45.660> it<00:01:45.990> directly<00:01:46.770> over

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
Waypoint form and drag it directly over

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.940 
Waypoint form and drag it directly over
where<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> lighthouse<00:01:47.580> is<00:01:48.680> now<00:01:49.680> what<00:01:49.920> that

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
where the lighthouse is now what that

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.820 
where the lighthouse is now what that
does<00:01:50.160> is<00:01:50.910> as<00:01:51.390> we<00:01:51.570> take<00:01:51.780> off<00:01:51.990> from<00:01:52.140> Waypoint<00:01:52.620> 1

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
does is as we take off from Waypoint 1

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.130 
does is as we take off from Waypoint 1
and<00:01:53.510> fly<00:01:54.510> to<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.960> next<00:01:55.920> Waypoint<00:01:56.460> our<00:01:57.140> camera

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
and fly to the next Waypoint our camera

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.810 
and fly to the next Waypoint our camera
or<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.440> nose<00:01:58.650> of<00:01:58.860> our<00:01:58.950> multi-rotor<00:01:59.490> will<00:01:59.700> be

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
or the nose of our multi-rotor will be

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.180 
or the nose of our multi-rotor will be
pointed<00:02:00.360> at<00:02:00.540> Waypoint<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.410> the<00:02:01.560> entire<00:02:01.860> time

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
pointed at Waypoint for the entire time

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.560 
pointed at Waypoint for the entire time
giving<00:02:03.180> us<00:02:03.330> a<00:02:03.570> cinematic<00:02:04.290> panning<00:02:04.860> view<00:02:05.160> of

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
giving us a cinematic panning view of

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.930 
giving us a cinematic panning view of
our<00:02:06.570> region<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.170> interest<00:02:10.610> now<00:02:11.610> let's<00:02:11.790> do<00:02:11.910> a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
our region of interest now let's do a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.070 
our region of interest now let's do a
couple<00:02:12.269> of<00:02:12.420> things<00:02:12.510> here<00:02:12.720> we<00:02:12.810> want<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.019> go

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
couple of things here we want to go

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.809 
couple of things here we want to go
ahead<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.230> edit<00:02:13.379> Waypoint<00:02:13.620> 1<00:02:14.160> I'm<00:02:14.519> gonna<00:02:14.670> make

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
ahead and edit Waypoint 1 I'm gonna make

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.780 
ahead and edit Waypoint 1 I'm gonna make
that<00:02:15.000> take<00:02:15.690> off<00:02:16.069> and<00:02:17.069> then<00:02:17.550> we're<00:02:17.640> going<00:02:17.760> to

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.839 
that take off and then we're going to
edit<00:02:18.060> Waypoint<00:02:18.239> 7<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.230> make<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.430> landing

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849
