try and harass the probes over here that

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.590 
try and harass the probes over here that
there<00:01:25.710> aren't<00:01:25.890> even<00:01:26.009> any<00:01:26.189> probes<00:01:26.610> left<00:01:26.970> there

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
there aren't even any probes left there

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.929 
there aren't even any probes left there
are<00:01:27.780> no<00:01:27.960> probes<00:01:28.320> left<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.770> mind<00:01:29.040> oh<00:01:29.310> my<00:01:29.729> gosh

won the game for him if he can take out

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.460 
won the game for him if he can take out
all<00:01:35.310> men<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.210> think<00:01:36.570> both<00:01:36.810> players<00:01:37.110> are<00:01:37.350> just

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
all men I think both players are just

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.410 
all men I think both players are just
functioning<00:01:38.009> all<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.220> their<00:01:38.490> existing<00:01:39.030> armies

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
functioning all of their existing armies

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.810 
functioning all of their existing armies
right<00:01:39.630> now<00:01:39.780> I'll<00:01:40.409> bet<00:01:40.590> mind<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.100> probably<00:01:41.700> a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
right now I'll bet mind is probably a

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.499 
right now I'll bet mind is probably a
distance<00:01:42.299> mining<00:01:42.689> at<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:42.930> point<00:01:44.240> it's<00:01:45.240> hard

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
distance mining at this point it's hard

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.609 
distance mining at this point it's hard
to<00:01:45.600> say<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.899> can't<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.200> don't<00:01:46.229> see<00:01:46.500> any

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
to say that I can't I don't see any

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
stats does have a little bit of an army

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.050 
stats does have a little bit of an army
left<00:05:13.650> and<00:05:13.920> he's<00:05:14.010> kept<00:05:14.280> in<00:05:14.400> reserve<00:05:14.550> this<00:05:14.880> whole

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.050 
left and he's kept in reserve this whole
time<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.620> if<00:05:16.620> it's<00:05:17.130> too<00:05:17.340> much<00:05:17.370> of<00:05:17.520> an<00:05:17.700> army<00:05:17.940> he

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
time and if it's too much of an army he

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.000 
time and if it's too much of an army he
may<00:05:18.240> be<00:05:18.300> able<00:05:18.450> to<00:05:18.600> stop<00:05:18.870> mind<00:05:19.350> from<00:05:19.650> mining

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
may be able to stop mind from mining

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.740 
may be able to stop mind from mining
that<00:05:20.160> location<00:05:20.700> this<00:05:21.240> is<00:05:21.420> absolutely

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
that location this is absolutely

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.840 
that location this is absolutely
ridiculous<00:05:21.990> both<00:05:22.620> players<00:05:22.980> again<00:05:23.400> stopped

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
ridiculous both players again stopped

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.380 
ridiculous both players again stopped
from<00:05:24.120> mining<00:05:24.510> I<00:05:25.730> guess<00:05:26.730> that's<00:05:26.940> didn't<00:05:27.270> want

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
from mining I guess that's didn't want

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.560 
from mining I guess that's didn't want
to<00:05:27.480> try<00:05:27.630> and<00:05:27.720> invest<00:05:27.990> money<00:05:28.230> into<00:05:28.470> more<00:05:28.740> probes

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
to try and invest money into more probes

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.850 
to try and invest money into more probes
so<00:05:30.570> he<00:05:30.840> was<00:05:30.960> just<00:05:31.110> doing<00:05:31.260> what<00:05:31.380> he<00:05:31.500> could<00:05:31.710> move

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
so he was just doing what he could move

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.710 
so he was just doing what he could move
it<00:05:31.950> probes<00:05:32.190> he<00:05:32.310> had<00:05:32.490> okay<00:05:32.910> here<00:05:33.180> here's

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
it probes he had okay here here's

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.740 
it probes he had okay here here's
statuses<00:05:34.410> a<00:05:34.620> first-person<00:05:35.610> view<00:05:35.820> he's<00:05:36.420> got<00:05:36.720> a

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
statuses a first-person view he's got a

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.530 
statuses a first-person view he's got a
hundred<00:05:37.170> minerals<00:05:37.710> left<00:05:37.950> 103<00:05:38.940> minerals<00:05:39.300> left

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
hundred minerals left 103 minerals left

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.380 
hundred minerals left 103 minerals left
and<00:05:39.800> and<00:05:40.800> and<00:05:41.340> that's<00:05:41.550> it<00:05:41.910> and<00:05:41.940> he's<00:05:42.210> not

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
and and and that's it and he's not

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.790 
and and and that's it and he's not
producing<00:05:42.870> any<00:05:43.020> approach<00:05:43.200> I<00:05:43.350> now<00:05:43.470> see<00:05:43.650> he's

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
producing any approach I now see he's

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.990 
producing any approach I now see he's
just<00:05:44.040> keeping<00:05:44.160> those<00:05:44.400> hundred<00:05:44.700> medals<00:05:44.940> in

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
just keeping those hundred medals in

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.370 
just keeping those hundred medals in
reserve<00:05:45.300> I<00:05:45.420> guess<00:05:45.570> in<00:05:45.720> case<00:05:45.870> he<00:05:45.990> needs<00:05:46.170> one

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
reserve I guess in case he needs one

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.890 
reserve I guess in case he needs one
last<00:05:46.410> delat<00:05:47.100> or<00:05:47.550> something<00:05:48.510> like<00:05:48.600> that<00:05:48.660> he's

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
last delat or something like that he's

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.720 
last delat or something like that he's
only<00:05:49.050> got<00:05:49.200> 130<00:05:49.770> gasto<00:05:50.250> so<00:05:50.370> you<00:05:50.460> can't<00:05:50.640> even

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
only got 130 gasto so you can't even

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.730 
only got 130 gasto so you can't even
build<00:05:50.880> anymore<00:05:51.210> Templar<00:05:51.630> here<00:05:51.840> mind<00:05:52.440> has

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
build anymore Templar here mind has

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.490 
build anymore Templar here mind has
looks<00:05:53.610> like<00:05:53.760> 90<00:05:54.270> minerals<00:05:54.540> left<00:05:54.990> in<00:05:55.140> the<00:05:55.230> banks

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
looks like 90 minerals left in the banks

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.220 
looks like 90 minerals left in the banks
so<00:05:55.890> he<00:05:56.130> can<00:05:56.280> only<00:05:56.430> make<00:05:56.670> like<00:05:56.700> one<00:05:57.150> vulture<00:05:57.690> so

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
so he can only make like one vulture so

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.590 
so he can only make like one vulture so
it<00:05:58.500> is<00:05:58.650> just<00:05:58.680> going<00:05:59.490> to<00:05:59.550> be<00:05:59.610> a<00:05:59.700> battle<00:06:00.030> of<00:06:00.270> what

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
it is just going to be a battle of what

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.000 
it is just going to be a battle of what
they<00:06:00.780> have<00:06:01.020> left<00:06:01.260> it's<00:06:01.560> going<00:06:01.770> to<00:06:01.800> be<00:06:01.920> an

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
they have left it's going to be an

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.160 
they have left it's going to be an
elimination<00:06:02.340> battle<00:06:03.000> i<00:06:03.090> think<00:06:03.360> if<00:06:03.480> not<00:06:03.720> a<00:06:03.750> draw

woman<00:06:59.340> I<00:06:59.730> don't<00:06:59.790> even<00:07:00.180> know<00:07:00.389> what<00:07:00.480> to<00:07:00.510> say

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 
woman I don't even know what to say

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.930 
woman I don't even know what to say
there<00:07:00.990> that<00:07:01.590> was<00:07:01.800> almost<00:07:02.070> a<00:07:02.370> draw<00:07:02.580> I<00:07:02.760> almost

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
there that was almost a draw I almost

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.450 
there that was almost a draw I almost
have<00:07:03.180> to<00:07:03.210> say<00:07:03.419> that<00:07:03.630> stats<00:07:04.020> had<00:07:04.290> had<00:07:04.830> held<00:07:05.160> back

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 
have to say that stats had had held back

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.340 
have to say that stats had had held back
and<00:07:05.760> would<00:07:05.910> have<00:07:06.030> been<00:07:06.060> a<00:07:06.180> draw<00:07:06.450> if<00:07:06.780> he<00:07:06.960> hadn't

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350 
and would have been a draw if he hadn't

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.260 
and would have been a draw if he hadn't
gone<00:07:07.650> in<00:07:07.919> there<00:07:08.100> it<00:07:08.610> might<00:07:08.880> have<00:07:08.970> been<00:07:09.060> a<00:07:09.120> draw

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.270 
gone in there it might have been a draw

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.670 
gone in there it might have been a draw
because<00:07:09.390> stats<00:07:09.870> was<00:07:10.080> keeping<00:07:10.410> him<00:07:10.530> from

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
because stats was keeping him from

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.040 
because stats was keeping him from
mining<00:07:11.160> he<00:07:11.820> didn't<00:07:12.120> have<00:07:12.270> to<00:07:12.300> charge<00:07:12.690> in<00:07:12.900> there

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
mining he didn't have to charge in there

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.960 
mining he didn't have to charge in there
I<00:07:13.080> don't<00:07:13.200> think<00:07:13.350> and<00:07:13.710> try<00:07:14.310> and<00:07:14.370> win<00:07:14.610> he<00:07:14.790> could

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:14.970 
I don't think and try and win he could

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.340 
I don't think and try and win he could
have<00:07:15.060> been<00:07:15.150> a<00:07:15.180> job<00:07:15.419> maybe<00:07:15.720> I<00:07:15.810> guess<00:07:16.080> that's

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.350 
have been a job maybe I guess that's

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.900

thought<00:07:16.620> with<00:07:16.770> those<00:07:16.919> two<00:07:17.100> are<00:07:17.310> cons<00:07:17.580> to<00:07:17.760> take

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:17.910
