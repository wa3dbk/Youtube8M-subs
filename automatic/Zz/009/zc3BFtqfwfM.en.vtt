00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 everything that goes up must come down 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.549
 the landing gear of an airplane must 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.350
 be able to withstand great pressures 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.030
 this key element in an airplane is the 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.639
 product of an expert mechanics 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.639
 combined with sophisticated technology 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.570
 this heavy piece of steel is the train of 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.610
 landing of a kc-135 r stratotankers 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.680
 the landing gear comprises a tree 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.240
 central to which it joins in the axis and the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.180
 wheels 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.220
 the first step is to create the tree this 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.040
 digital lathe works the surface 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.809
 outside of the piece a jet of water and 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.090
 of oil cools the piece that is 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.390
 reheats due to friction 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.280
 the next step is to bore the 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.450
 Abocar drilling head will give the 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.310
 tree interior 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.910
 the alignment of the head should be 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.910
 perfect 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.550
 the remains of the cuts are collected for 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.059
 sell them to the conditions where they 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.059
 they will recycle 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.800
 the cutting tool that is used to 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.659
 make the holes in the train 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.659
 landing must be very pointed 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.400
 the hole widens on both sides 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.400
 through this tool 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.630
 the piece cools once more with a 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.630
 water and oil mixture 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.400
 the cut is finished and the 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.960
 hole with compressed air for 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.960
 proceed to visual inspection 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.620
 after this machine wears three 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.520
 pieces at a time since they will be used in 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.960
 aviation 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.800
 these pieces must have a finish 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.800
 perfect 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.000
 the manufacture of the tree is almost 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.000
 completed 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.009
 This beard machine unites the 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.260
 surfaces with compressed air and discs 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.750
 of sandpaper 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.909
 and then you have to verify the 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.220
 dimensions of the piece this machine 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:22.959
 digital has three axes and performs the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.959
 verification with the highest precision 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.480
 there is another unit to work the pieces 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.480
 larger 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.769
 in these facilities they are also 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.829
 point landing gear used as 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.540
 this one of a boeing 707 is first removed 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:51.069
 painting with a sandblast to 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.069
 check the condition of the pieces 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.290
 however the visual inspection is not 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.760
 enough the possible cracks can 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.040
 detected with concentration of 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.110
 magnetic particles of magnetite the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.950
 piece and any possible crack will be 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.950
 visible to ultraviolet light 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.739
 It's time to go to the workshop for the 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.870
 Next step spray with steel balls 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.069
 the surface of the metal to increase the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.079
 fatigue resistance 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.599
 before repainting the piece and what 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.519
 galvanize the piece dips 10 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:25.709
 minutes instead it forms a layer 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.709
 protective that will resist corrosion 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.380
 then it dives quickly into 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.380
 chromic acid 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.060
 the water stirred by action motors 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.640
 clean the chromic acid and the piece is 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.800
 rinse in water once more 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.440
 then it went that in a furnace to 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.090
 190 degrees for 23 hours for 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.780
 eliminate the hydrogen induced during 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.780
 the galvanized 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.280
 the next step is to submerge the piece 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.410
 in liquid nitrogen at minus 129 degrees 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.440
 before inserting it to reduce its 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.440
 size 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.849
 this clamp is pushed with a cat 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.849
 hydraulic 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.460
 When reheating the clamp recovers 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.650
 its normal size 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.810
 then they are inserted inside the 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.930
 piston the different components and the 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.470
 leak proof gaskets 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.419
 the shock absorber goes inside the piston 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.259
 this part absorbs shocks when 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.259
 an airplane lands 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.530
 then the piston slides inside the 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.620
 cylinder and it is verified that the 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.720
 shock absorber is leak proof 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.910
 the manufacturing concludes when it dries 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.010
 painting in the oven 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.230
 it takes between six and eight months in 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.480
 manufacture a new landing gear and 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.380
 between six and eight weeks in putting 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.380
 used one point
