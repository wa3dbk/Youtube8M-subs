00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.640
 also a feasible fixed for but together 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.950
 in in every train is for an animal 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.710
 field occupation is essential 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.280
 we don't have to let you play 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.820
 NS sees a bit confused about this 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.730
 read more moves a bit together 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.690
 but you have to realize 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.510
 plays three against three plus 2 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.540
 it the two extra people 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.540
 so basically he should not lose the ball in these days 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.540
 to achieve that 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.580
 she has had to play very disciplined from a certain position 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.690
 the Indian field occupation 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.010
 in possession of the ball 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.960
 had you shown now we are starting to look good 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.190
 he has to play 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.190
 if you come is closer 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.570
 and you come a little closer 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.880
 so you should give him the opportunity to possibly also play a long ball on 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.100
 the moment he plays a deep ball 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.970
 imaginary striker 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.070
 then you have to cost sober you have to go with standard 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.210
 so you have to switch very quickly 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.840
 could get the black 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.280
 defend meijs 2 you play on the inside 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.670
 the card and I am very happy the man is going to play 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.090
 nec 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.120
 this can also play a long time in this time 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.480
 or you have to play casillas for a long time our team is tiraspol point i am 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.480
 already left 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.340
 committee the committee the facility committee 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:12.859
 you can only hear twice 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.299
 at 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.640
 well so and almost spelled well past years ago, too bad 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.529
 the opposition 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:33.529
 let run what runs game again game now calm 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.459
 calm calm calm 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.319
 calm calm 60 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.319
 create conditions 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.989
 and then you don't come expecting 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.349
 you do not only play football with your legs but also with your head what you see now 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.959
 show you that you've seen 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.959
 I've seen here 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.599
 so we get customers out well, good time is chosen very well 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.699
 a faster field occupation that blue one 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.019
 well played 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.949
 if so well looked york 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.939
 and choose no position on the roadside in the coming coming 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:44.699
 will lie quietly locklear locklear 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.599
 and the auto track and put on right 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.359
 watch it come out here 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.419
 they wanted to participate 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.419
 join quickly 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.169
 and game learn to spell wii game again 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.169
 well done 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.639
 I would like 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.639
 if your policy trains were running now for your own purpose you will not participate 

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:19.939
 then you play heart balls 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:22.939
 and see what happens here 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.779
 and now we are honest 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:28.340
 just play soccer 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.340
 a physical structure 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.090
 well played 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.090
 play the game play faster 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:45.779
 and grams per km 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.419
 don't come too close to each other 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.259
 then you make the field came 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.029
 I think I choose a position 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:06.819
 he plays the ball back 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.729
 and precisely that it is long-term 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.789
 and that's me here 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.830
 and what are you doing great 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.120
 and then he comes to the middle that means you click in the office 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.229
 but always maintained your field occupation 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.770
 she always remains conversant in doing ideals 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.849
 that means that you should not actually become that ball 

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:45.159
 well done 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.580
 and done with it 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.580
 well placed 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.089

 walk well for so long 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.909
 but also very long and can hold back 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.180
 to pull out and pull 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.180
