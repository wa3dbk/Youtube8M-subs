so this is the finished product after

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.670 
so this is the finished product after
making<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:10.030> fuel<00:03:10.720> injector<00:03:11.110> cleaner<00:03:11.319> off<00:03:11.500> of

goes<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:26.319> the<00:03:26.470> on/off<00:03:27.310> valve<00:03:27.989> and<00:03:28.989> then<00:03:29.700> you

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
goes to the on/off valve and then you

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.110 
goes to the on/off valve and then you
got<00:03:30.910> your<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.650> hose<00:03:32.860> barb<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:33.970> got<00:03:34.090> a

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
got your to the hose barb and you got a

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.270 
got your to the hose barb and you got a
piece<00:03:34.300> of<00:03:34.330> hose<00:03:34.600> from<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.900> hose<00:03:35.080> barb<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:36.130> this

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
piece of hose from the hose barb to this

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.449 
piece of hose from the hose barb to this
hose<00:03:36.459> barb<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:37.150> then<00:03:37.660> you<00:03:37.780> have<00:03:37.930> it<00:03:38.140> to<00:03:38.459> this

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
hose barb and then you have it to this

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.229 
hose barb and then you have it to this
reducer<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.900> injector<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:42.130> then<00:03:42.340> you

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
reducer to the injector and then you

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.949 
reducer to the injector and then you
have<00:03:43.450> your<00:03:44.010> bracket<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.489> is<00:03:45.550> only<00:03:46.269> in<00:03:46.510> sector

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
have your bracket that is only in sector

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.840 
have your bracket that is only in sector
they're<00:03:47.140> kind<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.069> falling<00:03:48.340> off<00:03:48.400> right<00:03:48.640> now

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
they're kind of falling off right now

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.020 
they're kind of falling off right now
with<00:03:49.060> this<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:50.830> then<00:03:50.980> you<00:03:51.130> have<00:03:51.340> your<00:03:51.550> switch

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
with this and then you have your switch

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.440 
with this and then you have your switch
or<00:03:52.630> your<00:03:52.780> extra<00:03:53.019> injector<00:03:53.680> plug<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:54.850> a<00:03:54.880> battery

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
or your extra injector plug to a battery

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.759 
or your extra injector plug to a battery
that's<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:56.050> a<00:03:56.080> push-button<00:03:56.380> so<00:03:58.350> as<00:03:59.350> you<00:03:59.650> can

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
that's to a push-button so as you can

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.380 
that's to a push-button so as you can
hear<00:04:00.390> it<00:04:01.650> activates<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:03.459> injector<00:04:04.000> with<00:04:04.180> a

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
hear it activates the injector with a

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.220 
hear it activates the injector with a
triple-a<00:04:05.019> battery<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.769> then<00:04:06.519> the<00:04:07.480> bracket

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
triple-a battery and then the bracket

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.050 
triple-a battery and then the bracket
here<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:08.680> was<00:04:09.040> made<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.280> same<00:04:09.519> way<00:04:09.700> you've<00:04:09.850> seen

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
here I was made the same way you've seen

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.170 
here I was made the same way you've seen
in<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.780> other<00:04:10.930> video<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.920> mine<00:04:12.670> just<00:04:12.880> slides

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
in the other video and mine just slides

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.469 
in the other video and mine just slides
over<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.480> top<00:04:13.780> there<00:04:14.019> and<00:04:14.500> then<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:15.700> just

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
over the top there and then this just

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.469 
over the top there and then this just
slides<00:04:16.810> right<00:04:16.930> together<00:04:17.320> real<00:04:17.799> nice<00:04:18.039> and<00:04:18.190> easy

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
slides right together real nice and easy

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.250 
slides right together real nice and easy
a<00:04:19.769> few<00:04:20.769> differences<00:04:21.300> and<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.690> cleaner<00:04:22.900> that<00:04:23.229> I

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
a few differences and the cleaner that I

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.340 
a few differences and the cleaner that I
made<00:04:23.590> in<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:24.370> cleaner<00:04:24.580> that's<00:04:24.789> in<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.030> link

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
made in the cleaner that's in the link

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.469 
made in the cleaner that's in the link
the<00:04:26.350> piece<00:04:26.590> here<00:04:27.010> is<00:04:27.340> actually<00:04:28.030> a<00:04:28.090> smaller

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
the piece here is actually a smaller

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.300 
the piece here is actually a smaller
coupler<00:04:28.990> I'll<00:04:29.140> have<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.440> get<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.680> size<00:04:29.919> and

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
coupler I'll have to get the size and

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.310 
coupler I'll have to get the size and
then<00:04:30.460> I<00:04:30.520> had<00:04:30.700> to<00:04:30.789> drill<00:04:31.090> mine<00:04:31.300> out<00:04:31.570> instead<00:04:32.260> of

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
then I had to drill mine out instead of

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.230 
then I had to drill mine out instead of
using<00:04:32.620> a<00:04:33.660> 2764<00:04:34.660> I<00:04:35.080> believe<00:04:35.830> it<00:04:35.950> was<00:04:36.070> a<00:04:36.130> 7/16<00:04:37.030> so

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
using a 2764 I believe it was a 7/16 so

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.420 
using a 2764 I believe it was a 7/16 so
the<00:04:37.419> next<00:04:37.780> size<00:04:37.990> up<00:04:38.289> made<00:04:38.590> it<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.830> little<00:04:39.010> easier

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
the next size up made it a little easier

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.909 
the next size up made it a little easier
for<00:04:39.490> me<00:04:39.700> to<00:04:39.789> slide<00:04:40.150> my<00:04:40.360> injector<00:04:40.870> in<00:04:40.990> or<00:04:41.470> made

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
for me to slide my injector in or made

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.909 
for me to slide my injector in or made
it<00:04:42.039> you<00:04:42.280> know<00:04:42.310> so<00:04:42.760> I<00:04:42.789> wouldn't<00:04:43.180> care<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.479> seals

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
it you know so I wouldn't care the seals

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.420 
it you know so I wouldn't care the seals
I<00:04:44.919> don't<00:04:45.520> have<00:04:45.669> any<00:04:46.979> injector<00:04:47.979> printer<00:04:48.250> at<00:04:48.370> the

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
I don't have any injector printer at the

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.310 
I don't have any injector printer at the
moment<00:04:48.820> but<00:04:48.940> I'm<00:04:49.060> going<00:04:49.240> to<00:04:49.300> use<00:04:49.539> just<00:04:49.870> some

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
moment but I'm going to use just some

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.990 
moment but I'm going to use just some
carburetor<00:04:50.830> cleaner<00:04:51.070> for<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.490> time<00:04:51.700> being

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
carburetor cleaner for the time being

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.180 
carburetor cleaner for the time being
just<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:53.020> demonstrate<00:04:53.910> and<00:04:54.910> I'll<00:04:55.979> squirt<00:04:56.979> some

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
just to demonstrate and I'll squirt some

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.040 
just to demonstrate and I'll squirt some
in<00:04:57.250> there<00:04:57.550> fill<00:04:57.850> it<00:04:57.910> up<00:04:58.710> with<00:04:59.710> some<00:05:01.050> that

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
in there fill it up with some that

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.730 
in there fill it up with some that
should<00:05:02.350> be<00:05:02.440> plenty<00:05:03.870> then<00:05:04.870> we'll<00:05:05.020> take<00:05:05.229> our<00:05:05.260> air

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
should be plenty then we'll take our air

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.420 
should be plenty then we'll take our air
hose<00:05:06.720> that<00:05:07.720> that's<00:05:08.229> art<00:05:08.440> had<00:05:08.590> been<00:05:09.220> to<00:05:09.340> the

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
hose that that's art had been to the

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.859 
hose that that's art had been to the
regulator<00:05:09.849> we<00:05:10.240> turned<00:05:10.479> it<00:05:10.599> down<00:05:10.780> to<00:05:11.590> 20<00:05:12.159> pounds

00:05:13.859 --> 00:05:13.869 
regulator we turned it down to 20 pounds

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:16.169 
regulator we turned it down to 20 pounds
so<00:05:14.259> it<00:05:14.649> depressurizes<00:05:15.309> like<00:05:15.490> a<00:05:15.520> fuel<00:05:15.999> real

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:16.179 
so it depressurizes like a fuel real

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:21.089 
so it depressurizes like a fuel real
then<00:05:16.899> we<00:05:17.020> took<00:05:17.319> this<00:05:17.919> on<00:05:18.550> off<00:05:18.819> valve<00:05:18.849> is<00:05:19.419> off<00:05:20.099> we

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
then we took this on off valve is off we

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:33.559 
then we took this on off valve is off we
take<00:05:21.309> and<00:05:21.669> we<00:05:22.330> plug<00:05:23.139> the<00:05:24.129> air<00:05:24.189> hose<00:05:24.459> in<00:05:27.959> okay

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:33.569
