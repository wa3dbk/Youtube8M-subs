00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.820
 he hid his game it's not possible to go 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.400

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.930
 catch by the patrol with stybar who would not come back 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.050
 helped by jimmie johnson who was marking an old gentleman alassane ouattara in the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.050
 last turn his chants his yards diane sawyer who is a passionate 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.120
 in his last year 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.120
 cap screwed in the vast hall of easter easter 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.740
 viewers and 14,000 euros 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.619
 we were there we can buy them objective anyway we ignore the 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.950
 because yes 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.700

 so these fireworks in winter amazing try like talladega will save 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.540
 not the car of calais-marck the quaking 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.670
 but we went around the TV news all for the rhythm all by 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.600
 the wall with the publication of a judicial inquiry 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.040
 at least nine people were killed on the spot 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.880
 on the hood before our car 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.860
 after winning race 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.039

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.620
 the fc barcelona everyone is happy for now 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.930
 in the stands you could hear 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.930
 the interest of this appointment in addition to the mouth 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.290
 on the post a shock at night 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.960
 obviously it was enough 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.200
 so during this story is ranked still more class 14th which will result 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.760
 more than a month 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.499
 friendship but I believe it is 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:10.489
 we are a little applauding anyway 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.730
 the festival of comics during the race on the last lap which has not passed 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.529
 a little too early 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.049
 khaled lemmouchia lombard we also see what happened he had 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.419
 fabulous patient he added to his homily 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.539
 they could not do otherwise keep it 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:28.079
 the drowned voice exceptional it passes all alone amine am but also marc 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.389
 bloch at the origin is a blocking benefactor in the afternoon he knew 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.059
 that he had passed 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.960
 bruno the mayor 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.820
 tour in western Ivory Coast interspersed 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.090
 which allowed me to try something towards the end the end to review in 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.029
 completeness behind the c2 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:45.259
 to get in order denis amines the pistols outside johnson is 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:46.529
 blocked by stewart 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:50.040
 mediation to get closer to the back straight johnson takes with him 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:52.929
 percent estimate between Americans are at first 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:55.889

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.199
 recover the suction both cases a mouth he'll get there slowly the 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.729
 young will meanwhile the income the ouch has a triple aspirations necessarily 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:07.859
 simard must be he debouched as they say if I allow myself this term she 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.219
 by jimmie johnson and it will take well for the decisions of one of the turns it 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:15.039
 must pass what fly blocked trajectory then inevitably he go there 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:17.650
 and here he goes inside she goes outside 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.010
 and in fact a mouthful 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.999
 who still wanted 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:22.659
 change course in a turn 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.379
 and necessarily he always fully serves their mother he has done right 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.879
 left in fact they touched twice we were disappointed or even 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:28.979
 dirty them 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:32.509
 he's trying to find a way more and more we're just his emotion and 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.169
 greeted the linesman here 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.109
 that's going on outside and she would not come back for the 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.279
 block payments africa but avoidable at those speeds it's in 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:42.269
 trying to 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.410
 happy to come back to the moment when he is in imbalance whose who can not 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.660
 he should have waited to look behind you know you do you want you 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.149
 was too late bourgoin 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:55.479
 if the employer will stop the mans 10,000-year-old author and his new daughter 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.479
 flight schedules on arrival the second option 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.950
 it seemed authentic and especially interesting it is indeed here do not go 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.290
 not seek notice you can not blame those who were trying to 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.010
 block for target 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.789
 the past week he says at 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.579
 a third but it was really his temperament and it's still 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:13.240
 not 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.360
 second win of the season for tony stewart who won with the 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.279
