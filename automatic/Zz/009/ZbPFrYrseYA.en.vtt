00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
jazz in my opinion is very much a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.490 
jazz in my opinion is very much a
soloist<00:00:49.789> genre<00:00:50.789> there's<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.719> lot<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.930> solos

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
soloist genre there's a lot of solos

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
basic chord pattern and basic head of

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.580 
basic chord pattern and basic head of
the<00:00:57.090> song<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.570> then<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.020> lot<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.260> people<00:00:58.469> take

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the song and then a lot of people take

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.189 
the song and then a lot of people take
solos<00:00:58.949> over<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.690> now<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:00.780> not<00:01:00.840> always<00:01:01.050> that

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.349 
solos over that now it's not always that
way<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.890> my<00:01:02.010> experience<00:01:02.100> mostly<00:01:02.879> it's

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
way but in my experience mostly it's

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.299 
way but in my experience mostly it's
been<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.870> way<00:01:03.899> there's<00:01:04.379> at<00:01:04.530> least<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:04.830> solo

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
been that way there's at least one solo

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.550 
been that way there's at least one solo
and<00:01:05.519> every<00:01:06.060> jazz<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.780> our<00:01:06.900> most<00:01:07.020> chaste<00:01:07.290> songs

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
within four on the floor like our

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.250 
within four on the floor like our
pattern<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.090> we<00:02:12.180> did<00:02:12.300> last<00:02:12.480> time

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
pattern that we did last time

so I'll give you a few examples of

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.649 
so I'll give you a few examples of
copping<00:02:17.549> with<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:17.970> then<00:02:18.150> confident<00:02:18.599> the

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
copping with this and then confident the

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.050 
copping with this and then confident the
base<00:02:18.870> not<00:02:19.650> too<00:02:19.980> complicated<00:02:20.250> just<00:02:20.819> so<00:02:21.000> you

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
base not too complicated just so you

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.539 
base not too complicated just so you
guys<00:02:21.269> can<00:02:21.329> follow<00:02:21.689> along<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.470> start<00:02:22.769> off<00:02:22.890> slow

an eighth notes and then you can add
some<00:03:44.890> triplets<00:03:45.310> my<00:03:46.180> favorite<00:03:46.660> is<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:47.769> a<00:03:48.400> triplet

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
some triplets my favorite is a a triplet

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.490 
some triplets my favorite is a a triplet
pattern<00:03:49.420> where<00:03:49.569> you<00:03:49.629> do<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.810> base<00:03:50.200> on<00:03:50.410> the

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
pattern where you do the base on the

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.800 
pattern where you do the base on the
first<00:03:50.709> note<00:03:50.980> and<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.579> to<00:03:51.790> snare<00:03:52.030> hits<00:03:52.269> on<00:03:52.480> the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
first note and the to snare hits on the

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.630 
first note and the to snare hits on the
second<00:03:53.140> two<00:03:53.200> notes<00:03:53.410> of<00:03:53.530> triplet<00:03:53.860> so<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.430> goes

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
second two notes of triplet so it goes

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.729 
second two notes of triplet so it goes
bass<00:03:55.239> snare<00:03:55.390> snare<00:03:55.629> bass<00:03:55.989> there<00:03:56.290> snare<00:03:56.590> and

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
bass snare snare bass there snare and

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:03.210 
bass snare snare bass there snare and
you<00:03:56.799> can<00:03:56.950> work<00:03:57.069> it<00:03:57.220> up<00:03:57.280> pretty<00:03:57.489> fast<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:02.680> that's

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
you can work it up pretty fast so that's

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.039 
you can work it up pretty fast so that's
cool<00:04:03.489> and<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.790> kind<00:04:03.940> of<00:04:04.030> sounds<00:04:04.450> almost<00:04:04.690> like<00:04:04.930> a

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
cool and it kind of sounds almost like a

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.809 
cool and it kind of sounds almost like a
one-handed<00:04:05.530> roll<00:04:05.799> buddy<00:04:05.980> rich<00:04:06.160> to<00:04:06.340> that<00:04:06.519> a<00:04:06.549> lot

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
one-handed roll buddy rich to that a lot

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.680 
one-handed roll buddy rich to that a lot
and<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:08.560> those<00:04:08.680> are<00:04:08.829> some<00:04:08.889> examples<00:04:09.540> you<00:04:10.540> can

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
and so those are some examples you can

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.500 
and so those are some examples you can
also<00:04:10.840> comp<00:04:11.230> with<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.500> ride<00:04:12.000> by<00:04:13.000> changing<00:04:13.420> the

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
pattern I change the pattern a little

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.089 
pattern I change the pattern a little
bit<00:04:14.650> during<00:04:14.829> the<00:04:14.920> beginning<00:04:15.220> uh<00:04:16.769> but<00:04:17.769> for<00:04:18.010> the

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
bit during the beginning uh but for the

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:19.979 
bit during the beginning uh but for the
beginners<00:04:18.459> out<00:04:18.669> there<00:04:18.849> stick<00:04:19.389> with<00:04:19.720> just<00:04:19.870> the

beginners out there stick with just the
basic<00:04:20.019> ride<00:04:20.470> pattern<00:04:20.680> so<00:04:20.950> you<00:04:21.039> get<00:04:21.190> that<00:04:21.370> down

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
basic ride pattern so you get that down

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.089 
basic ride pattern so you get that down
