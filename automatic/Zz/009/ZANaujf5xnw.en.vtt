videos<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.560> will<00:01:52.710> know<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.890> we<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.340> do<00:01:53.490> a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
videos you will know that we can do a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.580 
videos you will know that we can do a
lot<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:53.970> things<00:01:54.450> with<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.960> falling<00:01:55.350> sand

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
lot of things with the falling sand

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.770 
lot of things with the falling sand
entity<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.189> command<00:01:56.490> blocks<00:01:56.759> such<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.479> you

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
entity and command blocks such as you

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.539 
entity and command blocks such as you
know<00:01:57.869> spawning<00:01:58.259> chests<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.770> contain<00:01:59.159> items

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
know spawning chests that contain items

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.609 
know spawning chests that contain items
in<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.909> using<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.780> replace<00:02:01.020> other<00:02:01.290> blocks

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
in it using it to replace other blocks

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.819 
in it using it to replace other blocks
or<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.189> case<00:02:02.659> taking<00:02:03.659> on<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.170> form<00:02:04.560> or

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
or in this case taking on the form or

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.039 
or in this case taking on the form or
the<00:02:04.950> look<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.430> other<00:02:05.729> blocks<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.540> right<00:02:06.750> here

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
the look of other blocks so right here

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.740 
the look of other blocks so right here
is<00:02:07.200> actually<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> falling<00:02:08.009> sand<00:02:08.340> entity<00:02:08.520> but<00:02:09.479> it

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
is actually a falling sand entity but it

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.800 
is actually a falling sand entity but it
is<00:02:10.050> using<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.709> portal<00:02:11.190> ID<00:02:11.430> 90<00:02:12.120> or<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.450> should

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
is using the portal ID 90 or I should

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.720 
is using the portal ID 90 or I should
say<00:02:12.930> ID<00:02:13.230> 9

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
say ID 9

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.300 
say ID 9
block<00:02:13.970> which<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.720> portal<00:02:15.080> block<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.590> when

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
block which is the portal block and when

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.070 
block which is the portal block and when
used<00:02:16.580> as<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.790> half<00:02:17.060> slab<00:02:17.330> but<00:02:17.510> actually

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
used as a half slab but actually

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.289 
used as a half slab but actually
displays<00:02:18.590> not<00:02:18.739> only<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.040> animated<00:02:19.580> but<00:02:20.180> it

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
displays not only is it animated but it

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.750 
displays not only is it animated but it
shows<00:02:20.569> up<00:02:20.840> on<00:02:21.019> its<00:02:21.440> side<00:02:21.739> it<00:02:21.920> goes<00:02:22.129> up<00:02:22.340> sideways

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
shows up on its side it goes up sideways

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.750 
shows up on its side it goes up sideways
so<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.480> can<00:02:24.110> try<00:02:24.379> and<00:02:24.590> jump<00:02:24.830> in<00:02:25.040> oh<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.340> might<00:02:25.610> be

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
so I can try and jump in oh it might be

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.610 
so I can try and jump in oh it might be
kind<00:02:25.940> of<00:02:25.970> hard<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.150> do<00:02:26.299> can<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.510> do<00:02:26.569> it<00:02:26.750> oh<00:02:26.930> no<00:02:27.470> it

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
kind of hard to do can I do it oh no it

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.780 
kind of hard to do can I do it oh no it
doesn't<00:02:27.799> do<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:27.980> well<00:02:28.220> actually<00:02:28.370> this<00:02:28.580> is<00:02:28.640> how

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
doesn't do it well actually this is how

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.240 
doesn't do it well actually this is how
it<00:02:29.030> looks<00:02:29.209> anyways<00:02:29.599> so<00:02:30.110> if<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.319> put<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.680> down

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
it looks anyways so if you put it down

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.610 
it looks anyways so if you put it down
can<00:02:31.879> I<00:02:31.970> get<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.330> there<00:02:32.480> we<00:02:32.569> go<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.230> this<00:02:33.470> is

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
can I get it there we go so this is

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.720 
can I get it there we go so this is
actually<00:02:33.769> what<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.069> looks<00:02:34.280> like<00:02:34.430> underneath

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
actually what it looks like underneath

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.580 
actually what it looks like underneath
the<00:02:35.360> reason<00:02:35.569> we<00:02:35.660> have<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.840> fence<00:02:36.080> here<00:02:36.410> is

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
the reason we have a fence here is

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.619 
the reason we have a fence here is
because<00:02:37.250> in<00:02:37.489> order<00:02:37.730> for<00:02:37.879> the<00:02:37.970> falling<00:02:38.299> sand

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
because in order for the falling sand

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.539 
because in order for the falling sand
entity<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:39.080> be<00:02:39.110> placed<00:02:39.500> properly<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:40.129> display

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
entity to be placed properly and display

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.430 
entity to be placed properly and display
the<00:02:40.670> portal<00:02:41.000> needs<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.660> be<00:02:41.750> on<00:02:41.840> top<00:02:42.049> of<00:02:42.079> a<00:02:42.260> fence

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
the portal needs to be on top of a fence

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.199 
the portal needs to be on top of a fence
but<00:02:42.620> see<00:02:42.829> every<00:02:43.159> single<00:02:43.489> time<00:02:43.610> you<00:02:43.790> jump<00:02:44.030> into

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
but see every single time you jump into

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.360 
but see every single time you jump into
it<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:45.440> go<00:02:45.590> ahead<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.799> get<00:02:45.860> teleported<00:02:46.280> it

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
it you go ahead and get teleported it

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.289 
it you go ahead and get teleported it
doesn't<00:02:46.579> matter<00:02:46.730> where<00:02:46.879> you<00:02:46.910> jump<00:02:47.150> in<00:02:47.269> you

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
doesn't matter where you jump in you

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.850 
doesn't matter where you jump in you
will<00:02:47.569> always<00:02:47.989> come<00:02:48.200> out<00:02:48.290> on<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.530> other<00:02:48.680> side

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
will always come out on the other side

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.530 
will always come out on the other side
if<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.220> guys<00:02:49.340> are<00:02:49.459> wondering<00:02:49.790> what<00:02:50.390> the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
if you guys are wondering what the

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.569 
if you guys are wondering what the
blocks<00:02:50.810> are<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.470> have<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.040> little<00:02:52.370> bit<00:02:52.459> of<00:02:52.519> a

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
blocks are I have a little bit of a

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.250 
blocks are I have a little bit of a
confession<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.150> make<00:02:53.269> this<00:02:53.450> isn't<00:02:53.810> redstone

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
confession to make this isn't redstone

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.069 
confession to make this isn't redstone
magic<00:02:54.650> either<00:02:54.829> I<00:02:55.160> literally<00:02:55.760> just<00:02:56.030> went<00:02:56.569> Andry

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
magic either I literally just went Andry

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.610 
magic either I literally just went Andry
textured<00:02:57.700> like<00:02:58.700> podzol<00:02:59.329> and<00:02:59.720> spruce<00:03:00.470> trees

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
textured like podzol and spruce trees

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.430 
textured like podzol and spruce trees
you'll<00:03:00.799> see<00:03:00.859> so<00:03:01.370> nowhere<00:03:02.239> near<00:03:02.690> is<00:03:02.840> attractive

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
you'll see so nowhere near is attractive

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.809 
you'll see so nowhere near is attractive
this<00:03:03.620> time<00:03:03.859> but<00:03:04.099> I<00:03:04.129> thought<00:03:04.400> it'd<00:03:04.549> look<00:03:04.609> pretty

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
this time but I thought it'd look pretty

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.430 
this time but I thought it'd look pretty
good<00:03:04.970> for<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.239> video<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:05.720> would<00:03:06.049> oh<00:03:06.200> yeah

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
good for the video so I would oh yeah

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.839 
good for the video so I would oh yeah
like<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.709> said<00:03:06.739> I<00:03:06.859> would<00:03:06.980> Freddy<00:03:07.190> I'll<00:03:07.280> out<00:03:07.640> for

like I said I would Freddy I'll out for

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.250 
like I said I would Freddy I'll out for
this<00:03:07.910> one<00:03:08.090> because<00:03:08.180> I<00:03:08.359> was<00:03:08.510> just<00:03:08.629> so<00:03:08.720> impressed

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
this one because I was just so impressed

this one because I was just so impressed
by<00:03:09.890> how<00:03:10.099> useful<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:10.609> can<00:03:10.640> be<00:03:10.879> you<00:03:11.060> can

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
by how useful it can be you can

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.110 
by how useful it can be you can
literally<00:03:11.480> make<00:03:12.010> sideways<00:03:13.010> portals<00:03:13.489> now<00:03:13.549> this

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
literally make sideways portals now this

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.610 
literally make sideways portals now this
is<00:03:14.269> going<00:03:14.390> to<00:03:14.480> be<00:03:14.569> extremely<00:03:15.049> useful<00:03:15.590> for

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
is going to be extremely useful for

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.800 
is going to be extremely useful for
server<00:03:16.069> aesthetics<00:03:16.660> apparently<00:03:17.660> it's<00:03:17.750> a

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
server aesthetics apparently it's a

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.180 
server aesthetics apparently it's a
little<00:03:18.049> bit<00:03:18.169> buggy<00:03:18.410> but<00:03:18.709> anyways<00:03:18.980> let<00:03:19.069> me<00:03:19.099> go

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
little bit buggy but anyways let me go

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.920 
little bit buggy but anyways let me go
ahead<00:03:19.250> show<00:03:19.519> you<00:03:19.579> exactly<00:03:20.030> how<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.269> works<00:03:20.419> now

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
ahead show you exactly how it works now

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.039 
ahead show you exactly how it works now
so<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:22.099> think<00:03:22.280> if<00:03:22.669> I<00:03:22.760> break<00:03:23.060> this<00:03:23.510> block<00:03:23.840> over

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
so I think if I break this block over

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.680 
so I think if I break this block over
here<00:03:24.730> yeah<00:03:25.730> let's<00:03:25.970> give<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.209> shot<00:03:26.419> so<00:03:26.599> this

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
here yeah let's give it a shot so this

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.059 
here yeah let's give it a shot so this
is<00:03:26.840> going<00:03:26.930> to<00:03:27.019> break<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.440> redstone<00:03:27.859> down

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
is going to break the redstone down

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.099 
is going to break the redstone down
there<00:03:28.310> because<00:03:29.030> if<00:03:29.209> I<00:03:29.359> if<00:03:29.569> I<00:03:29.720> were<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:29.989> have

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
there because if I if I were to have

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.500 
there because if I if I were to have
gotten<00:03:30.440> any<00:03:30.590> sooner<00:03:31.099> it<00:03:31.609> would<00:03:31.849> keep<00:03:32.150> trying

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
gotten any sooner it would keep trying

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.550 
gotten any sooner it would keep trying
to<00:03:32.599> teleport<00:03:32.870> me<00:03:33.109> every<00:03:33.260> time<00:03:33.380> I<00:03:33.470> would

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
to teleport me every time I would

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.750 
to teleport me every time I would
approach<00:03:33.829> the<00:03:34.010> command<00:03:34.280> block<00:03:34.459> it<00:03:34.669> would

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
approach the command block it would

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.940 
approach the command block it would
teleport<00:03:35.239> me<00:03:35.359> in<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:36.109> direction<00:03:36.500> I<00:03:36.739> get

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
teleport me in that direction I get

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.670 
teleport me in that direction I get
stuck<00:03:37.489> inside<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.180> Ender<00:03:38.480> blocks<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:39.380> over

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
stuck inside the Ender blocks so over

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.289 
stuck inside the Ender blocks so over
here<00:03:39.919> it's<00:03:40.130> actually<00:03:40.370> pretty<00:03:40.760> simple<00:03:40.970> enough

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
here it's actually pretty simple enough

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.800 
here it's actually pretty simple enough
we<00:03:41.870> have<00:03:42.109> a<00:03:42.430> redstone<00:03:43.430> clock<00:03:43.609> setting<00:03:44.180> err<00:03:44.480> and

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
we have a redstone clock setting err and

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.690 
we have a redstone clock setting err and
setting<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.739> redstone<00:03:46.130> block<00:03:46.340> so<00:03:46.549> that's

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
setting the redstone block so that's

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.809 
setting the redstone block so that's
just<00:03:46.790> constantly<00:03:47.299> going<00:03:47.450> off<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.959> then<00:03:48.819> it's

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
just constantly going off and then it's

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.280 
just constantly going off and then it's
just<00:03:50.030> this<00:03:50.209> OOP<00:03:50.510> up<00:03:50.780> what<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.109> heck<00:03:51.260> just

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
just this OOP up what the heck just

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.900 
just this OOP up what the heck just
happened<00:03:51.470> Oh<00:03:51.739> see<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.010> accidentally<00:03:52.489> press<00:03:52.730> the

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
happened Oh see I accidentally press the

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.360 
happened Oh see I accidentally press the
red<00:03:53.060> stuff<00:03:53.299> like<00:03:53.599> knob<00:03:53.930> stuck<00:03:54.319> I<00:03:54.620> don't<00:03:55.190> get

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
red stuff like knob stuck I don't get

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.180 
red stuff like knob stuck I don't get
out<00:03:55.419> losing<00:03:56.419> air<00:03:56.599> okay<00:03:57.260> hey<00:03:57.440> let<00:03:57.859> me<00:03:57.889> get<00:03:58.040> back

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
out losing air okay hey let me get back

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.400 
out losing air okay hey let me get back
down<00:03:58.370> here<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:59.239> was<00:03:59.629> not<00:03:59.870> supposed<00:04:00.049> to<00:04:00.200> power

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
down here I was not supposed to power

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.770 
down here I was not supposed to power
that<00:04:00.680> but<00:04:00.889> this<00:04:01.160> is<00:04:01.459> just<00:04:01.730> what<00:04:02.299> this<00:04:02.510> block

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
that but this is just what this block

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.110 
that but this is just what this block
does<00:04:03.019> all<00:04:03.290> it<00:04:03.620> is<00:04:03.739> is<00:04:03.919> it's<00:04:04.129> checking<00:04:04.489> for

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
does all it is is it's checking for

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.390 
does all it is is it's checking for
players<00:04:05.480> in<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:05.989> radius<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:06.500> 5<00:04:06.709> around<00:04:07.010> you<00:04:07.190> and

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
players in a radius of 5 around you and

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.460 
players in a radius of 5 around you and
simply<00:04:08.030> put<00:04:08.209> it's<00:04:08.359> just<00:04:08.510> teleporting<00:04:09.049> you<00:04:09.139> 7

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
simply put it's just teleporting you 7

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.530 
simply put it's just teleporting you 7
blocks<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.889> the<00:04:09.980> left<00:04:10.010> so<00:04:10.639> 7<00:04:11.030> blocks<00:04:11.209> to<00:04:11.449> the

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
blocks to the left so 7 blocks to the

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.900 
blocks to the left so 7 blocks to the
left<00:04:11.720> of<00:04:11.870> here<00:04:12.139> is<00:04:12.440> right<00:04:13.430> here<00:04:13.699> which

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
left of here is right here which

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.699 
left of here is right here which
explains<00:04:14.389> kind<00:04:14.690> of<00:04:14.780> why<00:04:14.870> I<00:04:14.900> did<00:04:15.199> the<00:04:15.319> border<00:04:15.680> I

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
explains kind of why I did the border I

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.409 
explains kind of why I did the border I
didn't<00:04:16.340> want<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.549> make<00:04:16.669> a<00:04:16.699> whole<00:04:16.970> world<00:04:17.180> this

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
didn't want to make a whole world this

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.750 
didn't want to make a whole world this
was<00:04:17.599> the<00:04:17.720> best<00:04:17.900> way<00:04:18.079> to<00:04:18.109> hide<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.799> damage<00:04:19.400> but

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
was the best way to hide the damage but

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.819 
was the best way to hide the damage but
in<00:04:20.510> terms<00:04:20.720> of<00:04:20.870> setting<00:04:21.049> it<00:04:21.199> up<00:04:21.229> all<00:04:21.440> we<00:04:21.560> have<00:04:21.709> is

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
in terms of setting it up all we have is

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.219 
in terms of setting it up all we have is
the<00:04:21.950> redstone<00:04:22.340> clock<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:22.849> then<00:04:23.180> we<00:04:23.539> just<00:04:23.840> set

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
the redstone clock and then we just set

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.909 
the redstone clock and then we just set
up<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:25.520> redstone<00:04:26.180> as

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
up the redstone as

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.540 
up the redstone as
let<00:04:27.099> me<00:04:27.219> do<00:04:27.699> that<00:04:27.939> and<00:04:28.210> then<00:04:28.680> yep<00:04:29.680> so<00:04:30.009> now<00:04:30.189> it<00:04:30.520> is

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
let me do that and then yep so now it is

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.100 
let me do that and then yep so now it is
back<00:04:30.789> to<00:04:30.999> working<00:04:31.300> if<00:04:31.360> I<00:04:31.419> can<00:04:31.569> break<00:04:31.719> my<00:04:31.780> way

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
back to working if I can break my way

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.350 
back to working if I can break my way
out<00:04:32.259> of<00:04:32.289> here<00:04:32.439> I<00:04:32.800> always<00:04:33.520> get<00:04:33.699> stuck<00:04:33.969> doing

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
out of here I always get stuck doing

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.909 
out of here I always get stuck doing
that<00:04:34.569> you<00:04:34.629> see<00:04:34.719> what<00:04:34.840> I<00:04:34.870> mean<00:04:35.020> so<00:04:35.469> that's<00:04:35.680> what

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
that you see what I mean so that's what

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.230 
that you see what I mean so that's what
happened<00:04:36.249> when<00:04:36.340> I<00:04:36.370> was<00:04:36.520> trying<00:04:36.699> to<00:04:36.819> originally

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
happened when I was trying to originally

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.700 
happened when I was trying to originally
figure<00:04:37.509> out<00:04:37.629> what<00:04:38.110> was<00:04:38.229> going<00:04:38.289> on<00:04:38.529> down<00:04:38.650> here

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
figure out what was going on down here

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.459 
figure out what was going on down here
but<00:04:38.979> yet<00:04:39.099> see<00:04:39.279> you<00:04:39.430> jump<00:04:39.669> right<00:04:39.789> on<00:04:39.969> in<00:04:40.180> and

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:40.469 
but yet see you jump right on in and

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:42.269 
but yet see you jump right on in and
teleported<00:04:41.469> in<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.620> area<00:04:41.860> I'm<00:04:42.039> gonna<00:04:42.159> put

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:42.279 
teleported in the area I'm gonna put

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:44.279 
teleported in the area I'm gonna put
this<00:04:42.400> texture<00:04:42.729> pack<00:04:42.759> back<00:04:43.120> on<00:04:43.330> okay<00:04:44.050> so<00:04:44.110> now

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
this texture pack back on okay so now

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.869 
this texture pack back on okay so now
the<00:04:44.349> important<00:04:44.860> part<00:04:45.009> which<00:04:45.249> is<00:04:45.400> getting<00:04:45.639> the

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:45.879 
the important part which is getting the

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:48.480 
the important part which is getting the
portal<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.449> turn<00:04:46.949> diagonal<00:04:47.949> or<00:04:48.159> I<00:04:48.189> should<00:04:48.370> say

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
portal to turn diagonal or I should say

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.969 
portal to turn diagonal or I should say
sideways<00:04:48.909> on<00:04:49.210> its<00:04:49.389> own<00:04:49.539> and<00:04:49.779> this<00:04:50.560> is<00:04:50.710> actually

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
sideways on its own and this is actually

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.010 
sideways on its own and this is actually
going<00:04:51.069> to<00:04:51.159> be<00:04:51.219> something<00:04:51.520> you<00:04:51.610> need<00:04:51.909> to<00:04:52.150> work<00:04:52.870> a

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
going to be something you need to work a

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.409 
going to be something you need to work a
little<00:04:53.229> bit<00:04:53.439> outside<00:04:54.009> of<00:04:54.340> Minecraft<00:04:55.120> with<00:04:55.270> you

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
little bit outside of Minecraft with you

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.629 
little bit outside of Minecraft with you
might<00:04:55.569> need<00:04:55.689> to<00:04:55.840> get<00:04:56.020> mcedit<00:04:57.009> because<00:04:57.400> we<00:04:57.580> are

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
might need to get mcedit because we are

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.320 
might need to get mcedit because we are
going<00:04:57.789> to<00:04:57.879> be<00:04:57.969> using<00:04:58.449> the<00:04:58.990> fabled<00:04:59.740> block<00:05:00.520> 36

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
going to be using the fabled block 36

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.240 
going to be using the fabled block 36
which<00:05:01.539> is<00:05:01.659> basically<00:05:02.080> an<00:05:02.409> invisible<00:05:03.129> block

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
which is basically an invisible block

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.730 
which is basically an invisible block
that<00:05:04.150> entities<00:05:04.689> cannot<00:05:05.229> pass<00:05:05.500> there<00:05:05.710> I

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
that entities cannot pass there I

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.950 
that entities cannot pass there I
believe<00:05:05.949> it<00:05:06.039> is<00:05:06.129> but<00:05:06.310> you<00:05:06.520> still<00:05:06.789> can<00:05:07.029> when<00:05:07.870> we

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
believe it is but you still can when we

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.179 
believe it is but you still can when we
press<00:05:08.169> f3<00:05:08.379> here<00:05:08.650> you'll<00:05:08.770> see<00:05:08.919> that<00:05:09.039> it<00:05:09.159> is

00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:09.189 
press f3 here you'll see that it is

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:11.909 
press f3 here you'll see that it is
called<00:05:09.430> piston<00:05:09.879> extension<00:05:10.719> now<00:05:11.560> you<00:05:11.620> should

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
called piston extension now you should

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.080 
called piston extension now you should
be<00:05:11.949> able<00:05:12.099> to<00:05:12.250> give<00:05:12.400> yourself<00:05:12.789> piston

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
be able to give yourself piston

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.490 
be able to give yourself piston
extension<00:05:13.419> either<00:05:13.779> for<00:05:13.960> command<00:05:14.259> blocks

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
extension either for command blocks

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.749 
extension either for command blocks
through<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:14.830> give<00:05:14.979> command<00:05:15.340> or<00:05:15.550> through

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 
through the give command or through

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.610 
through the give command or through
mcedit<00:05:16.270> let<00:05:16.509> me<00:05:16.599> see<00:05:16.810> give<00:05:17.740> @p<00:05:18.339> with<00:05:18.580> any<00:05:18.729> luck

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
mcedit let me see give @p with any luck

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.100 
mcedit let me see give @p with any luck
should<00:05:20.620> be<00:05:20.710> able<00:05:20.770> to<00:05:20.889> just<00:05:21.120> piston<00:05:22.120> it's

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
should be able to just piston it's

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.249 
should be able to just piston it's
hidden<00:05:23.500> so<00:05:24.089> Nancy<00:05:25.089> yeah<00:05:25.509> you<00:05:25.569> have<00:05:25.900> to<00:05:25.930> get<00:05:26.169> it

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
hidden so Nancy yeah you have to get it

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.659 
hidden so Nancy yeah you have to get it
through<00:05:26.289> mcedit<00:05:26.800> you<00:05:26.949> can't<00:05:27.159> just<00:05:27.310> type<00:05:27.460> it<00:05:27.580> in

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
through mcedit you can't just type it in

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.219 
through mcedit you can't just type it in
through<00:05:27.819> commands<00:05:28.150> it's<00:05:28.839> a<00:05:28.900> very<00:05:29.080> unique

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
through commands it's a very unique

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:30.450 
through commands it's a very unique
block<00:05:29.589> when<00:05:29.740> you<00:05:29.830> right-click<00:05:30.069> it<00:05:30.370> it

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
block when you right-click it it

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.059 
block when you right-click it it
disappears<00:05:30.879> but<00:05:31.029> apparently<00:05:31.650> having<00:05:32.650> fences

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:33.069 
disappears but apparently having fences

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:34.980 
disappears but apparently having fences
and<00:05:33.250> then<00:05:33.969> on<00:05:34.089> top<00:05:34.300> of<00:05:34.389> that<00:05:34.479> is<00:05:34.629> piston

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
and then on top of that is piston

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.019 
and then on top of that is piston
extensions<00:05:35.409> block<00:05:35.589> 36<00:05:36.009> and<00:05:36.189> then<00:05:36.279> more<00:05:36.520> fences

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:37.029 
extensions block 36 and then more fences

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:39.839 
extensions block 36 and then more fences
and<00:05:37.240> then<00:05:38.169> the<00:05:38.469> portal<00:05:39.009> blocks<00:05:39.129> itself<00:05:39.580> will

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
and then the portal blocks itself will

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:41.429 
and then the portal blocks itself will
actually<00:05:40.300> cause<00:05:40.449> them<00:05:40.539> to<00:05:40.659> connect<00:05:40.930> there<00:05:41.349> is

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:41.439 
actually cause them to connect there is

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:42.809 
actually cause them to connect there is
a<00:05:41.469> little<00:05:41.830> bit<00:05:41.919> of<00:05:42.009> a<00:05:42.039> glitch<00:05:42.279> where<00:05:42.490> I<00:05:42.550> believe

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
a little bit of a glitch where I believe

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:44.279 
a little bit of a glitch where I believe
I<00:05:43.029> don't<00:05:43.210> I<00:05:43.330> think<00:05:43.419> it's<00:05:43.689> just<00:05:43.810> time<00:05:43.990> based

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
I don't I think it's just time based

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.399 
I don't I think it's just time based
where<00:05:44.469> after<00:05:44.620> a<00:05:44.770> while<00:05:45.009> the<00:05:45.699> portals<00:05:46.089> will

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
where after a while the portals will

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.689 
where after a while the portals will
revert<00:05:47.409> to<00:05:47.589> their<00:05:47.680> normal<00:05:47.979> shape<00:05:48.009> there's

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
revert to their normal shape there's

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.179 
revert to their normal shape there's
probably<00:05:49.149> a<00:05:49.240> way<00:05:49.389> to<00:05:49.629> circumvent<00:05:50.050> this<00:05:50.620> you

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:51.189 
probably a way to circumvent this you

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:52.829 
probably a way to circumvent this you
know<00:05:51.279> having<00:05:51.580> them<00:05:51.699> spawn<00:05:52.029> in<00:05:52.270> again<00:05:52.629> on<00:05:52.659> a

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:52.839 
know having them spawn in again on a

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:55.740 
know having them spawn in again on a
timer<00:05:53.139> but<00:05:53.439> for<00:05:54.399> the<00:05:54.490> time<00:05:54.669> being<00:05:55.000> there<00:05:55.270> is<00:05:55.419> no

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
timer but for the time being there is no

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.360 
timer but for the time being there is no
way<00:05:56.110> that<00:05:56.229> I<00:05:56.349> know<00:05:56.469> of<00:05:56.649> to<00:05:56.860> fix<00:05:57.039> that<00:05:57.189> if<00:05:57.339> you

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
way that I know of to fix that if you

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.529 
way that I know of to fix that if you
