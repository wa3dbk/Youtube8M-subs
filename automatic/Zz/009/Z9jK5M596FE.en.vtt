this much hair this not relaxed and the
rest<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.840> that<00:01:21.840> look<00:01:21.990> kind<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.259> stringy<00:01:23.840> this

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
rest is that look kind of stringy this

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.100 
rest is that look kind of stringy this
is<00:01:25.490> my<00:01:26.490> dress<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.540> do<00:01:27.600> not<00:01:27.810> feel<00:01:27.869> like

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
is my dress because I do not feel like

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.649 
is my dress because I do not feel like
doing<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.710> big<00:01:28.890> chop<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.520> should<00:01:30.299> not<00:01:30.390> want<00:01:30.570> to

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
doing the big chop I should not want to

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.310 
doing the big chop I should not want to
be<00:01:30.750> involved<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.610> I'm<00:01:32.610> gonna<00:01:32.790> start<00:01:33.150> with<00:01:34.079> this

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
be involved so I'm gonna start with this

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.410 
be involved so I'm gonna start with this
and<00:01:34.740> see<00:01:35.549> how<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.820> works<00:01:37.159> and<00:01:38.159> three<00:01:38.909> weeks<00:01:39.180> how

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
and see how it works and three weeks how

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.690 
and see how it works and three weeks how
big<00:01:39.780> ahead<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.290> get<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.680> retwist<00:01:41.220> fit<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.640> I

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
big ahead and get it retwist fit that I

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.149 
big ahead and get it retwist fit that I
make<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> month<00:01:44.149> hopefully<00:01:45.149> all<00:01:45.540> those<00:01:45.750> well

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
make a month hopefully all those well

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.679 
make a month hopefully all those well
I'm<00:01:47.159> hoping<00:01:48.060> everything<00:01:48.450> works<00:01:48.899> out<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:50.490> know

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
I'm hoping everything works out you know

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.330 
I'm hoping everything works out you know
occasionally<00:01:51.689> some<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.020> them

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
occasionally some of them

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.149 
occasionally some of them
and<00:01:54.340> what<00:01:54.580> I<00:01:54.610> would<00:01:54.880> do<00:01:55.000> is<00:01:55.180> I<00:01:55.450> go<00:01:55.630> ahead<00:01:55.659> and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
and what I would do is I go ahead and

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.430 
and what I would do is I go ahead and
retwist<00:01:57.159> that<00:01:57.400> one<00:01:57.640> I<00:01:58.119> always<00:01:58.720> make<00:01:59.049> sure<00:01:59.080> you

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
retwist that one I always make sure you

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:08.120 
retwist that one I always make sure you
twist<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.040> right<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:04.350> tidy

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.360 

another<00:02:09.130> technique<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.819> did<00:02:10.119> was<00:02:10.450> I<00:02:11.160> cut<00:02:12.160> my

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
another technique I did was I cut my

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.150 
another technique I did was I cut my
hair<00:02:12.700> should<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.690> all<00:02:13.870> be<00:02:13.900> even<00:02:14.470> as<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:15.130> can

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
hair should it all be even as you can

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.400 
hair should it all be even as you can
see<00:02:15.459> they're<00:02:16.120> all<00:02:16.270> even<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.989> I<00:02:19.989> did<00:02:20.260> it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
see they're all even and I did it

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.830 
see they're all even and I did it
because<00:02:20.709> when<00:02:20.920> my<00:02:21.520> dress<00:02:21.790> get<00:02:22.000> longer<00:02:22.239> I<00:02:22.630> don't

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
because when my dress get longer I don't

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.400 
because when my dress get longer I don't
want<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.470> have<00:02:23.650> some<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.130> Wunderland<00:02:25.410> some

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
want to have some of the Wunderland some

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.060 
want to have some of the Wunderland some
longer<00:02:26.769> than<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:30.130> this<00:02:30.550> is<00:02:30.850> what<00:02:31.060> I'm<00:02:31.180> doing<00:02:31.450> I

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
longer than so this is what I'm doing I

00:02:32.070 --> 00:03:22.229 
longer than so this is what I'm doing I
can't<00:02:33.070> wash<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.580> yet<00:02:33.760> into<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.150> locks<00:02:34.360> up<00:03:21.239> from

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
can't wash it yet into it locks up from

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.270 
can't wash it yet into it locks up from
the<00:03:22.630> back

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
the back

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.979 
the back
and<00:03:24.280> hopefully<00:03:24.730> I'll<00:03:25.150> keep<00:03:25.390> you<00:03:25.540> guys<00:03:25.660> updated

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
you can start a many ways you can start

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.470 
you can start a many ways you can start
with<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.370> box<00:03:36.549> variance<00:03:36.970> that's<00:03:37.150> what<00:03:37.269> I<00:03:37.359> was

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
with the box variance that's what I was

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.539 
with the box variance that's what I was
gonna<00:03:37.600> do<00:03:37.840> first<00:03:38.079> but<00:03:38.350> I<00:03:38.500> said<00:03:38.799> let<00:03:39.100> me<00:03:39.250> try<00:03:39.489> to

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
gonna do first but I said let me try to

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.449 
gonna do first but I said let me try to
twist<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:41.200> could<00:03:41.560> do<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.920> two<00:03:42.070> strand<00:03:42.340> to

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
twist and you could do the two strand to

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:49.050 
twist and you could do the two strand to
it<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.950> you<00:03:44.950> guys<00:03:45.070> updated<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:46.950> hopefully<00:03:48.060> you

might<00:03:49.299> feel<00:03:49.600> inspired<00:03:50.049> to<00:03:50.290> travel<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.100> way

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
might feel inspired to travel the way
