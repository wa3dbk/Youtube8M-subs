what<00:00:01.060> bunions<00:00:01.360> are<00:00:01.510> is<00:00:01.630> a<00:00:01.660> deviation<00:00:02.050> of<00:00:02.770> the

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:03.610 
what bunions are is a deviation of the

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.660 
what bunions are is a deviation of the
first<00:00:03.639> metatarsal<00:00:04.000> which<00:00:04.900> is<00:00:05.110> the<00:00:05.410> bone<00:00:06.280> that

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:06.670 
first metatarsal which is the bone that

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.970 
first metatarsal which is the bone that
goes<00:00:06.880> to<00:00:07.030> your<00:00:07.090> big<00:00:07.270> toe<00:00:07.450> and<00:00:07.750> it<00:00:08.500> causes<00:00:08.770> a

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
goes to your big toe and it causes a

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.930 
goes to your big toe and it causes a
bump<00:00:09.310> on<00:00:09.490> the<00:00:09.640> inside<00:00:10.030> of<00:00:10.060> your<00:00:10.480> of<00:00:11.110> your<00:00:11.380> foot

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
bump on the inside of your of your foot

bump on the inside of your of your foot
right<00:00:12.940> at<00:00:13.059> the<00:00:13.150> big<00:00:13.300> toe<00:00:13.480> they<00:00:14.170> tend<00:00:14.830> to<00:00:14.950> be

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
right at the big toe they tend to be

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.220 
right at the big toe they tend to be
more<00:00:15.309> common<00:00:15.760> as<00:00:16.180> I<00:00:16.299> said<00:00:16.510> in<00:00:16.660> women<00:00:16.960> than<00:00:17.080> in

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
more common as I said in women than in

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.370

men<00:00:17.260> and<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.850> reflects<00:00:19.449> partly<00:00:19.869> it's<00:00:19.990> aware

that women wear it's a common it's a

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.490 
that women wear it's a common it's a
problem<00:00:24.250> largely<00:00:25.060> that<00:00:25.779> I<00:00:25.810> see<00:00:26.170> in

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
problem largely that I see in

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.800 
problem largely that I see in
middle-aged<00:00:27.460> women<00:00:27.760> but<00:00:28.119> there's<00:00:28.390> a<00:00:28.449> subgroup

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
middle-aged women but there's a subgroup

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.380 
middle-aged women but there's a subgroup
of<00:00:29.170> patients<00:00:29.380> or<00:00:29.949> teenagers<00:00:30.820> and<00:00:30.970> so<00:00:31.119> forth

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
of patients or teenagers and so forth

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.930

who who have this problem as well the
the<00:00:33.969> issue<00:00:34.510> is<00:00:34.989> that<00:00:35.019> the<00:00:35.559> first<00:00:35.829> metatarsal

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:36.159 
the issue is that the first metatarsal

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:38.459 
the issue is that the first metatarsal
which<00:00:36.640> is<00:00:36.969> the<00:00:37.120> bone<00:00:37.719> that<00:00:37.749> goes<00:00:38.139> from<00:00:38.319> the

which is the bone that goes from the

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.389 
which is the bone that goes from the
middle<00:00:38.679> of<00:00:38.739> your<00:00:38.800> foot<00:00:39.100> to<00:00:39.789> your<00:00:39.909> big<00:00:40.030> toe<00:00:40.059> is

middle of your foot to your big toe is

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.119 
middle of your foot to your big toe is
deviated<00:00:42.399> out<00:00:42.579> of<00:00:42.789> position<00:00:43.389> there's<00:00:43.629> a

deviated out of position there's a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.079 
deviated out of position there's a
inheritance<00:00:45.129> component<00:00:46.059> to<00:00:46.239> this<00:00:46.420> and<00:00:46.690> it's

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
inheritance component to this and it's

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:53.750 
inheritance component to this and it's
exacerbated<00:00:49.089> by<00:00:49.449> by<00:00:50.440> shoe<00:00:50.710> wear<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.929> patients

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
symptoms that they have from this

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.719 
symptoms that they have from this
problem<00:00:58.420> meaning<00:00:59.409> I<00:00:59.559> can<00:00:59.829> see<00:01:00.190> patients<00:01:00.399> who

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
problem meaning I can see patients who

have a mild bunion that may be pretty
uncomfortable<00:01:03.069> and<00:01:03.760> I<00:01:04.330> may<00:01:04.510> see<00:01:04.570> someone

surgery the reason to operate on bunions

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.220 
surgery the reason to operate on bunions
is<00:01:18.550> basically<00:01:19.480> that<00:01:19.690> they<00:01:19.840> failed

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
is basically that they failed

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.260 
is basically that they failed
non-operative<00:01:21.040> therapy<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:21.670> what<00:01:22.150> is

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
non-operative therapy and what is

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.170 
non-operative therapy and what is
non-operative<00:01:22.810> therapy<00:01:23.170> it's<00:01:24.090> wearing<00:01:25.090> the

appropriate types of shoes it's
sometimes<00:01:28.420> an<00:01:28.600> arch<00:01:28.750> support<00:01:29.200> can<00:01:29.440> be<00:01:29.470> helpful

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
sometimes an arch support can be helpful

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.120 
sometimes an arch support can be helpful
basically<00:01:31.600> not<00:01:31.780> squishing<00:01:32.410> your<00:01:32.560> foot<00:01:32.830> into<00:01:32.980> a

basically not squishing your foot into a
shoe<00:01:33.460> that<00:01:33.670> it<00:01:33.790> doesn't<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:35.290> it<00:01:35.410> shouldn't

shoe that it doesn't that it shouldn't
be<00:01:35.920> in<00:01:36.010> now<00:01:36.670> we<00:01:37.060> live<00:01:37.240> in<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.360> real<00:01:37.540> world<00:01:37.600> and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
be in now we live in the real world and

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.880 
be in now we live in the real world and
I'm<00:01:38.200> not<00:01:38.770> going<00:01:38.980> to<00:01:39.040> ask<00:01:39.190> a<00:01:40.260> 45<00:01:41.260> year<00:01:41.410> old<00:01:41.530> woman

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
I'm not going to ask a 45 year old woman

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.649 
I'm not going to ask a 45 year old woman
to<00:01:42.070> wear<00:01:42.250> space<00:01:42.520> shoes<00:01:42.820> I<00:01:43.000> mean<00:01:43.150> that<00:01:43.330> would<00:01:43.540> be

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
to wear space shoes I mean that would be

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.320 
to wear space shoes I mean that would be
absurd<00:01:43.780> so<00:01:44.350> getting<00:01:45.310> into<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.670> reasonably

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
absurd so getting into a reasonably

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.520 
absurd so getting into a reasonably
fitting<00:01:46.720> shoe<00:01:47.220> comfortably<00:01:48.220> is<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.909> goal<00:01:49.530> so

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
fitting shoe comfortably is the goal so

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.620 
fitting shoe comfortably is the goal so
the<00:01:50.560> question<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:51.040> how<00:01:51.220> do<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.480> how<00:01:52.480> do<00:01:52.540> you

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
the question is how do you how do you

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.970 
the question is how do you how do you
correct<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:53.020> book<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.290> bunion<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.650> what<00:01:53.830> are<00:01:53.920> the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
correct a book a bunion and what are the

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.219 
correct a book a bunion and what are the
surgical<00:01:54.310> principles<00:01:54.610> involved<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.480> the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
surgical principles involved and the

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.380 
surgical principles involved and the
answer<00:01:56.590> is<00:01:56.770> that<00:01:57.250> if<00:01:57.460> you<00:01:57.580> again<00:01:58.000> if<00:01:58.150> you<00:01:58.240> look

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
answer is that if you again if you look

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.030 
answer is that if you again if you look
at<00:01:58.510> a<00:01:58.570> normal<00:01:58.750> foot<00:01:59.170> which<00:01:59.440> is<00:01:59.470> this<00:01:59.770> model

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
at a normal foot which is this model

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.250 
at a normal foot which is this model
you'll<00:02:00.370> see<00:02:00.580> that<00:02:00.729> this<00:02:00.940> bone<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:01.690> this<00:02:02.050> bone

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
you'll see that this bone and this bone

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.080 
you'll see that this bone and this bone
are<00:02:02.440> parallel<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:02.860> so<00:02:03.190> that's<00:02:03.340> what<00:02:03.610> you're

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
are parallel and so that's what you're

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.700 
are parallel and so that's what you're
trying<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.540> correct<00:02:04.840> because<00:02:05.110> in<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:05.500> bunion

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
trying to correct because in a bunion

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.639 
trying to correct because in a bunion
this<00:02:06.430> first<00:02:06.700> metatarsal<00:02:07.060> is<00:02:07.690> deviated<00:02:08.439> that

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
this first metatarsal is deviated that

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.149 
this first metatarsal is deviated that
way<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.749> couple<00:02:11.049> of<00:02:11.109> x-rays<00:02:11.499> that<00:02:12.010> I'm

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 
way so the couple of x-rays that I'm

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.410 
way so the couple of x-rays that I'm
going<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.370> show<00:02:12.489> you<00:02:12.519> there

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
going to show you there

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.990 
going to show you there
you'll<00:02:14.200> notice<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.590> on<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.950> left<00:02:15.220> there's<00:02:15.849> a

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
you'll notice that on the left there's a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.699 
you'll notice that on the left there's a
bunion<00:02:16.390> that's<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.750> little<00:02:16.930> milder<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.500> on<00:02:17.620> the

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
bunion that's a little milder and on the

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.020 
bunion that's a little milder and on the
right<00:02:17.890> there's<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.340> bunion<00:02:18.520> that's<00:02:18.790> more

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
right there's a bunion that's more

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.140 
right there's a bunion that's more
severe<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:20.440> for<00:02:20.739> me<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.459> bunion<00:02:21.880> on<00:02:22.030> the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
severe so for me the the bunion on the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.570 
severe so for me the the bunion on the
left<00:02:22.390> gets<00:02:23.200> what<00:02:23.440> I<00:02:23.470> call<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.800> Chevron<00:02:24.220> Aiken

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
left gets what I call a Chevron Aiken

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.520 
left gets what I call a Chevron Aiken
procedure<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.840> Chevron<00:02:26.200> Aiken

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
procedure and the Chevron Aiken

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.740 
procedure and the Chevron Aiken
procedure<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.700> procedure<00:02:27.910> that's<00:02:28.480> done

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
procedure is a procedure that's done

under local it's in and out the same day
and<00:02:33.540> what<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.569> do<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:35.080> shave<00:02:35.380> off<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.709> edge<00:02:35.830> of

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
and what I do is shave off the edge of

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.970 
and what I do is shave off the edge of
the<00:02:36.069> bone<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.550> cut<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.390> bone<00:02:37.569> shifted<00:02:38.140> over<00:02:38.260> in

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
the bone I cut the bone shifted over in

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.770 
the bone I cut the bone shifted over in
in<00:02:39.459> this<00:02:39.640> particular<00:02:39.819> procedure<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.569> use<00:02:40.750> a

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
in this particular procedure I use a

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.660 
in this particular procedure I use a
dissolvable<00:02:41.290> pin<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.890> then<00:02:42.400> make<00:02:42.550> another

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
dissolvable pin and then make another

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.640 
dissolvable pin and then make another
little<00:02:43.030> cut<00:02:43.239> just<00:02:43.750> on<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.050> other<00:02:44.140> side<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.560> the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650

little cut just on the other side of the
joint<00:02:44.890> cause<00:02:45.069> an<00:02:45.220> incan<00:02:45.519> procedure<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.239> you

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
joint cause an incan procedure and you

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.229 
joint cause an incan procedure and you
can<00:02:46.930> see<00:02:47.140> from<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.440> post-op<00:02:47.920> x-ray<00:02:48.430> on<00:02:48.730> the

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
can see from the post-op x-ray on the

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.600 
can see from the post-op x-ray on the
left<00:02:49.480> that<00:02:49.989> she's<00:02:50.260> gotten<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.620> nice<00:02:50.860> correction

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
left that she's gotten a nice correction

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.390 
left that she's gotten a nice correction
that's<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.540> very<00:02:52.900> appropriate<00:02:53.140> procedure<00:02:54.010> for

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
that's a very appropriate procedure for

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.330 
that's a very appropriate procedure for
a<00:02:54.430> mild<00:02:54.819> or<00:02:55.060> moderate<00:02:55.390> bunion<00:02:55.930> if<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:57.069> look<00:02:57.220> at

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
a mild or moderate bunion if you look at

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.370 
a mild or moderate bunion if you look at
the<00:02:57.459> other<00:02:57.640> side<00:02:57.940> in<00:02:58.480> addition<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.959> she<00:02:59.260> has<00:02:59.350> a

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
the other side in addition to she has a

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.220 
the other side in addition to she has a
couple<00:02:59.620> of<00:02:59.709> hammer<00:02:59.860> toes<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:01.870> forth<00:03:02.080> which

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
couple of hammer toes and so forth which

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.800 
couple of hammer toes and so forth which
is<00:03:02.350> a<00:03:02.380> different<00:03:02.709> discussion<00:03:03.510> but<00:03:04.510> what<00:03:04.690> I've

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
is a different discussion but what I've

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.720 
is a different discussion but what I've
done<00:03:05.019> is<00:03:05.319> I've<00:03:05.530> gone<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.040> base<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.670> the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
done is I've gone to the base of the

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.210 
done is I've gone to the base of the
first<00:03:06.910> metatarsal<00:03:07.330> which<00:03:07.870> is<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.739> base<00:03:08.980> of

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
first metatarsal which is the base of

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.160 
first metatarsal which is the base of
this<00:03:09.340> bone<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:09.910> you'll<00:03:10.480> notice<00:03:10.840> on<00:03:11.019> the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
this bone and you'll notice on the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.650 
this bone and you'll notice on the
post-op<00:03:11.739> x-ray<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:13.030> if<00:03:13.120> there's<00:03:13.299> a<00:03:13.360> metal

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
post-op x-ray and if there's a metal

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.180 
post-op x-ray and if there's a metal
plate<00:03:13.900> there<00:03:14.170> with<00:03:14.290> some<00:03:14.470> screws<00:03:14.799> and<00:03:15.010> what<00:03:15.160> I

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
plate there with some screws and what I

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.340 
plate there with some screws and what I
did<00:03:15.430> is<00:03:15.610> cut<00:03:15.910> that<00:03:16.120> bone<00:03:16.420> more<00:03:16.900> towards<00:03:17.260> the

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
did is cut that bone more towards the

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.780 
did is cut that bone more towards the
base<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:18.660> made<00:03:19.660> it<00:03:19.870> parallel<00:03:20.560> made<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.609> is

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
base and made it parallel made that is

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.880 
base and made it parallel made that is
the<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.359> great<00:03:22.630> toe<00:03:23.140> first<00:03:23.560> metatarsal

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
the the great toe first metatarsal

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.280 
the the great toe first metatarsal
parallel<00:03:24.730> with<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.030> second<00:03:25.390> metatarsal<00:03:25.989> in

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
parallel with the second metatarsal in

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.710 
parallel with the second metatarsal in
addition<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.100> do<00:03:27.160> some<00:03:27.459> soft<00:03:27.700> tissue<00:03:27.880> balancing

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
addition I do some soft tissue balancing

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.599 
addition I do some soft tissue balancing
at<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.590> big<00:03:29.739> toe<00:03:29.950> and<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.250> gets<00:03:30.489> an

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
at the big toe and that gets an

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.580 
at the big toe and that gets an
excellent<00:03:31.000> correction<00:03:31.660> for<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:31.930> more<00:03:32.170> severe

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
excellent correction for a more severe

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.060 
excellent correction for a more severe
bunion<00:03:33.239> those<00:03:34.239> two<00:03:34.450> procedures<00:03:34.780> correct<00:03:35.350> as<00:03:36.010> I

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
bunion those two procedures correct as I

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.340 
bunion those two procedures correct as I
would<00:03:36.370> as<00:03:36.670> I<00:03:36.850> said<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.600> vast<00:03:37.750> majority<00:03:38.320> of

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
would as I said the vast majority of

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.289 
would as I said the vast majority of
patients<00:03:38.739> I<00:03:38.769> should<00:03:38.950> also<00:03:39.070> add<00:03:39.280> that<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.700> both

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
patients I should also add that the both

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.080 
patients I should also add that the both
procedures<00:03:40.870> are<00:03:41.019> done<00:03:41.109> on<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.290> local<00:03:42.090> with

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
procedures are done on the local with

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.599 
procedures are done on the local with
some<00:03:43.299> IV<00:03:43.600> sedation<00:03:44.040> people<00:03:45.040> don't<00:03:45.220> like<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.489> be

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
some IV sedation people don't like to be

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.430 
some IV sedation people don't like to be
wide<00:03:45.850> awake<00:03:46.030> for<00:03:46.359> this<00:03:46.510> but<00:03:46.750> they<00:03:46.900> like<00:03:47.079> to<00:03:47.290> be

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
wide awake for this but they like to be

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.009 
wide awake for this but they like to be
wide<00:03:47.769> awake<00:03:47.980> right<00:03:48.190> after<00:03:48.519> I'm<00:03:48.609> done<00:03:49.019> the

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
wide awake right after I'm done the

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.539 
wide awake right after I'm done the
question<00:03:50.500> is<00:03:50.590> what's<00:03:50.859> the<00:03:50.980> recovery<00:03:51.220> like

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
question is what's the recovery like

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.970 
question is what's the recovery like
from<00:03:51.820> from<00:03:52.780> bunion<00:03:52.989> surgery<00:03:53.140> and<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.739> course

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
from from bunion surgery and of course

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.080 
from from bunion surgery and of course
there's<00:03:54.190> some<00:03:54.370> variability<00:03:54.760> between

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
there's some variability between

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.009 
there's some variability between
patients<00:03:55.930> but<00:03:56.650> in<00:03:56.890> general<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:58.810> goes

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
patients but in general it goes

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.840 
patients but in general it goes
something<00:03:59.290> like<00:03:59.470> this<00:03:59.799> and<00:04:00.069> I<00:04:00.160> generally<00:04:00.549> will

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
something like this and I generally will

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.789 
something like this and I generally will
write<00:04:01.120> it<00:04:01.239> put<00:04:01.600> it<00:04:01.690> in<00:04:01.780> writing<00:04:02.109> for<00:04:02.260> patients

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
write it put it in writing for patients

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.770 
write it put it in writing for patients
and<00:04:03.010> tell<00:04:03.760> them<00:04:03.910> this<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.359> what<00:04:04.540> you<00:04:04.660> can

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
and tell them this is what you can

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.500 
and tell them this is what you can
expect<00:04:04.900> in<00:04:05.470> terms<00:04:05.650> of<00:04:05.829> your<00:04:05.950> recovery<00:04:06.510> if

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
expect in terms of your recovery if

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.150 
expect in terms of your recovery if
we're<00:04:07.780> doing<00:04:07.930> one<00:04:08.290> foot<00:04:08.560> you'll<00:04:08.769> be<00:04:08.859> in<00:04:09.010> and
