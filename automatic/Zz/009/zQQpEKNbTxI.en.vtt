 I like him people 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.609
 but for me it is true 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.449
 the eagle people don't like me 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.470

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.999
 and he is fine with us 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.880
 briefly 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.439
 just a minute later 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.439
 reiteration 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.380
 so no need to invent from there 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.240
 however, the reasons for this lie reasons 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.490
 which perhaps share a massive 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.030
 and this is not very low tolerance for 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.070
 double under the walls 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.070
 buying bullshit 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.130
 and everyone wants to tell and his 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.890
 studios garbage 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.810
 many of them don't know when 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.680
 stop talking talked to this 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.580

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.790
 verbal diarrhea 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.080
 who knows when the conversation is over what 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.940
 this is the perfect day of work that i 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.930
 saw things that not even remotely 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.900
 are interested 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.150

 all these six ago I think 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.420
 it looks like 6 is about six years ago six 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.149
 or seven times opportunity 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:30.490
 be 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.220
 judging by the reaction to 7 more than 6 less 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.500
 the stronger 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.120

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.740
 maybe it was eight years ago 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.520
 it was rather in the two thousandth 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.690

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.279
 I'm trying to use language 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:46.189

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.119
 Solovyov's questions 

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:27.550
