Delta knobs that are the saying that I
would<00:00:34.829> get<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.100> done<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:35.579> done<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:36.750> can

would get it done and it's done we can

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.869 
would get it done and it's done we can
find<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.230> small<00:00:37.469> notch<00:00:37.770> here<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.610> this

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
find a small notch here on this

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.080 
find a small notch here on this
particular<00:00:39.480> mode<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> you

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
particular mode what you can do is you

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.560 
particular mode what you can do is you
can<00:00:42.120> use<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.960> rotate<00:00:44.090> if<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.239> would<00:00:45.390> want

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
can use this to rotate if you would want

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.900 
can use this to rotate if you would want
to<00:00:45.600> rotate<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.200> or<00:00:46.860> move<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> sliders<00:00:47.789> off

to rotate the or move the sliders off

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.610 
to rotate the or move the sliders off
and<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.210> that's<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.110> reason<00:00:49.230> why<00:00:49.590> this

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
and on that's the reason why this

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.119 
and on that's the reason why this
launches<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.120> lobs<00:00:51.390> having<00:00:51.809> done<00:00:52.129> now

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
launches on this lobs having done now

launches on this lobs having done now
I'm<00:00:54.120> really<00:00:54.539> not<00:00:54.660> able<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.020> get<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> clear

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
I'm really not able to get a clear

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
I'm really not able to get a clear
picture<00:00:56.600> to<00:00:57.600> show<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.379> demo<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.010> how<00:00:59.250> this

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
picture to show you a demo of how this

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
actually focusing on this particular

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.399 
actually focusing on this particular
park<00:01:05.570> here<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:08.540> hopefully<00:01:09.540> I'll<00:01:09.900> be<00:01:09.930> able<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
park here and hopefully I'll be able to

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.830 
park here and hopefully I'll be able to
give<00:01:10.590> something<00:01:10.619> some<00:01:11.460> kind<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.210> good

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
give something some kind of a good

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.219 
give something some kind of a good
reference<00:01:13.049> for<00:01:13.350> your<00:01:13.710> further<00:01:14.159> future<00:01:14.790> bind

so<00:01:16.229> I'm<00:01:16.590> going<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.860> try<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.369> turn<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.000> knob

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
so I'm going to try and turn this knob

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.929 
so I'm going to try and turn this knob
which<00:01:19.049> actually<00:01:19.350> moves<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.520> slide<00:01:20.759> of

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
which actually moves the slide of

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.300 
which actually moves the slide of
fronting<00:01:21.299> back<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.500> particular<00:01:22.710> slide

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
fronting back and this particular slide

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.730 
fronting back and this particular slide
or<00:01:23.640> not<00:01:23.880> moves<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> left<00:01:25.320> or<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.590> right

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
or not moves it to the left or the right

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.429 
or not moves it to the left or the right
this<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.700> forward<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.299> backward<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:28.350> is

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
this is forward and backward that is

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.390 
this is forward and backward that is
left<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.860> right<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:30.259> let<00:01:31.259> me<00:01:31.290> try<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:32.159> show<00:01:32.340> you

something<00:01:32.700> if<00:01:33.299> there<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.750> shake<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:34.470> that

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
something if there is a shake here that

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.399 
something if there is a shake here that
you<00:01:35.070> will<00:01:35.220> be<00:01:35.250> able<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.610> see<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> screen

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
you will be able to see on the screen

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.050 
you will be able to see on the screen
that<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.530> because<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.070> crappy<00:01:38.520> tripod

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
that is because of the crappy tripod

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.180 
that is because of the crappy tripod
that<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.270> have

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
that I have

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.340 
that I have
not<00:01:40.460> because<00:01:40.760> of<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:41.000> slide<00:01:41.240> a<00:01:41.270> moment<00:01:41.750> this

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
not because of the slide a moment this

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.350 
not because of the slide a moment this
is<00:01:42.500> brief<00:01:42.740> like<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:42.950> tank<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:44.060> functions

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
is brief like a tank and it functions

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.780 
is brief like a tank and it functions
like<00:01:44.630> a<00:01:44.750> time<00:01:45.790> so<00:01:46.790> let<00:01:47.270> me<00:01:47.360> try<00:01:48.310> so<00:01:49.310> trying<00:01:49.640> to

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
like a time so let me try so trying to

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.910 
like a time so let me try so trying to
move<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.210> camera<00:01:50.420> bit<00:01:50.810> closer<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:52.270> bark

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
move the camera bit closer to the bark

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.830 
move the camera bit closer to the bark
as<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.130> can<00:01:55.310> see<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:56.060> bark<00:01:56.300> is<00:01:56.420> slightly

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
as you can see the bark is slightly

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.830 
as you can see the bark is slightly
going<00:01:57.350> out<00:01:57.500> of<00:01:57.530> focus<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:59.300> projection<00:01:59.720> is

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
going out of focus the projection is

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.530 
going out of focus the projection is
going<00:02:00.050> on<00:02:00.140> a<00:02:00.200> focused<00:02:04.120> I'm<00:02:05.120> going<00:02:05.300> to<00:02:05.390> try<00:02:05.510> to

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
going on a focused I'm going to try to

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.810 
going on a focused I'm going to try to
take<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.780> couple<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.200> shots<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:06.830> shorts<00:02:07.700> in

okay<00:02:28.820> there's<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.630> shot<00:02:30.550> I'm<00:02:31.550> gonna<00:02:31.790> move<00:02:32.000> the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
okay there's a shot I'm gonna move the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.410 
okay there's a shot I'm gonna move the
place<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:33.680> camera<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.190> sliders<00:02:34.640> slightly

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
place the camera the sliders slightly

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:44.740 
place the camera the sliders slightly
backward

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.080 

now<00:02:45.320> you<00:02:45.380> can<00:02:45.620> see<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.220> petition<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.730> bark

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
now you can see the petition of the bark

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.290 
now you can see the petition of the bark
is<00:02:47.330> actually<00:02:48.020> out<00:02:48.110> of<00:02:48.290> focus<00:02:49.000> just<00:02:50.000> waiting

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
is actually out of focus just waiting

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
is actually out of focus just waiting
for<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.480> camera<00:02:50.810> shake<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.200> stuff<00:02:56.320> the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
for the camera shake the stuff the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.060 
for the camera shake the stuff the
second<00:02:57.650> shot<00:02:57.860> is<00:02:58.010> taking<00:02:59.800> I'll<00:03:00.800> get<00:03:00.980> the

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
second shot is taking I'll get the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.120 
second shot is taking I'll get the
camera<00:03:01.430> was<00:03:01.490> the<00:03:01.640> way<00:03:01.730> back<00:03:02.000> now<00:03:02.920> by<00:03:03.920> turning

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
camera was the way back now by turning

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:12.460 
camera was the way back now by turning
in<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:05.060> snow<00:03:05.300> of<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.450> couple<00:03:05.720> of<00:03:05.780> times<00:03:11.410> now<00:03:12.410> you

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
in the snow of a couple of times now you

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.680 
in the snow of a couple of times now you
can<00:03:12.650> see<00:03:12.890> them<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.790> backbone<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.360> bark<00:03:14.570> is

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
can see them the backbone of the bark is

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.080 
can see them the backbone of the bark is
completely<00:03:15.260> out<00:03:15.350> of<00:03:15.380> focus<00:03:15.709> other<00:03:16.700> than<00:03:16.880> the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
completely out of focus other than the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:25.820 
completely out of focus other than the
projection<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.050> the<00:03:18.170> foreground

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.930 

going<00:03:26.830> to<00:03:26.920> take<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.310> couple<00:03:27.340> of<00:03:27.700> matches

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
going to take it a couple of matches

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.500 
going to take it a couple of matches
back<00:03:28.330> again<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:30.640> get<00:03:30.790> everything<00:03:31.120> all<00:03:31.420> the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
back again to get everything all the

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:44.700 
back again to get everything all the
focus

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.250 

I'm<00:03:45.710> not<00:03:45.950> able<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.280> focus<00:03:46.820> the<00:03:47.600> image<00:03:47.720> clearly

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
I'm not able to focus the image clearly

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.980 
I'm not able to focus the image clearly
over<00:03:48.620> here<00:03:49.360> hopefully<00:03:50.360> you<00:03:50.450> can<00:03:50.570> find<00:03:50.630> the

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
over here hopefully you can find the

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.630 
over here hopefully you can find the
sample<00:03:51.350> images<00:03:51.590> interesting<00:03:52.570> so<00:03:54.580> apart<00:03:55.580> from

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
sample images interesting so apart from

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.040 
sample images interesting so apart from
this<00:03:55.850> construction<00:03:56.270> there<00:03:56.540> is<00:03:56.630> a<00:03:56.660> little<00:03:56.840> bit

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
this construction there is a little bit

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.790 
this construction there is a little bit
of<00:03:57.080> the<00:03:57.740> maintenance<00:03:57.950> part<00:03:58.430> that<00:03:58.610> needs<00:03:58.760> to<00:03:59.030> be

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
of the maintenance part that needs to be

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.670 
of the maintenance part that needs to be
Infante<00:04:00.800> of<00:04:01.100> people<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:02.420> sliders<00:04:02.870> actually

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
Infante of people the sliders actually

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.650 
Infante of people the sliders actually
donate<00:04:04.040> any<00:04:04.340> kind<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.760> lubrication<00:04:05.240> because

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
donate any kind of lubrication because

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.800 
donate any kind of lubrication because
their<00:04:05.840> decision<00:04:06.260> win<00:04:06.470> so<00:04:07.430> if<00:04:08.210> there<00:04:08.420> is<00:04:08.540> dust

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
their decision win so if there is dust

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.960 
their decision win so if there is dust
in<00:04:09.020> between<00:04:09.350> this<00:04:09.590> slider<00:04:10.130> this<00:04:10.460> main<00:04:10.730> slide<00:04:10.910> a

in between this slider this main slide a

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.050 
in between this slider this main slide a
body<00:04:11.270> or<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.900> slider<00:04:12.110> itself<00:04:12.650> that<00:04:13.550> may<00:04:13.850> cause

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
body or the slider itself that may cause

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.300 
body or the slider itself that may cause
a<00:04:14.090> problem<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:15.320> easiest<00:04:15.710> of<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:15.920> simple

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
a problem the easiest of the simple

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.729 
a problem the easiest of the simple
solution<00:04:16.430> would<00:04:16.880> be<00:04:16.940> to<00:04:17.090> add<00:04:17.480> or<00:04:17.690> drop<00:04:17.840> just<00:04:18.620> a

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
solution would be to add or drop just a

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.340 
solution would be to add or drop just a
single<00:04:19.010> drop<00:04:19.400> of<00:04:19.610> motor<00:04:20.299> oil<00:04:20.420> automobile<00:04:21.170> oil

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
single drop of motor oil automobile oil

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.680 
single drop of motor oil automobile oil
don't<00:04:21.799> try<00:04:21.950> to<00:04:21.980> use<00:04:22.250> coconut<00:04:22.430> oil<00:04:22.700> here<00:04:23.000> it

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
don't try to use coconut oil here it

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.770 
don't try to use coconut oil here it
would<00:04:23.870> blacken<00:04:24.170> the<00:04:24.470> aluminium<00:04:25.540> just<00:04:26.540> grew

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
would blacken the aluminium just grew

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.890 
would blacken the aluminium just grew
roots<00:04:26.840> here<00:04:27.290> at<00:04:27.740> least<00:04:28.010> once<00:04:28.100> in<00:04:28.730> a<00:04:28.760> 6<00:04:29.150> 6<00:04:29.330> months

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
roots here at least once in a 6 6 months

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.640 
roots here at least once in a 6 6 months
or<00:04:30.050> so<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:31.460> can<00:04:31.640> just<00:04:31.670> add<00:04:31.940> another<00:04:31.970> drop<00:04:32.510> of

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
or so you can just add another drop of

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.810 
or so you can just add another drop of
motor<00:04:33.650> oil<00:04:33.770> that<00:04:34.070> is<00:04:34.130> well<00:04:34.370> it<00:04:34.550> needs<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:36.820> rest

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
motor oil that is well it needs and rest

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.430 
motor oil that is well it needs and rest
wise<00:04:38.090> I<00:04:38.420> don't<00:04:38.660> think<00:04:38.870> so<00:04:38.990> there<00:04:39.140> is<00:04:39.230> anything

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
wise I don't think so there is anything

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.500 
wise I don't think so there is anything
else<00:04:39.710> that<00:04:39.860> needs<00:04:40.250> to<00:04:40.430> be<00:04:40.580> maintained<00:04:41.180> on<00:04:41.330> this

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
else that needs to be maintained on this

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.820 
else that needs to be maintained on this
particular<00:04:42.400> focus<00:04:43.400> lighter<00:04:44.230> so<00:04:45.230> thanks<00:04:45.740> for

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
particular focus lighter so thanks for

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.160
