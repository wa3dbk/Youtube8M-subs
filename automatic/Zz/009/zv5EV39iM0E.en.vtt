00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
had mine for a little bit over six

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.709 
had mine for a little bit over six
months<00:00:08.370> now<00:00:08.550> so<00:00:08.910> as<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.150> can<00:00:09.269> tell<00:00:09.480> it's

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
months now so as you can tell it's

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.900 
months now so as you can tell it's
pretty<00:00:09.809> worn<00:00:10.469> out<00:00:10.740> but<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.219> still<00:00:11.429> has<00:00:11.670> this

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
pretty worn out but it still has this

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.600 
pretty worn out but it still has this
shape<00:00:12.300> so<00:00:13.049> this<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.710> large<00:00:14.040> one<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.490> I

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
shape so this is the large one and I

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.950 
shape so this is the large one and I

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
believe that Jeff the studded ones are

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
believe that Jeff the studded ones are
discontinued<00:00:18.960> but<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.380> still<00:00:19.619> get<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
discontinued but you can still get the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.750 
discontinued but you can still get the
normal<00:00:20.310> ones<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:21.199> stores<00:00:22.199> or<00:00:22.619> whatever<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.279> I

phone<00:01:58.840> in<00:01:58.870> here<00:01:59.260> and<00:01:59.470> then<00:01:59.920> my<00:02:00.100> pens<00:02:00.550> or

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
phone in here and then my pens or

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.450 
phone in here and then my pens or
pencils<00:02:00.940> are<00:02:01.930> just<00:02:02.290> little<00:02:02.620> small<00:02:02.800> stuff<00:02:03.250> I

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
pencils are just little small stuff I

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.090 
pencils are just little small stuff I
don't<00:02:03.760> want<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.210> lose<00:02:04.750> in<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.440> big<00:02:05.650> pockets

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
don't want to lose in the big pockets

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.680 
don't want to lose in the big pockets
and<00:02:06.580> then<00:02:06.820> on<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.210> size<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.960> has<00:02:08.410> these<00:02:09.160> water

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
and then on the size it has these water

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.330 
and then on the size it has these water
bottle<00:02:10.690> thing<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.500> can<00:02:11.680> put<00:02:11.920> water<00:02:12.100> bottles

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
bottle thing you can put water bottles

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.280 
bottle thing you can put water bottles
in<00:02:12.670> here<00:02:12.910> but<00:02:13.150> it's<00:02:13.330> not<00:02:13.390> really<00:02:13.480> suggestible

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
in here but it's not really suggestible

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.320 
in here but it's not really suggestible
so<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:15.190> plain<00:02:16.140> 16-ounce<00:02:17.140> water<00:02:17.730> would<00:02:18.730> fit<00:02:19.120> in

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
so a plain 16-ounce water would fit in

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.970 
so a plain 16-ounce water would fit in
here<00:02:19.360> but<00:02:19.930> anything<00:02:20.560> bigger

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
here but anything bigger

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.210 
here but anything bigger
it<00:02:21.310> probably<00:02:21.670> won't<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:23.290> for<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.590> dimensions

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
it probably won't so for the dimensions

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.330 
it probably won't so for the dimensions
of<00:02:24.430> this<00:02:24.760> backpack<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.570> width<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:26.110> this<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.530> 11

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
of this backpack the width of this is 11

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.020 
of this backpack the width of this is 11
inches<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:28.450> height<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.680> 16<00:02:30.550> inches

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
inches the height of this is 16 inches

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.010 
inches the height of this is 16 inches
and<00:02:31.330> then<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.990> depth<00:02:32.320> is<00:02:32.890> um<00:02:33.630> six<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.990> half

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
and then the depth is um six and a half

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.060 
and then the depth is um six and a half
inches<00:02:35.830> so<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.790> can<00:02:37.060> fit<00:02:37.420> not<00:02:37.990> a<00:02:38.320> lot<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:38.830> stuff

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
inches so it can fit not a lot of stuff

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.950 
inches so it can fit not a lot of stuff
they<00:02:39.250> can<00:02:39.430> fit<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.670> 13<00:02:40.390> inch<00:02:40.690> MacBook<00:02:42.960> Pro

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
they can fit a 13 inch MacBook Pro

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.800 
they can fit a 13 inch MacBook Pro
laptop<00:02:44.800> if<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:45.160> guys<00:02:45.460> want<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:46.000> fit<00:02:46.270> that<00:02:46.540> in

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
laptop if you guys want to fit that in

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.190 
laptop if you guys want to fit that in
so<00:02:47.740> yeah<00:02:47.950> this<00:02:48.280> that's<00:02:48.790> pretty<00:02:49.300> much<00:02:49.540> it

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
so yeah this that's pretty much it

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.950 
so yeah this that's pretty much it
reaches<00:02:51.070> its<00:02:51.310> limit<00:02:51.610> um<00:02:52.060> if<00:02:52.420> you're<00:02:52.540> gonna<00:02:52.690> put

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
reaches its limit um if you're gonna put

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.240 
reaches its limit um if you're gonna put
this<00:02:53.080> in<00:02:53.290> here<00:02:53.470> it's<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.800> little<00:02:53.920> bit<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.190> a

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
this in here it's a little bit of a

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.710 
this in here it's a little bit of a
struggle<00:02:54.520> so<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.800> sit<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:57.100> I<00:02:57.670> believe<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.540> can

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
struggle so I sit and I believe you can

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.590 
struggle so I sit and I believe you can
fit<00:02:58.960> probably<00:02:59.260> one<00:02:59.800> more<00:02:59.830> binder<00:03:00.700> in<00:03:00.940> here<00:03:01.420> I

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
fit probably one more binder in here I

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.060 
fit probably one more binder in here I
usually<00:03:01.959> don't<00:03:02.260> care<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.530> lot<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.830> stuff<00:03:03.040> just

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
usually don't care a lot of stuff just

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.640 
usually don't care a lot of stuff just
because<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:03.880> want<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.600> keep<00:03:04.810> this<00:03:05.020> backpack<00:03:05.230> in

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
because I want to keep this backpack in

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.340 
because I want to keep this backpack in
good<00:03:05.920> condition<00:03:06.430> but<00:03:06.940> here's<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.209> binder<00:03:07.630> and

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
good condition but here's a binder and

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.590 
good condition but here's a binder and
put<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.680> in<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.430> then<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:09.820> can<00:03:09.970> keep<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.390> little

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
put it in and then you can keep a little

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.270 
put it in and then you can keep a little
bit<00:03:11.250> pencil<00:03:12.250> case<00:03:12.459> in<00:03:12.790> here<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.360> let's<00:03:14.350> see<00:03:14.620> my

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
bit pencil case in here and let's see my

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.110 
bit pencil case in here and let's see my
planner<00:03:15.610> in<00:03:15.970> here<00:03:16.270> and<00:03:16.540> that's<00:03:17.290> pretty<00:03:17.950> much

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
planner in here and that's pretty much

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.780 
planner in here and that's pretty much
bold<00:03:19.120> you<00:03:19.450> can<00:03:19.650> probably<00:03:20.650> put<00:03:21.010> another<00:03:21.400> thing

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
bold you can probably put another thing

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.240 
bold you can probably put another thing
but<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.510> mean<00:03:23.230> I<00:03:23.260> would<00:03:23.530> say<00:03:23.709> that's<00:03:23.950> pretty

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
but I mean I would say that's pretty

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.120 
but I mean I would say that's pretty
much<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.850> limit<00:03:25.060> of<00:03:25.420> this<00:03:25.630> um<00:03:25.959> I<00:03:26.739> wouldn't

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
much the limit of this um I wouldn't

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.699 
much the limit of this um I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:27.430> putting<00:03:27.850> any<00:03:28.239> really<00:03:28.959> big<00:03:28.989> thick

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
recommend putting any really big thick

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.890 
recommend putting any really big thick
text<00:03:30.250> books<00:03:30.459> in<00:03:30.640> here<00:03:30.850> I<00:03:31.060> mean<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.570> can<00:03:31.870> if

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
text books in here I mean you can if

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.080 
text books in here I mean you can if
that's<00:03:32.350> going<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.680> be<00:03:32.800> the<00:03:33.070> only<00:03:33.340> item<00:03:33.940> you

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
that's going to be the only item you

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.120 
that's going to be the only item you
have<00:03:34.120> but<00:03:34.630> other<00:03:34.840> than<00:03:35.080> that<00:03:35.140> I<00:03:35.500> don't<00:03:35.830> really

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
have but other than that I don't really

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.979 
have but other than that I don't really
recommend<00:03:36.370> putting<00:03:36.970> lot<00:03:37.300> stuff<00:03:37.600> just<00:03:37.810> because

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
recommend putting lot stuff just because

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.979 
recommend putting lot stuff just because
I<00:03:38.470> mean<00:03:39.100> let's<00:03:39.580> be<00:03:39.670> honest<00:03:40.090> this<00:03:40.270> is<00:03:40.420> a<00:03:40.450> really

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
I mean let's be honest this is a really

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.830 
I mean let's be honest this is a really
pretty<00:03:41.280> pricey<00:03:42.280> bag<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.300> don't<00:03:43.480> want<00:03:43.720> it
