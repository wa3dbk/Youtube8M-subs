00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello everybody what you not to you 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.090
 here is the wall of my kitchen that 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.660
 that you saw in the video next to the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.570
 my decorated kitchen passing here and 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.890
 I came to show that I changed something. 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.170
 Now in the kitchen, it's like black if the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.150
 people carry a lot so I think he 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.880
 it weighs a little in the environment 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.650
 I decided instead to take all 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.739
 paper with tactics and only that I used it to 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.600
 the contact and here I used ink to dhaka 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.559
 only I used the premium Dakar where 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.510
 I've been watching my kitchen since 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.730
 I did that first video there that you 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.190
 has the customization of mine from my 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.670
 kitchen made me decorated with tati 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.670
 the video 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.530
 no yellow people, no ink, no 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.850
 a high-value paint is not us 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.500
 well in mind 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:05.460
 O remained in the comics that are 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.190
 of 15 in the case 15 by 15 cut out 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.380
 certinho was placed as 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.910
 putting the fingers on I do not know 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.480
 up 4 anything 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.240
 and here I played people I came back to where I was 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:22.920
 That is, it does not even come close. 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.830
 black or white polka dots can give 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.800
 a change and take a little air of heavy 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.910
 what went right're super besides having 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.490
 changed is in the spot of my lamp I 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.869
 I changed until I pass here I'm going up 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.840
 here for you to see 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.790
 I changed the spot, I got away. 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.610
 I voted two lamps of 25 O is on the case 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:53.070
 stayed well lit kitchen well 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.479
 lit and really gave a new air 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.369
 To the kitchen, everyone who comes home 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.270
 and asks if I painted again 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.780
 cook what I did 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.500
 but of course you already notice immediately 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.430
 change I made forgetting that it is 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.200
 I did not use this ball black without 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.690
 why even my 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.940
 I have here that the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.400
 chickens lines evil my chickens 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.120
 d'angola that I have decorative in a 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.420
 in this niche here they have come close 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.610
 now there are but they are black and with 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.520
 white balls then 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.620
 I did this part here to combine the 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.580
 people saw that just to give an idea 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.010
 To you home, and you did right. 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.300

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.950
 kitchen is all black and white as it was 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.130
 done previously suddenly came 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.290
 get tired of not taking everything off people who 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.550
 Do not forget this is the contact I 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:03:00.020
 I used both here and here's vulcan 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.090
 so on average the price of the roll is 60 reais 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.000
 has now grown here in joinville 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.550
 I bought on average that the meter itself 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.110
 here to redecorate this part of the 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.810
 Kitchen I came back over the top not even 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.260
 I retired I was down I went over 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:19.250
 even from the other and a very nice effect 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.820
 of a more nervous air was something more 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.400
 smooth in the kitchen okay that's it we're 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.010

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.660

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.239
 but it ended however of color 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.900
