00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
all right ladies I just wanted to talk

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.960 
all right ladies I just wanted to talk
about<00:00:05.850> holding<00:00:06.620> 1414<00:00:07.620> veins<00:00:07.830> or<00:00:08.099> 1312<00:00:08.760> Ames

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
about holding 1414 veins or 1312 Ames

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.749 
about holding 1414 veins or 1312 Ames
and<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:09.389> keeps<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:09.870> all<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.260> so<00:00:10.530> holding<00:00:11.400> it

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
and it keeps this all in so holding it

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.820 
and it keeps this all in so holding it
defending<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.900> obviously<00:00:13.259> good<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.679> learn

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
defending it is obviously good to learn

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.849 
defending it is obviously good to learn
as<00:00:14.040> well<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:14.820> first<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.719> all<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.230> hold<00:00:16.440> this<00:00:16.619> you

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
as well so first of all to hold this you

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.680 
as well so first of all to hold this you
need<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.250> know<00:00:17.369> some<00:00:17.609> time<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.449> first

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
need to know some time so the first

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.179 
need to know some time so the first
things<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:18.990> know<00:00:19.260> they<00:00:19.439> can<00:00:19.590> tip<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.949> off<00:00:20.039> that

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
things to know they can tip you off that

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.880 
things to know they can tip you off that
this<00:00:20.310> build<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.760> coming<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.960> timings<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
this build is coming the timings of the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.740 
this build is coming the timings of the
natural<00:00:23.400> expansion<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:24.000> your<00:00:24.150> opponent<00:00:24.510> since

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
natural expansion of your opponent since

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.080 
natural expansion of your opponent since
most<00:00:25.019> people<00:00:25.109> just<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.560> overlord<00:00:25.949> Scout<00:00:26.220> this

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
most people just to overlord Scout this

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.790 
most people just to overlord Scout this
is<00:00:27.269> what<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.570> need<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.810> be<00:00:27.869> looking<00:00:28.170> for<00:00:28.380> to

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
is what you need to be looking for to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.040 
is what you need to be looking for to
realize<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:29.910> base<00:00:30.090> build<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.019> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
realize that it's a one base build so a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
realize that it's a one base build so a
hatch<00:00:31.349> first<00:00:31.650> starts<00:00:32.640> about<00:00:32.910> 215<00:00:33.809> or<00:00:34.140> 210<00:00:34.800> 2<00:00:34.950> to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
hatch first starts about 215 or 210 2 to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.639 
hatch first starts about 215 or 210 2 to
15<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> clock<00:00:35.969> standard<00:00:36.630> pool<00:00:37.050> expand

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
15 on the clock standard pool expand

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.310 
15 on the clock standard pool expand
without<00:00:37.829> gas<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.550> pull<00:00:39.420> first<00:00:39.780> without<00:00:40.079> gas

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
without gas so pull first without gas

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.190 
without gas so pull first without gas
the<00:00:40.559> expansion<00:00:41.070> goes<00:00:41.280> down<00:00:41.520> around<00:00:41.760> 2:45<00:00:42.239> so

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the expansion goes down around 2:45 so

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.650 
the expansion goes down around 2:45 so
with<00:00:43.320> these<00:00:43.469> two<00:00:43.530> times<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.190> mind<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:45.390> means

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
with these two times in mind that means

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.330 
with these two times in mind that means
that<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.950> there's<00:00:47.850> any<00:00:48.120> expansion<00:00:49.110> later<00:00:49.770> than

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
that if there's any expansion later than

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.209 
that if there's any expansion later than
245<00:00:51.000> when<00:00:51.449> your<00:00:51.570> overlord<00:00:51.989> gets<00:00:52.230> there<00:00:52.500> who's

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
245 when your overlord gets there who's

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.490 
245 when your overlord gets there who's
most<00:00:53.520> likely<00:00:53.610> got<00:00:54.120> gas<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.899> most<00:00:55.140> likely

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
most likely got gas and it's most likely

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.470 
most likely got gas and it's most likely
gonna<00:00:55.829> be<00:00:56.039> some<00:00:56.250> aggression<00:00:56.850> coming<00:00:57.059> if

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
gonna be some aggression coming if

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.099 
gonna be some aggression coming if
there's<00:00:57.930> no<00:00:58.050> expansion<00:00:58.440> by<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.100> 3<00:00:59.399> minutes

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
there's no expansion by like 3 minutes

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.229 
there's no expansion by like 3 minutes
then<00:01:01.129> you<00:01:02.129> will<00:01:02.309> definitely<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.879> want<00:01:03.180> to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
then you will definitely be want to

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.729 
then you will definitely be want to
preparing<00:01:03.600> for<00:01:03.690> someone<00:01:03.960> basal<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.500> most

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
preparing for someone basal in most

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.560 
preparing for someone basal in most
likely<00:01:05.159> thirteen<00:01:05.549> twelve<00:01:05.820> or<00:01:06.119> fourteen

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
likely thirteen twelve or fourteen

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.420 
likely thirteen twelve or fourteen
fourteen<00:01:06.960> veins<00:01:07.200> since<00:01:07.950> there<00:01:08.100> aren't<00:01:08.220> really

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
fourteen veins since there aren't really

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.550 
fourteen veins since there aren't really
any<00:01:08.549> other<00:01:08.939> one<00:01:09.299> base<00:01:09.510> all<00:01:09.720> ends<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.200> if<00:01:10.290> if

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
any other one base all ends and if if

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.350 
any other one base all ends and if if
they<00:01:10.770> do<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> different<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:11.820> basal<00:01:12.210> and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
they do do a different one basal and

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.270 
they do do a different one basal and
it's<00:01:12.479> gonna<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.750> pretty<00:01:12.900> bad<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:14.130> will

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
it's gonna be pretty bad and this will

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.340 
it's gonna be pretty bad and this will
hold<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.640> perfectly<00:01:14.790> fine<00:01:15.180> as<00:01:15.390> well<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.200> one

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
hold it perfectly fine as well so one

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.710 
hold it perfectly fine as well so one
Ohana<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:16.920> arrive<00:01:17.220> at<00:01:17.369> his<00:01:17.460> base<00:01:17.670> about<00:01:18.000> 320

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
Ohana we arrive at his base about 320

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.539 
Ohana we arrive at his base about 320
that's<00:01:19.200> when<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.530> see<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.799> natural<00:01:20.189> hatchery

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
that's when we see is natural hatchery

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.240 
that's when we see is natural hatchery
we<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.390> nothing<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.900> there<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.619> how<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:22.950> we

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
we see nothing is there so how do we

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.580 
we see nothing is there so how do we
react<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.119> reaction<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.869> same<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.350> both

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
react the reaction is same for both

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.550 
react the reaction is same for both
hatch<00:01:25.950> first<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.549> pull<00:01:26.759> first<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:28.290> don't

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
hatch first and pull first and you don't

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.590 
hatch first and pull first and you don't
want<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.829> basically<00:01:29.549> once<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.970> see<00:01:30.180> no

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
want to basically once you see no

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.719 
want to basically once you see no
natural<00:01:31.439> expansion<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.159> don't<00:01:32.400> want<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.640> go

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
natural expansion you don't want to go

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.760 
natural expansion you don't want to go
over<00:01:33.030> eighteen<00:01:33.479> runs<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.290> what<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.530> want<00:01:34.710> to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
over eighteen runs but what you want to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.069 
over eighteen runs but what you want to
do<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:35.790> want<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.180> build<00:01:36.360> Queens<00:01:36.750> you

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
do is you just want to build Queens you

do is you just want to build Queens you
want<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.290> build<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.530> spine<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.460> only<00:01:38.670> want

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
want to build a spine and you only want

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.300 
want to build a spine and you only want
to<00:01:39.060> build<00:01:39.240> about<00:01:39.509> eight<00:01:39.750> links<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.829> goal<00:01:41.070> is

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
to build about eight links the goal is

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.039 
to build about eight links the goal is
to<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.670> build<00:01:41.880> Queens<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.479> spines<00:01:42.810> and

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
to just build Queens and spines and

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.480 
to just build Queens and spines and
after<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.500> Ling's<00:01:43.799> you're<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.159> gonna<00:01:44.310> build

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
after a Ling's you're just gonna build

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.440 
after a Ling's you're just gonna build
even<00:01:44.670> more<00:01:44.820> drones

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
even more drones

want to do with the first two Queens is
you<00:02:05.369> don't<00:02:05.610> want<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.969> inject<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:06.780> want

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
you don't want to inject you just want

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.180 
you don't want to inject you just want
to<00:02:06.990> pull<00:02:07.140> them<00:02:07.290> straight<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.860> ramp<00:02:08.039> you

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
to pull them straight to the ramp you

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.910 
to pull them straight to the ramp you
want<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.459> save<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.239> energy<00:02:09.690> for<00:02:10.020> transfuse<00:02:10.619> on

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
want to save the energy for transfuse on

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.050 
want to save the energy for transfuse on
the<00:02:11.190> spine<00:02:11.400> crawler<00:02:11.730> or<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.510> other<00:02:12.720> queen

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
the spine crawler or on other queen

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.970 
the spine crawler or on other queen
then<00:02:13.270> you<00:02:13.390> start<00:02:13.630> another<00:02:13.900> Queen<00:02:14.140> from<00:02:14.739> both

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
then you start another Queen from both

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.740 
then you start another Queen from both
of<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.250> hatchery<00:02:15.550> just<00:02:15.849> gonna<00:02:15.970> spam<00:02:16.270> Queens

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
of the hatchery just gonna spam Queens

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.260 
of the hatchery just gonna spam Queens
and<00:02:17.110> spines<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.890> drones<00:02:18.220> at<00:02:18.459> this<00:02:18.580> point<00:02:18.819> so<00:02:19.060> I

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
and spines and drones at this point so I

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.210 
and spines and drones at this point so I
should<00:02:19.720> start<00:02:19.989> building<00:02:20.170> more<00:02:20.530> drone<00:02:20.830> soon

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
should start building more drone soon

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.949 
should start building more drone soon
and<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:21.940> can<00:02:21.970> just<00:02:22.180> rally<00:02:22.450> these<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.870> the

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
and you can just rally these to the

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.750 
and you can just rally these to the
natural<00:02:23.349> like<00:02:23.560> only<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.920> few<00:02:24.250> are<00:02:24.400> gonna<00:02:24.489> die

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
natural like only a few are gonna die

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.490 
natural like only a few are gonna die
and<00:02:25.060> he's<00:02:25.420> on<00:02:25.540> one<00:02:25.720> base<00:02:25.900> anyway<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:26.410> it

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
and he's on one base anyway so it

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.720 
and he's on one base anyway so it
doesn't<00:02:26.739> really<00:02:26.800> matter<00:02:27.010> here<00:02:27.190> we<00:02:27.310> go<00:02:27.459> for

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
doesn't really matter here we go for

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.460 
doesn't really matter here we go for
drones<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.239> then<00:02:28.750> I'm<00:02:28.959> gonna<00:02:29.080> try<00:02:29.260> and

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
drones and then I'm gonna try and

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.990 
drones and then I'm gonna try and
balance<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:30.099> out<00:02:30.220> so<00:02:30.430> I<00:02:30.459> can<00:02:30.519> keep<00:02:30.819> building

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
balance it out so I can keep building

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.180 
balance it out so I can keep building
spines<00:02:31.450> drones<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:31.989> queens<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.500> then<00:02:32.950> any

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
spines drones and queens and then any

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.710 
spines drones and queens and then any
aggression<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.790> comes<00:02:34.000> from<00:02:34.180> let's<00:02:34.480> speed

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
aggression that comes from let's speed

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.770 
aggression that comes from let's speed
this<00:02:34.750> up<00:02:35.190> should<00:02:36.190> get<00:02:36.340> absolutely<00:02:36.970> smashed<00:02:37.510> so

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
this up should get absolutely smashed so

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.080 
this up should get absolutely smashed so
we<00:02:37.870> got<00:02:38.019> two<00:02:38.319> queens<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:39.220> fourth<00:02:39.640> queens<00:02:39.910> that

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
we got two queens the fourth queens that

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.610 
we got two queens the fourth queens that
pop<00:02:40.360> now<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:41.019> need<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.230> move<00:02:41.349> that<00:02:41.530> one

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
pop now and I need to move that one

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.440 
pop now and I need to move that one
straight<00:02:41.890> down<00:02:42.099> from<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.400> main<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:43.330> the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
straight down from the main to the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.150 
straight down from the main to the
natural<00:02:43.750> is<00:02:43.870> he<00:02:43.930> gonna<00:02:44.019> go<00:02:44.200> nuts<00:02:44.440> getting

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
natural is he gonna go nuts getting

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.070 
natural is he gonna go nuts getting
distracted<00:02:45.430> here<00:02:45.760> but<00:02:46.000> three<00:02:46.510> queens<00:02:46.780> is

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
distracted here but three queens is

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.570 
distracted here but three queens is
enough<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.500> go<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.709> trans<00:02:47.920> fuses<00:02:48.310> on<00:02:48.430> those

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
enough to go the trans fuses on those

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.490 
enough to go the trans fuses on those
Queens<00:02:48.850> so<00:02:49.120> they<00:02:49.540> can<00:02:49.690> transfuse<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.290> Queen

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
Queens so they can transfuse the Queen

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.020 
Queens so they can transfuse the Queen
all<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.739> spines<00:02:51.010> if<00:02:51.190> they<00:02:51.340> volunteer<00:02:51.819> and

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
all the spines if they volunteer and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.850 
all the spines if they volunteer and
malignus<00:02:52.780> just<00:02:52.959> can't<00:02:53.140> get<00:02:53.319> past<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.680> Queen

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
malignus just can't get past the Queen

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.430 
malignus just can't get past the Queen
so<00:02:54.069> this<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.430> really<00:02:55.000> really<00:02:55.150> simple<00:02:55.450> way<00:02:55.690> to

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
so this is a really really simple way to

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.910 
so this is a really really simple way to
hold<00:02:56.620> one<00:02:57.519> base<00:02:57.730> all<00:02:57.970> in<00:02:58.120> 2014<00:02:58.930> Bane's<00:02:59.170> 13:12

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
hold one base all in 2014 Bane's 13:12

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.160 
hold one base all in 2014 Bane's 13:12
aims<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.790> it's<00:03:00.940> very<00:03:01.180> low<00:03:01.360> variance<00:03:01.840> as<00:03:02.049> well

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
aims and it's very low variance as well

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.809 
aims and it's very low variance as well
instead<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.560> fighting<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:03.130> with<00:03:03.280> Ling<00:03:03.519> Bane

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
instead of fighting it with Ling Bane

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.640 
instead of fighting it with Ling Bane
like<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.450> couple<00:03:04.840> of<00:03:04.930> people<00:03:05.200> though<00:03:05.319> I'm<00:03:05.500> not

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
like a couple of people though I'm not

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.289 
like a couple of people though I'm not
sure<00:03:05.799> how<00:03:06.010> common<00:03:06.400> this<00:03:06.519> strategy<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:07.150> because

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
sure how common this strategy is because

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.240 
sure how common this strategy is because
I<00:03:07.450> kind<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.690> made<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:07.900> myself<00:03:08.110> but<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.830> haven't

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
I kind of made it myself but I haven't

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.710 
I kind of made it myself but I haven't
really<00:03:09.489> seen<00:03:09.640> anyone<00:03:10.030> go<00:03:10.239> up<00:03:10.330> against

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
really seen anyone go up against

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.900 
really seen anyone go up against
fourteen<00:03:11.110> fourteen<00:03:11.470> Bane's<00:03:11.709> in<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.099> pro<00:03:12.670> game

common on ladder and this is a really

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.460 
common on ladder and this is a really
low<00:03:18.579> variance<00:03:18.970> way<00:03:19.209> of<00:03:19.329> holding<00:03:19.690> it<00:03:19.810> if<00:03:20.079> you<00:03:20.290> do

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
low variance way of holding it if you do

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.229 
low variance way of holding it if you do
manage<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.859> hold<00:03:21.190> it<00:03:21.459> or<00:03:21.609> they<00:03:21.910> take<00:03:22.090> an

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
manage to hold it or they take an

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.990 
manage to hold it or they take an
expansion<00:03:22.840> or<00:03:23.019> they<00:03:23.140> stop<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.560> aggression

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
expansion or they stop the aggression

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.220 
expansion or they stop the aggression
once<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:25.120> get<00:03:25.269> past<00:03:25.480> that<00:03:25.570> point<00:03:25.780> of<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:25.989> game

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
once you get past that point of the game

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.380 
once you get past that point of the game
you<00:03:26.410> can<00:03:26.530> take<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:26.769> double<00:03:27.130> gasp<00:03:27.310> after<00:03:28.180> getting

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
you can take a double gasp after getting

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
you can take a double gasp after getting

baneling nest and you go straight to

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.250 
baneling nest and you go straight to
double<00:03:37.299> guess<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.780> you<00:03:37.840> can<00:03:37.959> just<00:03:38.079> play<00:03:38.230> a
