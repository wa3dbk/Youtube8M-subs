 So I will turn on your group in Skype 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.389
 This group is sent a link to 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.899
 webinar when it comes down to it and if that 

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:22.240
 I once again remind you that the webinars are not 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:25.270
 I'm sorry in these groups 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.189
 no talking outside 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.619
 Webinar, that is, there either sends a link 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.389
 either during the webinar there are questions 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.200
 are set or some kind of discussion can 

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:36.819
 happen but we just cherish 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.219
 time the energy of those people who 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.899
 signed to them during working hours there 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.909
 didn't jump out any trash and they didn't 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.990
 distracted by what it leads to 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.140
 lists there 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.720
 we don't want to bother anyone for nothing 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.350
 so here is such a request 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.960
 and accordingly again it will be 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.570
 Saturday coming at 10 am Moscow time 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.549
 We have many people who are already involved but 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.350
 and those who are new subscribe to the channel 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.409

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.409
