00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
adjusting my shutter speed up and down

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.660 
adjusting my shutter speed up and down
by<00:02:24.700> utilizing<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.769> faster<00:02:26.769> shutter<00:02:27.010> speed<00:02:27.430> you

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
by utilizing a faster shutter speed you

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.789 
by utilizing a faster shutter speed you
can<00:02:28.299> bring<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.629> ambient<00:02:29.230> light<00:02:29.409> in<00:02:29.620> the

shutter<00:02:33.220> speed<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.879> can<00:02:34.629> bring<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.019> ambient

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
shutter speed you can bring the ambient

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.220 
shutter speed you can bring the ambient
light<00:02:35.620> in<00:02:35.799> the<00:02:35.980> background<00:02:36.489> up<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.900> can

light in the background up you can

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.809 
light in the background up you can
choose<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.620> environment<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.340> you'd<00:02:39.579> like
