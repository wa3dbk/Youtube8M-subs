ago there are some scientists who

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
believe that our capacity is infinite I

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.540 
believe that our capacity is infinite I
can<00:01:19.280> feel<00:01:19.490> every<00:01:19.880> living<00:01:20.060> thing<00:01:20.770> I<00:01:21.770> would<00:01:22.520> say

can feel every living thing I would say

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.040 
can feel every living thing I would say
the<00:01:22.730> possibilities<00:01:23.240> endless<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.900> reason

the possibilities endless and the reason

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.170 
the possibilities endless and the reason
I<00:01:24.260> say<00:01:24.290> that<00:01:24.470> is<00:01:24.680> a<00:01:25.100> hundred<00:01:25.550> years<00:01:25.730> ago<00:01:25.790> we

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
I say that is a hundred years ago we

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.850 
I say that is a hundred years ago we
could<00:01:26.390> not<00:01:26.540> have<00:01:26.660> predicted<00:01:26.750> what<00:01:27.290> we<00:01:27.680> have

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
could not have predicted what we have

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.340 
could not have predicted what we have
today<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:28.670> anything<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:29.300> predict<00:01:29.720> today<00:01:30.110> is

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
today so anything I predict today is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.470 
today so anything I predict today is
almost<00:01:30.860> certainly<00:01:31.220> going<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.490> be<00:01:31.580> wrong<00:01:31.820> 30<00:01:32.120> 40
