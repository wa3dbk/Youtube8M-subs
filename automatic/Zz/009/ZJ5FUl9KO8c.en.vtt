00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.590
 That's right, Victor Duarte. 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.960
 the first impressions I had of 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.810
 anime in the game no life an anime that 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.119
 premiered on April 9 in Japan that was 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.680
 produced by the studio and house that measures 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.140
 For me it's one of the best 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.529
 anime né 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.529
 so come on 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.670
 this is a work done by yo kamia and the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.719
 direction is in charge of chu katsuko 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.280
 really I have to admit that 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.210
 when the first five began 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.100
 minutes 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.680
 I immediately remembered to bitu a 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.920
 which coincidentally is made of the same 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.649
 the average house but I noticed that the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.199
 rhythm of the story is quite accelerated and 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.590
 has a very philosophical footprint and much more 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.289
 lightweight and when I say fast pace 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.359
 does not mean that the script is 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.240
 run down which costs information in the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.670
 face of the viewer but who can 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.400
 dynamism and simplicity in the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.409
 present the package of history and if there is 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.150
 something that has been happening in 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.100
 Today's anime 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.479
 although an adaptation to 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.960
 animation generates this dynamic the 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.479
 viewer right? 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.939
 precisely because of the ease of transmitting 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.880
 the message through visuals 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.579
 much more sophisticated than the manga 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.640
 But enough to roll, let's go to the 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.890
 setting of the series and its characters 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.150
 The story begins by introducing the world. 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.090
 dmmr pg online where four players 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.460
 are considered to be invincible but 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.340
 only two brothers who 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.750
 spend their lives playing work 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.189
 study or just be a hobo 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.320
 apparently refers to a criticism of 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.750
 today 's society where many day 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.390
 prefer to stay inside 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.550
 in the imaginary fantasy world where 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.970
 feel good and at ease 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.520
 once again art imitates life i think 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.950
 which is how the phrase soria and xirú 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.980
 considers the world in which we live a 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.360
 play without grace and if without resources in 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.880
 your own world 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.220
 but that's where they have the opportunity to 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.620
 know the world the topic where everything is 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.560
 determined by the games where the rules are 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.620
 clear and all compete by betting some 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.410
 value similar to the unfolding of the 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.959
 becomes darker in the middle of the 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.180
 first episode where and even in a 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.370
 fantasy world the best player is 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.709
 always the one who gets along at the end 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.690
 clear opening gaps pay cheating 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.510
 lies and manipulation 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.370
 the plot is very interesting and demonstrates 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.489
 great potential 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.670
 although after the first episode the 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.260
 fan service show your face again 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.760
 but it seems that there is no way in the galley 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.420
 this tool was used during 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.130
 decades and now it's not going to stop. 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.750
 average high as it is always my 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.090
 expectations when it comes to 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.430
 quality always with flawless art 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.440
 excellent soundtrack that combines with 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.070
 the story but it's still early to 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.330
 Confirm what will be new game life 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.700
 sincerely my expectations 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.769
 remain high and later this work 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.120
 will appear in the anime analyzes of 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.100
 channel 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.170
 do not forget to give a like in the video 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.720
 share with your friends and tell 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.170
 See you at the next 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.170
 thanks
