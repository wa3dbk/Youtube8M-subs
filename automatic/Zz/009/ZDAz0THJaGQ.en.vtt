00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.090
 hello today we'll talk about 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.090
 how to connect the level gauge 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.990
 fuel per year ultraflex with sensors 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.810
 fuel level with 5 film volume sistan 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.009
 or 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:25.310
 fuel level sensor which 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:28.079
 article 66 180 firms and bitch and so 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.009
 fuel gauge on reflex farm 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:34.739
 has the following contacts contacts 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.230
 which denote the letter 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.030
 and what does anger ignition mean 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.890
 positive battery contact 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.550
 denoted by letters g n it means 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.990
 ground ground and signal contact 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.010
 designated respectively bukovkoy s 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.880
 to connect 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:03.079
 fuel gauge to sensor 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:07.130
 fuel level 66 180 we charge 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:12.570
 negative battery cable and 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:16.010
 We connect it to the contact which 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:21.770
 marked well as a stone gnd 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:25.970
 next we take another wire 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:33.710
 connect it to the mass 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.710
 sensor mounting 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.740
 and this wire we also connect to 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:55.270
 contact gnd 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:02:00.650
 fix it fixed further 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:09.140
 signal wire we connect 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:16.030
 the sensor signal contact fix 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:19.940
 him and to the signal contact of the device 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.900
 which is designated as fleet we him 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.900
 also fixed 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:37.810
 the final touch of the positive connection 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:40.299
 battery contact accordingly we 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.519
 connect it to the contact 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.519
 Designator beeches peak 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.900
 here we have an electrical circuit 5 now we 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:05.080
 we can check how correctly she is 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:09.230
 works as you can see 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:13.120
 depending on the position of the sensor us 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.120
 leaning arrow device 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:23.739
 next we connected the sensor 66 108 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.050
 s5 pro sensor connects much easier 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.110
 sensor out of 5 there are two wires blue 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.980
 wire is a signal and black wire 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.680
 this is land 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:40.569
 Well , the signal bands connect 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:44.120
 the signal contract of the instrument and the land to 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:46.870
 black wire 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.870
 sensor 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:56.180
 we connected we can check how 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:00.190
 see, too, the arrow we carry sensor 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:06.740
 working correctly should say that 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:11.440
 the sensor works in the range from 0 to 180 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.440
 the device works in the same range 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.500
 that's all 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.050
 more details you can 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.890
 see on our website 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:27.310
 whose address is listed below thanks for 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.310
 Attention
