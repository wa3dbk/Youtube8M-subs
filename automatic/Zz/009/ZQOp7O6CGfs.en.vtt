blocks<00:02:43.549> doing<00:02:44.549> /<00:02:44.760> test<00:02:45.150> for<00:02:46.549> and<00:02:48.290> we're<00:02:49.290> just

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
blocks doing / test for and we're just

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.170 
blocks doing / test for and we're just
going<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.560> use<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.890> XYZ<00:02:50.310> at<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:50.970> position

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
going to use the XYZ at this position

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.970 
going to use the XYZ at this position
right<00:02:51.599> here<00:02:52.849> 88<00:02:53.849> 74<00:02:54.450> 108<00:02:54.989> that's<00:02:55.500> pretty<00:02:55.920> easy

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
right here 88 74 108 that's pretty easy

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.800 
right here 88 74 108 that's pretty easy
to<00:02:56.760> remember<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.959> /<00:02:58.200> test<00:02:58.500> for<00:02:58.739> at<00:02:58.980> P<00:02:59.780> which<00:03:00.780> is

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
to remember so / test for at P which is

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.830 
to remember so / test for at P which is
the<00:03:01.109> selector<00:03:02.180> x<00:03:03.180> equals<00:03:03.780> eighty<00:03:04.260> eight<00:03:05.840> ye

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
the selector x equals eighty eight ye

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.720 
the selector x equals eighty eight ye
has<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.470> equal<00:03:07.560> 74<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:09.450> z<00:03:10.170> has<00:03:10.349> to<00:03:10.530> equal<00:03:10.670> 108

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.750 

so<00:03:15.859> yeah<00:03:18.109> so<00:03:19.109> how<00:03:19.170> old<00:03:19.410> do<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.739> get<00:03:20.099> we<00:03:20.459> got<00:03:20.609> the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
so yeah so how old do is get we got the

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.520 
so yeah so how old do is get we got the
center<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.329> now<00:03:21.870> we've<00:03:22.049> got<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.349> get<00:03:22.410> the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
center of it now we've got to get the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.409 
center of it now we've got to get the
corners<00:03:22.829> 89<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.670> 87<00:03:25.040> so<00:03:26.040> put<00:03:26.280> one<00:03:26.400> right<00:03:26.549> here

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.610 

let's<00:03:30.419> go<00:03:30.599> ahead<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:30.840> copy<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.169> paste<00:03:31.500> that

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
let's go ahead and copy and paste that

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:47.830 
let's go ahead and copy and paste that
one<00:03:38.450> let's<00:03:39.450> select<00:03:39.750> all<00:03:40.099> copy

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:55.610

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:04.240 

a<00:03:55.940> seven<00:03:56.940> and<00:04:02.360> what<00:04:03.360> it<00:04:03.450> will<00:04:03.540> do<00:04:03.720> is<00:04:03.750> just

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
a seven and what it will do is just

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.850 
a seven and what it will do is just
teleport<00:04:05.250> us<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.750> hear<00:04:06.830> it'll<00:04:07.830> just

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
teleport us to hear it'll just

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:15.949 
teleport us to hear it'll just
teleporters<00:04:08.430> back<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:13.640> this<00:04:14.640> place<00:04:14.849> or<00:04:15.269> to

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
teleporters back to this place or to

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.629 
teleporters back to this place or to
this<00:04:16.109> command<00:04:16.470> block<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:20.190> this<00:04:20.340> secondly

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
second point which could be right about

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.640 
second point which could be right about
here<00:04:50.960> now<00:04:51.960> we'll<00:04:52.139> just<00:04:52.169> build<00:04:52.440> ourselves

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
here now we'll just build ourselves

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.430 
here now we'll just build ourselves
another<00:04:53.160> nether<00:04:53.460> portal<00:04:53.880> or<00:04:54.570> another<00:04:54.870> another

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
another nether portal or another another

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:08.279 
another nether portal or another another
portal<00:04:56.960> all<00:04:57.960> right<00:05:02.030> whoa

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.799 

another<00:05:09.219> portal<00:05:09.789> another<00:05:10.089> portal<00:05:12.569> they<00:05:13.569> sound

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:13.809 
another portal another portal they sound

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:24.150 
another portal another portal they sound
the<00:05:13.869> same<00:05:13.960> don't<00:05:14.319> they<00:05:14.379> okay<00:05:16.559> my<00:05:17.559> god

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.560 

well<00:05:25.160> apparently<00:05:25.310> if<00:05:25.610> you're<00:05:25.730> recording<00:05:26.090> and

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
well apparently if you're recording and

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.780 
well apparently if you're recording and
you're<00:05:27.440> running<00:05:27.700> two<00:05:29.200> to<00:05:30.200> three<00:05:31.070> commands<00:05:31.670> at

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
you're running two to three commands at

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.670 
you're running two to three commands at
the<00:05:31.880> same<00:05:32.120> time<00:05:32.360> it<00:05:32.720> probably<00:05:33.260> will<00:05:33.440> lag<00:05:33.710> a<00:05:33.740> lot

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
the same time it probably will lag a lot

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:42.570 
the same time it probably will lag a lot
so

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.430 

we're<00:05:43.580> just<00:05:43.640> gonna<00:05:43.820> build<00:05:44.510> a<00:05:44.660> one-way<00:05:45.050> portal

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
we're just gonna build a one-way portal

00:05:45.440 --> 00:06:00.750 
we're just gonna build a one-way portal
for<00:05:46.280> now

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.490 

okay<00:06:01.760> so<00:06:01.940> we<00:06:02.180> have<00:06:02.210> like<00:06:03.460> smooth<00:06:04.460> spikes

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
okay so we have like smooth spikes

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.080 
okay so we have like smooth spikes
instead<00:06:06.500> of<00:06:06.530> lag<00:06:06.800> spikes<00:06:07.160> it<00:06:07.430> smooth<00:06:07.730> spikes

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
instead of lag spikes it smooth spikes

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:18.190 
instead of lag spikes it smooth spikes
haha<00:06:09.730> sorry<00:06:16.420> okay<00:06:17.420> then<00:06:17.660> we'll<00:06:17.750> just<00:06:17.930> choose

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
haha sorry okay then we'll just choose

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.340 
haha sorry okay then we'll just choose
the<00:06:18.230> center<00:06:18.710> of<00:06:18.740> this<00:06:19.600> this<00:06:20.600> portal<00:06:21.230> right

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
the center of this this portal right

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:30.940 
the center of this this portal right
here<00:06:24.130> which<00:06:25.130> is<00:06:25.280> 97<00:06:25.970> 496<00:06:29.620> let's<00:06:30.620> not<00:06:30.800> go

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
here which is 97 496 let's not go

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:45.690 
here which is 97 496 let's not go
through

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:58.620 

so<00:06:46.360> we'll<00:06:47.140> teleporter<00:06:47.680> selves<00:06:51.960> 297<00:06:54.930> 496<00:06:57.630> so

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:58.630 
so we'll teleporter selves 297 496 so

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.710 
so we'll teleporter selves 297 496 so
now<00:06:58.810> if<00:06:59.020> we<00:06:59.140> go<00:06:59.560> into<00:06:59.740> that<00:07:00.330> portal<00:07:01.330> over<00:07:01.570> there

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 
now if we go into that portal over there

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:12.240 
now if we go into that portal over there
over<00:07:02.050> here<00:07:06.810> we<00:07:07.810> got<00:07:08.050> teleported<00:07:10.950> so<00:07:11.950> yeah<00:07:12.070> so

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
over here we got teleported so yeah so

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.370 
over here we got teleported so yeah so
that's<00:07:12.430> how<00:07:12.610> this<00:07:12.850> command<00:07:13.810> block<00:07:13.990> mod<00:07:14.230> will

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:14.380 
that's how this command block mod will
