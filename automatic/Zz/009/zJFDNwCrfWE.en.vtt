fax one pull sometimes two is going to
be<00:01:12.420> enough<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.200> think<00:01:14.030> looking<00:01:15.030> at<00:01:15.150> this

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
be enough and I think looking at this

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.050 
be enough and I think looking at this
one<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.840> going<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:16.320> two<00:01:16.640> I'm<00:01:17.640> not<00:01:17.880> going

one it's going to be two I'm not going

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480 
one it's going to be two I'm not going
to<00:01:18.150> worry<00:01:18.390> at<00:01:18.780> all<00:01:19.140> about<00:01:19.200> ghosting<00:01:20.100> here

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
to worry at all about ghosting here

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.429 
to worry at all about ghosting here
because<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.270> fact<00:01:21.479> if<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.810> get<00:01:22.049> some<00:01:22.259> little

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
because in fact if I get some little

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.219 
because in fact if I get some little
what<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.770> call<00:01:22.830> ghost<00:01:23.369> grasses<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.960> won't

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
what I call ghost grasses it won't

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.289 
what I call ghost grasses it won't
matter<00:01:25.409> at<00:01:25.619> all<00:01:25.830> because<00:01:26.130> I'm<00:01:26.340> aiming<00:01:26.939> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
matter at all because I'm aiming to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.480 
matter at all because I'm aiming to
create<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.290> meadow<00:01:28.820> type<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:30.030> effect<00:01:31.340> so<00:01:32.340> I've

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
create a meadow type of effect so I've

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.010 
create a meadow type of effect so I've
taken<00:01:32.729> an<00:01:33.240> opaque<00:01:34.170> pink

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
taken an opaque pink

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.530 
taken an opaque pink
I've<00:01:37.020> added<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.979> tiny<00:01:38.220> little<00:01:38.490> bit<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.210> color<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
I've added a tiny little bit of color to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.260 
I've added a tiny little bit of color to
a<00:01:39.780> mixture<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.380> opaque<00:01:41.070> white<00:01:41.340> which<00:01:42.090> is

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
a mixture of opaque white which is

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.719 
a mixture of opaque white which is
really<00:01:42.600> full<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.840> pigment<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.560> sheer<00:01:44.430> white

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
really full of pigment and sheer white

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.389 
really full of pigment and sheer white
so<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:45.840> not<00:01:45.990> totally<00:01:46.710> opaque<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.250> it's

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
so that it's not totally opaque but it's

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.010 
so that it's not totally opaque but it's
going<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.700> be<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> big<00:01:48.090> enough<00:01:48.360> for<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.689> see

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
going to be a big enough for you to see

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.310 
going to be a big enough for you to see
it

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
it

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.469 
it
create<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> shimmer<00:01:50.369> effect<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:51.000> top<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
create a shimmer effect on top of the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.730 
create a shimmer effect on top of the
fabric<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.700> we'll<00:01:53.700> go<00:01:53.850> back<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:55.590> can

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
fabric so we'll go back to and you can

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.740 
fabric so we'll go back to and you can
see<00:01:55.950> you'll<00:01:56.159> notice<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:57.000> while<00:01:57.180> I'm<00:01:57.329> working

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
see you'll notice that while I'm working
