nice<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.980> don't<00:04:00.250> have<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:00.610> lay<00:04:00.790> on<00:04:00.850> the

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
nice you don't have that lay on the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.780 
nice you don't have that lay on the
table<00:04:01.030> design<00:04:01.690> so<00:04:02.230> this<00:04:02.530> this<00:04:03.010> case<00:04:03.370> is<00:04:03.550> pretty

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
table design so this this case is pretty

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.330 
table design so this this case is pretty
much<00:04:03.970> for<00:04:04.209> style<00:04:05.070> because<00:04:06.070> there<00:04:06.250> are<00:04:06.310> things

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
much for style because there are things

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.300 
much for style because there are things
exposed<00:04:06.880> here<00:04:07.300> and<00:04:07.950> fail<00:04:08.950> and<00:04:09.550> on<00:04:10.180> top<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:12.250> you

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
exposed here and fail and on top so you

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.620 
exposed here and fail and on top so you
guys<00:04:12.400> they<00:04:12.580> don't<00:04:12.790> get<00:04:12.880> that<00:04:13.060> much<00:04:13.239> protection

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630
