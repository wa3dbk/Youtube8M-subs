00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.010
 on 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.870
 hi stopgeym one and we continue 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.760
 which mods 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.369
 and today we will look wonderful 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.180
 mod smart physicist he adds meinkravt 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.000
 physics 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.860
 your character, that is, you can scrub 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.559
 forged then intermeddle and so on 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.379
 finding fault is pretty interesting 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.020
 now we will sort everything out and in advance 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:42.210
 I apologize if not worse will be heard 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:46.900
 thanks, moreover, they smell the microphone for it 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.420
 Well, in general, that's how this mod is called 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.769
 here I have candles and so smart moving 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:58.110
 but okay , you see, he has four modes 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:00.400
 there is disabled light medium and severe 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.330
 i.e. light is not strong and 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.879
 realistic 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.570
 the middle is already over and hard is the 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.560
 or leaf 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:12.250
 but since we are school kids let's play 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.549
 on average you can disable it altogether 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.740
 disable it is interesting especially 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:22.030
 so interesting feels great on 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.369
 servers, by the way, this is version 1.4.5 and mine 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.049
 favorite 50 ma come on minecraft assembly 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.240
 let's get started on 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.939
 run away and you see these arrows 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.340
 energy wave 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.909
 they are smaller than you 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.189
 then you can not run and under you rested 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.799
 wall how do we get through not 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:45.070
 except here this is my shoals 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:49.340
 I'm sorry, I just appeared there 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.600
 lava will eat but also in that form in general 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.670
 how can we just get over us 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.280
 in the normal version but with this mod 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.430
 you can jump and hold p and saw 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.220
 we shed shave i will show 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.980
 these are all modes 5 because 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.490
 not interesting as the street from the first 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.490
 weights 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.340
 that by 3 everything was visible and four 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.380
 block how to sneak in spite of my 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.320
 shoals so we do not see them all invisible we 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.320
 see all that he do this clamp 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.200
 shift and erp the same shift and spent it 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.040
 temporarily and in such lines appear and 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:34.230
 we let go and pinch or and here you are 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.060
 scrambles and now you can hold here 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.740
 so here goes through glory 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:45.440
 the main thing is not to fall guys litter 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.440
 let's try this go to the service 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:55.190
 you see see the lead 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.190
 it is very realistic as if tried 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:06.580
 Well, you see, he gave it more every day 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:10.210
 but I'm already on average since I 'm standing 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.350
 my oh why so sorry for mine 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.140
 shoals just 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.730
 some teams will but you see 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.700
 big difference between average damage 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.700
 complexity the most difficult 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.370
 The fact that they have these arrows swing 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.520
 faster and now how does he tie 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.930
 jump off 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.350
 you can just jump but we 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.460
 there will be less efficiency you can get down here 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.030
 So . 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.340
 and here's an example now do something to us 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.890
 need to get here if you allow 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.800
 this is very useful if you run from the shah 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.380
 in the mine from the creeper from the skeletons you and 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.020
 without armor from not know with ten 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.500
 diamonds by the way recognize diamonds 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.810
 this is not enough and by the way subscribe to the channel 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.960
 for good 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.240
 Come on, enough already enough ads like this 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.730
 Now if we even turn off this mode, he 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.159
 it will still be albeit and not yet carried 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.060
 from this tunnel mine call as 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:15.310
 want and here he crawls out this too 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:20.739
 will work but if you turn it off 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:22.810
 accordingly, so almost under the belly to them 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.910
 still the most interesting will ride 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.830
 belly 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.479
 yes yes yes you will not be heard 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.500
 ride 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:36.400
 clamp and I will give f5 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.350
 normal mode will show like this we 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.240
 must have been flown 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.030
 but 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.360
 since i'm here and flew very 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.669
 amazing and now we have cans 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.050
 with this him 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:55.620
 and now I'll show you the main chips 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.960
 of this mod if you are an admin or 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.030
 play on this server let's build 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:05.810
 big so 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.810
 Ambassadors do not know then from diamonds 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.330
 everything 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:17.629
 press f5 take the parachute canopy is 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:21.629
 separate mod again this is all at 50 and 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:23.460
 check but you saw for a second 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:26.460
 I opened well, so a short distance 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.500
 he did not open and now we show how so 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.750
 fly feed here is very cool here you are 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:37.319
 included the third mod and see we 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.849
 superman superman at all cool so 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.840
 you feel like a superman 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.210
 grabs a raincoat 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.060
 I'm probably for fun so the system 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.069
 small such 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.810
 The miniclip superman of this is generally quite 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:54.680
 and my husband will wash 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:56.300
 Well, we flew the village that they 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.590
 compete with and venice 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:03.680
 I accidentally glasses all the end well 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.169

 videos and wait for new fashion videos 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.980
 minecraft and this assembly will be interesting 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.840
 on the paradigm to drive the incentive or write to 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:25.220
