00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.190
 yes we have to analyze it first 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.320
 I believe the whole after ten minutes 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.150
 Big chance hits the wrong one 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.259
 decision 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.220
 instead of thinking about the inside 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.740
 to close rows 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.289
 the crowbar if we make the 1 0 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.179
 I think that makes the 1 0 then 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.250
 It looks very different here 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.769
 the lions were unsettled in the 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.540
 first half of that one has seen but 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.910
 yes we have to have a chance then 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.070
 advantage when you the very different here 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:44.440
 so you go with 0 0 in the half time in 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:49.780
 the second half-time coach right 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.949
 announcement made and placed on but so 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.690
 as of us a second not 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.390
 present here before the native 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.210
 get back two standard euro fans 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.910
 we knew that you too 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.050
 standards are dangerous 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.820
 Okotie makes two goals against us 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.780
 knew he was a fire hazard 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.110
 player front is that of 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.890
 header strength that's 42 or standard 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.210
 rain is really annoying because had 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.009
 in first has a great chance with 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.500
 simon yes, unfortunately, it does not make it pure 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.360
 difficult after 20 again one again 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.820
 I think we are the one to come 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.180
 first half, not at all 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.009
 arrived as we should 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.479
 certainly also because they that the 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.540
 sixties ingo were unsure that 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.860
 it seemed like you were somewhere 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.049
 Not partie looks so a bit 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.060
 There is a clear rippling sound when you still have one 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.340
 two possibilities but fundamental 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.720
 we could not do that at all 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.700
 what we wanted to have done before 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.090
 attack attack attack attack 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.950
 the uncertainty of the 60s somewhere 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.630
 but that's what it's all about 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.320
 we did not succeed in that 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.420
 got battles and yes that 1 0 then 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.310
 in the second half was then 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.670
 somewhere that has the icing on the cake 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.990
 negative senses of today and then 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.760
 it goes there then so 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.620
 then you realize that it is a certain 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.720
 there is uncertainty and that we are today 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.700
 The game was not possible 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.190
 again to think as it then last 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.680
 Ending positive for us would be the mood 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.340
 tilts a bit wheel loader scenes are 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.330
 Of course not nice for us but well 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:34.110
 maybe it would be time now 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:35.730
 is a daily business is bitter first 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.570
 play I met now could 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.780
 Unfortunately I do not help the team 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.690
 that we've been so important through 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.220
 that's why people stretch very much here 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.470
 disappointed, of course , that's understandable 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:52.200
 I mean we are the pattern 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.660
 unbeaten at home if you go there 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.730
 you just saw the glass half full 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.430
 have the last weeks that is now 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.480
 also there and then it is clear that that 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.920
 the mood also gives and that the 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.650
 people become dissatisfied 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.780
 we saw what we saw before 32 three 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.250
 months and what we did 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.580
 now, and it is clear that that 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.440
 it dissatisfied dissatisfied opinions 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.260
 There are completely normal 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.019
 now but with normal 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.950
 I do not even know 50 games anymore 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.360
 win then of course gives the 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.400
 mood will be very good in the 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.010
 found season and now of course 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.390
 quickly back off and I understand too 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.230
 that the fans are of course angry we are 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.820
 Of course , they are not happy either 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.040
 about it and now everyone is back 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.209
 converge and now shortly after 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.350
 game is of course too difficult too 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.030
 say what was wrong now 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.810
 of course that was of course wrong 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.709
 but 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.540
 yes we have to get out of there again and 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.930
 hold together fans and then it will 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.370
 again 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.330
 now go to the battle that will not 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.410
 It's easier than you have to 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.660
 now this week 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:58.599
 trainings to work up what's going on today 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.019
 no sheet is happening before the 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.959
 take a mouth and get ready 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:08.110
 do that on the Betze hold another 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.840
 quite another wind blows we have to 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.750
 as a team together simply move 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.389
 watch that we start everything there as well 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.850
 nasty play scrape that we are there 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.169
 what to take 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.040
 now is first time scan through thinking 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.610
 not to the next 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:28.320
 I have to process it first 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.320
 take two days and then my head
