00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.530
 Hello my 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.860
 I'm on Koscheev I represent the network 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.030
 sports clubs sport 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.920
 and today I want to tell 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.789
 their training and their particular 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.570
 performing a circular training this 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.520
 high intensity training method 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.980
 which can be applied for both 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.259
 increase endurance and for drying 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.570
 precisely because of its energy consumption 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.300
 Circuit training is more suitable for 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.309
 losing weight than gaining muscle mass 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.960
 This is a great option for those who do not. 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.239
 loves cardio then their 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.250
 monotony here you can perform 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.500
 different exercises with the same 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.480
 the result is this kind of physical 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.670
 loads includes work on 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.309
 three muscle groups on the same day they 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.679
 working out them in stages you are not only 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.649
 burns extra calories but gradually 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:58.199
 strengthen the whole body bringing it to tone 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.210
 at circuit training more often performed 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.309
 basic exercises for large muscle 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.739
 groups at the entry level 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.229
 exercise is better to perform on simulators 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.570
 Circuit training can be carried out 2-3 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.430
 Once a week on each of them can 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.380
 change as a sequence of exercises 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.020
 and consistently in the study 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.030
 muscle groups are circuit training 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.909
 is that the whole exercise 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.820
 performed one by one through the pipes they 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.460
 normal sets one circle consists of 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.530
 different exercises from six to ten 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.469
 usually this exercise on different parts 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.670
 bodies that are performed one after another 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.890
 on one approach 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.850
 each exercise has a specific 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.710
 number of repetitions 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.439
 or performed for a certain 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.680
 time lapse of each hand between 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.770
 air exercises do not exist after 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.619
 each lap rest 35 minutes 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.649
 depending on the level of preparedness 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.659
 workouts can be from 2 to 6 laps 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.960
 the duration of the workout 40-60 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.159
 minutes intensity of circular training 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.679
 increases due to an increase in the number 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.270
 reps and circles and shortening 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.329
 amount of rest time between 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.190
 approaches and so today we will spend 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.860
 circuit training to the top 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.810
 body first exercise that we will 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.269
 perform this upper block thrust behind 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.709

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.560
 elbows retracted and maximally 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.560
 we collect shovels 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.660
 the next exercise we will be 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.660
 perform this push ups with wide 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.390
 hands -up push-ups are basic 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.490
 multi-part exercise when performing 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.160
 which included in the chest 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.840
 muscles and triceps push up technique 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.450

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.800
 arm flexion in elbow joints 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.740
 lower position 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.620
 and then effort in the pectoral muscles squeeze 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.990
 straight arms up 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.270
 statically strain your pectoral muscles 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.500
 only then go to 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.290
 next repetition 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.900
 when doing this exercise not 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.420

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.829
 palms are turned inward 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.599
 on the exhale, start lifting the dumbbells when 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.329
 forearm will be parallel to the floor 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.919
 start turning the brushes out when 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.049
 this does not stop the movement 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.579
 try to lift the dumbbells as you can 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.650
 above 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.930
 I lower the dumbbells repeat the rotation of the brushes 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.660
 in reverse order to do 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.949
 exercise is even more effective keep 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.750
 elbows still 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.030
 while they are pressed to the sides of 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.110
 fixed in this position and here 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.110
 pushing harder 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.550
 the next exercise we will be 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.280
 perform this extension arm at the top 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.530
 block the initial position take 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.120
 inclined securely balanced 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.389
 position holding straight handle 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.820

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.139
 pointing right ahead 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.669
 throughout the exercise, straighten your arms 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.520
 elbows 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:10.590
 start moving slowly bucket and on 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.560
 exhale return hands to the starting position 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.229
 pause at the end of each repetition 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.050
 for one or two seconds to maximize 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.550
 feel the muscle tension also watch out for 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.169
 so that your elbows are always 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.169
 fixed and pressed to the body 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.870
 the next exercise we will be 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.870
 perform hyperextension 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.300
 when doing this exercise 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.400
 long back muscles are worked out 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.560
 initial position on the simulator we go to bed 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.680
 so that the pelvic bones are not removed 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.810
 simulator and a little written off the thigh should 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.050
 be pressed to the simulator feet 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.689
 we rest the roller of the arm in front of us 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.870
 performing an inspiratory exercise slowly 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:58.990
 drop down as you exhale rise 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.210
 just above the floor parallel the following 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.699
 exercise that we will perform this 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.069
 lifting the legs sitting in this exercise 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:07.139
 all muscles are worked through in a complex 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:10.990
 abdominals 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:13.060
 starting position sit on a bench leg 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.199
 and to keep a weight on bit and 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.560
 bent at the knees 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:20.440
 torso tilt back 45 degrees 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:23.529
 relation to the bench hands pay for 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.139
 bench behind the back on the exhale pull up 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:29.289
 knees of the chest without bending the legs at the knees and 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.029
 raise torso to meet them after 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:32.949
 a brief pause on the inhale slowly 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:35.590
 return to starting position 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:36.340
 to maximize the load on the bottom 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.199
 abdominal muscles 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.900
 try to lean back as far as you can 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:41.180
 stronger 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.490
 load level when doing this 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.330
 exercises can be adjusted by 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.270
 leg flexion 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.400
 the straighter your legs will be the harder 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.410
 you will perform this exercise 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.860
 all the exercises of this workout 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.759
 performed on 20-25 reps as 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.710
 number of laps 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:00.020
 regulated depending on the level 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:03.350
 preparation and intensity itself 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.979
 training you was me on his spit up 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.979
 new meetings
