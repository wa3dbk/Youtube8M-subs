 after the meal sébastien emmanueli not 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.400
 search for the horses that left her 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.990
 at liberty near the sheepfold 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.560

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:35.430

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:37.559
 a mare and her foals live here at 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.410
 over time the Corsican horse has 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.510
 almost disappeared in the 80's 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.930
 some young breeders try a bet 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.809
 crazy replenish the flock from 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.640
 a handful of individuals the family 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.440
 emmanueli was part of this 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.789
 adventure 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.500
 today Sebastian is one of 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.719
 last Corsican horse breeders 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.949
 yes recognize me because eat I 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.650
 come often see them once a 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.090
 week anyway I spend seeing them 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.490
 never know what can happen then 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.659
 I come here new per week 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.580

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.229
 together in the winter and they are at my 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.850
 village so I see it every day 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.110
 so they know me for the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.729
 foals it's even more interesting 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.140
 that a lot for others because 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.700
 the foal is born here already and lives in 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.290
 group 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.000
 he has around a dominant mare so 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.920
 they have to follow the rule there that he 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.619
 do not what are going there are in this 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.189

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.689
 storms and drought and ya to all there 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.009

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.210
 cows so her hair her garbage 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.270
 days we can go anywhere they 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.189
 are afraid of nothing in 2012 members of 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.750
 the association were rewarded for 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.880
 their efforts she passed on the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.880
 mane transmits his radio 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.159
 after years of work they have 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.299
 got the official recognition of 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.299
 the race of the Corsican horse 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.020
 the next step for the association 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.940
 rehabilitate transhumance trails 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.190
