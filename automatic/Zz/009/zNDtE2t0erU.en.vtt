00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello and welcome to hard parat in 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.319
 this video is a gaming pc for 1300 euro 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.010
 April 2013 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.769
 as cpu an integrative 37 70 came with 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.929
 4 times 3 5 gigahertz the processor is like that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.680
 pretty much the best for gambling 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.529
 93 60x but the kosice around the 900 euro 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.439
 and for that here is really top he 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.460
 has a standard of 3 5 ghz turbo 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.560
 3.9 ghz only 77 watt tdp 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.570
 he had in the name that means he has 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.280
 an open multiplier that means 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.350
 free overclock and he has 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.300
 hyperthreading that means everyone 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.719
 core can take over two tasks so 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.079
 theoretically 1 8 nuclear than cpu cooler 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.149
 terminal 1 0 2 marco that should be the cpu 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.270
 Quietly cool and you should 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.770
 high clock rates then reach as well 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.070
 Memory on 16GB bt group 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.309
 extreme ddr3 1600 the processor 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.309
 supports ddr3 1600 count is nine 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.780
 a good latency and 16 gb should also 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.860
 still sufficient for the future 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.600
 as a mainboard of a vz 77 per 3 with the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.000
 internet z 77 chipset 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.610
 It has everything you need usb3 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.060
 sata3 four ddr3 ram banks pci express 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.619
 3.0 and a 7.1 sound card and for that 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.630
 the value for money is real 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.600
 top because I have seen the better ones 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.930
 Mainboards start only from 110 120 euro 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.270
 on 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.579
 and before there is nothing 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.470
 really what is better and thanks to the z 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.829
 77 chip set can also be 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.990
 then overclock a ssd from samsung 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.710
 a samsung 840 basic with 120 gb 120 gb 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.840
 for operating system and some programs 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.720
 then as hard disk a 1000 gigabytes 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.540
 touchy the more the hard drive should he 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.520
 be pretty quick and run smoothly then 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.659
 as graphics card a 2 gigabyte gb 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.460
 wrong emanates x6 80 looks the map 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.180
 should actually everything up at the time 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.189
 Ultra pack and thanks to the wind force 3 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.280
 kÃ¶hler should make the card quite quiet 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.430
 be cooled as power supply 480 watts be 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.240
 quiet straight power e9 it has 80 plus 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.790
 gold what 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.350
 the fun does and what cable management 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.790
 means that you remove the cables 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.320
 you do not need them and you 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.690
 not unnecessarily in the housing 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.570
 then lie around a dvd burner of 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.820
 samsung and as housing 1a man z 9 plus 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.590
 the midi-tower the house is quite chic 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.970
 but as always only a suggestion of 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.710
 I of course you can every time 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.210
 other company then thank you 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.310

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.240
 than two months is please in the 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.400
 look into the description and the 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.980
 each gaming pc select their 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.200
 needs with the link he comes namely 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.910
 always the newest variant then would 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.910
 I'll say until the next video
