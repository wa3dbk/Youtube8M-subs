same as the 1198 s so it's less

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.300 
same as the 1198 s so it's less
restrictive<00:02:30.780> than<00:02:30.840> say<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.170> 1098<00:02:31.799> R<00:02:31.980> you've

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
restrictive than say the 1098 R you've

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.910 
restrictive than say the 1098 R you've
got<00:02:32.489> your<00:02:32.670> 8<00:02:32.820> levels<00:02:33.269> of<00:02:33.709> different<00:02:34.709> settings

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
got your 8 levels of different settings

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.490 
got your 8 levels of different settings
and<00:02:35.340> eight<00:02:36.030> being<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.690> most<00:02:36.870> restrictive<00:02:37.410> all

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
and eight being the most restrictive all

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.620 
and eight being the most restrictive all
the<00:02:37.650> way<00:02:37.709> down<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.100> one<00:02:38.340> like<00:02:38.910> on<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.180> road<00:02:39.390> we

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
the way down to one like on the road we

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.199 
the way down to one like on the road we
you<00:02:40.170> guys<00:02:40.290> rode<00:02:40.650> them<00:02:40.799> today<00:02:40.950> with<00:02:41.340> the

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
you guys rode them today with the

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.300 
you guys rode them today with the
traction<00:02:42.480> trial<00:02:42.840> on<00:02:42.959> level<00:02:43.230> six<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.950> then

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
traction trial on level six and then

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.400 
traction trial on level six and then
once<00:02:44.519> we<00:02:44.640> got<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:44.970> track<00:02:45.209> we<00:02:45.450> turned<00:02:46.290> it

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
once we got to the track we turned it

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.800 
once we got to the track we turned it
down<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.560> level<00:02:46.829> four<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.640> it's<00:02:48.239> quite<00:02:48.480> an<00:02:48.660> easy

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
down to level four so it's quite an easy

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.260 
down to level four so it's quite an easy
you<00:02:49.290> know<00:02:49.430> two-second<00:02:50.430> job<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.940> just<00:02:51.150> to

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
you know two-second job to just to

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.970 
you know two-second job to just to
change<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.630> level<00:02:51.989> traction<00:02:52.349> control<00:02:52.709> so

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
change the level traction control so

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.809 
change the level traction control so
it's<00:02:53.190> it

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
it's it

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.160 
it's it
quite<00:02:54.030> good<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.390> know<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.480> can<00:02:54.749> ride<00:02:55.019> your

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
quite good you know you can ride your

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.339 
quite good you know you can ride your
motorcycle<00:02:55.439> to<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.069> track<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.989> on<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.170> road

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
motorcycle to the track on on the road

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.020 
motorcycle to the track on on the road
within<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.950> level<00:02:59.249> six<00:02:59.489> or<00:02:59.609> whatever<00:02:59.819> you<00:02:59.879> want

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
within a level six or whatever you want

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.339 
within a level six or whatever you want
and<00:03:00.060> get<00:03:00.329> to<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.510> track<00:03:00.719> and<00:03:00.870> turn<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.170> down<00:03:01.290> a

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
and get to the track and turn it down a

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.379 
and get to the track and turn it down a
bit<00:03:01.469> so<00:03:01.799> it's<00:03:02.010> an<00:03:02.189> extremely<00:03:02.909> you<00:03:03.359> know

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
bit so it's an extremely you know

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.720 
bit so it's an extremely you know
advanced<00:03:04.019> traction<00:03:04.769> control<00:03:05.159> system

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
advanced traction control system

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.970 
advanced traction control system
what<00:03:06.389> sort<00:03:06.569> of<00:03:06.599> horsepower<00:03:06.959> despite<00:03:07.379> putting

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
what sort of horsepower despite putting

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.209 
what sort of horsepower despite putting
out<00:03:08.129> a<00:03:08.159> much<00:03:08.370> less<00:03:08.609> than<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.319> 1098<00:03:10.319> would<00:03:11.040> be

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:11.219 
out a much less than the 1098 would be

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:11.990 
out a much less than the 1098 would be
yep

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
yep

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.660 
yep
yeah<00:03:12.329> for<00:03:12.510> sure<00:03:12.629> it's<00:03:12.840> it's<00:03:13.530> 155<00:03:14.370> horsepower

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
yeah for sure it's it's 155 horsepower

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.860 
yeah for sure it's it's 155 horsepower
so<00:03:15.299> it's<00:03:15.420> about<00:03:15.540> five<00:03:15.870> less<00:03:16.230> than<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.709> 1098

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
so it's about five less than the 1098

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.199 
so it's about five less than the 1098
being<00:03:18.870> that's<00:03:19.019> pretty<00:03:19.349> much<00:03:19.469> the<00:03:19.950> same<00:03:20.849> engine

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
being that's pretty much the same engine

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.319 
being that's pretty much the same engine
is<00:03:21.329> as<00:03:21.540> at<00:03:21.719> 1098<00:03:22.290> but<00:03:22.469> Jacobi<00:03:22.859> over<00:03:23.219> change<00:03:24.180> it

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
is as at 1098 but Jacobi over change it

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.059 
is as at 1098 but Jacobi over change it
around<00:03:24.419> a<00:03:24.719> little<00:03:24.840> bit<00:03:25.049> with<00:03:25.230> cams<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.859> and

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
around a little bit with cams and and

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.250 
around a little bit with cams and and
all<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.549> type<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.060> thing<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.510> give<00:03:28.139> it<00:03:28.230> a

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
all that type of thing to give it a

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.440 
all that type of thing to give it a
little<00:03:28.769> bit<00:03:28.919> more<00:03:29.099> mid-range<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:30.030> little<00:03:30.359> bit

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
little bit more mid-range a little bit

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.330 
little bit more mid-range a little bit
nicer<00:03:30.689> to<00:03:30.959> ride<00:03:31.139> on<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.409> road<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.829> not<00:03:31.949> all

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
nicer to ride on the road and not all

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.300 
nicer to ride on the road and not all
its<00:03:32.549> power<00:03:32.819> up<00:03:33.150> in<00:03:33.359> the<00:03:33.449> top-end

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
its power up in the top-end

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.129 
its power up in the top-end
ok<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.370> they're<00:03:35.939> available<00:03:36.030> in<00:03:36.540> stores<00:03:36.810> now
