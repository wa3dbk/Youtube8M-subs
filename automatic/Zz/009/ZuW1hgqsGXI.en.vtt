00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello everyone guys here break down 117 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.400
 welcome to this new video on 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.560
 fight this we'll talk about 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.389
 silencer quality defects for and against 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.849
 when it is convenient to use it if convenient 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.469
 when not before but I want to tell you that 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.540
 the clips that are in the background 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.520
 simply gameplay made in 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.630
 maps 9 indra managed precisely have it 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.980
 put no gameplay with the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.689
 silencer because essentially not 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.850
 I think he has the slightest certain sense 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.590
 you could see for example who shoots 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.000
 of enemies and their allies do not 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.900
 see or that therefore I can take myself to 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.609
 home of the killings 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.810
 but this thing could also be 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.669
 due to the fact that they cannot use 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.649
 my map so I don't have that 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.350
 on the same then we say that the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.820
 result of the clips made 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.950
 this purpose could also be 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.780
 simply failed is not a merit 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.309
 from the accessory itself but the fault of the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.989
 opponents themselves queen let's say I have 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.730
 favorite to take them in the pendragon game 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.920
 street the novelty of the moment and I think that 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.420
 interests you slightly more in each 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.219
 case let's not let's chat we give 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.840
 talk about the accessory silencer from 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.000
 mount on the barrel as an alternative to 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.430
 heavy barrel in the cold of mouth or 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.960
 the Turkish senses are the compensator 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.640
 four types but it is the exact same 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.309
 what a fuck doesn't change 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.780
 there is one standard plus 3 findable 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.939
 inside the battle packages one by 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.770
 each faction but are purely for one 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.510
 aesthetic factor have none 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.830
 influence on the game is not that it is more 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.259
 strong of another not carlo boy 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.330
 so let's avoid heart to talk about it 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.860
 very convenient site so sinti to the site 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.479
 to which I take the statistics for all 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.979
 this is my guide 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.840
 nice screen on the silencer on 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.920
 at the would be in English he says 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.720
 all the pros and cons 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.729
 how can you analyze some of them? 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.770
 quite unnecessary unnecessary stupid 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.630
 so why is not the pro of not 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.960
 be scalded on the mini map when 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.460
 you shoot and the device the malus to have 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.350
 of bullets that will travel to one 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.189
 speed lower than what they have of 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.110
 weapons base 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.060
 let's take these two pros as parameters 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.500
 and against the question that now arises 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.950
 spontaneous will therefore be convenient 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.899
 use the smith silencer 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.060
 let's say it's very occasional depends 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.829
 mainly from map mode and style 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.170
 of play because basically the 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.149
 should card is quite heavy the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.430
 speed of projectiles divides 300 meters at 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.689
 second and much slower than that 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.210
 they have basell weapons that sometimes 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.240
 reaches 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.369
 also 700 studios of 18 so this is a 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.750
 the heavy bass on the other hand however the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.950
 can the possibility of not being 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.450
 just spit on the mini map 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.890
 could give me an advantage in certain 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.569
 circumstances and therefore we see 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.310
 just the latter first of all the 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.540
 question to ask is how you are playing 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.010
 alone or with friends 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.959
 the question may seem enough 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.850
 stupid at first but think about it 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.160
 if what you yourself are looking for 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.380
 to move on its own precisely because it is not 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.940
 being able to communicate with others 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.110
 however, he tries to do a little by himself 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.150
 charge for stone does not rely 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.160
 too much on others for me at least so if 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.200
 I don't know that it can give me the certainty of 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.850
 scripts from a given side control e 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.110
 I rather that side rather than 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.610
 c is so stupid because 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.500
 rightly the rigid protocol of 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.060
 people who don't want to team up 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.890
 I will be but for me it works like this 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.690
 sincerely tends to play a way one 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.040
 a little bit more lonely while they are 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.959
 with friends maybe we want to move 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.690
 to that group here depends if the group 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.950
 if it wants to have been or not that is if 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.510
 I'm the only bitch to have the 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.709
 silencer if they shoot they see me 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.120
 the same so what changes that not 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.739
 they see me know that in that area there 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.780
 they are my companions but they are also 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.950
 maybe find me by chance but they find me 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.140
 so let's say it would be useless 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.340
 use a silencer while se 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.799
 we all agree we have 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.750
 all billions silenced and whiskers 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.820
 precisely those as they are called shadow 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.989
 something like that you don't 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.640
 they make us move longer 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.230
 exploit it as such already a 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.700
 little thought we could do with it 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.470
 we all go without votes when 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.910
 everyone is wrong nobody sees us and 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.130
 let's do the kids a little bit like this 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.260
 here the speech is simple however this 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.610
 not enough to say it seems useful 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.410
 you also need to see the type of mode 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.940
 there are euro modes from the time in 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.590
 this accessory more or less useful for 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.030
 example in the running could be useful 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.130
 the moment you see a park 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.170
 you see an opportunity you can 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.400
 infiltrate enemy lines to do 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.930
 some killing get to place the 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.940
 bomb that could have some sort of 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.290
 useful because in any case maybe you are from 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.359
 you just don't want to miss it while 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.739
 having reached your goal then it will be enough 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.660
 simply defend it here too 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.280
 could have some sort of utility and 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.870
 so here a sense could have it 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.459
 this argument can be applied for 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.720
 the mode that would be yes type seeks 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.680
 it destroys the beginning or I don't remember 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.510
 what it's called the one that looks like 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.820
 to the present mode with any 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.160
 another fps with the converse tranche that one 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.080
 of that where there is a life 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.220
 boris becker round of sincerely not 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.720
 I remember what it's called in this 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.010
 Title the mode as some li 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.360
 it may be useful not to do it 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.640
 run away when you get home 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.290
 killing is a there will be here I already took 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.120
 a little bit bigger than the 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.400
 standard mode where there is the respons 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.500
 so it might make sense mode 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.730
 as a conquest instead where 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.290
 basically to make goals for 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.660
 take points you have to stay in a group with 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.670
 others because you will rarely be able to 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.520
 end up alone undisturbed because 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.500
 precisely in 32 against 32 5 flags the 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.210
 enemy tends to try to defend the 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.350
 his flags and maybe here he could 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.880
 be of little use because maybe a 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.860
 your partner manara even if it is not 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.410
 with you upstairs to the floor of 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.510
 below right to left and bright that 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.160
 there is the presence of micheli then 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.900
 he could even find you and kill you 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.560
 precisely in my opinion it is not much not to say 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.540
 in these cases 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.370
 finally, the last parameter you need 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.990
 take into account the map seem 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.430
 really stupid like what because it says 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.230
 which changes from one stage to another 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.450
 they are all the same map us 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.400
 fuck personally i think some 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.780
 milk the silencer is a blast in 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.880
 others we know what useful that can 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.790
 be an example first guide of the weapons 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.830
 what months it was on sar 21 and the clips were 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.630
 almost all recorded in storm pa 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.980
 lager where the map is a fucking 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.110
 cool to use the silencer 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.520
 simply because with all the islets 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.920
 that there are with taxara that you will have to do 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.930
 feet often you will be moving by 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.940
 only these only to fairies are from 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.080
 alone to move less do not risk than in 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.730
 a corridor like any other 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.470
 ally no maybe I dream between 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.600
 will be between islands and could 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.890
 happen to meet an enemy in that 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.900
 journey have king scientist could 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.220
 actually help you not to not give up 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.240
 disclose to all opponents the 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.280
 presence yes certain 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.020
 then when you want to conquer the 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.970
 actually flags you will not be 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.440
 cassol there are others but the important 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.110
 even getting there must say in these 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.510
 cases the sense torino map is useful as 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.950
 this is very nice in my opinion 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.090
 speech instead is not valid for tables 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.500
 country you think 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.940
 that map could also be 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.600
 there are plenty of flags, but 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.490
 think about it 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.410
 how many times you are in the middle of norcia di 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.669
 bullets and ammunition grenades that 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.840
 fly right and left as many times 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:02.370
 you are in the action 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.780
 just think of the flags anymore 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.200
 fought those al 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.390
 center 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.190
 often the enemies were the comrades going 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.510
 even on the roof ok maybe you are 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.370
 just grounded the silenced weapon 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.900
 done by those above you who maybe there is a 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.460
 your partner who is shooting in one 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.230
 enemy silencer sees the dot to the 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.060
 his map obviously does not know if you have over 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.560
 under it, however, an eye throws it the same 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.750
 even if it's not at the same level 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.610
 maybe enemy and find you there is some 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.390
 case like this sincerely the 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.550
 I really find the silencer 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.870
 superfluous because it is found anyway 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.610
 to be so much in contact with i 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.870
 your allies that the effect of not doing 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.910
 really dispute an effect 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.620
 secondary and not too important 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.570
 summing up guys it's worth it 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.770
 they used the basic silencer 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.690
 King scientist without more will take 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.340
 you lack your enemies but theirs 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.470
 they don't know where you are yours 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.750
 comrades of the dead enemy know it from 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.670
 where they shot and turned a little 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.800
 lost you can put it inside the 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.540
 own chip sincerely puts without 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.520
 let you dig yourself in the slightest so you have 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.890
 a surprise factor but in the moment in 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.180
 where the opponent knows where you are at fault 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.770
 of your allies or things of this 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.420
 generally no use because you want 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.400
 you will simply have a harmonk the most 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.870
 therefore weak from a technical point of view 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.520
 in that case it is only a malus 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.990
 so guys hope this video 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.220

 don't use yes I like to use it on

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.480
