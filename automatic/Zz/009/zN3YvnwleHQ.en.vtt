00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.519
 digital had the option of the first 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.110
 Unfortunately it samsung galaxy s 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.420
 left the line leaving as an alternative 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.730
 some Chinese appliances of provenance 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.770
 very dubious quality but 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.869

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.019
 Let's confuse something. 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.780
 clear 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.219
 outside the name the ecv has almost nothing to 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.440
