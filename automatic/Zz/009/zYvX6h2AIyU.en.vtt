which is really nice it's not moving
around<00:01:16.460> got<00:01:17.460> my<00:01:17.580> Forge<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.420> up<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.050> running

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
around got my Forge here up and running

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.630 
around got my Forge here up and running
and<00:01:20.920> uh<00:01:21.750> got<00:01:22.750> my<00:01:22.930> pit<00:01:23.290> controller<00:01:23.740> right<00:01:24.370> there

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
and uh got my pit controller right there

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.960 
and uh got my pit controller right there
have<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.000> set<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.840> hold<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:26.890> at<00:01:27.040> 2100<00:01:27.730> degrees

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
have it set to hold it at 2100 degrees

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.490 
have it set to hold it at 2100 degrees
which<00:01:28.450> I<00:01:28.570> find<00:01:28.810> works<00:01:29.020> really<00:01:29.080> good<00:01:29.440> for

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
which I find works really good for

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.070 
which I find works really good for
forging<00:01:31.110> forging<00:01:32.110> l6

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
forging forging l6

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.880 
forging forging l6
I<00:01:34.980> just<00:01:35.430> put<00:01:35.580> this<00:01:35.730> little<00:01:36.170> plate<00:01:37.170> back<00:01:37.470> little

that worked this press was really good
if<00:01:50.080> I<00:01:50.230> have<00:01:50.320> my<00:01:50.440> unit<00:01:50.710> my<00:01:50.800> flat<00:01:51.070> died<00:01:51.280> and<00:01:51.640> then

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
if I have my unit my flat died and then

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.300 
if I have my unit my flat died and then
my<00:01:52.080> drawing<00:01:53.080> died<00:01:53.320> on<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.530> top<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:53.980> can<00:01:54.190> do

it's got like a little twisty knob on
that<00:05:07.520> side<00:05:07.760> it<00:05:08.060> clamps<00:05:08.480> on<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:08.870> it<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:10.510> and<00:05:11.510> I

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
that side it clamps on to it and and I

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.270 
that side it clamps on to it and and I
just<00:05:11.810> step<00:05:12.080> on<00:05:12.230> the<00:05:12.260> little<00:05:12.560> lever<00:05:12.710> like<00:05:12.950> such
