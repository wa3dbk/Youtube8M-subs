rockiness of it this is part 2 of the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.500 
rockiness of it this is part 2 of the
video<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.110> I'm<00:02:29.200> not<00:02:29.410> using<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:30.130> internal<00:02:30.730> the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
video so I'm not using the internal the

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.970 
video so I'm not using the internal the
external<00:02:31.960> mic<00:02:32.110> I'm<00:02:32.620> using<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.190> internal<00:02:33.760> mic

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
external mic I'm using the internal mic

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.890 
external mic I'm using the internal mic
so<00:02:35.980> just<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.370> case<00:02:36.490> you<00:02:36.700> do<00:02:36.880> hear<00:02:37.330> audio

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
so just in case you do hear audio

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.590 
so just in case you do hear audio
difference<00:02:38.530> that's<00:02:39.040> why<00:02:39.300> I'm<00:02:40.300> standing

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
difference that's why I'm standing

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.200 
difference that's why I'm standing
roughly<00:02:40.990> or<00:02:41.490> you<00:02:42.490> know<00:02:42.580> holding<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.000> camera

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
roughly or you know holding the camera

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.720 
roughly or you know holding the camera
roughly<00:02:43.630> about<00:02:44.070> four<00:02:45.070> or<00:02:45.100> five<00:02:45.220> inches<00:02:45.520> away

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
roughly about four or five inches away

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.450 
roughly about four or five inches away
from<00:02:45.910> my<00:02:46.180> face

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.650 

so

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.940 

or
