sure<00:05:00.620> it's<00:05:00.889> around<00:05:01.040> 12<00:05:01.639> 99<00:05:02.030> around<00:05:02.540> that<00:05:02.780> price

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
sure it's around 12 99 around that price

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.460 
sure it's around 12 99 around that price
range<00:05:03.729> so<00:05:04.729> it's<00:05:04.970> a<00:05:05.060> pretty<00:05:05.240> good<00:05:05.540> value<00:05:06.050> i'd

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470
