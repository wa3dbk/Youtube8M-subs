00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.700
 of controversy among gamers 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.980
 price it is 18 in that it is not so 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.020
 Cheap and really gets the doubt if it 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.260
 replaces it or if it brings more benefits 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.330
 than an expensive keyboard starting at 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.640
 fact that he is a mechanic, he already has 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.130
 mechanical keys rather than keyboards 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.740

 absurdly expensive space we see the

 dcs players fps players 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.709

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.160
 a position where to him 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.420
 already the not so comfortable but effective there 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.310

 you can put the keyboard away and 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.130
 stay focused on the mouse in the game 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.840
 pad does not replace the keyboard this is something 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.430

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.710
 things it is basically to even play 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.790

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.740
 side of your mouse 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.780
 Another important bill item is the
