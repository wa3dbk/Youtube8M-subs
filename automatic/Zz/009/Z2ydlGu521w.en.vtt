00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
though this mod only has two of blocks

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.200 
though this mod only has two of blocks
added<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.320> that's<00:00:25.470> all<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.099> needs<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:27.000> first

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
added and that's all it needs the first

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.390

one<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.840> wireless<00:00:28.380> transmitter<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
one is the wireless transmitter and the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.009 
one is the wireless transmitter and the
way<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.730> craft<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.359> for<00:00:30.689> iron

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
way that you craft this is for iron

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.990 
way that you craft this is for iron
ingots<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.500> two<00:00:31.619> corners<00:00:31.980> with<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> ring<00:00:32.880> of

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
ingots in two corners with a ring of

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.360 
ingots in two corners with a ring of
redstone<00:00:33.329> around<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.960> redstone<00:00:34.320> torch<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:35.010> you

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
redstone around a redstone torch and you

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.160 
redstone around a redstone torch and you
will<00:00:35.489> receive<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.880> wireless<00:00:36.540> transmitter

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
will receive the wireless transmitter

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.990 
will receive the wireless transmitter
now<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.739> will<00:00:37.980> need<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.250> transmitter<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
now you will need the transmitter to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.180 
now you will need the transmitter to
actually<00:00:39.510> transmit<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> Redstone<00:00:40.920> hence

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
actually transmit to the Redstone hence

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.150 
actually transmit to the Redstone hence
the<00:00:41.520> transmitter<00:00:42.270> side<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.050> name<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the transmitter side of the name and the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.279 
the transmitter side of the name and the
next<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.610> wireless<00:00:45.030> receiver<00:00:45.510> which<00:00:46.050> I'm

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
next is the wireless receiver which I'm

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.810 
next is the wireless receiver which I'm
pretty<00:00:46.620> sure<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.920> guys<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.280> guess<00:00:47.489> what<00:00:47.700> this

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
pretty sure you guys can guess what this

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.610 
pretty sure you guys can guess what this
one<00:00:47.879> does<00:00:48.120> now<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.840> only<00:00:49.079> difference<00:00:49.289> between

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
one does now the only difference between

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.760 
one does now the only difference between
this<00:00:50.039> recipe<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:50.969> one<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.629> instead<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
this recipe and that one is instead of a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.760 
this recipe and that one is instead of a
redstone<00:00:53.190> torch<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:54.120> need<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.539> lever<00:00:54.870> now<00:00:55.500> all

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
redstone torch you need a lever now all

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.010 
redstone torch you need a lever now all
we<00:00:55.920> gotta<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.309> go<00:00:57.000> ahead<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.780> these

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
we gotta do is go ahead and get these

amazing machinery now of course all you
have<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.840> adjust<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.799> frequency<00:01:05.400> by

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
have to do is adjust the frequency by

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.580 
have to do is adjust the frequency by
right<00:01:05.939> clicking<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.510> them<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.840> adding<00:01:07.380> what

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
right clicking of them and adding what

9000 which I think you don't need to go
quite<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.450> far<00:01:18.689> now<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.530> course<00:01:19.680> we're<00:01:19.950> just

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
quite that far now of course we're just

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.740 
quite that far now of course we're just
gonna<00:01:20.189> go<00:01:20.369> ahead<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.700> set<00:01:20.939> these<00:01:21.060> frequencies

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
gonna go ahead and set these frequencies

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.800 
gonna go ahead and set these frequencies
to<00:01:22.049> one<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:22.950> long<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.850> blocks<00:01:24.240> are<00:01:24.450> set

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
to one and as long as the blocks are set

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.690 
to one and as long as the blocks are set
at<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.170> same<00:01:25.409> frequency<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.220> they<00:01:26.400> will

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
at the same frequency and they will

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.130 
at the same frequency and they will
connect<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.210> each<00:01:27.330> other<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.720> let's<00:01:27.869> go<00:01:27.960> ahead

not<00:01:39.689> touching<00:01:40.079> each<00:01:40.170> other<00:01:40.350> no<00:01:40.799> hidden<00:01:41.070> wires

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
not touching each other no hidden wires

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.609 
not touching each other no hidden wires
included<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.780> wirelessly

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
included and it is wirelessly

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.399 
included and it is wirelessly
transmitting<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:45.090> redstone<00:01:45.689> now<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.229> course

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
transmitting the redstone now of course

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.830 
transmitting the redstone now of course
this<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.770> an<00:01:46.950> impressive<00:01:47.340> feat<00:01:47.549> but<00:01:48.210> let's<00:01:48.689> go

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
this is an impressive feat but let's go

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.440 
this is an impressive feat but let's go
ahead<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.200> put<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.950> larger<00:01:50.490> scale<00:01:50.880> by

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
ahead and put this on a larger scale by

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.200 
ahead and put this on a larger scale by
lighting<00:01:51.990> up<00:01:52.229> an<00:01:52.439> entire<00:01:52.799> mountaintop<00:01:53.640> so

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
lighting up an entire mountaintop so

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.700 
lighting up an entire mountaintop so
let's<00:01:54.360> go<00:01:54.450> ahead<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.780> head<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.170> over<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.470> this

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
let's go ahead and head on over to this

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.830 
let's go ahead and head on over to this
one<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.340> preset<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.000> these<00:01:57.180> frequencies

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
one I have preset to these frequencies

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.810 
one I have preset to these frequencies
to<00:01:58.200> ten<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.070> let's<00:01:59.219> go<00:01:59.340> ahead<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.670> pull

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
to ten so let's go ahead and pull

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.359 
to ten so let's go ahead and pull
another<00:02:00.360> lever<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.990> as<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.710> can<00:02:01.860> see<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
another lever and as you can see the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.580 
another lever and as you can see the
mountainside<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.119> completely<00:02:03.810> lit<00:02:04.020> up<00:02:04.140> but

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
mountainside is completely lit up but

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.260 
mountainside is completely lit up but
how<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.950> do<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.369> there<00:02:05.579> are<00:02:05.729> multiple

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
how do I do this there are multiple

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.779 
how do I do this there are multiple
receivers<00:02:06.719> -<00:02:07.140> only<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:07.710> transmitter<00:02:08.280> well

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
receivers - only one transmitter well

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.669 
receivers - only one transmitter well
that<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.090> where<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.450> frequencies<00:02:10.050> come<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.470> as

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
that is where the frequencies come in as

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.850 
that is where the frequencies come in as
long<00:02:11.160> as<00:02:11.340> there<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.750> same<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.260> frequency

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
long as there is the same of frequency

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.610 
long as there is the same of frequency
the<00:02:14.430> transmitter<00:02:15.000> as<00:02:15.210> well<00:02:15.570> as<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.050> receivers

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
the transmitter as well as the receivers

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.500 
the transmitter as well as the receivers
they<00:02:17.130> will<00:02:17.460> connect<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.000> each<00:02:18.120> other<00:02:18.270> no

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
they will connect to each other no

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.690 
they will connect to each other no
matter<00:02:18.660> how<00:02:18.990> many<00:02:19.650> receivers<00:02:20.310> there<00:02:20.520> are

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
matter how many receivers there are

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.670 
matter how many receivers there are
connected<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.330> transmitter<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.110> course<00:02:22.470> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
connected to a transmitter of course the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.470 
connected to a transmitter of course the
transmitter<00:02:23.160> there<00:02:23.460> can<00:02:23.580> only<00:02:23.670> be<00:02:23.820> one<00:02:23.940> but

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
transmitter there can only be one but

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.660 
transmitter there can only be one but
why<00:02:24.810> would<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.110> want<00:02:25.320> more<00:02:25.590> than<00:02:25.740> one<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.130> if

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
why would you want more than one and if

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.010 
why would you want more than one and if
we<00:02:26.790> go<00:02:26.910> ahead<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.270> break<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.630> block<00:02:27.840> and

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
we go ahead and break that block and

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.810 
we go ahead and break that block and
look<00:02:28.170> down<00:02:28.350> here<00:02:28.560> there<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.280> 10<00:02:29.520> on<00:02:29.670> this

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
look down here there is a 10 on this

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.520 
look down here there is a 10 on this
meaning<00:02:30.210> it<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.480> they<00:02:30.630> are<00:02:30.660> running<00:02:31.200> off<00:02:31.500> of

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
meaning it that they are running off of

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.830 
meaning it that they are running off of
the<00:02:31.710> same<00:02:32.070> frequency<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:33.240> goes<00:02:33.450> for<00:02:33.810> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
the same frequency that goes for the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.840 
the same frequency that goes for the
same<00:02:34.110> for<00:02:34.380> this<00:02:34.500> one<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.220> one<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.670> all

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
same for this one and that one and all

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.660 
same for this one and that one and all
the<00:02:35.880> ones<00:02:36.090> above<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.810> now<00:02:37.320> of<00:02:37.590> course<00:02:38.070> this<00:02:38.430> is

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
the ones above it now of course this is

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.820 
the ones above it now of course this is
a<00:02:38.700> fantastic<00:02:39.510> mod<00:02:39.990> for<00:02:40.230> all<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.590> red

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.770 
wiring all the way up to that mountain
that<00:02:49.530> would<00:02:49.680> be<00:02:49.860> ridiculous<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.390> really

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
