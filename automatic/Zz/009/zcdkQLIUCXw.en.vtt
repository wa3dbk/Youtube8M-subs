lighten it up now give us some depth of

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.220 
lighten it up now give us some depth of
field<00:04:06.560> what<00:04:07.160> do<00:04:07.220> you<00:04:07.310> think<00:04:07.549> ok<00:04:08.150> I<00:04:08.360> just<00:04:09.049> would

field what do you think ok I just would

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:20.210 
field what do you think ok I just would
be<00:04:09.380> a<00:04:09.410> spiral<00:04:09.950> coming<00:04:10.280> towards<00:04:10.579> us

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.430 

and<00:04:20.760> this<00:04:20.910> is<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.120> spiral<00:04:21.480> going<00:04:21.870> away<00:04:21.959> from<00:04:22.260> us

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
and this is a spiral going away from us

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:30.470 
and this is a spiral going away from us
here

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.910 

and<00:04:31.050> they're<00:04:31.170> leaning<00:04:31.380> on<00:04:31.680> this<00:04:31.920> kind<00:04:32.670> of

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
and they're leaning on this kind of

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.730 
and they're leaning on this kind of
alcohol

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.600 

there's<00:04:40.430> our<00:04:40.550> finish<00:04:41.020> okay<00:04:42.020> lots<00:04:42.889> of<00:04:43.069> action

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.920 

but<00:04:46.610> if<00:04:46.729> you<00:04:46.819> think<00:04:46.849> about<00:04:47.150> it<00:04:47.360> it's<00:04:47.660> really

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
but if you think about it it's really

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.120 
but if you think about it it's really
fairly<00:04:48.349> simple<00:04:48.889> in<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:50.000> story<00:04:50.330> okay<00:04:51.130> however

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
fairly simple in the story okay however

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.999 
fairly simple in the story okay however
a<00:04:52.160> roller<00:04:52.370> coaster<00:04:52.910> going<00:04:53.120> back<00:04:53.479> and<00:04:53.870> up<00:04:54.650> and

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
a roller coaster going back and up and

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:05.430 
a roller coaster going back and up and
around<00:04:57.699> okay<00:04:59.949> three<00:05:00.949> different<00:05:01.220> lands
