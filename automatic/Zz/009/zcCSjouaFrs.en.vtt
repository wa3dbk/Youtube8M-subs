got<00:02:48.209> some<00:02:48.390> better<00:02:48.569> lighting<00:02:48.959> so<00:02:49.140> before<00:02:49.409> I<00:02:49.440> cut

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
got some better lighting so before I cut

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.350 
got some better lighting so before I cut
this<00:02:49.739> thing<00:02:49.950> open<00:02:50.129> here's<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.700> close-up<00:02:51.060> of

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
this thing open here's a close-up of

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.210 
this thing open here's a close-up of
that<00:02:51.420> point<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:51.900> entry<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.769> bullet<00:02:53.040> for

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
that point of entry and the bullet for

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.830 
that point of entry and the bullet for
comparison<00:02:53.819> so<00:02:54.330> obviously<00:02:54.569> what<00:02:54.750> we're

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
comparison so obviously what we're

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.600 
comparison so obviously what we're
looking<00:02:55.319> for<00:02:55.349> is<00:02:55.650> their<00:02:55.799> permanent<00:02:56.250> cavity

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
looking for is their permanent cavity

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.030 
looking for is their permanent cavity
and<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.299> penetration<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:58.049> that<00:02:58.230> 64<00:02:58.799> grand

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
and the penetration of that 64 grand

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.970 
and the penetration of that 64 grand
soft<00:02:59.430> point<00:02:59.670> quick<00:03:00.629> lock<00:03:00.840> at<00:03:01.110> one<00:03:01.500> side<00:03:01.769> of

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
soft point quick lock at one side of

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.770 
soft point quick lock at one side of
this<00:03:02.099> track<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.640> second<00:03:03.030> track<00:03:03.239> has<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.480> lot

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
this track the second track has a lot

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.199 
this track the second track has a lot
more<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.409> but<00:03:05.010> we<00:03:05.220> have<00:03:05.459> expansion

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
more in it but we have expansion

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.270 
more in it but we have expansion
beginning<00:03:06.480> about<00:03:06.599> an<00:03:06.750> inch<00:03:06.900> in<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.739> this<00:03:08.099> is

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
beginning about an inch in and this is

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.009 
beginning about an inch in and this is
just<00:03:08.549> unbelievable<00:03:09.209> right<00:03:09.390> here<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:09.659> peel<00:03:09.900> that

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
just unbelievable right here I peel that

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.860 
just unbelievable right here I peel that
back<00:03:10.079> so<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.709> can<00:03:10.920> see<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.940> also<00:03:12.180> runs<00:03:12.569> down

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
back so you can see it it also runs down

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.589 
back so you can see it it also runs down
underneath<00:03:13.260> there<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.849> that's<00:03:15.180> pretty

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
underneath there that is that's pretty

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.979 
underneath there that is that's pretty
wicked<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.650> this<00:03:17.069> is<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.400> possibly<00:03:17.970> two<00:03:18.359> and<00:03:18.810> a

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
wicked so this is a possibly two and a

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.830 
wicked so this is a possibly two and a
half<00:03:19.200> inches<00:03:19.650> almost<00:03:20.549> 3<00:03:20.970> inches<00:03:21.000> running<00:03:21.690> that

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
half inches almost 3 inches running that

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.660 
half inches almost 3 inches running that
direction<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:23.099> it<00:03:23.370> goes<00:03:23.579> out<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:24.120> about<00:03:24.510> the

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
direction and it goes out to about the

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.110 
direction and it goes out to about the
let's<00:03:26.670> say<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.470> five<00:03:28.470> maybe<00:03:29.340> five<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.090> half

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
let's say the five maybe five and a half

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.059 
let's say the five maybe five and a half
inch<00:03:30.540> mark<00:03:30.959> let's<00:03:31.379> take<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.560> look<00:03:31.829> at<00:03:31.950> the

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
inch mark let's take a look at the

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.000 
inch mark let's take a look at the
second<00:03:32.489> half<00:03:32.519> of<00:03:32.849> this<00:03:33.620> alright<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:34.859> here's

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
second half of this alright and here's

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.890 
second half of this alright and here's
the<00:03:35.129> second<00:03:35.519> half<00:03:35.670> this<00:03:35.879> is<00:03:36.060> primarily<00:03:36.510> the

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
the second half this is primarily the

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.660 
the second half this is primarily the
biggest<00:03:37.260> part<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.739> based<00:03:37.950> on<00:03:38.069> how<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.250> cut<00:03:38.549> it

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
biggest part of it based on how I cut it

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.699 
biggest part of it based on how I cut it
down<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.940> middle<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.299> block<00:03:39.709> expansion

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
down the middle that block expansion

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.440 
down the middle that block expansion
here<00:03:40.920> shows<00:03:41.220> that<00:03:41.459> starts<00:03:41.760> about<00:03:42.000> half<00:03:42.269> an

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
here shows that starts about half an

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.910 
here shows that starts about half an
inch<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:42.810> this<00:03:42.959> side<00:03:43.019> so<00:03:43.470> let's<00:03:43.650> call<00:03:43.799> it

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
inch on this side so let's call it

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.710 
inch on this side so let's call it
happiness<00:03:44.340> from<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:44.609> first<00:03:44.849> half<00:03:45.090> as<00:03:45.299> well

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
happiness from that first half as well

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.449 
happiness from that first half as well
but<00:03:46.109> you<00:03:46.200> look<00:03:46.319> at<00:03:46.409> this<00:03:46.530> cavitation<00:03:47.280> that

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
but you look at this cavitation that

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.720 
but you look at this cavitation that
begins<00:03:47.879> at<00:03:48.180> about<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:49.099> one<00:03:50.099> and<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.280> half<00:03:50.459> two

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
begins at about the one and a half two

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.580 
begins at about the one and a half two
inch<00:03:50.970> mark<00:03:51.269> that's<00:03:51.780> about<00:03:52.109> an<00:03:52.260> inch<00:03:52.349> and<00:03:52.560> a

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
inch mark that's about an inch and a

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.159 
inch mark that's about an inch and a
half<00:03:52.620> across<00:03:53.010> there<00:03:53.549> but<00:03:53.700> notice<00:03:54.000> this<00:03:54.209> that

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
half across there but notice this that

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.339 
half across there but notice this that
blew<00:03:55.560> out<00:03:55.829> that<00:03:56.700> whole<00:03:56.970> section<00:03:57.359> so<00:03:58.139> if<00:03:58.230> you

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
blew out that whole section so if you

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.119 
blew out that whole section so if you
measure<00:03:58.560> from<00:03:58.859> the<00:03:58.980> top<00:03:59.190> of<00:03:59.489> that<00:04:00.769> and<00:04:01.769> look<00:04:02.010> at

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
measure from the top of that and look at

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.400 
measure from the top of that and look at
that<00:04:02.310> that<00:04:02.669> is<00:04:03.030> an<00:04:03.359> inch<00:04:03.599> and<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.810> quarter<00:04:04.019> deep

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
that that is an inch and a quarter deep

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.220 
that that is an inch and a quarter deep
where<00:04:04.650> I've<00:04:04.739> got<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:05.129> peel<00:04:05.400> back<00:04:06.169> we're<00:04:07.169> at

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
where I've got that peel back we're at

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.039 
where I've got that peel back we're at
the<00:04:07.410> five<00:04:07.709> six<00:04:08.160> inch<00:04:08.400> mark<00:04:08.700> this<00:04:09.180> continues<00:04:09.810> on

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
the five six inch mark this continues on

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.039 
the five six inch mark this continues on
so<00:04:10.680> this<00:04:10.859> is<00:04:10.919> some<00:04:11.250> pretty<00:04:11.549> impressive

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
so this is some pretty impressive

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.210 
so this is some pretty impressive
cavitation<00:04:13.049> that<00:04:13.620> runs<00:04:13.919> for<00:04:14.129> approximately

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
cavitation that runs for approximately

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.539 
cavitation that runs for approximately
the<00:04:14.790> half-inch<00:04:15.359> mark<00:04:15.739> to<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.919> eight<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.430> a

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
the half-inch mark to the eight and a

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.699 
the half-inch mark to the eight and a
half<00:04:17.579> inch<00:04:18.120> mark<00:04:18.389> Wow

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
half inch mark Wow

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.900 
half inch mark Wow
that<00:04:19.919> is<00:04:20.510> you<00:04:21.510> know<00:04:21.630> really<00:04:21.930> talking<00:04:22.320> about

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
that is you know really talking about

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.969 
that is you know really talking about
1150<00:04:23.910> 1200<00:04:24.599> foot-pounds<00:04:25.380> of<00:04:25.440> energy<00:04:25.560> at<00:04:25.949> that

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
1150 1200 foot-pounds of energy at that

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.339 
1150 1200 foot-pounds of energy at that
distance<00:04:26.510> that's<00:04:27.510> doing<00:04:27.750> quite<00:04:27.780> a<00:04:27.990> bit<00:04:28.199> of

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
distance that's doing quite a bit of

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.439 
distance that's doing quite a bit of
quite<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:28.860> bit<00:04:29.039> of<00:04:29.130> damage<00:04:29.370> but<00:04:30.060> here's<00:04:30.270> the

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
quite a bit of damage but here's the

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.870 
quite a bit of damage but here's the
trade<00:04:30.750> off<00:04:30.960> there's<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:31.949> bullet<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.520> look<00:04:32.760> at

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
trade off there's the bullet and look at

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.390 
trade off there's the bullet and look at
the<00:04:32.940> penetration<00:04:33.389> that's<00:04:34.020> coming<00:04:34.410> in<00:04:34.590> at<00:04:34.800> ten

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
the penetration that's coming in at ten

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.070 
the penetration that's coming in at ten
and<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.639> half<00:04:35.820> inches<00:04:36.300> with<00:04:36.479> the<00:04:36.570> leading<00:04:36.780> edge

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
and a half inches with the leading edge

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.529 
and a half inches with the leading edge
measured<00:04:37.620> here<00:04:37.949> and<00:04:38.160> I<00:04:38.760> believe<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.210> reason

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
measured here and I believe the reason

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.589 
measured here and I believe the reason
why<00:04:39.720> we<00:04:40.020> had<00:04:40.910> such<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:41.940> low<00:04:42.210> amount<00:04:42.360> of

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
why we had such a low amount of

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.839 
why we had such a low amount of
penetration<00:04:43.199> at<00:04:43.289> least<00:04:43.530> low<00:04:43.770> relative<00:04:44.760> to

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
penetration at least low relative to

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.390 
penetration at least low relative to
what<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.060> was<00:04:45.270> thinking<00:04:45.660> we<00:04:45.780> were<00:04:45.870> going<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.199> get

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
what I was thinking we were going to get

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.040 
what I was thinking we were going to get
that's<00:04:47.400> really<00:04:47.669> stuck<00:04:47.970> in<00:04:48.150> there<00:04:48.360> I'll<00:04:48.690> pull

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
that's really stuck in there I'll pull

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.480 
that's really stuck in there I'll pull
this<00:04:49.169> out<00:04:49.410> here<00:04:49.590> just<00:04:49.710> a<00:04:49.860> second<00:04:50.250> get<00:04:50.370> it

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
this out here just a second get it

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.779 
this out here just a second get it
cleaned<00:04:50.760> up<00:04:50.940> but<00:04:51.270> at<00:04:51.660> a<00:04:51.720> glance<00:04:52.610> notice<00:04:53.610> how

cleaned up but at a glance notice how

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.420 
cleaned up but at a glance notice how
