really<00:02:42.269> nice<00:02:42.720> prior<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.620> coloring<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.610> the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
really nice prior to coloring it the

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.080 
really nice prior to coloring it the
bundles<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.630> curls<00:02:45.930> on<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.230> bundles

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
bundles the curls on the bundles

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.729 
bundles the curls on the bundles
appeared<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.239> be<00:02:48.269> a<00:02:48.390> lot<00:02:48.750> looser<00:02:49.380> than<00:02:49.410> they

were before coloring and I understand
that<00:02:52.110> could<00:02:52.230> happen<00:02:52.380> when<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.830> die<00:02:53.010> hair<00:02:53.370> it

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.970 
that could happen when you die hair it

out I apply that I left it on it
recommended<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.060> believe<00:03:06.390> two<00:03:06.630> minutes<00:03:06.930> but<00:03:07.079> I

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
recommended I believe two minutes but I

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.900 
recommended I believe two minutes but I
left<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.410> on<00:03:07.530> for<00:03:07.590> two<00:03:07.920> minutes<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.400> then<00:03:08.880> I

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
left it on for two minutes and then I

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.759 
left it on for two minutes and then I
rinsed<00:03:09.239> it<00:03:09.329> out<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.720> curls<00:03:10.049> popped<00:03:10.530> back

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
rinsed it out and the curls popped back

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.250 
rinsed it out and the curls popped back
in<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.310> don't<00:03:11.640> think<00:03:11.910> it's<00:03:12.060> as<00:03:12.299> curly<00:03:12.810> as<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.109> was

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
in I don't think it's as curly as it was

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.590 
in I don't think it's as curly as it was
prior<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.650> die<00:03:14.100> but<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:14.970> definitely<00:03:15.180> looks<00:03:15.480> a

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
prior to die but it definitely looks a

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.210 
prior to die but it definitely looks a
lot<00:03:15.810> better<00:03:16.079> than<00:03:16.380> it<00:03:16.410> did<00:03:16.650> after<00:03:16.859> the

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
lot better than it did after the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.039 
lot better than it did after the
bleaching<00:03:17.609> process<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.390> curl<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.720> definitely

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
bleaching process the curl is definitely

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.319 
bleaching process the curl is definitely

be<00:03:26.340> full<00:03:26.609> at<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:26.910> one<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.390> don't<00:03:27.870> really<00:03:27.959> have

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
be full at this one I don't really have

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.770 
be full at this one I don't really have
an<00:03:28.350> issue<00:03:28.500> with<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.980> fullness<00:03:29.660> I'm<00:03:30.660> not

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
an issue with the fullness I'm not

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.180 
an issue with the fullness I'm not
really<00:03:30.930> sure<00:03:31.049> about<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.470> cut<00:03:31.650> of<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.890> I<00:03:32.010> have<00:03:32.160> a

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
really sure about the cut of it I have a

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.819 
really sure about the cut of it I have a
basic<00:03:32.700> idea<00:03:32.820> but<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.900> think<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:34.440> could<00:03:34.590> probably

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
basic idea but I think I could probably

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.370 
basic idea but I think I could probably
go<00:03:35.130> in<00:03:35.280> some<00:03:35.549> more<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.060> trim<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.750> some<00:03:36.959> more<00:03:36.989> or

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
go in some more and trim it some more or

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.500 
go in some more and trim it some more or
cut<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.680> some<00:03:37.859> more<00:03:37.890> but<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.519> aside<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.480> think

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
cut it some more but that aside I think

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.289 
cut it some more but that aside I think
it's<00:03:39.900> beautiful<00:03:40.170> hair<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:40.890> love<00:03:41.340> love<00:03:41.790> love<00:03:42.000> the

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
it's beautiful hair I love love love the

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.210 
it's beautiful hair I love love love the
hair<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.780> just<00:03:43.350> hated<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.739> fact<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:44.010> the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
hair I just hated the fact that the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.220 
hair I just hated the fact that the
bundles<00:03:44.549> were<00:03:44.670> so<00:03:44.850> thin<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.480> did<00:03:45.780> take<00:03:46.079> this

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
bundles were so thin it did take this

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.080 
bundles were so thin it did take this
color<00:03:46.530> quite<00:03:46.829> nicely<00:03:47.069> because<00:03:47.430> this<00:03:47.730> is<00:03:47.910> the

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
color quite nicely because this is the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.090 
color quite nicely because this is the
exact<00:03:48.390> color<00:03:48.630> that<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.079> was<00:03:49.260> on<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.530> phone<00:03:49.799> box

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
exact color that it was on the phone box

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.210 
exact color that it was on the phone box
however<00:03:51.030> is<00:03:51.359> for<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.720> bleaching<00:03:52.220> the

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
however is for the bleaching the

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.130 
however is for the bleaching the
bleaching<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.850> bundles<00:03:54.239> didn't<00:03:54.569> really<00:03:54.750> take

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
bleaching the bundles didn't really take

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.949 
bleaching the bundles didn't really take
to<00:03:55.440> bleaching<00:03:55.799> that<00:03:56.760> well<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.450> closure

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
to bleaching that well the closure

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.140 
to bleaching that well the closure
bleach<00:03:58.380> really<00:03:59.040> easily<00:03:59.400> really<00:03:59.910> nicely

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
bleach really easily really nicely

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.800 
bleach really easily really nicely
lifted<00:04:00.720> perfectly<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.920> quickly<00:04:02.850> but<00:04:03.569> the

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
lifted perfectly and quickly but the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.629 
lifted perfectly and quickly but the
bundles<00:04:04.230> didn't<00:04:04.650> really<00:04:04.859> lived<00:04:05.069> as<00:04:05.280> quickly

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
bundles didn't really lived as quickly

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.360 
bundles didn't really lived as quickly
and

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
and

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.830 
and
but<00:04:06.489> let<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:06.700> color<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:07.360> was<00:04:07.450> becoming

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
but let the color that it was becoming

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.309 
but let the color that it was becoming
was<00:04:08.230> not<00:04:08.610> what<00:04:09.610> I<00:04:09.640> wanted<00:04:09.909> perhaps<00:04:10.840> if<00:04:11.080> I<00:04:11.200> had

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
was not what I wanted perhaps if I had

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.500 
was not what I wanted perhaps if I had
left<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.680> on<00:04:11.739> for<00:04:11.799> longer<00:04:12.250> maybe<00:04:12.610> an<00:04:12.849> hour<00:04:13.090> it

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
left it on for longer maybe an hour it

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.789 
left it on for longer maybe an hour it
would<00:04:13.629> have<00:04:13.780> lifted<00:04:13.959> to<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.260> plum<00:04:14.530> that<00:04:14.769> I

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
would have lifted to the plum that I

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.129 
would have lifted to the plum that I
wanted<00:04:15.220> but<00:04:15.879> I<00:04:15.940> was<00:04:16.479> nervous<00:04:16.660> about<00:04:16.900> doing

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139
