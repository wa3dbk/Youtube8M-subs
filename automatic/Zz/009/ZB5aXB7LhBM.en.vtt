and here we go this is actually a

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.650 
and here we go this is actually a
modular<00:01:52.730> design<00:01:52.760> right<00:01:53.240> here<00:01:53.450> which<00:01:53.630> means

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
modular design right here which means

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.060 
modular design right here which means
that<00:01:53.960> U<00:01:54.050> is<00:01:54.080> actually<00:01:54.530> upgraded<00:01:54.890> what

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
that U is actually upgraded what

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.260 
that U is actually upgraded what
everything<00:01:55.400> is<00:01:55.460> upgrade<00:01:55.820> was<00:01:55.970> a<00:01:56.000> look<00:01:56.150> at

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
everything is upgrade was a look at

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.660 
everything is upgrade was a look at
where<00:01:56.420> a<00:01:56.450> drive

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
where a drive

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.210 
where a drive
memory<00:01:58.450> everything<00:01:58.810> what<00:01:59.619> that<00:01:59.740> means<00:01:59.979> is

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
memory everything what that means is

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.070 
memory everything what that means is
that<00:02:00.250> instead<00:02:00.610> of<00:02:00.880> having<00:02:01.150> to<00:02:01.330> like<00:02:01.659> buy<00:02:01.780> a<00:02:01.810> new

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
that instead of having to like buy a new

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.080 
that instead of having to like buy a new
system<00:02:02.530> every<00:02:02.950> few<00:02:03.189> years<00:02:03.430> you<00:02:03.820> can<00:02:03.970> actually

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
system every few years you can actually

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:12.020 
system every few years you can actually
just<00:02:04.420> upgraded<00:02:04.960> to<00:02:04.990> each

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.870

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
right so what kind of processors are

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:25.690 
right so what kind of processors are
running

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.710
