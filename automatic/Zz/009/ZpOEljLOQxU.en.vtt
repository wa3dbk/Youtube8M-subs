00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
pieces can be separated now the there

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.270 
pieces can be separated now the there
are<00:01:24.420> rubber<00:01:24.659> pads<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> bottom<00:01:25.439> which<00:01:26.130> is

doesn't have any rail caps or a spray in
bedliner<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.740> rubber<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.189> just<00:01:32.310> going<00:01:32.400> to

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
bedliner this rubber is just going to

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.310 
bedliner this rubber is just going to
help<00:01:32.670> protect<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.210> surface<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.960> your<00:01:34.049> truck

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
so now that we got these pieces

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.340 
so now that we got these pieces
separated<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.829> Yakima<00:01:38.369> logo<00:01:39.060> will<00:01:39.420> go<00:01:39.630> facing

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
separated the Yakima logo will go facing

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.230 
separated the Yakima logo will go facing
towards<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.860> outside<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.670> pickup<00:01:42.000> truck

towards the outside of the pickup truck

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.300 
towards the outside of the pickup truck

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
usually I like to say stay up towards

rubber pads contouring to the cap and

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.609 
rubber pads contouring to the cap and
then<00:02:03.630> I'm<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.079> loosen<00:02:04.320> up<00:02:04.469> this

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
then I'm just going to loosen up this

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.830 
then I'm just going to loosen up this
bolt<00:02:04.920> again<00:02:05.579> just<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.210> make<00:02:06.360> sure<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.750> we

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
underside another thing to keep in mind

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.610 
underside another thing to keep in mind
when<00:02:12.030> you're<00:02:12.150> choosing<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.599> location<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.319> and

when you're choosing a location to and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.399 
when you're choosing a location to and
the<00:02:13.769> bike<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.129> that<00:02:14.459> if<00:02:14.849> your<00:02:15.170> truck<00:02:16.170> has<00:02:16.349> a

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
the bike is that if your truck has a

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.920 
the bike is that if your truck has a
drop<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:17.069> bedliner<00:02:17.430> there<00:02:17.790> are<00:02:17.940> some<00:02:18.209> plastic

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
drop in bedliner there are some plastic

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.130 
drop in bedliner there are some plastic
tabs<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.830> actually<00:02:20.190> stick<00:02:20.549> out<00:02:21.019> through<00:02:22.019> the

tabs that actually stick out through the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.680 
tabs that actually stick out through the
underside<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.129> sometimes<00:02:23.549> there<00:02:23.790> won't<00:02:24.000> be

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
underside so sometimes there won't be

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.940 
underside so sometimes there won't be
sometimes<00:02:25.200> there<00:02:25.319> won't<00:02:25.500> be<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.620> smooth

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
sometimes there won't be a smooth

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.460 
sometimes there won't be a smooth
surface<00:02:26.220> under<00:02:26.640> here<00:02:26.879> for<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.750> get<00:02:27.959> this

this piece flat up against the bottom
now<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.010> we<00:02:32.099> got<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:32.430> screw<00:02:32.819> loosened<00:02:33.269> up

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
now that we got this screw loosened up

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.050 
now that we got this screw loosened up
I'm<00:02:33.629> going<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.810> start<00:02:34.140> by<00:02:34.379> inserting<00:02:35.060> just

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
I'm going to start by inserting just

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.569 
I'm going to start by inserting just
going<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.239> call<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.750> J<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:37.440> rack<00:02:37.890> and

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
going to call this the J of the rack and

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.369 
going to call this the J of the rack and
I<00:02:38.640> started<00:02:39.000> at<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.239> bottom<00:02:39.569> part<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.900> J<00:02:40.110> up

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
I started at the bottom part of the J up

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.220 
I started at the bottom part of the J up
underneath<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.190> bed<00:02:41.370> rail<00:02:41.629> I'll<00:02:42.629> pinch<00:02:42.959> this

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
underneath the bed rail I'll pinch this

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.500 
underneath the bed rail I'll pinch this
forward<00:02:45.680> insert<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:47.069> allen<00:02:47.609> tool<00:02:48.030> through

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
forward insert the allen tool through

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.330 
forward insert the allen tool through
and<00:02:48.780> then<00:02:49.260> when<00:02:49.379> we<00:02:49.470> thread<00:02:49.739> this<00:02:49.859> down<00:02:50.099> it's

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
and then when we thread this down it's

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.349 
and then when we thread this down it's
actually<00:02:50.609> going<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.819> go<00:02:50.970> through<00:02:51.239> that

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
actually going to go through that

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.309 
actually going to go through that
threaded<00:02:51.810> hole<00:02:52.019> in<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.310> part<00:02:53.579> of<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.849> rack

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
threaded hole in this part of the rack

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.650 
threaded hole in this part of the rack
so<00:02:55.319> when<00:02:55.470> we<00:02:55.620> tighten<00:02:55.859> it<00:02:56.129> this<00:02:56.640> part<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.390> J

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
so when we tighten it this part this J

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.020 
so when we tighten it this part this J
part<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.049> gonna<00:02:58.170> come<00:02:58.500> up<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:58.980> pinch<00:02:59.700> roll

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
part is gonna come up and pinch roll

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.930 
part is gonna come up and pinch roll
tightly<00:03:00.750> against<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.620> underside<00:03:02.549> of<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.819> bed

and then we'll slide the forks down onto
the<00:03:35.370> skewer<00:03:35.489> now<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.329> heavier<00:03:36.720> might<00:03:36.959> a

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
the skewer now a heavier might a

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.080 
the skewer now a heavier might a
mountain<00:03:37.560> bike<00:03:37.709> it<00:03:37.859> might<00:03:38.010> not<00:03:38.190> be<00:03:38.370> as<00:03:38.609> easy

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
mountain bike it might not be as easy

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.509 
mountain bike it might not be as easy
but<00:03:39.959> still<00:03:40.169> you<00:03:40.290> got<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.530> nice<00:03:40.709> convenient

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
but still you got the nice convenient

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.339 
but still you got the nice convenient
convenience<00:03:42.269> factor<00:03:42.660> where<00:03:42.810> all<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.079> do<00:03:43.199> is

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
convenience factor where all you do is

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.409 
convenience factor where all you do is
basically<00:03:43.530> just<00:03:43.919> set<00:03:44.699> it<00:03:44.819> in<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:44.970> truck<00:03:45.239> and

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
basically just set it in the truck and

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.360 
basically just set it in the truck and
then<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.989> remove<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.949> know<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.190> just

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
then to remove it you know you just

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.129 
then to remove it you know you just
slide<00:03:47.579> it<00:03:47.699> out<00:03:47.819> and<00:03:47.879> then<00:03:48.419> be<00:03:48.629> able<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.870> lift<00:03:48.989> it

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
slide it out and then be able to lift it

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.229 
slide it out and then be able to lift it
right<00:03:49.199> out<00:03:49.530> so<00:03:50.489> with<00:03:50.639> the<00:03:50.730> forks<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.180> bike

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
right out so with the forks of the bike

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.270 
right out so with the forks of the bike
onto<00:03:51.419> the<00:03:51.959> skewer<00:03:52.049> we'll<00:03:52.560> just<00:03:52.769> tighten<00:03:53.040> this

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
onto the skewer we'll just tighten this

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.819 
onto the skewer we'll just tighten this
black<00:03:53.609> piece<00:03:53.849> down<00:03:54.090> here<00:03:56.720> and<00:03:57.720> then<00:03:58.349> clamp<00:03:58.650> it

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
black piece down here and then clamp it

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.520 
black piece down here and then clamp it
down<00:03:59.040> you<00:03:59.639> want<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.849> be<00:03:59.940> careful<00:04:00.180> not<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.079> clamp

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
down you want to be careful not to clamp

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.490 
down you want to be careful not to clamp
it<00:04:01.650> down<00:04:01.680> too<00:04:02.069> tight<00:04:02.400> especially<00:04:03.120> if<00:04:03.690> your

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
it down too tight especially if your

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.640 
it down too tight especially if your
bike<00:04:04.709> is<00:04:04.980> made<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.519> composite<00:04:06.000> material<00:04:06.650> now

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
bike is made of a composite material now

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.020 
bike is made of a composite material now
that<00:04:07.799> we<00:04:07.859> got<00:04:07.980> our<00:04:08.129> bike<00:04:08.280> all<00:04:08.459> loaded<00:04:08.489> up<00:04:08.819> we'll

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
that we got our bike all loaded up we'll

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.039 
that we got our bike all loaded up we'll
go<00:04:09.180> ahead<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:09.389> take<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.599> out<00:04:09.750> on<00:04:09.930> our<00:04:09.959> test

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
go ahead and take it out on our test

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:22.030 
go ahead and take it out on our test
course<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.709> show<00:04:10.859> you<00:04:10.919> how<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.160> performs

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.910
