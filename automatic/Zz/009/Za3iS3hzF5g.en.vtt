00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.440
 hey people I am not fled 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.570
 Today I wanted to show man strong team 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.940
 plays and in itself is pretty easy 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.990
 if you can powerkurs otherwise 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.170
 suitable for you 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.580
 is not meant to be bad if you have it 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:28.080
 now you can show him playing for the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.019
 looking a bit we have it right now 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.309
 somehow half past eight or so and I have to 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.180
 a little bit careful or loud 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.120
 I hope it is still the title 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:48.660
 has the basic chords with reason chord 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:55.379
 So it has until shortly after the reason 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:57.620
 follows a hair in the level of alliance 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.620
 se 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:22.159
 to the stroke pattern you have to take care 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:35.060
 Mail plays as well as fast 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:36.920
 Variation of slow it is so I would 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.270
 recommend you if you play him at 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.130
 grab the airport now after the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.799
 second shock so it's down and yes 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.509
 up when you hit them 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.880
 pulled a little bit of the 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.090
 to go down the side so muffled the 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.720
 besides not then that sounds like that then 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:09.410
 stopped abruptly otherwise that would sound 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:13.549
 through wild whole sounds honest and too 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.450
 so watch if you have that and the 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.980
 It does not hit me that way 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:26.019
 it would have to be about 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.019
 the final result to sound with sound 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:03:09.740
 the toggenburg is going on so angeles 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.950
 transition to the refrain you play it with 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:17.150
 distortion you do not have to sound then 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.459
 About this, I would like a movie 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.770
 to play per minute 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.150
 So it's called the palm on the 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.850
 page I put my faith sees even 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:32.690
 not so on the bunch her web and then 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.930
 but only for this short one 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.930
 beard 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:46.150
 the refrain is similar to the stanza 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.150
 it's only based on it's going on then 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.090
 then goes to the goal 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.730
 and then into the hair 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.690
 and starts again yesterday 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:10.840
 as far as the theory to the stop must there 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.840
 I'll be right there 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.930
 ok now first remember 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.380
 Call the stroke pattern is as follows 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.380
 looks like 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:37.970
 hello faster down so down 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.970
 down substructure 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.990
 does it sound then trapped for him? 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.620
 That's what it was with questions 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.650

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.949
 Write or her limp message 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.080

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:36.639
