00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.000
 hello apple friends I'm emilio suÃ¡rez 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.170
 and this is a new market a day good 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.700
 action eros you see that I've dressed 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.709
 for the occasion in this first program 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.270
 let's talk about corratec and its 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.570
 news for 2014 to accompany me 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.699
 well corratec for this 2014 has bet 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.140
 very strong by the measure of 27 and a half 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.619
 without forgetting of course having 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.960
 26-inch bikes and also bikes 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.660
 29 inch measures that are still 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.850
 current and that you want the 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.380
 you have available and if you want them 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.050
 for you 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.300
 in 27 and a half correct that this year has 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.210
 taken out affordable bikes with pictures of 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.480
 aluminum so that everyone who 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.150
 want a bike of this measure can 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.940
 access it as we have the 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.910
 correct that x werth for measure 27 and 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.060
 we also have it available in 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.340
 29-inch measurements both come with 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.830
 an aluminum frame and an assembly 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.300
 balanced for a good relationship 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.820
 price quality 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.640
 as well as correct bet very strong 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.400
 this year for the wheels of 27 and a half do not 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.880
 has wanted to forget the 29 and their 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.850
 best-selling the xbox and the superbowl 29 of 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.250
 what we're going to talk about next 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.860
 correct and 'super bowl' 29 this year 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.710
 It also presents some news 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.830
 We have the suisse tea fork of 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.790
 magnesium bars here in the part 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.880
 back we also have the lpc system 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.030
 to raise the change pin and 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.610
 get a cleaner chain step and 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.120
 finally in what has been something 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.150
 best-selling for cutting that your system 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.710
 biometric specially indicated for 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.070
 29- inch bikes 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:59.000
 the biometric bow design proves to be 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.900
 very effective in safety and comfort 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.900
 of the cyclist 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.959
 for the segment of enduro bikes 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.360
 corratec has also opted for 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.640
 wheels of 27 and a half here we have his 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.640
 novelty what squeeze that we're going to 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.610
 talk more carefully 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.010
 the corra tec copy of this year presents 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.470
 very important news we have the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.120
 27 and a half wheels that mark 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.700
 trend right now in the world of 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.280
 enduro these wheels are even more 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.750
 light than the 26 inches of the year 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.360
 past both forward and back we have 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.430
 the oversized axles of 15 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.859
 millimeters 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:07.349
 and 12 mm behind the front brings a 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:10.859
 Magnitude suspension fork minute 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:13.379
 and behind a radio magnitude damper 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:20.219
 and tuned especially for this bike 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:22.469
 both with a 150- minute tour 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:25.620
 copy belt presents you a system 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:28.590
 of virtual pivot suspension in this 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.599
 suspension system in the force of 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.510
 impact is not just a point from which 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.329
 but it is distributed evenly in 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.849
 several points like that we get a 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:42.349
 more sensitive absorption and greater 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.349
 resistance of the frame to fatigue 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.580
 the range of ccoo rate that on the road is 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.610
 also very important with many 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.680
 carbon frames aluminum co2 the 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.930
 carbon bikes we will teach them in 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.180
 another program now accompany me to see 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.280
 the correct aluminum ones that in all 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.060
 your road bikes presents the 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.810
 system but sife system 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.150
 is a system to measure the tables in 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.520
 the one that all cyclists are going to 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.180
 find your ideal size with this 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.550
 system the important thing is not the distance 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.730
 of the bottom bracket shaft at the end of the tube 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.820
 of the saddle that is as classically 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.490
 measured the road boxes with the 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.970
 system project the main measure 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.410
 which is taken is that of the horizontal tube 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:58.660
 so we get smaller pictures 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.830
 adapted to all cyclists more 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:05.500
 more playful comfortable and more models 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.580
 latex for your pin of change ruled 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.400
 by the system l by low profile 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.190
 einstein so run you get that the 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.650
 pin of change be carried respect to 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.229
 traditional systems and the passage of 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.500
 the chain will be cleaner achieving 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:25.680
 also more rigidity 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.530
 both the Corones tech belt and the 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.580
 belt technology tea have pictures of 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:35.850
 aluminum in the crown is the geometry is 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.220
 more racing and in the dolomiti we have a 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.920
 geometry plus cyclotourist for 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:44.520
 Enjoy hours on the bike 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.450
 both bikes come very well mounted in 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.050
 the crown 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:52.020
 we have a carbon fork the 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.520
 brand components belt take it 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.370
 fix 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:01.380
 high quality rotor rods 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.380
 and an integral change 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.240
 ah
