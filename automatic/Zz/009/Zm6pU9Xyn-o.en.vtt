00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.140
 I'm also going to make blue pallets 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.680
 berry 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.680
 d 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.390
 they are good three pallets for for time 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.260
 of heat when you are buying 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.260
 pallets 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.560
 for children who have more shadows 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.250
 so we can 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.020
 We can measure the sugar we make 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.540
 our 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.960
 our pallets 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.170
 what 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:31.000

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.000
 they can eat whatever they want, they want it 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:51.190
