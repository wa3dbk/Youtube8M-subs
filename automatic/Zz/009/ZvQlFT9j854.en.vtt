00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 overweight and obesity in school children 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.589
 in 2006 fill forty-one of 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.920
 you add to the games today if 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.230
 we add the two we are at 45% almost 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.700
 half of the children at age 6 are 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.470
 in progress and overweight because it is 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.000
 important because between that overweight and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.490
 there is risk to the problem of these 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.039
 children who at 6 years old and 10% have 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.960
 hypertension of children 6 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.300
 years 30% of those children who are there 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.510
 they will have high cholesterol and half 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.880
 are pre-diabetic of those children and that's 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.620
 is the drama that children are not children 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.170
 but those children when they are 40 years old 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.480
 they're going to start doing everything in a way 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.329
 very early infarcts accidents 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.430
 vascular and cancers in health is spoken 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.110
 of cardiovascular risk the risk 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.360
 cardiovascular is the irrigation would go a 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.039
 person to make a heart attack the week 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.800
 that follows what is the risk that has a 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.469
 Chilean when he turns 45 years old how many 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.899
 men 93 percent men 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.890
 Chileans from the age of 45 onwards 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.390
 high vascular guard 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:11.300
 and of the women the 53 and the total the 72 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.190
 percent but really that 90 for 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.020
 Chilean men's cent have watering 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.229
 cardiovascular at 45 and 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.490
 very high because that means the sum 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.119
 of all the risk factors that have 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.150
 Obese or overweight men 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:29.300
 hypertension diabetes high cholesterol 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.610
 high triglycerides and that's what it is 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.310
 determining living are moving 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.600
 300 people daily and of those 300 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.420
 people days good for all the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.630
 200 causes are dying from heart attack 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.850
 vascular accident and cancer and 100 of 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.550
 those who die from heart attack accident 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.649
 vascular and cannes is dying today 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.240
 between 40 and 65 are deaths 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.220
 premature and avoidable 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.220
 this product you would say of sant or not 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.789
 It's been a while since we've solved a campaign 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.429
 against them has nice sticker game 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.869
 he says he has cereal but all these 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.470
 products have the same as a cocacola 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.989
 a hidden sugar or hidden salt that 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.970
 unmanageable nobody knows that when 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.610
 Take a coke you eat 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.430
 13 lumps of sugar when I take a 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.350
 normal cocacola does not know people do not 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.290
 it is known what 2 cocacola 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.840
 those are taken 23 this sugar rum nobody 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.360
 know that this is garbage should be 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.790
 prescribed but the labeling does not start at 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.560
 see it because I have trouble reading the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.480
 verses and I read it I do not understand 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.739
 what does it mean that this has 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.410
 sodium example 640 milligrams know 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.569
 you how much the sodium standard know 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.120
 they do not even know some doctors 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.239
 they know when they are not good nutritionists 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.010
 this has sugar and salt because they have 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.140
 salt all these products all have 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.060
 salt and very high amount because they have 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.410
 salt to generate addiction to children 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.390
 interiors saving and salt produces 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.190
 addiction gelatins have salt 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.900
 jams have salt milk 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.690
 you have the chickens there 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.489
 come out in articles in the in the third 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.880
 I have one day because the chickens have 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:15.510
 have injected salt they inject them 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.799
 up to 4 or 5 grams of salt and you who 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.989
 they're going to do when we buy chicken in 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.360
 supermarkets that make you add zeal 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.280
 they do not want now add salt who knows 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.510
 that the chicken has salt and that there is no 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.340
 add it because it already comes with salt 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.380
 normally people add salt 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.810
 all that sauce and knead hidden I 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.450
 I think this is what is 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.980
 making the main responsible for 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.480
 obesity of children and 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.040
 parameters that I showed them and the 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.799
 prevalences that are 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.150
 dramatic are these responsible 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.430
 companies we are in a project 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.319
 of law that he was trying to label 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.560
 this so that it is comprehensive I want 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.260
 a label that a child can 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.840
 understand who said these foods 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.019
 that a child decides us now 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.780
 we demand NestlÃ© and all this company 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.180
 because this is the labeling that is there 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.379
 above this idea is illegal 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.959
 proposed without authorization to the ministry 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:09.569
 I assure you that in the moment that in 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.879
 this cereal sign or that you take it 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.950
 two most representative brands that were 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.410
 red for sugar and red for salt that 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.239
 the next day you would want 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.150
 they wanted to lower the top output of 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.610
 he assured if people knew they know 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.320
 that people know they are going to do 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.990
 handle salt and sugar because they do not 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.330
 they go down because people do not understand the 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.120
 label the day the labeling is 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.620
 Comprehensive will not stop selling no 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.479
 it was safe they are going to lower the salt and the 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.949
 sugar when one gives sugar line to 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.840
 someone is like putting sugar to the 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.979
 blood immediately increase the 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.440
 triglycerides a change occurs 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.120
 structural metabolism and obviously 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.729
 after a while they have gray hair 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.150
 more and more to your carbon this product 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:54.300
 for you, you keep 640 milligrams of 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.560
 salt this product is really harmful 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.930
 for children a child should eat 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.389
 1,000 milligrams of salt a day maximum 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.360
 2,000 milligrams only if you eat 100 grams 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:06.680
 of this already ate 640 milligrams of the 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.680
 salt without the most rose
