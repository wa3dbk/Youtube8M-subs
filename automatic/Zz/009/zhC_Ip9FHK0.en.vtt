well<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.350> my<00:01:49.829> fingers<00:01:50.159> will<00:01:50.399> thick<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.570> just

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
well and my fingers will thick so I just

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.230 
well and my fingers will thick so I just
thought<00:01:52.560> for<00:01:52.860> such<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> small<00:01:53.610> knife<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.119> was

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
thought for such a small knife that was

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.440 
thought for such a small knife that was
a<00:01:54.299> plus<00:01:54.950> um<00:01:55.950> as<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.640> see<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.030> back<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
a plus um as you see on the back of the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.370 
a plus um as you see on the back of the
blade<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:58.259> doesn't<00:01:58.560> really<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:59.070> jimping<00:01:59.700> um

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
blade it doesn't really have jimping um

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.959 
blade it doesn't really have jimping um
no<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.619> more<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.009> grooving<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.670> doesn't

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
no it's more of grooving it doesn't

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.450 
no it's more of grooving it doesn't
doesn't<00:02:03.659> bite<00:02:04.020> your<00:02:04.320> hand<00:02:04.469> real<00:02:04.829> well<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.310> it

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
doesn't bite your hand real well but it

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.009 
doesn't bite your hand real well but it

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
does add some extra um

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
used this blade this is how the blood

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.550 
used this blade this is how the blood
comes<00:02:17.159> it<00:02:17.939> comes<00:02:17.970> with<00:02:18.390> like<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> Warren<00:02:19.140> kind

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
comes it comes with like a Warren kind

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.839 
comes it comes with like a Warren kind
of<00:02:20.269> vintage<00:02:21.269> look<00:02:21.870> actually<00:02:22.370> like<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> like

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
of vintage look actually like a like

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.670 
of vintage look actually like a like
it's<00:02:24.000> been<00:02:24.150> used<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.750> lot<00:02:24.900> but<00:02:25.260> that's<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
it's been used a lot but that's the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.880 
it's been used a lot but that's the
picture<00:02:25.890> that's<00:02:26.340> actually<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:27.319> boy<00:02:28.319> shows

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
picture that's actually the boy shows

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.979 
picture that's actually the boy shows
that<00:02:29.159> being<00:02:29.459> on<00:02:29.609> the<00:02:29.760> picture<00:02:30.359> too<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.750> I

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
that being on the picture too so I

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.050 
that being on the picture too so I
thought<00:02:31.319> that<00:02:31.439> was<00:02:31.530> also<00:02:31.709> kind<00:02:32.519> of<00:02:32.609> plus<00:02:32.819> it's

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
thought that was also kind of plus it's

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.309 
thought that was also kind of plus it's
not<00:02:33.269> like<00:02:33.329> a<00:02:34.489> textured<00:02:35.489> coating<00:02:35.730> um<00:02:36.319> it

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
not like a textured coating um it

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.270 
not like a textured coating um it
doesn't<00:02:37.530> even<00:02:37.680> actually<00:02:37.980> feel<00:02:38.129> like<00:02:38.159> a

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
doesn't even actually feel like a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.679 
doesn't even actually feel like a
painting<00:02:38.640> codigo<00:02:38.970> no<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.209> don't<00:02:39.420> know<00:02:39.510> what<00:02:39.599> it

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
painting codigo no I don't know what it

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.869 
painting codigo no I don't know what it
is<00:02:39.780> but<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:41.280> feels<00:02:41.430> very<00:02:41.579> smooth<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:43.879> blade

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
is but it feels very smooth the blade

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.229 
is but it feels very smooth the blade
style<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:46.260> drop-point<00:02:46.590> style<00:02:47.129> blade<00:02:47.400> and

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:57.699 

this<00:02:51.239> knife<00:02:51.510> overall<00:02:52.519> it's<00:02:53.519> only<00:02:53.790> about<00:02:55.069> hmm

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
this knife overall it's only about hmm

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.449 
this knife overall it's only about hmm
where's<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:59.010> ruler<00:02:59.810> there<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.459> alright

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
where's that ruler there it is alright

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.650 
where's that ruler there it is alright
so<00:03:03.709> let<00:03:04.709> me<00:03:04.769> get<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:04.950> right<00:03:05.189> here

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.350 

yeah<00:03:09.660> so<00:03:10.080> from<00:03:11.240> tip<00:03:12.240> to<00:03:12.270> bottom<00:03:13.260> it's<00:03:13.410> about

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
yeah so from tip to bottom it's about

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.600 
yeah so from tip to bottom it's about
right<00:03:15.360> around<00:03:15.660> about<00:03:16.430> four<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.460> a<00:03:17.580> half

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
right around about four and a half

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:26.000 
right around about four and a half
inches<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:21.660> um<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.970> should<00:03:24.350> be<00:03:25.350> legal<00:03:25.920> in

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
inches so um that should be legal in

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.820 
inches so um that should be legal in
most<00:03:26.160> states<00:03:26.310> for<00:03:27.210> the<00:03:27.450> entire<00:03:27.780> knife<00:03:28.050> the

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
most states for the entire knife the

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.440 
most states for the entire knife the
actual<00:03:28.980> blade<00:03:29.340> length<00:03:29.580> i<00:03:29.760> think<00:03:30.000> is<00:03:30.090> about<00:03:30.270> two

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
actual blade length i think is about two

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.199 
actual blade length i think is about two
inches<00:03:30.780> or<00:03:31.620> less<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:32.280> mean<00:03:32.550> it's<00:03:32.700> really<00:03:32.880> really

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
inches or less I mean it's really really

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:41.840 
inches or less I mean it's really really
small<00:03:37.250> as<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:39.209> can<00:03:39.330> see<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.540> has<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.959> um<00:03:40.860> well

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
small as you can see it has to um well

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.590 
small as you can see it has to um well
discard<00:03:42.350> starred<00:03:43.350> nuts<00:03:43.770> on<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.000> as<00:03:45.000> kids<00:03:45.360> going
