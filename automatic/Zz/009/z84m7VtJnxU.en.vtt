soldiers<00:00:16.080> show<00:00:16.470> up<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.770> think<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.070> had

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
soldiers show up I think we had

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.519 
soldiers show up I think we had
20-something<00:00:17.940> volunteers<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.660> 14<00:00:19.050> soldiers

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
20-something volunteers and 14 soldiers

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.560 
20-something volunteers and 14 soldiers
we've<00:00:20.279> grown<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.609> little<00:00:20.850> bit<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.119> think<00:00:21.390> we<00:00:21.449> had

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
we've grown a little bit I think we had

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.960 
we've grown a little bit I think we had
a<00:00:21.600> hundred<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.140> twenty<00:00:22.410> five-plus<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.789> not

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
a hundred and twenty five-plus it's not

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.970 
a hundred and twenty five-plus it's not
only<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.240> big<00:00:24.449> deal<00:00:24.689> for<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.990> soldiers<00:00:25.439> but<00:00:25.920> I

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
only a big deal for the soldiers but I

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.230 
only a big deal for the soldiers but I
think<00:00:26.220> it's<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.519> big<00:00:26.730> deal<00:00:26.880> for<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.210> community

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
think it's a big deal for the community

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.859 
think it's a big deal for the community
because<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.349> also<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.849> just<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.240> subtle

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
because it also is it just a subtle

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.229 
because it also is it just a subtle
reminder<00:00:31.160> as<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.369> what<00:00:32.520> these<00:00:32.700> young<00:00:32.730> men<00:00:33.090> and

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
reminder as to what these young men and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.360 
reminder as to what these young men and
women<00:00:33.510> do<00:00:33.719> because<00:00:34.680> quite<00:00:34.860> often<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.160> forget

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
women do because quite often we forget

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.310 
women do because quite often we forget
that<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.880> volunteer<00:00:36.329> army<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.989> not<00:00:37.200> like

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
that it's a volunteer army it's not like

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.630
