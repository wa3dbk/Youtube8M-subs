class of the research vessel called an
ocean<00:00:44.070> class<00:00:44.309> it's<00:00:45.000> gonna<00:00:45.360> have<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.260> suite<00:00:46.860> of

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
ocean class it's gonna have a suite of

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.860 
ocean class it's gonna have a suite of
instruments<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.610> that's<00:00:48.030> similar<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.780> our

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
instruments on it that's similar to our

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.900 
instruments on it that's similar to our
biggest<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.379> most<00:00:49.500> capable<00:00:49.800> vessels<00:00:50.399> yet

biggest and most capable vessels yet

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.910 
biggest and most capable vessels yet
it's<00:00:51.000> gonna<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> smaller<00:00:51.629> footprint<00:00:52.170> so

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
it's gonna have a smaller footprint so

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.830 
it's gonna have a smaller footprint so
it'll<00:00:53.340> take<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> little<00:00:53.699> bit<00:00:53.820> fewer<00:00:54.120> scientists

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
it'll take a little bit fewer scientists

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.350 
it'll take a little bit fewer scientists
to<00:00:55.050> see<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> smaller<00:00:56.039> crew<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.670> hopefully

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
to see have a smaller crew and hopefully

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.520 
to see have a smaller crew and hopefully
be<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:57.719> bit<00:00:57.809> more<00:00:57.930> efficient<00:00:58.379> than<00:00:58.469> our

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
be a little bit more efficient than our

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.529 
be a little bit more efficient than our
biggest<00:00:58.859> ships<00:00:59.160> are<00:00:59.340> right<00:00:59.579> now<00:00:59.789> one<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.780 
drinking water or floods these often
lead<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.210> both<00:01:39.900> direct<00:01:40.320> impacts<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.040> also<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
lead to both direct impacts and also the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.609 
lead to both direct impacts and also the
geopolitical<00:01:42.150> instabilities<00:01:43.079> all<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.530> those

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
geopolitical instabilities all of those

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.460 
geopolitical instabilities all of those
things<00:01:43.950> are<00:01:44.659> consequences<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.079> changing

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
things are consequences of the changing

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.740 
things are consequences of the changing
planet<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:47.640> need<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.820> understand<00:01:48.390> them<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
planet we need to understand them and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.660 
planet we need to understand them and
predict<00:01:49.200> them<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.470> best<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.189> feed

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
predict them as best we can and feed

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.700 
predict them as best we can and feed
them<00:01:50.850> into<00:01:51.000> our<00:01:51.119> government<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:51.990> know<00:01:52.439> what

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
them into our government so we know what

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.280 
them into our government so we know what
is<00:01:53.100> waiting<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:53.670> us<00:01:53.700> down<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.180> road<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.659> so

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
is waiting for us down the road and so

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.260 
is waiting for us down the road and so
over<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.530> decades<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.790> developed<00:01:57.180> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
over the decades we have developed a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.660 
over the decades we have developed a
pipeline<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.960> ideas<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.799> inventions<00:01:58.890> that

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
pipeline of ideas and inventions that

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.819 
pipeline of ideas and inventions that
are<00:02:00.090> first<00:02:00.360> used<00:02:00.570> by<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.810> US<00:02:01.110> Navy<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.680> when

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
are first used by the US Navy and when

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.020 
are first used by the US Navy and when
they're<00:02:01.979> comfortable<00:02:02.399> with<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.729> they<00:02:02.850> make

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
they're comfortable with it they make

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.209 
they're comfortable with it they make
the<00:02:03.180> transition<00:02:03.360> into<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.290> environmental

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
the transition into the environmental

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.249 
the transition into the environmental
side<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.579> what<00:02:05.790> we<00:02:05.820> do<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.719> we're<00:02:06.869> always<00:02:07.049> going

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
side of what we do so we're always going

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.320 
side of what we do so we're always going
to<00:02:07.320> need<00:02:07.409> access<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.129> ocean<00:02:08.280> we<00:02:09.149> need

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
to need access to the ocean we need

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.660 
to need access to the ocean we need
slightly<00:02:09.780> different<00:02:10.110> equipment<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:11.220> optimize

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
slightly different equipment to optimize

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.580 
slightly different equipment to optimize
the<00:02:11.879> experiments<00:02:12.450> we're<00:02:12.599> doing<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.170> deck

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
the experiments we're doing this deck

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.130 
the experiments we're doing this deck
compared<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.160> previous<00:02:14.250> decades<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.270> that's

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
compared to previous decades and that's

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.690 
compared to previous decades and that's
why<00:02:16.350> it's<00:02:16.530> important<00:02:16.950> every<00:02:17.040> now<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.400> then<00:02:17.490> to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
why it's important every now and then to

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.490 
why it's important every now and then to
build<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:17.970> new<00:02:18.090> research<00:02:18.390> vessel<00:02:18.810> right<00:02:19.260> now

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
build a new research vessel right now

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.490 
build a new research vessel right now
the<00:02:20.280> vessel<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.910> about<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.480> enter<00:02:21.630> its<00:02:21.990> initial

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
the vessel is about to enter its initial

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.080 
the vessel is about to enter its initial
construction<00:02:22.680> phase<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.670> we've<00:02:23.940> been

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
construction phase so we've been

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.840 
construction phase so we've been
involved<00:02:24.300> with<00:02:24.540> detailed<00:02:25.140> design<00:02:25.500> and

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
involved with detailed design and

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.680 
involved with detailed design and
following<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:27.000> we're<00:02:27.240> gonna<00:02:27.330> go<00:02:27.510> through

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
following that we're gonna go through

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.780 
following that we're gonna go through
about<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> year<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.380> half<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.890> construction

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
about a year and a half of construction

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.640 
about a year and a half of construction
and<00:02:29.970> we<00:02:30.630> hope<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.050> vessel<00:02:31.380> will<00:02:31.500> be

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
and we hope that the vessel will be

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.510 
and we hope that the vessel will be
delivered<00:02:32.040> in<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.220> early<00:02:32.490> part<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.820> 2015
