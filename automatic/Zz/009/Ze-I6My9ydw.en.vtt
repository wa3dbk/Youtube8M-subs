00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
radar in the middle of a spawn now i'd

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.300 
radar in the middle of a spawn now i'd
say<00:01:47.450> like<00:01:47.630> eighty<00:01:47.960> five<00:01:48.259> percent<00:01:48.319> plus<00:01:49.009> of<00:01:49.219> the

radars<00:01:52.009> are<00:01:52.130> kind<00:01:52.310> of<00:01:52.369> useless<00:01:52.609> but<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:54.380> know

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
radars are kind of useless but you know

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
out of a spawn show up on radar they let

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:00.639 
out of a spawn show up on radar they let
you<00:01:59.329> know<00:01:59.450> where<00:01:59.569> the<00:01:59.659> enemies<00:01:59.929> spawning<00:02:00.200> so

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
you know where the enemies spawning so

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.389 
you know where the enemies spawning so
it's<00:02:01.579> a<00:02:01.639> decent<00:02:02.090> tip<00:02:02.270> decent<00:02:02.689> tactic<00:02:03.049> to<00:02:03.139> use

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
it's a decent tip decent tactic to use

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
just you can't see anything it's really

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.370 
just you can't see anything it's really
hard<00:02:24.050> time<00:02:24.349> seeing<00:02:24.709> stuff<00:02:25.069> on<00:02:25.280> this<00:02:25.430> map

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
hard time seeing stuff on this map

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.590 
hard time seeing stuff on this map
so<00:02:27.650> now<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:27.860> look<00:02:28.160> up<00:02:28.370> into<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.670> typical<00:02:29.210> camper

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
so now I look up into the typical camper

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.930 
so now I look up into the typical camper
spot<00:02:29.900> yeah<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.040> mortal<00:02:31.370> I<00:02:31.430> know<00:02:31.490> there's<00:02:31.880> a

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
spot yeah the mortal I know there's a

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.920 
spot yeah the mortal I know there's a
guy<00:02:32.090> out<00:02:32.240> there<00:02:32.360> laying<00:02:32.630> down<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:34.420> again<00:02:35.420> this

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
guy out there laying down so again this

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.700 
guy out there laying down so again this
this<00:02:36.320> is<00:02:36.500> just<00:02:36.710> a<00:02:36.800> really<00:02:37.070> dusty<00:02:37.340> old<00:02:37.820> map<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:38.570> I

this is just a really dusty old map so I

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.250 
this is just a really dusty old map so I
tend<00:02:39.710> to<00:02:39.830> avoid<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.340> but<00:02:40.550> when<00:02:41.480> I<00:02:41.510> do<00:02:41.660> play<00:02:41.990> it<00:02:42.140> I

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
tend to avoid it but when I do play it I

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.190 
tend to avoid it but when I do play it I
play<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.650> with<00:02:42.800> a<00:02:42.830> long-range<00:02:43.580> weapon<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:45.050> see

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200

ok<00:02:59.270> back<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.720> game<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:01.030> used<00:03:02.110> long-range

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
ok back to the game so I used long-range

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.160 
ok back to the game so I used long-range
weapons<00:03:03.650> because<00:03:04.480> majority<00:03:05.480> of<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.930> sight

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
weapons because majority of the sight

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.130 
weapons because majority of the sight
lines<00:03:06.200> on<00:03:06.710> this<00:03:06.860> map<00:03:07.130> our<00:03:07.400> long-range<00:03:08.180> you

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
lines on this map our long-range you

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.920 
lines on this map our long-range you
you're<00:03:10.010> pressed<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.550> find<00:03:10.580> short<00:03:11.450> sight<00:03:11.690> lines

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
you're pressed to find short sight lines

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.430 
you're pressed to find short sight lines
like<00:03:12.880> I'd<00:03:13.880> say<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.210> average<00:03:14.360> sight<00:03:14.990> line<00:03:15.200> even

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
like I'd say the average sight line even

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.320 
like I'd say the average sight line even
running<00:03:15.710> in<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.070> out<00:03:16.160> of<00:03:16.220> boxes<00:03:16.760> and<00:03:17.150> crates

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
running in and out of boxes and crates

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.240 
running in and out of boxes and crates
and<00:03:17.750> all<00:03:17.840> that<00:03:18.020> good<00:03:18.230> stuff<00:03:18.290> drop<00:03:18.860> shot<00:03:19.070> down

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
and all that good stuff drop shot down

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.400 
and all that good stuff drop shot down
stairs<00:03:19.490> all<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.030> good<00:03:20.210> stuff<00:03:20.480> is<00:03:20.690> Oh<00:03:20.960> sir<00:03:21.170> john

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
stairs all the good stuff is Oh sir john

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.700 
stairs all the good stuff is Oh sir john
it's<00:03:21.830> probably<00:03:22.990> averaging<00:03:23.990> around<00:03:24.140> maybe

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
it's probably averaging around maybe

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.350 
it's probably averaging around maybe
like<00:03:25.750> 40<00:03:26.750> feet<00:03:27.250> that's<00:03:28.250> typical<00:03:28.790> range<00:03:29.030> right

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
like 40 feet that's typical range right

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.630 
like 40 feet that's typical range right
so<00:03:30.640> you<00:03:31.640> can<00:03:31.760> use<00:03:31.970> an<00:03:32.120> SMG<00:03:32.480> but<00:03:33.340> you're<00:03:34.340> better

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
so you can use an SMG but you're better

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.470 
so you can use an SMG but you're better
off<00:03:34.790> with<00:03:35.300> an<00:03:35.420> assault<00:03:35.720> rifle<00:03:36.010> because<00:03:37.010> of<00:03:37.280> the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
off with an assault rifle because of the

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.450 
off with an assault rifle because of the
long<00:03:38.480> side<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:39.320> there<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:39.680> go<00:03:39.890> again<00:03:39.920> just

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
long side and there I go again just

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.790 
long side and there I go again just
