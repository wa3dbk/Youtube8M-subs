00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
computer all you have to do is I mean

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.330 
computer all you have to do is I mean
basically<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:35.010> problem<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:36.649> your<00:00:37.649> phone

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
basically the problem is that your phone

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.810 
basically the problem is that your phone
has<00:00:38.840> something<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.770> internal<00:00:41.309> storage

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
has something in the internal storage

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.090 
has something in the internal storage
that's<00:00:42.239> preventing<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.020> entity<00:00:43.410> application

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
that's preventing the entity application

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.750 
that's preventing the entity application
to<00:00:45.059> connect<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.600> your<00:00:45.690> computer<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.760> it's

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
to connect to your computer and it's

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.790 
to connect to your computer and it's
actually<00:00:47.940> crashing<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.899> then<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.110> restarts

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
actually crashing and then it restarts

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.049 
actually crashing and then it restarts
so<00:00:51.649> if<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.770> want<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.039> get<00:00:53.730> rid<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.940> that

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
so if you want to get rid of that

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.810 
so if you want to get rid of that
