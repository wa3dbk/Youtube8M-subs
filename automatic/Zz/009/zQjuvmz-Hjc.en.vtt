 hi my name is federico tanger and this 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.720
 it's a demo for the country instruments 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.720
 musicals 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.800
 this is a demo of the tsunami cluster 9 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.380
 order this pedal is a clone of Ivan 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.980
 he was screamer of that 9 only that with 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.360
 some improvements has more travel than 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.180
 drive 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.390
 more pitch variation and much more 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.330
 What is this pedal for? 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.760
 It is also a cover of the common we can 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.090
 give more sustenance for the solos and we 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.950
 fulfills the function of booster 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.030
 this pedal has three 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:43.250
 one drive potentiometers 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:47.380
 another tone and another volume 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.380
 this is the clean signal of the guitar 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.810
 let's try it with the minimum driver the 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.810
 around the middle and the middle one 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.440
 the drive 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.930
 let's give it a little more 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.390
 and we are going to raise the slight 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.200
 let's open up the tone a bit 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.629
 and 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.330
 all right
