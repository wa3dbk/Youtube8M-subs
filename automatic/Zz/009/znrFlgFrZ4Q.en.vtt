 Hila May stuffing kashchita 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.170
 grand theft auto 5 is definitely the most 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.650
 loud release of 2013 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.489
 joke is the most expensive game in history on 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.860
 a creation that went 265 million 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.950
 dollars and while rumored to be paid off 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.360
 before the release alone 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.420
 pre-order even pirated version 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.430
 leaked into the network did not deceive everyone 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.770
 because it would have to abandon 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.910
 multiplayer about him, we will tell separately 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.130
 for now let's focus on the first ones 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.130
 impressions of the single player campaign 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.440
 on the first sensations 5 gta absorbed 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.110
 all the best that was in the previous parts 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.110
 she got a visual style from wai city 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.220
 and partly the atmosphere is sunny 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.670

 giant space pumping 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.810
 characteristics and the ultimate wealth 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.610
 Opportunities the fourth part shared 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.950
 combat system with shelters 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:36.660
 focusing on the plot and graphics engine 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:38.880
 which is however seriously refined for 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.770
 current generation of consoles game 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.610
 shows just awesome 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.400
 picture 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.220
 especially if we take into account the size of the world 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.350
 and the distance of his drawing and yes 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.170
 closed spaces of detail 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.080
 impressive here for example headquarters 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.360
 local social networking life invader 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.360
 where is one of the story missions 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.179

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.550
 typical geeks as employees 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.300
 interesting facebook office looks 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.300
 about the same 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.520
 the main characters now become three and in 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.800
 each according to the developers more 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:23.200
 polygons than in all models of san 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.959
 Andreas together taken open they 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.060
 gradually acquaintance begins with 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.880
 former robber michael who 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.130
 imitated his own death and since 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.780
 still trying to lead a simple life 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.510
 american citizen 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.100
 but not the poorest with great

 over age kids dropping 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.480
 spoilers let's just say some 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.850
 circumstances make him again 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.220
 return to the old profession to rob 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.410
 banks and incidentally build relationships 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.410
 family and pay off debts 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.930
 typical mission for michael my son and I 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.900
 go cycling 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.540
 and the next second we are sailing to the yacht 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.550
 save daughter from porn barons from where 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:30.350
 have to clean up on a jet ski 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:32.540
 and under a hail of bullets second to us 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.110
 represent franklin simple 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.300
 black guy from even more 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.070
 dysfunctional family and at the same time 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.470
 congenital driver of the fifth part 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.350
 each of the heroes has a special 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.230
 abilities and it is exactly the share of franklin 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.080
 dropped time slowdown while driving for 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.730
 driving in this mode car 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.220
 gains incredible maneuverability 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.900
 to go around them any obstacles 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.330
 michael in turn 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.690
 can just as well slow down time when 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.690
 shooting 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:10.180
 and finally the third character is a treasurer 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.489
 of the whole trinity, he was the most 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.069
 colorful former military pilot 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.410
 now drunken drunk regularly 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.269
 waking up somewhere in the gateway and 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.300
 in shorts and torn T-shirts 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.910
 he lives in a dunking trailer there 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.550
 cooks something narcotic causing 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.400
 the show's associations are serious and 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.740
 in general, with all his appearance causes desire 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.150
 go to the other side of the street when 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.900
 better meeting 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.880
 upgrade baseball bat to advance 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.630
 but with the fact that he is damn cool not 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.630
 argue 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.800
 All some missions are only available. 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.560
 one of the characters 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.240
 others are done together and then 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.460
 introductory video will be slightly 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.150
 vary by whom 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.060
 You have taken this mission but it is the largest 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.830
 tasks heroes are often going to threesome 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.560
 then between them 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.560
 switch performing different tasks 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.610
 one shoot snipers other 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:19.330
 shoot down the helicopter the third divert the fire on 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.850
 themselves from time to time will appear and 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.840
 secondary characters which too 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.330
 can choose 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.760
 more often on the principle than the best 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.450
 characteristics the more he will have 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.510
 pay 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.660
 and to top it off they will steer even the most 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.540
 real dog and it is long before 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.120
 Released call of duty GOST really not 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.140
 We think that local dogs will allow 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.140
 do that 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.880
 and rocks 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.580
 sometimes you have to choose the way 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.160
 passing missions and still at the stage 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.350
 planning want to commit a robbery 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.620
 with shooting and fireworks 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.090
 take care to find the right weapon 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.150
 want to do everything quietly 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.810
 get the sleeping gas cylinders and then 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.060
 and other 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.060
 considered an extra mission 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.320
 well, in between tasks 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.450
 we are on our own 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.030
 ride a bike walk in 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:26.120
 strip club to hunt deer in the forest 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.850
 swim compete in running ride 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.350
 ferris wheel and roller coaster and 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.080
 much more 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:35.540
 date still encourages thoughtful 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.970
 learning virtual world which 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.910
 both countable secrets hidden 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:44.380
 easter eggs and movie links games and 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.380
 modern reality 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:51.450
 and unlike serious and dramatic 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.950
 4 parts here the developers are back to 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:58.410
 gay lawlessness 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:07:00.660
 typical previous games of the series are not 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.970
 to the extent of the second to her 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.420
 most oriented creators Saints 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.060
 cow 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:09.000
 but still the transition from dark gray 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.730
 liberty city sun los santos y 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.460
 perceived with relief 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.680
 all the hopes we pinned on 5 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.280
 Grand Theft Auto 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.280
 justified in full
