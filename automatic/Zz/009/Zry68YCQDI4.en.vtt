00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.090
 about four or five days ending 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.580
 in drop of mamis and padel just in time 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.949
 for when the author comes good 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.590
 exactly on time because it gives you time 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.680
 still to read me the raven voice that is 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.539
 the last thing that maggie has published 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.000
 and now the faces of scorpio have come 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.190
 what do you mean when they come 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.080
 I will be more than ready as I said 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.410
 already on some other occasion this book what 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.690
 I started a long time ago I left it and I've 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.480
 taken I have not taken because I have returned 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.310
 to start recently the thing is that 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.050
 when I started I had algae that moore 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.940
 with 'twilight' because new 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.860
 arrests eight love stories 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.110
 pastelosa with licántropos of by means 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.809
 so I took it with a bit of the ones 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.820
 you move more expensive liking 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.110
 very much mag style and I decided that 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.710
 you had to give an opportunity in addition 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.110
 Spain was coming so well, either 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.780
 I opposed a lot for the idea of ​​going back to 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.210
 try to read tremor you are the one that 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.030
 I was very surprised 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.009
 a lot of done my list is gone 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.890
 favorite books and you all know what 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.930
 pretty that is the edition that has made sm 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.729
 and obviously here it is not appreciated but the 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.430
 leaves is in relief has as rain 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.840
 and also in the outline not only the eyes 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.890
 of sanz that are there but the outline 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.240
 something that I liked a lot 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.619
 novel is that we do not need a 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.390
 very complex argument so that 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.880
 you were stuck in the story and you 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.320
 will hook what it has and the 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.850
 way he has to tell you things 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.460
 to write your feelings and 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.369
 making precious metaphors very 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:45.080
 Poetics all do not bother you 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:48.350
 fact that there will be a turn of the 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.180
 plot that will leave you impressed not what 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.710
 you need because the way he tells you 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.200
 a simple story dazzles although the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.720
 final yes that surprised us because it is not 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.039
 nothing you expect is a tad 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.190
 antico although conclusive autoconclusivo 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:10.250
 and that has caused many people not to 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.320
 have liked trail and probably 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.790
 I did not like it either, I always go 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.930
 try it with the other two even though 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.340
 everybody told me not to do it 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.320
 that you have a tremor that is the best 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.620
 but I do not like to leave sagasta of days and 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.390
 less 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.330
 if you have such good experience with the 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.940
 first I assume when in a saga that 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.560
 nothing will look better than the first one has 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.239
 last with percy jackson the first 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.549
 several or the second weakens and then the 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.019
 saga is going to better in this case good the 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.030
 first yes that the last yes that is 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.290
 brutal harry potter also happens what 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.700
 same the first one is very good the second 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.420
 loose and the following increase 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.190
 in quality and in trap so good me 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.500
 I assume astor is not going to be the best 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.930
 book is not going to impress I love me 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.660
 as much as liked to tremble but it's something 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.739
 that I assume and that I'm going to read the book with 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.599
 the various desires with which I have taken 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.560
 tremor and with which picked up letters is 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.810
 which one I'm going to catch 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.489
 ground is not because I like author and 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.409
 I like to count things when 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.220
 I was reading the book I have the hobby 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:10.480
 to browse and not learn yet pick them up 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.180
 for when I have left 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.250
 for this book and I thought that I had 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.739
 eaten a chicken when leaving a verb 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.580
 which I will not say because neither 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.580
 I want nobody 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:27.329
 I read something over and he gave me a 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.799
 idea of ​​the end when I arrive I do not know if it is 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.349
 for the idea that I had preconceived or 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.810
 because it really surprised me not 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:37.319
 I expected what happened to the 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.209
 final but not abstract because it is 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.540
 quite uncomfortable trying to talk about 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.579
 a novel trying not to make spoilers 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.349
 because you end up very stressed and you end up 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.959
 some fixed charm because of that theme 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:51.390
 so it's good to say that if you have not 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.980
 read tremor , do it if you have not 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.930
 I read nothing of makin I do not know what you expect 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.970
 after having seen me in the video 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.739
 of scorpion racing jumping 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.389
 wonders about her and that I'm dying 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.970
 I'm looking forward to meeting you I'm lucky 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.970
 I can go to bail that I'm part of 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.530
 temple team and what good floor and 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.909
 together with my companion carlota to whom 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.099
 more has gone bad and go to 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:14.280
 I find that there is before signing the 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.229
 day 16 the signature is given about 7 of the 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.060
 late if I'm not wrong and the meeting 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.889
 it will be about 4 so I will have the 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.280
 opportunity to know the air that I 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.050
 sign my hair sample in boys 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.970
 that we see in the next video that does not 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.320
 It will be known I know I have a slope 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.620
 what was the escape has been a 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.910
 change with the mobile program I was 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.290
 they have lost all the videos that I had 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.550
 engravings I do not know exactly how 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.900
 import them 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.669
 and there, good has also taken advantage 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.400
 to change the intro that is more good 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.130
 there is God hits me more I believe and 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.200
 good has to re-record the of what 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.210
 what to do and now I had to 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.910
 take the name of the wind of patricians 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.639
 coming this Friday I have faith in power 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.110
 finish it before the first as much as 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.940
 live the truth and I'm very hooked 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.590
 and very in love with him too 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.850
 guided by the epic fantasy that the 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.410
 let's do if this is possible 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.510
 consider epic fantasy so good 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.840
 it's good if we see each other in the next 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.840
 I said
