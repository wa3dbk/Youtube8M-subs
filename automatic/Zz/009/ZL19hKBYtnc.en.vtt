00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hi girls and guys how are you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.509
 welcome to a new day and good the 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.010
 today we are going to continue the theme of 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.290
 decoration that we started in the video of 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.150
 last Friday in which the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.070
 shopping or you do not buy them 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.780
 made for the house and today what you 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.340
 I wanted to teach them how to customize by 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.710
 example a piece of furniture in this case I'm going to 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.109
 customize that sidewalk that teaches you and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.580
 that there he appreciates me or paint him whole or 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.350
 put some detail in another day 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.730
 it occurred to me to simply put the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.980
 name of leo that is now the one 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.050
 use this sidewalk and I will show you 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.850
 how to do it first of all you have to 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.350
 choose the reason you want to paint 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.450
 about that furniture in my case as you 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.980
 said is the name of leo with which in 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.899
 a program any range of editing in 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.129
 this illustrator case you put the name 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.750
 you go that choosing the right size 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.399
 you can go creating that word in 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.379
 different fonts until you find 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.390
 the typeface that you most want 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.370
 use once you have chosen the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.199
 typography just create that word 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.309
 in different sizes more or less 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.050
 calculate that you have opened a 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.180
 document with din a4 good as it is the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.710
 size of a sheet and more or less you can 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.840
 calculate what would be the size of the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.760
 letters that you want to print we are going to 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.739
 place on a hard surface like 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.850
 it can be a portfolio to avoid over 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.280
 everything that crosses 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.290
 let's put a cardboard underneath and 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.090
 we're just going to stick to hold a 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.799
 little bit on paper, then 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.509
 the help of a cutter and a rule in 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.009
 its defect a stick and I rule already 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.229
 right now I could not find it in 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.210
 house then at this time place and 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.880
 tend to search and the good is the same 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.320
 any straight thing that we do the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.509
 same function that makes a rule and 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.640
 just cut it down here you can see 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.710
 how is the word reads as following 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.330
 step we're going to cut out the next thing that 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.860
 let's do is place the name of 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.049
 I read right in the back of the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.640
 stool chair roughly to one 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.200
 distance equidistant from both sides 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.899
 for the side I'm just going to talk 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.149
 so a little tape of wsi tape and the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.800
 I'll place behind the side we go 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.690
 circulito and what I'm going to do is going to be 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.920
 paste it here in the center if you want 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.690
 this part of here for example not 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.909
 Also, why do not you put a 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.840
 little bit of tape below the following 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.250
 What am I going to do? 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.110
 little bit of chak paint that is this 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.909
 chalk paint that you have already taught in 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.350
 some other cool day I'll leave you in the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.450
 description the link to the store where 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.399
 you can get this same bein that is 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.600
 the authentic brand that they sell is what 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.979
 next we do with the help of a 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.170
 specific brush for this kind of 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.350
 paintings and let's paint it doing 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.130
 pressure for 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.130
 you do not know 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.720
 once the first has dried 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.730
 hand we go with the second hand and so 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.380
 You see how the lyrics of Leo were with 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.290
 Who is Leo is going to really sit 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.250
 to release the chair to see 7 or 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.050
 when I actually have that 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.730
 become today is pierre mans I'm going 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.380
 doing the same in this other chair that 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.720
 it's a chair that I'm going to paint to mine and 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.710
 I'm going to do exactly like that of 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.080
 I read it like that 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.760
 As you can see, it's a simple detail that 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.460
 you can apply as I am doing to 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.560
 a chair or you can for example paint the 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.300
 door of the room you can paint the 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.120
 headboard of the bed that is there are many 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.650
 ways to customize something for you 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.630
 children for example as is the case today 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.940
 and to finish we give you a cloth 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.420
 and a little bit of wax to protect the 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.420
 painting 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.000
 one we have seen is an idea very 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.680
 simple but good just an idea 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.930
 I wanted to throw you so that you 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.610
 occurs and gives rise to new things or 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.900
 new ways to customize furniture 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.120
 that you have at home and especially 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.590
 customize them thank you very much for watching me 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.209
 if you liked little fingers up and 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.799
 I'll leave you now with two more 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.780
 videos the first of the videos os 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.760
 I teach to use also a stencil 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.040
 as we have done today but to paint a 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.629
 bag and create a designer bag and in 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.250
 the next I die them and I give you more 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.720
 ideas to paint with this painting 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.950
 special called jack paint 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.900
 I hope either of you 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.900
 like it and see you in the next video
