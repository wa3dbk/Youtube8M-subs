00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
see this little line right here let me

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.399 
see this little line right here let me
delete<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.740> I'm<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.729> put<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.939> right<00:01:24.030> here

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
delete it I'm going to put it right here

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.510 
delete it I'm going to put it right here
we<00:01:25.409> go<00:01:25.530> ahead<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.740> put<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.040> there<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.460> then

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
we go ahead and put it there and then

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.120 
we go ahead and put it there and then
it's<00:01:27.420> basically<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.960> curve<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.500> made<00:01:28.680> up<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.920> two

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
it's basically a curve is made up of two

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.280 
it's basically a curve is made up of two
points<00:01:29.490> correct<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.090> here's<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:30.780> point<00:01:31.079> and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
points correct so here's one point and

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.749 
points correct so here's one point and
then<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.619> other<00:01:31.650> point<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.159> whatever<00:01:32.369> end<00:01:32.640> I

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
then the other point is whatever end I

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.490 
then the other point is whatever end I
attaches<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.110> I'm<00:01:34.170> going<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.350> put<00:01:34.409> this

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
attaches to so I'm going to put this

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.800 
attaches to so I'm going to put this
right<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.070> because<00:01:35.970> I'm<00:01:36.150> going<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.570> do<00:01:36.689> this

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
right here because I'm going to do this

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.830 
right here because I'm going to do this
little<00:01:37.020> strip<00:01:37.710> right<00:01:37.890> here<00:01:40.189> now<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.840> there's

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
little strip right here now I there's

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.960 
little strip right here now I there's
probably<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.290> way<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.590> stop<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.189> from<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.549> but

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
probably a way to stop it from going but

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.730 
probably a way to stop it from going but
I<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.509> put<00:01:45.720> one<00:01:45.899> extra<00:01:46.229> point<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:46.680> I

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
I just put one extra point and then I

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.889 
I just put one extra point and then I
hit<00:01:46.950> backspace<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.820> leaves<00:01:47.970> my<00:01:48.149> two<00:01:48.210> so

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
hit backspace and it leaves my two so

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.590 
hit backspace and it leaves my two so
here's<00:01:49.110> my<00:01:49.200> line<00:01:49.470> right<00:01:49.850> now<00:01:50.850> go<00:01:51.030> back<00:01:51.210> over<00:01:51.479> to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
here's my line right now go back over to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.200 
here's my line right now go back over to
your<00:01:51.720> pen<00:01:51.930> tool<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.850> go<00:01:53.850> over<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.119> to

your pen tool and go over here to
convert<00:01:54.600> point<00:01:55.049> now<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.979> tricky

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
convert point now this is the tricky

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.880 
convert point now this is the tricky
part<00:01:56.810> it<00:01:57.810> takes<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.140> little<00:01:58.259> bit<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.500> trying

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
part it takes a little bit of trying

part it takes a little bit of trying
what<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.579> do<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.880> you<00:01:59.969> go<00:02:00.119> over<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.420> point

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
what you do is you go over to this point

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.310 
what you do is you go over to this point
i'll<00:02:00.780> zoom<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:03.469> you<00:02:04.469> go<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:05.450> when<00:02:06.450> you

click on that spot and then you drag and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.910 
click on that spot and then you drag and
what's<00:02:10.200> going<00:02:10.349> happen<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.679> you're<00:02:10.770> going<00:02:10.860> to

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
get two little toggle bars now if there

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:14.240 
get two little toggle bars now if there
was<00:02:13.860> another

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
was another

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.430 
was another
point<00:02:14.490> here<00:02:14.910> which<00:02:15.390> I'll<00:02:15.570> probably<00:02:15.750> redo<00:02:16.320> this

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
point here which I'll probably redo this

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.620 
point here which I'll probably redo this
and<00:02:16.680> show<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.890> then<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.790> would<00:02:17.940> adjust<00:02:18.450> that

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
now I just go over my line art and try

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.740 
now I just go over my line art and try
to<00:02:57.480> make<00:02:58.020> it<00:02:58.050> as<00:02:58.700> best<00:02:59.700> on<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.090> line<00:03:00.540> as

to make it as best on that line as

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.830 
to make it as best on that line as
possible<00:03:01.290> if<00:03:01.489> you<00:03:02.489> have<00:03:02.760> really<00:03:03.300> really<00:03:03.630> big

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
possible if you have really really big

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.070 
possible if you have really really big
curves<00:03:04.580> sometimes<00:03:05.580> it's<00:03:05.880> just<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.300> seems

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
curves sometimes it's just it seems

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.229 
curves sometimes it's just it seems
impossible<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.739> do<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.100> perfectly<00:03:08.370> by<00:03:08.850> hand<00:03:09.120> so

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
impossible to do it perfectly by hand so

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.840 
impossible to do it perfectly by hand so
this<00:03:09.360> pin<00:03:09.630> tool<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:10.050> a<00:03:10.080> lifesaver<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:11.730> now<00:03:11.820> I

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
this pin tool is a lifesaver so now I

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.510 
this pin tool is a lifesaver so now I
have<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.300> way<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.450> like<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.489> right<00:03:14.489> click

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
have it the way I like it I right click

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.140 
have it the way I like it I right click
and<00:03:15.560> all<00:03:16.560> these<00:03:16.709> little<00:03:16.890> doodads<00:03:17.640> come<00:03:17.910> up<00:03:18.030> I

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
and all these little doodads come up I

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.220 
and all these little doodads come up I
don't<00:03:18.299> know<00:03:18.390> how<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.630> use<00:03:18.660> them<00:03:18.900> all<00:03:19.049> but<00:03:19.170> I

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
don't know how to use them all but I

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.470 
don't know how to use them all but I
know<00:03:19.320> I<00:03:19.410> use<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.709> pen<00:03:19.890> tool<00:03:19.920> now<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:21.330> go<00:03:21.450> to

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
know I use the pen tool now you go to

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.620 
know I use the pen tool now you go to
stroke<00:03:21.870> path<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:23.269> you<00:03:24.269> can<00:03:24.420> simulate

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
stroke path and you can simulate

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.630 
stroke path and you can simulate
pressure<00:03:25.170> but<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.739> does<00:03:26.010> some<00:03:26.220> funky<00:03:26.610> stuff

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
pressure but that does some funky stuff

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.890 
pressure but that does some funky stuff
and<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.030> haven't<00:03:27.269> quite<00:03:27.360> figured<00:03:27.540> out<00:03:27.690> how<00:03:27.840> to

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
and I haven't quite figured out how to

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.320 
and I haven't quite figured out how to
do<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.260> but<00:03:28.470> don't<00:03:28.860> worry<00:03:29.040> about<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.489> so

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
do that but don't worry about that so

tool<00:04:04.560> I'm<00:04:04.829> going<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:05.040> make<00:04:05.400> this<00:04:05.610> shape<00:04:06.090> right

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
tool I'm going to make this shape right

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.660 
tool I'm going to make this shape right
here<00:04:06.829> although<00:04:07.829> I<00:04:07.860> wouldn't<00:04:08.040> recommend<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.549> I

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
here although I wouldn't recommend it I

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.370 
here although I wouldn't recommend it I
think<00:04:08.730> it's<00:04:09.180> better<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.570> do<00:04:09.720> one<00:04:09.930> line<00:04:10.140> at<00:04:10.290> a

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
think it's better to do one line at a

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.650 
think it's better to do one line at a
time<00:04:10.410> tapering<00:04:11.220> because<00:04:11.549> it's<00:04:11.820> in<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.510> long

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
time tapering because it's in the long

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.270 
time tapering because it's in the long
run<00:04:12.690> if<00:04:13.079> you<00:04:13.170> take<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.530> time<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.860> do<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:14.040> you'll

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
run if you take the time to do it you'll

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.630 
run if you take the time to do it you'll
be<00:04:14.400> happier<00:04:14.730> with<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.090> final<00:04:15.390> product<00:04:15.570> so<00:04:16.640> I'm

we go go bat convert point usually I do
the<00:04:58.510> points<00:04:58.900> first<00:04:59.110> just<00:04:59.470> because<00:04:59.500> it's

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860
