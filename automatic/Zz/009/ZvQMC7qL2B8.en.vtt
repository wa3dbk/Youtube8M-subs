00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.299
 That's the raw material from the chips 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.299
 be made 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.299
 sand 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.090
 It is made of silicon dioxide 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.870
 Silicon is the second most common element 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.100
 the earth crust and just comes in 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.100
 bound form 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.380
 elaborate chemical and physical 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.970
 Processes are necessary so that the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.100
 silicon crystals the high 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.220
 requirements are the same as for the chip 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.200
 production needed 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.020
 The end product is a crystalline one 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.239
 silicon rod of the highest purity on 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.949
 ten million silicon atoms 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.839
 there is only one foreign atom here 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.780
 Silicon is a semiconductor 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.300
 atomic structure looks like every one 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.240
 Silicon atom has four external electrons 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.280
 there are no free charge carriers 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.830
 Pure silicon monocrystals is included 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.810
 Room temperature is not conductive to him 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.210
 be targeted to make conductive 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.720
 small amounts of foreign atoms incorporated 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.130
 for example, has phosphorus phosphorus 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.130
 five outside electrons 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.020
 built into the silicon crystal lattice 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.720
 is the fifth phosphorus free electron 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.150
 movable due to this structure 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.460
 the silicon phosphorus crystal negative 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.500
 loaded or suffering from boring atoms 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.510
 on the other hand, only three are outside 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.520
 electrons when they are in the silicon 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.460
 lattice will be installed in each case 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.370
 an electron of silicon free it 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.770
 arise electron holes they wander 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.390
 like positively charged electricity 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.260
 Particles through the crystal 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.600
 the material is positively charged or 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.430
 conduct 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.320
 from such p &amp; r conducting 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.510
 Silicon crystals are the transistors 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.560
 built in modern 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.240
 memory chips are located 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.440
 Transistors are the smallest sounds 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.020
 units of microchips 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.270
 for example, a moss transistor in 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.650
 His heart is pi and in 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.310
 leading layers 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.310
 silicon crystals 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.920
 another layer consists of 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.230
 silicon oxide and serves for isolation 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.319
 it will be a layer of electrical 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.290
 applied conductive polysilicon 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.209
 Each transistor has three connections 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.730
 middle bank on the money 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.129
 electrically conductive polysilicon on 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.409
 put tension only on the two 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.010
 external connections can no electricity 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.510
 flow the transistor is locked 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.849
 it is different if in addition one 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.239
 voltage applied to the middle connection 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.000
 becomes 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.469
 the electrons move out of the story 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.599
 now in the direction of the middle one 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.760
 connection and accumulate at the 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:09.010
 interface between silicon crystal 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.439
 and insulating gate oxide 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.959
 between the islands of the n leading 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.700
 materials a channel is formed 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.630
 the electrons can flow 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.480
 the circuit is closed 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.510
 the transistor can be de-energized 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.650
 and current flow so zero and one out 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.630
 and be switched 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.070
 this binary system is the foundation 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.070
 electronic data processing
