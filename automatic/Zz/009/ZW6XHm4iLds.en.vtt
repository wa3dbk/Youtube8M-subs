I think

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.780 
I think
I<00:00:33.690> guess<00:00:34.469> he's<00:00:34.649> considered<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.160> be<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
I guess he's considered to be one of the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.869 
I guess he's considered to be one of the
worst<00:00:37.160> alright<00:00:38.160> not<00:00:38.309> really<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> best<00:00:38.760> I

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
worst alright not really the best I

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.600 
worst alright not really the best I
guess<00:00:39.000> magma<00:00:39.329> Neos<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.690> like<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> best<00:00:40.050> one

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
guess magma Neos is like the best one

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.010 
guess magma Neos is like the best one
but<00:00:41.610> he's<00:00:42.059> still<00:00:42.239> one<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.390> my<00:00:42.450> favorites<00:00:42.930> I
