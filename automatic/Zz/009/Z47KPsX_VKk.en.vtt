the PS Vita slim is the new Vita to

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.049 
the PS Vita slim is the new Vita to
replace<00:00:08.620> the<00:00:08.830> old<00:00:09.129> one<00:00:09.370> and<00:00:09.610> there's<00:00:09.910> been<00:00:10.030> a

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 
replace the old one and there's been a

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.600 
replace the old one and there's been a
number<00:00:10.450> of<00:00:10.690> changes<00:00:11.200> some<00:00:12.039> for<00:00:12.309> the<00:00:12.369> good<00:00:12.400> some

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
number of changes some for the good some

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.209 
number of changes some for the good some
for<00:00:13.299> the<00:00:13.420> while<00:00:13.750> we're<00:00:13.960> not<00:00:14.080> really<00:00:14.290> sure<00:00:14.379> the

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
for the while we're not really sure the

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.490 
for the while we're not really sure the
biggest<00:00:15.639> difference<00:00:16.000> of<00:00:16.119> course<00:00:16.299> is<00:00:16.599> the<00:00:16.779> LCD

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
biggest difference of course is the LCD

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.859 
biggest difference of course is the LCD
screen<00:00:17.890> that<00:00:17.919> dominates<00:00:18.550> the<00:00:18.730> front<00:00:19.090> of<00:00:19.300> the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
screen that dominates the front of the

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.260 
screen that dominates the front of the
device<00:00:20.259> the<00:00:20.860> result<00:00:21.309> is<00:00:21.520> that<00:00:21.759> the<00:00:21.910> colors

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
device the result is that the colors

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.920 
device the result is that the colors
aren't<00:00:22.720> as<00:00:22.869> bright<00:00:23.169> or<00:00:23.410> as<00:00:23.619> crisp<00:00:24.099> or<00:00:24.399> as<00:00:24.610> well

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
aren't as bright or as crisp or as well

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.749 
aren't as bright or as crisp or as well
nice<00:00:25.930> and<00:00:26.500> it's<00:00:26.770> a<00:00:26.829> bit<00:00:26.950> of<00:00:26.980> a<00:00:27.099> shame<00:00:27.399> to<00:00:27.640> be

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
nice and it's a bit of a shame to be

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.760 
nice and it's a bit of a shame to be
honest<00:00:28.059> because<00:00:28.360> if<00:00:28.779> we<00:00:29.050> quite<00:00:29.320> enjoyed<00:00:29.619> the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
honest because if we quite enjoyed the

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.280 
honest because if we quite enjoyed the
screen<00:00:30.070> at<00:00:30.219> the<00:00:30.369> first<00:00:30.610> one<00:00:30.790> in<00:00:31.599> reality

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
screen at the first one in reality

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.840 
screen at the first one in reality
however<00:00:32.529> you<00:00:32.890> probably<00:00:33.070> won't<00:00:33.370> see<00:00:33.460> the<00:00:33.700> two

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
however you probably won't see the two

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.069 
however you probably won't see the two
together<00:00:34.059> because<00:00:34.390> they're<00:00:34.719> discontinuing

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
together because they're discontinuing

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.470 
together because they're discontinuing
the<00:00:35.590> original<00:00:36.070> and<00:00:36.309> so<00:00:36.760> most<00:00:36.970> gamers<00:00:37.210> will

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
the original and so most gamers will

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.090 
the original and so most gamers will
just<00:00:37.630> be<00:00:37.750> happy<00:00:38.110> with<00:00:38.290> the<00:00:38.440> large<00:00:38.680> bright

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
just be happy with the large bright

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.830 
just be happy with the large bright
screen<00:00:39.520> that<00:00:39.730> is<00:00:39.880> in<00:00:40.180> front<00:00:40.540> of<00:00:40.690> them

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
screen that is in front of them

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.860 
screen that is in front of them
otherwise<00:00:41.830> you<00:00:42.130> get<00:00:42.310> one<00:00:42.610> gig<00:00:42.910> of<00:00:43.120> storage<00:00:43.180> now

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
otherwise you get one gig of storage now

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.990 
otherwise you get one gig of storage now
inside<00:00:44.320> so<00:00:44.530> you've<00:00:44.680> got<00:00:44.890> at<00:00:45.010> least<00:00:45.070> a<00:00:45.370> nominal

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
inside so you've got at least a nominal

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.880 
inside so you've got at least a nominal
space<00:00:46.300> to<00:00:46.540> store<00:00:46.780> stuff<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.350> get<00:00:47.470> you<00:00:47.650> going

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
space to store stuff to get you going

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.430 
space to store stuff to get you going
and<00:00:48.280> there's<00:00:48.820> a<00:00:48.880> change<00:00:49.239> in<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.840> charging

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
and there's a change in the charging

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.920 
and there's a change in the charging
port<00:00:50.650> so<00:00:50.920> it's<00:00:51.040> now<00:00:51.160> micro<00:00:51.550> USB<00:00:52.060> so<00:00:52.660> you<00:00:52.720> don't

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
port so it's now micro USB so you don't

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.300 
port so it's now micro USB so you don't
have<00:00:53.110> to<00:00:53.260> worry<00:00:53.470> about<00:00:53.590> finding<00:00:54.070> the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
have to worry about finding the

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.830 
have to worry about finding the
dedicated<00:00:54.850> cable<00:00:55.360> that<00:00:55.540> you've<00:00:55.630> done

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
dedicated cable that you've done

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.560 
dedicated cable that you've done
previously<00:00:56.110> we're<00:00:56.860> really<00:00:57.070> just<00:00:57.570> ransack

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
previously we're really just ransack

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.630 
previously we're really just ransack
your<00:00:58.600> cable<00:00:59.500> drawer<00:00:59.800> for<00:01:00.070> one<00:01:00.220> from<00:01:00.520> your

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
your cable drawer for one from your

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.150 
your cable drawer for one from your
smartphone<00:01:01.000> or<00:01:01.329> tablet<00:01:01.510> it's<00:01:02.470> also<00:01:02.680> lighter

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
smartphone or tablet it's also lighter

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.929 
smartphone or tablet it's also lighter
about<00:01:03.610> 15%<00:01:04.059> and<00:01:04.600> smaller<00:01:05.019> about<00:01:05.799> 20%<00:01:06.579> and<00:01:06.729> that

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
about 15% and smaller about 20% and that

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.109 
about 15% and smaller about 20% and that
really<00:01:07.270> just<00:01:07.450> means<00:01:07.630> curved<00:01:08.020> edges<00:01:08.499> and<00:01:09.119> I'm

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
really just means curved edges and I'm

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.450 
really just means curved edges and I'm
taking<00:01:10.960> some<00:01:11.109> of<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.289> kelvins<00:01:11.649> now<00:01:11.829> certainly

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
taking some of the kelvins now certainly

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.700 
taking some of the kelvins now certainly
from<00:01:12.670> a<00:01:12.729> light<00:01:12.969> perspective<00:01:13.780> or<00:01:14.170> so<00:01:14.380> weight

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
from a light perspective or so weight

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.129 
from a light perspective or so weight
perspective<00:01:15.429> it<00:01:15.850> does<00:01:16.090> feel<00:01:16.389> a<00:01:16.630> lot<00:01:16.899> lighter

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:17.139 
perspective it does feel a lot lighter

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:19.139 
perspective it does feel a lot lighter
than<00:01:17.319> 15%<00:01:18.100> so<00:01:18.219> we<00:01:18.310> quite<00:01:18.579> enjoy<00:01:18.609> that

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
than 15% so we quite enjoy that

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.209 
than 15% so we quite enjoy that
especially<00:01:19.840> if<00:01:20.049> you're<00:01:20.289> keen<00:01:20.709> on<00:01:21.009> playing

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
especially if you're keen on playing

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.120 
especially if you're keen on playing
long<00:01:21.639> gaming<00:01:21.909> sessions<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:23.439> dedicated

long gaming sessions the dedicated

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.309 
long gaming sessions the dedicated
joysticks<00:01:25.119> certainly<00:01:25.600> make<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.810> difference

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:26.319 
joysticks certainly make a difference

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.499 
joysticks certainly make a difference
