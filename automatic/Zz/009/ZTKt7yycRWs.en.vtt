going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> do<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> finally<00:01:45.600> favors<00:01:46.079> now<00:01:46.259> so

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
going to do as a finally favors now so

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.830

yeah<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.040> I'm<00:01:47.159> surprised<00:01:47.670> about<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.270> but

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840

yeah so I'm surprised about that but
possibly<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.649> might<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> solution

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
possibly you might have the solution

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.660 
possibly you might have the solution
internally<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.200> who's<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.799> young<00:01:53.460> always

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
internally and who's up young always

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.819 
internally and who's up young always
that<00:01:53.939> Caden<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.540> thought<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:55.049> thought<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:55.619> had<00:01:55.710> an

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
that Caden I thought I thought we had an

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.830 
that Caden I thought I thought we had an
outstanding<00:01:56.159> game<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.969> under-21s<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
outstanding game for the under-21s the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.380 
outstanding game for the under-21s the
other<00:01:57.960> night<00:01:58.490> serve<00:01:59.490> Antonia<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> league

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
other night serve Antonia in the league

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.929 
other night serve Antonia in the league
cut<00:02:00.689> 1<00:02:00.899> or<00:02:01.110> far<00:02:01.380> II<00:02:01.409> mean<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.280> give<00:02:02.520> them<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> go

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
cut 1 or far II mean and give them a go

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.700 
cut 1 or far II mean and give them a go
so<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.600> reckon<00:02:03.869> maybe<00:02:03.990> always<00:02:04.320> our<00:02:04.409> agent

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
so you reckon maybe always our agent

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.260 
so you reckon maybe always our agent
