idea<00:03:42.909> of<00:03:43.150> what<00:03:43.329> it<00:03:43.449> looks<00:03:43.479> like<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.109> the<00:03:45.040> hitch

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
idea of what it looks like and the hitch

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.960 
idea of what it looks like and the hitch
just<00:03:46.989> like<00:03:47.199> on<00:03:47.409> a<00:03:47.439> real<00:03:47.530> truck<00:03:48.009> they<00:03:48.549> needed<00:03:48.879> to

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
just like on a real truck they needed to

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.069 
just like on a real truck they needed to
figure<00:03:49.150> out<00:03:49.359> some<00:03:49.659> sort<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:50.109> scale<00:03:50.769> hitch<00:03:51.159> now

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
figure out some sort of scale hitch now

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.899 
figure out some sort of scale hitch now
because<00:03:53.079> everybody<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.889> in<00:03:54.009> my<00:03:54.159> movies<00:03:54.549> I<00:03:54.729> use

no problem at all now this hitch

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.899 
no problem at all now this hitch
actually<00:04:02.319> had<00:04:02.469> to<00:04:02.560> be<00:04:02.680> lightweight<00:04:03.159> sturdy

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
actually had to be lightweight sturdy

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:07.050 
actually had to be lightweight sturdy
and<00:04:04.239> easy<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.780> use<00:04:05.189> this<00:04:06.189> is<00:04:06.250> how<00:04:06.489> simple<00:04:06.879> it<00:04:06.969> is

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
and easy to use this is how simple it is

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.640 
and easy to use this is how simple it is
how<00:04:07.090> they<00:04:07.449> designed<00:04:07.810> it<00:04:07.989> I've<00:04:08.349> already

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
having trouble hold on a second there we

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.500 
having trouble hold on a second there we
go<00:04:36.750> get<00:04:37.750> this<00:04:37.930> into<00:04:38.200> place<00:04:39.000> like<00:04:40.000> so

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
go get this into place like so

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.140 
go get this into place like so
and<00:04:40.840> then<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.980> beauty<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.640> hitch<00:04:42.820> when

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
and then the beauty of the hitch when

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.390 
and then the beauty of the hitch when
you<00:04:43.240> have<00:04:43.420> a<00:04:43.450> receiver<00:04:44.050> like<00:04:44.350> that<00:04:44.620> is<00:04:44.980> you

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
you have a receiver like that is you

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.040 
you have a receiver like that is you
need<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:45.700> actual<00:04:46.000> assembly<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.690> what<00:04:46.870> they

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
need the actual assembly and what they

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.280 
need the actual assembly and what they
do<00:04:47.110> is<00:04:47.440> they<00:04:47.620> provide<00:04:47.820> cue<00:04:48.820> now<00:04:49.690> I<00:04:49.870> scrape<00:04:50.200> the

I can focus there is a hole there in the

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.620 
I can focus there is a hole there in the
top<00:05:10.750> for<00:05:11.440> a<00:05:11.470> body<00:05:11.980> pin<00:05:12.310> you'll<00:05:12.910> pop<00:05:13.240> that<00:05:13.480> into

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
top for a body pin you'll pop that into

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.150 
top for a body pin you'll pop that into
place<00:05:13.990> like<00:05:14.980> so<00:05:15.930> with<00:05:16.930> a<00:05:16.960> body<00:05:17.260> pin<00:05:17.560> I<00:05:17.590> mean<00:05:17.920> one

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.720 
into place just on camera line up the
two<00:05:23.110> holes<00:05:23.140> and<00:05:25.260> kablammo

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
two holes and kablammo

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.900 
two holes and kablammo
look<00:05:27.730> at<00:05:27.850> that<00:05:28.270> just<00:05:29.260> like<00:05:29.410> the<00:05:29.530> real<00:05:29.650> deal

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
look at that just like the real deal

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.840 
look at that just like the real deal
right<00:05:30.910> in<00:05:31.060> place<00:05:31.330> now<00:05:32.320> kind<00:05:33.250> of<00:05:33.310> scoot<00:05:33.670> this

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
right in place now kind of scoot this

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.820 
right in place now kind of scoot this
around<00:05:34.150> here<00:05:34.420> because<00:05:34.810> we've<00:05:35.020> got<00:05:35.170> the<00:05:35.440> two

place<00:06:06.960> you<00:06:07.960> can<00:06:08.080> see<00:06:08.230> how<00:06:08.320> that<00:06:08.530> goes<00:06:08.710> just

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
place you can see how that goes just

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.840 
place you can see how that goes just
like<00:06:09.460> so<00:06:09.760> and<00:06:11.310> here<00:06:12.310> I'll<00:06:12.400> just<00:06:12.430> see<00:06:12.669> if<00:06:12.700> I<00:06:12.820> can

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
like so and here I'll just see if I can

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:19.140 
like so and here I'll just see if I can
do<00:06:13.000> this<00:06:13.090> on<00:06:13.240> camera<00:06:14.970> doop<00:06:15.970> de<00:06:16.120> loop<00:06:16.300> to<00:06:16.450> do<00:06:18.150> the

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
do this on camera doop de loop to do the

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.950 
do this on camera doop de loop to do the
hitch<00:06:19.480> goes<00:06:19.720> in<00:06:19.870> the<00:06:19.960> end<00:06:20.140> like<00:06:20.650> so<00:06:21.750> line<00:06:22.750> this

up and oops right on top down into the

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.820 
up and oops right on top down into the
receiver<00:06:31.140> so<00:06:32.140> what<00:06:32.320> I'll<00:06:32.410> do<00:06:32.560> is<00:06:32.680> I'll<00:06:32.800> just
