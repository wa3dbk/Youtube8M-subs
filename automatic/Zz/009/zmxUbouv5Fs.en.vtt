00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
 It’s hard to believe that summer is over. 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.341
 I think time is passing like a fly. 

00:00:04.341 --> 00:00:07.019
 And the fruit flies like a banana (fly) 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:09.524
 why me? 

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:12.432
 Wow, I think bananas should now be made into banana bread. (would've been better off dead, it’s better to die, he changed the death to a bread bread.) 

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:15.064
 Can't you be a little bit safe? 

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:18.678
 Hey, please, pear, you don’t have to pull the plug out. 

00:00:18.678 --> 00:00:19.655
 not me 

00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:23.375
 That's it, brethren, that's over there. 

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:26.440
 Too perfect, that's it 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.598
 Hey! What shell do you have in our kitchen? (He talks about what the hell is called the shell shell) 

00:00:29.597 --> 00:00:31.924
 Your kitchen? No, no longer. 

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:33.274
 Come on, brethren! 

00:00:40.523 --> 00:00:43.132
 Wow, this whole kitchen has been reorganized. (He said cleaned up clean up as clamed up, clam=shell) 

00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:45.202
 I am Johnny. Shell 

00:00:45.203 --> 00:00:49.148
 The greatest player in the history of the casino industry 

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:50.608
 Hey, why are you coming here? 

00:00:50.607 --> 00:00:55.454
 Maybe it’s up to my partner, my friends, to talk to you. 

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:59.945
 Get out of the way, or you will admit that only the real players can stay in the shell casino. 

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:01.009
 Yes, idiots 

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:02.927
 If you are not happy, let's go. 

00:01:02.927 --> 00:01:05.173
 Shut up, rookie 

00:01:05.174 --> 00:01:07.055
 Grapefruit, what are you doing? 

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:10.850
 Hey, if anyone else can be a muscle beater, of course it’s me. 

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:14.248
 Yes, your ass muscles are really big. 

00:01:14.248 --> 00:01:17.658
 Friends, I will give you some chips. 

00:01:17.658 --> 00:01:21.554
 Take it easy, go play, I’m not sure. 

00:01:21.554 --> 00:01:23.421
 This whole thing looks very strange (shady, suspicious, and also has a shadow) 

00:01:23.421 --> 00:01:25.208
 Don't worry about this 

00:01:25.207 --> 00:01:27.417
 This is just the result of the track light (referring to the shadow) 

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:30.611
 Oh, it seems that a new winner has been born. 

00:01:33.207 --> 00:01:36.168
 Gold coins taste like chocolate candies in gold foil!!嘻嘻

00:01:36.168 --> 00:01:37.668
 Come again! 

00:01:37.668 --> 00:01:41.762
 21 is great! 

00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:45.519
 I want to play a few games, there should be nothing wrong with it, Liu Ding? 

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:47.420
 Liu Ding? 

00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:51.710
 Yeah, this place is really a paradise, understand? (He read paradise paradise as pair o' dice, pair of nephews, pun) 

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:56.813
 That's it, everyone is having fun. 

00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:04.838
 Bingo!! I am in the middle... 

00:02:04.838 --> 00:02:08.462
 Ok! This is really fun! 

00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:12.121
 Poker! No, wait..Go fish! No... I won! (Go fish is a poker game) 

00:02:12.122 --> 00:02:14.755
 Hey, itchy! 

00:02:16.572 --> 00:02:17.983
 Oh my god... please... 

00:02:17.983 --> 00:02:20.224
 Are you exploding? 

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:21.706
 My money is lost. 

00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:23.728
 Big money, big money, big money, big money 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:27.389
 Oh, I lost again. 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.493
 It’s my last chip. 

00:02:33.604 --> 00:02:36.278
 Flash off, waste, wait a minute... 

00:02:36.277 --> 00:02:40.032
 Just give me a little copper plate and I can win it back. I can definitely! 

00:02:40.032 --> 00:02:43.627
 Then why don't you just find a job here? Like I am like a gnome apple 

00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:48.388
 Oh! I promise that I will return it! 

00:02:48.388 --> 00:02:50.771
 This really hurts my self-esteem 

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:53.824
 Also hurt my ass... 

00:02:53.824 --> 00:02:56.205
 Hey, where are my chips going? 

00:02:56.205 --> 00:03:00.649
 I don't feel so happy (chipper is happy, but chip is a chip, pun) 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:03.316
 Look, everyone, I know I shouldn’t do this!! 

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:05.831
 I think our finances are out of the way (lost balance, can also be literally translated as losing the scale) 

00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:06.882
 Do you understand? Finance? 

00:03:06.882 --> 00:03:13.389
 Hey, isn't this our little citrus friend and his losers? 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.738
 This is not fair! You lied to us! 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.838
 You are just a liar! I'm not a liar 

00:03:18.838 --> 00:03:23.414
 I just came here to conquer your kitchen and take your money. 

00:03:23.414 --> 00:03:26.105
 Now I am going to throw you down the street! 

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:28.860
 Wow, don't you think you are a bit too selfish? (He talks about selfish selfish as shellfish shellfish) 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.629
 Enough, little smart guy 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.835
 Don't be so excited (steamed) 

00:03:33.836 --> 00:03:36.336
 excitement? I am not excited! 

00:03:36.336 --> 00:03:37.891
 I am... steam!! (Steam steam, excited and angry) 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.364
 What? 

00:03:38.364 --> 00:03:40.521
 Do not!!! 

00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:47.012
 Wow, this guy is really quite conceited (he spoke of self-esteem as the emphasis of the second half with the steam) 

00:03:47.012 --> 00:03:50.103
 Ok, I think we have learned a valuable lesson today. 

00:03:50.103 --> 00:03:53.473
 I think I learned it, isn't it? 

00:03:53.473 --> 00:03:55.731
 This is really the best job I have ever done. 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.844
 Oh, I don't feel very comfortable. 

00:04:01.605 --> 00:04:04.759
