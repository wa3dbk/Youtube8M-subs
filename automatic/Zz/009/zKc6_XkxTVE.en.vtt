00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.540
 now let's paint the other side 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.730
 let 's say the checkerboard of the seabed that 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:21.199
 It's like a chess game of checkers 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:24.680
 made like a board and we do it with 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:28.580
 the ultramarine blue again I can 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.520
 start with a matter between gentle sea 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.120
 and at this point while we paint a 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:40.820
 little the bottom we can go seeing of by 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:43.120
 example add a little bit of it 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.940
 cyan previous 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.940
 and go also intensifying 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.350
 the blue itself 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.980
 As I told you I always like the color 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.980
 very intense 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.480
 I think it gives a lot of life to the 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:21.150
 the works 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:27.680
 and the finishes are beautiful 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.680
 and we can always go on adding 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.140
 the turquoise 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.590
 the cyan 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.800
 and go mixing with the blue if we go 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.250
 measuring as we go working we go 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.060
 seeing if we want it that way if we want it 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.060
 then change a tad 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.060
 and while dry because of course 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.460
 while it's wet it gives you a color 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:02.790
 and when it's say dry 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.960
 changes normally it becomes a little 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.830
 more clear 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.660
 and then it 's the one that's when we can 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.660
 start overlaying colors 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.240
 to find the point where most 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.240
 we like 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.060
 if I'm mixing with a little bit of 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.060
 Zidane 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.280
 to obtain these these changes of 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.280
 colour 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.440
 well where is our work what 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:33.810
 let dry and then paint the 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:36.780
 fish and seaweed without being run away 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.930
 the painting towards the bottom area of â€‹â€‹the 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.930
 sea
