00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.520
 Speaker 1: In the outside world, cycling 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.790
 Looks like most personal sports - 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.900
 Athletes constantly strive to break through the limits of humanity, 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.459
 This is independent of the competition itself. 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.580
 However, insiders can see some 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.820
 Different things - team function 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.460
 It is more important than any other sport in this sport. 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.030
 The entire operation must be carefully planned 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.509
 In the chaotic process of the game. 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.160
 Navigation planning from long distance competitions - 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.790
 Speaker 2: You must control the brakes during the game. 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.781
 Speaker 1: Go to nutrition security. 

00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:46.780
 Including the driver who follows the team 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.890
 They provide mechanical support for possible problems. 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.290
 Including those who sacrificed their own achievements 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.660
 And for the team competition. 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.580
 There is also a team strategy to ensure the team 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.009
 The best rider has the best position to win the game. 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.710
 The best cycling team in the world in Algarve, Portugal 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.253
 Competing for the 40th Volta ao here 

00:01:15.253 --> 00:01:15.752
 Algarve event. 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.930
 Each team fights in five stages 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.140
 All the way to the Mediterranean resort 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.530
 Destination. 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.190
 After the three stages, Omega Pharma Quick-Step, 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.131
 Michal Kwiatkowski has a leading position. 

00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:33.515
 He won two of the three stages. 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.200
 Although the season started to be delayed 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.120
 So that there is more time to train, Alberto Contador 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.990
 I came to Portugal for the first time to compete. 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.820
 In the three stages, the Spaniard 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.060
 Ranked second among all players and he 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.965
 There are reasons to be satisfied with your decision. 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.590
 Volta ao Algarve in the fourth stage 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.990
 It is a bigger test for his legs. 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.440
 A total of 164 kilometers away, before the end is a small steep slope 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.139
 Until the summit of Alto Malaho. 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.884
 ALBERTO CONTADOR: I want to win. 

00:02:10.884 --> 00:02:14.290
 I know that our game is very difficult. 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.960
 Other riders have participated in more competitions than me. 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.600
 At this moment, winning is 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.556
 Training in the game. 

00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:26.960
 [applause] 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.410
 Speaker 1: This stage is very suitable for Contador's riding style. 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.670
 Also provides a great opportunity for Tinkoff-Saxo 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.740
 Come and prepare for the team in the Tour de France in July. 

00:02:42.753 --> 00:02:46.620
 [applause] 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.760
 Trained Tinkoff-Saxo team 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.110
 Protect their lead riders from the start so that he can keep 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.150
 In the forefront of the car group. 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.110
 PHILIPPE MAUDUIT: It’s hard to ride 60 kilometers. 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.090
 Improve consumption to make [inaudible] fatigue. 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.718
 Now we are at the end of the game. 

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:09.070
 Nato-cam is attacking the last [inaudible] and we will be fine. 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.470
 Speaker 1: The Tinkoff-Saxo team completed their goals. 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.300
 At the beginning of the last climb, 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.750
 Alberto Contador can launch an impact. 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.545
 Piloting the entire leader, Michal Kwiatkowski, 

00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:29.640
 After two accelerations, Contador decided to launch the impact. 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.770
 This is the first victory of Contador in more than a year. 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.426
 This is also an important announcement of his new campaign. 

00:03:56.426 --> 00:03:59.680
 The Spaniard wants to regain his top in the world 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.800
 The position of the stage rider. 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.480
 ALBERTO CONTADOR: Of course, both are important. 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.440
 Because in this game, after you start, I will step by step. 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.495
 At best. 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.430
 Speaker 1: Fifth, the final stage 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.709
 The riders are going to ride 155 km. 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.780
 Pass through the Algarve region of Portugal. 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.640
 For Omega Pharma Quick-Step, they 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.830
 There are two goals in the game - 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.990
 Protecting Michal Kwiatkowski from becoming a leader, 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.760
 Also protects Mark Cavendish's position in the forefront of the car 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.550
 I have a chance to start a sprint before the end. 

00:04:52.183 --> 00:04:53.600
 Mark CAVENDISH: When you sprint, you 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.020
 I want to win every competition, really. 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.780
 But I know my physical condition very well now. 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.275
 I have grown a lot in the past eight years, I can 

00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:03.690
 Measure your situation to determine when to sprint. 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.740
 So I no longer look at where I am. 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.997
 Instead, look at your own time. 

00:05:07.997 --> 00:05:10.330
 Speaker 1: Although he is not a born traditional short-distance rider, 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.980
 Cavendish is the sprint speed in the game 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.830
 One of the fastest riders. 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.070
 Only last year, it won twenty games. 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.320
 MARK CAVENDISH: I think everyone is until me. 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.210
 Never succumb to sports science. 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.617
 Science is just enough under normal circumstances. 

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:27.950
 According to this latest science, I can’t do it here anymore. 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:28.880
 Professional rider. 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.938
 I am keen to win, understand? 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.409
 Speaker 1: Control the game from the beginning to the end 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.670
 And keep the detachment group at close range 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.490
 After that, the Omega Pharma Quick-Step team 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.960
 Let Cavendish be able to display 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.620
 His position to challenge the power of science. 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.370
 Mark Cavendish first crossed the finish line 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.790
 He won his first victory in 2014. 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.820
 His teammate Michal Kwiatkowski won the championship. 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.270
 Talented Omega Pharma Quick-Step team 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.630
 They showed their power at the beginning of the season. 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.390
 The unity of the team in them and 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.870
 Other teams will be very good when they go to the ultimate Tour de France. 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.024
 important. 

00:06:34.024 --> 00:06:35.690
 MARK CAVENDISH: As a professional rider, 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.400
 You understand the effort required to win the game. 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.015
 The team's efforts can make the individual reach 

00:06:41.015 --> 00:06:41.730
 aims. 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:42.230
 Understand? 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.140
 Is this the same as any other sport or job, understand? 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.740
 Everyone has to go all the way to get it. 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.230
 Victory or success, that's a big deal.
