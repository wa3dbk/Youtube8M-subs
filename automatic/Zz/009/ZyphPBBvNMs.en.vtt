00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.180
 little and lead by fire 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.620

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.050

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:07.189
 we have full white flour morning 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.189

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.010
 salt and yeast 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.590
 Let's mix everything like this recipe. 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.050
 not going to the mixer it's important to move 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.820
 well mix well the flours so that they do not 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.830
 get pellets of white flour 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.410
 especially when she goes on the cake and 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.540
 She's not from the sun, it's not cool to mix. 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.910
 the dry people will take a look 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.240

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:37.000
 minutes when you turn off the fire has 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.080
 if she wants she had 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.530
 dry the water and then we mix it here 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.300
 naked here in the flour and we mix 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.460
 well I have here milk and olive oil 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:56.070
 add in a separate dish to 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.070
 then combine the flour 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.290
 you saw that when you put the liquid 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.370
 aquino has been giving this consistency of 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.480
 pasta 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.640

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.520

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:33.020
 mass you give tapped her to sit 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.680

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.180
 to the oven preheated to 250 degrees 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.550
 the cooking time will be more or 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.330
 less than 20 to 25 minutes depending on 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.330
