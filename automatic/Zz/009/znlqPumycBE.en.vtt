00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.700
 of patacones that is a Colombian soup 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.370
 very popular that is made with meat with 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.950
 potatoes and of course with patacones is 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.840
 very easy to prepare and as always the 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.910

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.539

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.250
 to prepare this soup we are going to add 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.250
 water to a large pot and if they want 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.800
 can use a pressure cooker 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.390
 and to the water we are going to add onion 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.780
 white can be chopped or grated 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.410
 we are also going to add chopped garlic 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.410
 chopped carrot 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.890
 pieces of meat and you can 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.260
 use any type of meat that 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.720
 want to use I like to use morrillo 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.260
 but they can also use rib 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.260
 boneless 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.890
 and now let's add a couple of 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.930
 cubes of Colombian dressings these 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.090

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.070

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.290

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.540
 pepper to taste 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.840
 We stir all the ingredients well 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.420
 then we cover the pot and we're going to leave it 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.610
 boil over high heat and once you're 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.100
 boiling let's reduce the heat to 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.090
 medium heat and cook for about 45 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.090
 minutes more or less 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.009
 after 45 minutes we uncovered the pot 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.350
 we add the potatoes 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.659
 and we are also going to add the patacones 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.090
 if they need to learn how to do 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:20.099
 patacones can click on the pot 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.260
 at this time and will take them to the video 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.030

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.780

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.780

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.510
 After adding the patacones we are going to 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.670
 let the soup boil again and 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.680
 we leave cooking this for about 20 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.760
 minutes or so or until the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.760
 potatoes are already soft 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.810
 after 20 minutes the meat is already 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.700
 soft the potatoes are soft and the 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.590
 patacones have given very good flavor to the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.640
 broth and the only thing we have to do 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.640
 is to serve the soup 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.150
 and finally if you want you can decorate 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.150
 with a little cilantro 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.650
 and so easy soup is prepared 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.650
