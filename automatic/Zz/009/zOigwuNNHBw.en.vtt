else we get let me see if i can increase

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.050 
else we get let me see if i can increase
this<00:01:22.040> what<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.280> 2<00:01:23.610> times<00:01:23.850> 7<00:01:28.340> come<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.490> Lucy

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
this what is 2 times 7 come on Lucy

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.499 
this what is 2 times 7 come on Lucy
that's<00:01:30.509> an<00:01:30.600> easy<00:01:30.780> one<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:35.240> right<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:36.270> it's

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
that's an easy one so right now it's

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.810 
that's an easy one so right now it's
telling<00:01:36.689> me<00:01:36.840> uh<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.650> basically<00:01:38.070> Google<00:01:38.430> search

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
telling me uh to basically Google search

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.850 
telling me uh to basically Google search
that's<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.689> didn't<00:01:39.930> work<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.560> too<00:01:40.710> good

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
that's so that didn't work not too good

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.249 
that's so that didn't work not too good
but<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.640> far<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.909> mean<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.270> more<00:01:43.110> or<00:01:43.200> less

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
but so far I mean it's more or less

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.639 
but so far I mean it's more or less
decent<00:01:44.540> back<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> dates<00:01:46.049> let's<00:01:46.320> see<00:01:46.439> if<00:01:46.500> we

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
decent back to the dates let's see if we

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.649 
decent back to the dates let's see if we
can<00:01:46.860> add<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.310> longer<00:01:47.939> date<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.270> see<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:48.540> can

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
can add a longer date and see if we can

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.819 
can add a longer date and see if we can
calculate<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:50.750> how<00:01:51.750> many<00:01:51.960> days<00:01:52.229> until<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
calculate that how many days until the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:02:02.930 
calculate that how many days until the
fourth<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.579> July<00:01:59.390> come<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.570> Clues<00:02:00.840> II

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.750 
can see there's some bugs on it so far
but<00:06:23.170> again<00:06:23.290> it's<00:06:23.560> free<00:06:23.860> it's<00:06:24.280> not<00:06:24.460> made<00:06:24.730> by

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
but again it's free it's not made by

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.700 
but again it's free it's not made by
google<00:06:25.060> its<00:06:25.330> third<00:06:25.540> party<00:06:25.900> and<00:06:26.290> again<00:06:26.560> it's

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
google its third party and again it's

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.040 
google its third party and again it's
not<00:06:26.860> limited<00:06:27.280> to<00:06:27.400> one<00:06:27.790> phone<00:06:28.150> hint<00:06:28.480> hint<00:06:28.570> so

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
not limited to one phone hint hint so

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.620 
not limited to one phone hint hint so
hopefully<00:06:29.440> with<00:06:29.860> future<00:06:30.250> updates<00:06:30.670> this<00:06:31.420> will

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
hopefully with future updates this will

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.510 
hopefully with future updates this will
improve<00:06:32.020> but<00:06:32.290> it's<00:06:32.410> a<00:06:32.470> good<00:06:32.560> start<00:06:32.620> so<00:06:33.040> far<00:06:33.100> and

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
improve but it's a good start so far and

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.610 
improve but it's a good start so far and
it<00:06:33.580> is<00:06:33.700> an<00:06:33.880> alternative<00:06:34.390> to<00:06:34.720> Siri<00:06:35.110> if<00:06:35.350> you<00:06:35.470> are

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
it is an alternative to Siri if you are

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.080 
it is an alternative to Siri if you are
running<00:06:35.770> Android<00:06:36.310> and<00:06:36.550> you<00:06:36.610> want<00:06:36.790> something

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
running Android and you want something

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.730

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
similar so again clues II wasn't overly

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.890 
similar so again clues II wasn't overly
impressive<00:06:42.160> but<00:06:42.940> it<00:06:43.060> is<00:06:43.240> an<00:06:43.390> option<00:06:43.690> at<00:06:43.780> this

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
impressive but it is an option at this
