the seedlings warm keeps these cups warm
about<00:01:13.610> 80<00:01:14.330> degrees<00:01:14.720> or<00:01:14.930> a<00:01:14.960> little<00:01:15.170> higher<00:01:15.880> this

you

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.220 

I<00:02:15.909> saw<00:02:16.659> these<00:02:16.900> seeds<00:02:17.349> April<00:02:18.310> 25th

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.759 

so<00:02:24.190> that's<00:02:24.459> about<00:02:26.040> eight<00:02:27.040> days<00:02:27.340> ago<00:02:28.769> these

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
so that's about eight days ago these

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.809 
so that's about eight days ago these
seeds<00:02:30.360> actually<00:02:31.360> germinated<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.610> lot<00:02:33.610> of<00:02:33.760> them

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
seeds actually germinated a lot of them

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.009 
seeds actually germinated a lot of them
actually<00:02:34.000> germinated<00:02:34.690> within<00:02:34.930> three<00:02:35.230> days<00:02:37.140> I

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
actually germinated within three days I

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.839 
actually germinated within three days I
have<00:02:41.019> two<00:02:41.200> highly<00:02:41.560> recommend<00:02:42.129> that<00:02:42.549> you<00:02:42.819> watch

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
have two highly recommend that you watch

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.509 
have two highly recommend that you watch
these<00:02:43.660> every<00:02:44.349> day<00:02:44.379> you<00:02:44.590> have<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:44.980> check<00:02:45.340> on

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
these every day you have to check on

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.460 
these every day you have to check on
them<00:02:45.700> every<00:02:45.730> day<00:02:46.060> because<00:02:46.599> what<00:02:46.959> can<00:02:47.230> happen

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
them every day because what can happen

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.819 
them every day because what can happen
is<00:02:47.890> if<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:48.879> forget<00:02:49.180> about<00:02:49.329> them<00:02:49.599> too<00:02:49.750> long<00:02:49.959> the

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
is if you forget about them too long the

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.309 
is if you forget about them too long the
seedlings<00:02:51.310> get<00:02:51.579> really<00:02:52.030> tall<00:02:52.329> and<00:02:52.690> spindly

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
seedlings get really tall and spindly

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.220 
seedlings get really tall and spindly
and<00:02:53.739> then<00:02:54.340> they<00:02:54.459> fall<00:02:54.519> over<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.209> then<00:02:55.930> they're

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
and then they fall over and then they're

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.100 
and then they fall over and then they're
no<00:02:56.379> good<00:02:56.579> so<00:02:57.579> after<00:02:58.120> they<00:02:58.299> sprout<00:02:58.660> you've<00:02:58.930> got

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
no good so after they sprout you've got

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.020 
no good so after they sprout you've got
about<00:02:59.349> a<00:02:59.410> 24<00:02:59.980> hour<00:03:00.099> period<00:03:00.370> where<00:03:00.700> you've<00:03:00.819> got

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
about a 24 hour period where you've got

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.869 
about a 24 hour period where you've got
to<00:03:01.230> see<00:03:02.230> these<00:03:02.410> take<00:03:03.069> them<00:03:03.220> out<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.370> get<00:03:03.760> them

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
to see these take them out and get them

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.400 
to see these take them out and get them
under<00:03:04.060> some<00:03:04.329> high<00:03:04.840> intensity<00:03:05.739> light<00:03:07.410> so

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
under some high intensity light so

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.960 
under some high intensity light so
that's<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:08.920> part<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.370> got<00:03:09.609> to<00:03:09.760> really<00:03:09.879> be

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
that's the part you got to really be

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.280 
that's the part you got to really be
careful<00:03:10.090> about<00:03:11.609> my<00:03:12.609> other<00:03:13.079> series<00:03:14.079> how<00:03:14.260> to

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
careful about my other series how to

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.990 
careful about my other series how to
grow<00:03:14.530> hot<00:03:14.680> peppers<00:03:15.239> part<00:03:16.239> 1<00:03:16.480> will<00:03:17.379> show<00:03:17.620> you

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
grow hot peppers part 1 will show you

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.410 
grow hot peppers part 1 will show you
what<00:03:19.000> I've<00:03:19.150> done<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.720> create<00:03:20.440> these<00:03:20.739> cheap

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
what I've done to create these cheap

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.539 
what I've done to create these cheap
cups<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:23.440> don't<00:03:23.650> have<00:03:23.829> to<00:03:23.980> pay<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.190> lot<00:03:24.400> of

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
cups you don't have to pay a lot of

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:31.280 
cups you don't have to pay a lot of
money<00:03:25.500> that's<00:03:26.500> always<00:03:26.859> good<00:03:27.069> in<00:03:27.160> my<00:03:27.310> opinion

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.410 

okay<00:03:32.010> so<00:03:32.099> that's<00:03:32.370> basically<00:03:32.579> it<00:03:32.939> for<00:03:33.090> now

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
okay so that's basically it for now

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.819 
okay so that's basically it for now
really<00:03:34.290> easy<00:03:34.939> tomatoes<00:03:35.939> grow<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.769> lot<00:03:37.769> faster

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
really easy tomatoes grow a lot faster

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.479 
really easy tomatoes grow a lot faster
than<00:03:38.819> peppers<00:03:39.329> do<00:03:39.540> that's<00:03:40.469> why<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:40.799> wait<00:03:41.250> so

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
than peppers do that's why I wait so

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.599 
than peppers do that's why I wait so
long<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:42.000> find<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.079> I<00:03:43.140> only<00:03:43.500> need<00:03:43.799> about<00:03:44.040> three

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
long I find that I only need about three

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:50.149 
long I find that I only need about three
weeks<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:46.290> in<00:03:46.709> advance<00:03:48.530> before<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.769> put<00:03:50.010> them

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
weeks to in advance before I put them

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.809 
weeks to in advance before I put them
outside<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:51.650> when<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.769> plants<00:03:53.129> go<00:03:53.340> outside

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
outside and when the plants go outside

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.690 
outside and when the plants go outside
as<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.959> will<00:03:55.140> see<00:03:55.170> in<00:03:55.379> my<00:03:55.890> future<00:03:55.920> video

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
as you will see in my future video

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.910 
as you will see in my future video
they're<00:03:57.480> not<00:03:57.629> enormous<00:03:58.319> at<00:03:58.470> all<00:03:58.590> they're

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
they're not enormous at all they're

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.289 
they're not enormous at all they're
probably<00:03:59.840> 34<00:04:00.840> inches<00:04:01.170> at<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.349> most<00:04:01.680> tall<00:04:02.299> but

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
probably 34 inches at the most tall but

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.050 
probably 34 inches at the most tall but
I've<00:04:03.840> found<00:04:04.349> that<00:04:04.590> once<00:04:05.549> you<00:04:05.700> get<00:04:05.879> them

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
I've found that once you get them

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.420 
I've found that once you get them
outside<00:04:06.239> even<00:04:07.049> in<00:04:07.439> that<00:04:09.769> even<00:04:10.769> with<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.159> size

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
outside even in that even with that size

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.720 
outside even in that even with that size
they<00:04:11.790> grow<00:04:12.090> like<00:04:12.120> crazy<00:04:12.950> there's<00:04:13.950> no<00:04:14.220> need<00:04:14.489> to

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
they grow like crazy there's no need to

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.180 
they grow like crazy there's no need to
start<00:04:15.030> them<00:04:15.269> any<00:04:15.419> earlier<00:04:15.810> in<00:04:16.109> my<00:04:16.320> opinion<00:04:16.739> in

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
start them any earlier in my opinion in

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.939 
start them any earlier in my opinion in
fact<00:04:18.380> just<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.470> quick<00:04:19.680> story<00:04:20.009> I<00:04:21.470> had<00:04:22.470> started<00:04:22.740> a

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
fact just a quick story I had started a

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.820 
fact just a quick story I had started a
bunch<00:04:23.130> of<00:04:23.280> seeds<00:04:23.520> in<00:04:23.729> a<00:04:23.789> previous<00:04:24.060> year<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.840> I

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
bunch of seeds in a previous year and I

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.060 
bunch of seeds in a previous year and I
can<00:04:26.009> say<00:04:26.160> they<00:04:26.340> got<00:04:26.520> really<00:04:26.910> tall<00:04:27.949> that's<00:04:28.949> how

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
can say they got really tall that's how

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.560 
can say they got really tall that's how
I<00:04:29.099> figured<00:04:29.520> out<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:29.669> that<00:04:29.940> was<00:04:30.120> not<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.330> good

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
I figured out that that was not a good

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.810 
I figured out that that was not a good
thing<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:32.460> brought<00:04:32.639> those<00:04:32.820> outside<00:04:33.360> and

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
thing and I brought those outside and

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.279 
thing and I brought those outside and
they<00:04:35.820> just<00:04:36.060> weren't<00:04:36.270> doing<00:04:36.630> very<00:04:36.659> good<00:04:37.080> and

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
they just weren't doing very good and

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:38.779 
they just weren't doing very good and
some<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.620> them<00:04:37.740> actually<00:04:37.919> just<00:04:38.280> kind<00:04:38.460> of<00:04:38.520> died

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
some of them actually just kind of died

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.390 
some of them actually just kind of died
off<00:04:39.080> so<00:04:40.080> I<00:04:40.110> had<00:04:40.349> to<00:04:40.380> start<00:04:40.680> some<00:04:40.889> new<00:04:40.919> ones<00:04:41.250> from

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
off so I had to start some new ones from

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.480 
off so I had to start some new ones from
seed<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:42.139> after<00:04:43.139> only<00:04:43.320> about<00:04:43.440> two<00:04:43.919> weeks<00:04:44.099> in

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
seed and after only about two weeks in

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.120 
seed and after only about two weeks in
the<00:04:44.729> cup<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:45.150> put<00:04:45.449> him<00:04:45.539> outside<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:46.229> those

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
the cup I put him outside and those

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.420 
the cup I put him outside and those
actually<00:04:47.610> grew<00:04:47.880> better<00:04:48.530> than<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.889> tall<00:04:50.159> ones

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
actually grew better than the tall ones

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.390 
actually grew better than the tall ones
in<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:50.970> end<00:04:51.199> so<00:04:52.199> that's<00:04:52.380> why<00:04:52.590> i<00:04:52.620> decided<00:04:53.159> that

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
in the end so that's why i decided that

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.250 
in the end so that's why i decided that
i<00:04:53.550> only<00:04:53.820> need<00:04:54.000> three<00:04:54.300> weeks<00:04:54.539> and<00:04:54.810> it's<00:04:54.960> really

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
i only need three weeks and it's really

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.710 
i only need three weeks and it's really
worked<00:04:55.500> good<00:04:55.860> for<00:04:55.919> me<00:04:56.190> for<00:04:56.669> the<00:04:56.699> last<00:04:56.909> five

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
worked good for me for the last five

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.750 
worked good for me for the last five
years<00:04:57.750> or<00:04:58.199> so<00:05:00.110> so<00:05:01.110> anyway<00:05:02.010> this<00:05:02.190> is<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.400> video
