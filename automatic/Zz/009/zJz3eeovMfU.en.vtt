around lately that Justice League has

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.589

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
been confirmed yet they were supposed to

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.609 
been confirmed yet they were supposed to
have<00:00:29.970> been<00:00:30.029> working<00:00:30.509> on<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> script<00:00:31.079> for<00:00:31.470> it

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
have been working on the script for it

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.180 
have been working on the script for it
and<00:00:32.660> we<00:00:33.660> still<00:00:34.019> haven't<00:00:34.230> heard<00:00:34.530> whether<00:00:34.980> or

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
and we still haven't heard whether or

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.130 
and we still haven't heard whether or
not<00:00:35.340> they've<00:00:35.610> got<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.879> good<00:00:36.210> director<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.839> who

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
not they've got a good director for who

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.639 
not they've got a good director for who
they<00:00:37.320> chosen<00:00:38.269> any<00:00:39.269> of<00:00:39.449> the<00:00:39.570> actor<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.079> anything

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
they chosen any of the actor is anything

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.990 
they chosen any of the actor is anything
like<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.250> if<00:00:41.460> they're<00:00:41.670> still<00:00:41.820> working

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
like that but if they're still working

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.090 
like that but if they're still working
on<00:00:42.269> the<00:00:42.390> script<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.809> guess<00:00:43.019> it<00:00:43.769> makes<00:00:43.949> sense

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
on the script I guess it makes sense

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.710 
on the script I guess it makes sense
they<00:00:44.489> might<00:00:44.699> not<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:45.120> all<00:00:45.329> those<00:00:45.479> things

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
they might not have all those things

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.139 
they might not have all those things
envisioned<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.350> yet<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.800> director<00:00:47.339> you'd

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
envisioned just yet but a director you'd

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.869 
envisioned just yet but a director you'd
think<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.839> exclusive<00:00:49.680> producer<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.550> think

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
think and exclusive producer you think

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.399 
think and exclusive producer you think
they'd<00:00:51.030> want<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.329> probably<00:00:51.540> get<00:00:51.899> them<00:00:52.229> on

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
they'd want to probably get them on

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:55.220 
they'd want to probably get them on
board<00:00:52.440> pretty<00:00:52.920> soon<00:00:53.719> we<00:00:54.719> did<00:00:54.870> hear<00:00:55.019> some

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
board pretty soon we did hear some

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.840 
board pretty soon we did hear some
rumors<00:00:55.350> i<00:00:55.649> think<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.920> was<00:00:56.010> offered<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.429> a<00:00:56.579> few

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
rumors i think it was offered to a few

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.849 
rumors i think it was offered to a few
different<00:00:56.940> people<00:00:57.269> then<00:00:57.719> Affleck<00:00:58.379> was<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:58.739> of

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
different people then Affleck was one of

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:59.990 
different people then Affleck was one of
them<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.160> pretty<00:00:59.339> sure<00:00:59.460> he<00:00:59.609> turned<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.969> down

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
them and pretty sure he turned it down

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.090 
them and pretty sure he turned it down
or<00:01:00.750> he<00:01:00.929> did<00:01:01.079> turn<00:01:01.260> down<00:01:01.559> there<00:01:01.859> were<00:01:01.920> some

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
or he did turn down there were some

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.919 
or he did turn down there were some
others<00:01:02.339> too<00:01:02.370> i<00:01:02.550> think<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.120> well<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:03.600> they<00:01:03.780> all

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
others too i think as well but they all

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.680 
others too i think as well but they all
turned<00:01:04.649> it<00:01:04.769> down<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.160> I<00:01:05.399> think<00:01:05.759> Justice<00:01:06.479> League

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
turned it down to I think Justice League

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.469 
turned it down to I think Justice League
might<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> project<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.070> as<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> movie<00:01:09.149> a<00:01:09.179> lot

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
might be a project that as a movie a lot

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.130 
might be a project that as a movie a lot
of<00:01:09.750> makers<00:01:10.740> filmmakers<00:01:11.340> will<00:01:11.580> maybe<00:01:12.539> shy<00:01:12.929> away

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
of makers filmmakers will maybe shy away

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.139 
of makers filmmakers will maybe shy away
from<00:01:13.320> because<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.130> how<00:01:14.310> much<00:01:14.520> work<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.000> would

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
from because of how much work it would

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.279 
from because of how much work it would
be<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.720> how<00:01:17.240> just<00:01:18.240> how<00:01:18.330> difficult<00:01:19.050> it<00:01:19.170> would

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
be and how just how difficult it would

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.440 
be and how just how difficult it would
be<00:01:19.319> to<00:01:19.470> really<00:01:19.830> do<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.369> characters<00:01:20.640> justice

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
be to really do the characters justice

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.219 
be to really do the characters justice
they<00:01:22.140> might<00:01:22.530> no<00:01:23.220> pun<00:01:23.399> intended<00:01:23.840> they<00:01:24.840> might

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
they might no pun intended they might

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.520 
they might no pun intended they might
not<00:01:25.530> want<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.369> sign<00:01:26.790> up<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:28.259> being

said<00:01:28.770> Avengers<00:01:29.369> worked<00:01:29.850> out<00:01:30.060> really<00:01:30.329> really

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
said Avengers worked out really really

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.630 
said Avengers worked out really really
well<00:01:30.659> from<00:01:30.990> marble<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.590> think<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.369> kind<00:01:32.490> of

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
well from marble I think it kind of

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.850 
well from marble I think it kind of
showed<00:01:32.939> DC<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.170> they<00:01:34.290> really<00:01:34.530> probably

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
showed DC that they really probably

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.219 
showed DC that they really probably
should<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.490> had<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> Justice<00:01:36.719> League<00:01:36.899> movie

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229

should have had a Justice League movie
already<00:01:37.439> they<00:01:38.070> should<00:01:38.219> have<00:01:38.340> at<00:01:38.399> least<00:01:38.430> had

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
already they should have at least had

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.969 
already they should have at least had
one<00:01:39.119> live-action<00:01:39.630> Justice<00:01:40.170> League<00:01:40.350> movie<00:01:40.649> at

people know them all at this point but

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.160 
people know them all at this point but
there<00:02:37.120> are<00:02:37.269> a<00:02:37.300> lot<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.569> people<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.050> if

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
there are a lot of people that if

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.839 
there are a lot of people that if
they're<00:02:38.290> not<00:02:38.410> in<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.680> comic<00:02:38.980> books<00:02:39.190> they

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
they definitely know Batman Superman

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.050 
they definitely know Batman Superman
that's<00:02:43.000> for<00:02:43.269> sure<00:02:43.420> everybody<00:02:43.930> knows<00:02:44.110> them<00:02:45.060> so

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
that's for sure everybody knows them so

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.759 
that's for sure everybody knows them so
that<00:02:46.629> being<00:02:46.840> said<00:02:46.900> they<00:02:47.260> pretty<00:02:47.530> much<00:02:47.620> know

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
that being said they pretty much know

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.830 
that being said they pretty much know
that<00:02:48.190> if<00:02:48.280> they<00:02:48.430> do<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.910> they<00:02:49.030> do<00:02:49.090> a<00:02:49.180> good<00:02:49.360> job<00:02:49.420> of

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
that if they do it they do a good job of

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.520 
that if they do it they do a good job of
a<00:02:50.140> movie<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.069> will<00:02:51.250> be<00:02:51.280> successful<00:02:52.379> so<00:02:53.379> if

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
a movie that it will be successful so if

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.110 
a movie that it will be successful so if
it<00:02:53.650> isn't<00:02:53.950> cancelled<00:02:54.459> I'm<00:02:54.760> gonna<00:02:54.970> do<00:02:55.090> a

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
it isn't cancelled I'm gonna do a

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.180 
it isn't cancelled I'm gonna do a
prediction<00:02:55.510> for<00:02:55.900> which<00:02:56.110> one<00:02:56.440> I<00:02:56.470> think<00:02:56.680> will<00:02:57.069> be

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
prediction for which one I think will be

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.259 
prediction for which one I think will be
better<00:02:57.370> now<00:02:57.580> this<00:02:57.730> is<00:02:57.819> going<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.000> be<00:02:58.060> really

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
better now this is going to be really

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.130 
better now this is going to be really
hard<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.540> do<00:02:58.660> because<00:02:58.750> we<00:02:58.959> don't<00:02:59.110> have

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
hard to do because we don't have

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.320 
hard to do because we don't have
anything<00:02:59.410> at<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.769> moment<00:02:59.920> since<00:03:00.910> it's<00:03:01.150> so

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
anything at the moment since it's so

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.390 
anything at the moment since it's so
early<00:03:01.569> but<00:03:02.260> if<00:03:02.410> they<00:03:02.560> do<00:03:02.620> both<00:03:02.950> go<00:03:03.160> through

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
early but if they do both go through

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.100 
early but if they do both go through
with<00:03:03.519> it<00:03:03.549> I<00:03:03.700> think<00:03:04.090> Justice<00:03:04.480> Lee<00:03:04.629> does<00:03:04.900> have

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
with it I think Justice Lee does have

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.130 
with it I think Justice Lee does have
the<00:03:05.230> potential<00:03:05.799> to<00:03:06.510> outsell<00:03:07.510> in<00:03:07.810> terms<00:03:08.019> of

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
the potential to outsell in terms of

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.610 
the potential to outsell in terms of
tickets<00:03:08.500> The<00:03:09.010> Avengers<00:03:09.760> 2<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.930> even<00:03:11.200> surpass

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
tickets The Avengers 2 to even surpass

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.910 
tickets The Avengers 2 to even surpass
probably<00:03:12.010> Avengers<00:03:12.459> one<00:03:13.709> that's<00:03:14.709> I<00:03:14.860> know

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
probably Avengers one that's I know

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.830 
probably Avengers one that's I know
that's<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.310> that's<00:03:15.579> going<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:16.450> be<00:03:16.510> pretty<00:03:16.630> hard

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
that's a that's going to be pretty hard

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.030 
that's a that's going to be pretty hard
to<00:03:16.900> do<00:03:17.049> since<00:03:17.230> they<00:03:17.349> did<00:03:17.530> over<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.799> billion

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
to do since they did over a billion

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.280 
to do since they did over a billion
dollar<00:03:18.340> but<00:03:18.910> I<00:03:18.970> definitely<00:03:19.239> think<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.989> could

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
dollar but I definitely think it could

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.319 
dollar but I definitely think it could
do<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.769> so<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.220> is<00:03:21.400> if<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:21.610> doesn't<00:03:21.670> get<00:03:22.000> can

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
do it so that is if it doesn't get can

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.319 
do it so that is if it doesn't get can
because<00:03:22.720> people<00:03:23.049> are<00:03:23.140> just<00:03:23.319> kind<00:03:23.590> of<00:03:23.709> too

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
because people are just kind of too

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.030 
because people are just kind of too
nervous<00:03:25.329> to<00:03:25.540> take<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.049> on<00:03:26.170> you<00:03:26.650> know<00:03:26.769> for

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
nervous to take it on you know for

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.430 
nervous to take it on you know for
themselves<00:03:27.400> um<00:03:27.900> at<00:03:28.900> least<00:03:28.959> that's<00:03:29.349> the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
themselves um at least that's the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.229 
themselves um at least that's the
potential<00:03:30.069> but<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.280> think<00:03:30.610> that<00:03:30.700> if<00:03:31.090> you're

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
potential but I think that if you're

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.789 
potential but I think that if you're
gonna<00:03:31.390> you<00:03:31.780> know<00:03:31.900> go<00:03:32.140> 1<00:03:32.349> verses<00:03:32.680> together

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
gonna you know go 1 verses together

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.030 
gonna you know go 1 verses together
based<00:03:33.730> on<00:03:34.000> just<00:03:34.269> how<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.480> Avengers<00:03:34.870> one<00:03:35.500> went

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
based on just how the Avengers one went

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.340 
based on just how the Avengers one went
and<00:03:36.340> what<00:03:36.700> Marvel<00:03:37.269> was<00:03:37.389> able<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.780> learn<00:03:37.959> from

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
and what Marvel was able to learn from

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.710 
and what Marvel was able to learn from
it<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:38.769> then<00:03:38.950> take<00:03:39.160> from<00:03:39.459> it<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.600> know

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
it and then take from it and you know

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.420 
it and then take from it and you know
going<00:03:41.019> to<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.350> next<00:03:41.500> one<00:03:41.680> with<00:03:41.799> it<00:03:41.980> as<00:03:42.100> well<00:03:42.250> as

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
going to the next one with it as well as

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.830 
going to the next one with it as well as
all<00:03:42.549> the<00:03:42.579> movies<00:03:42.910> they<00:03:43.060> from<00:03:43.269> producing

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
all the movies they from producing

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.650 
all the movies they from producing
leading<00:03:44.620> up<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.160> I<00:03:45.700> think<00:03:46.180> it'd<00:03:46.450> probably

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
leading up to it I think it'd probably

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.750 
leading up to it I think it'd probably
be<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.870> safe<00:03:47.170> bet<00:03:47.410> to<00:03:47.470> say<00:03:47.739> Avengers<00:03:48.190> 2<00:03:48.459> would

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
be a safe bet to say Avengers 2 would

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.509 
be a safe bet to say Avengers 2 would
probably<00:03:49.329> will<00:03:49.959> probably<00:03:50.500> out<00:03:50.680> do<00:03:51.010> it<00:03:51.040> because

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
probably will probably out do it because

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.370 
probably will probably out do it because
i<00:03:51.790> think<00:03:52.120> that<00:03:52.389> Justice<00:03:52.810> League<00:03:52.959> is<00:03:52.989> just<00:03:53.230> one

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
i think that Justice League is just one

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.349 
i think that Justice League is just one
of<00:03:53.410> those<00:03:53.530> projects<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.160> it's<00:03:54.280> kind<00:03:54.549> of<00:03:54.670> so

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
of those projects that it's kind of so

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.940 
of those projects that it's kind of so
hard<00:03:55.599> for<00:03:55.750> them<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.900> do<00:03:56.170> it<00:03:56.319> justice<00:03:56.739> that

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
hard for them to do it justice that

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
hard for them to do it justice that
they're<00:03:57.069> just<00:03:57.250> going<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.459> something's<00:03:57.849> going

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
they're just going to something's going

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.460 
they're just going to something's going
to<00:03:58.000> go<00:03:58.090> wrong<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:58.389> just<00:03:58.540> almost<00:03:58.870> think<00:03:59.319> of

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
to go wrong you just almost think of

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.589 
to go wrong you just almost think of
like<00:03:59.700> that<00:04:00.700> something's<00:04:01.060> got<00:04:01.209> to<00:04:01.239> go<00:04:01.389> wrong

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
like that something's got to go wrong

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.360 
like that something's got to go wrong
and<00:04:01.780> it's<00:04:01.900> either<00:04:02.139> God<00:04:02.410> I<00:04:02.440> get<00:04:02.799> I<00:04:03.040> don't<00:04:03.310> know

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
and it's either God I get I don't know

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.089 
and it's either God I get I don't know
turn<00:04:03.940> out<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.269> be<00:04:04.450> you<00:04:04.810> know<00:04:04.840> not<00:04:05.109> very<00:04:05.349> good<00:04:05.620> or

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
turn out to be you know not very good or

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.129 
turn out to be you know not very good or
just<00:04:06.130> I<00:04:06.459> kind<00:04:06.849> of<00:04:06.940> like<00:04:07.090> kind<00:04:07.660> of<00:04:07.780> like<00:04:07.840> Green

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
just I kind of like kind of like Green

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.199 
just I kind of like kind of like Green
Lantern<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.680> how<00:04:08.950> that<00:04:09.010> was<00:04:09.370> you<00:04:09.609> know<00:04:09.730> just<00:04:09.760> I

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
Lantern and how that was you know just I

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.059 
Lantern and how that was you know just I
don't<00:04:10.780> know<00:04:10.900> it<00:04:11.139> just<00:04:11.169> it<00:04:11.440> just<00:04:11.680> seems<00:04:12.010> like

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
don't know it just it just seems like

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.920 
don't know it just it just seems like
it's<00:04:12.310> it's<00:04:12.609> such<00:04:12.849> a<00:04:12.880> humongous<00:04:13.389> project<00:04:13.630> and

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
it's it's such a humongous project and

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.300 
it's it's such a humongous project and
you<00:04:13.989> have<00:04:14.079> so<00:04:14.290> many<00:04:14.410> big<00:04:14.680> characters<00:04:15.099> in<00:04:15.250> it

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
you have so many big characters in it

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.849 
you have so many big characters in it
that<00:04:15.750> it's<00:04:16.750> just<00:04:16.930> not<00:04:17.079> going<00:04:17.200> to<00:04:17.260> work<00:04:17.320> out<00:04:17.620> at

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
that it's just not going to work out at

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.620 
that it's just not going to work out at
least<00:04:18.039> that's<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.489> sense<00:04:18.849> that<00:04:18.940> I<00:04:19.120> get<00:04:19.599> from

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
least that's the sense that I get from

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.509 
least that's the sense that I get from
it<00:04:19.930> so<00:04:20.079> far<00:04:20.349> I<00:04:20.380> mean<00:04:20.530> obviously<00:04:20.859> we<00:04:21.190> don't<00:04:21.370> have

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
it so far I mean obviously we don't have

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.469 
it so far I mean obviously we don't have
a<00:04:21.579> trailer<00:04:21.820> yet<00:04:22.030> we<00:04:22.150> don't<00:04:22.240> know<00:04:22.389> who's

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
a trailer yet we don't know who's

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.750 
a trailer yet we don't know who's
involved<00:04:22.780> with<00:04:23.080> it<00:04:23.229> once<00:04:24.160> we<00:04:24.340> find<00:04:24.550> out<00:04:24.669> who

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
involved with it once we find out who

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.430 
involved with it once we find out who
the<00:04:24.849> director<00:04:25.000> is<00:04:25.389> that<00:04:25.599> would<00:04:25.750> be<00:04:25.900> you<00:04:26.320> know

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
the director is that would be you know

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.969 
the director is that would be you know
big<00:04:26.849> have<00:04:27.849> a<00:04:27.880> lot<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.180> impact<00:04:28.630> on<00:04:28.930> this<00:04:29.169> but<00:04:29.470> if

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
big have a lot of impact on this but if

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.409 
big have a lot of impact on this but if
they<00:04:30.190> get<00:04:30.340> someone<00:04:30.610> like<00:04:30.639> Christopher<00:04:31.000> Nolan

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
they get someone like Christopher Nolan

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.680 
they get someone like Christopher Nolan
I<00:04:31.510> think<00:04:31.720> it<00:04:31.810> could<00:04:31.930> work<00:04:32.139> Zack<00:04:33.130> Snyder<00:04:33.690> could

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
I think it could work Zack Snyder could

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.930 
I think it could work Zack Snyder could
also<00:04:34.840> could<00:04:35.440> also<00:04:35.560> work<00:04:35.860> but<00:04:36.490> whether<00:04:36.700> or<00:04:36.820> not

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
also could also work but whether or not

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.190 
also could also work but whether or not
they're<00:04:37.210> up<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.419> the<00:04:37.539> challenge<00:04:37.930> I<00:04:38.020> don't

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
they're up to the challenge I don't

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.450 
they're up to the challenge I don't
think<00:04:38.380> either<00:04:38.530> of<00:04:38.680> them<00:04:38.770> really<00:04:39.070> are<00:04:39.220> at<00:04:39.310> this

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
think either of them really are at this

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.580 
think either of them really are at this
point<00:04:39.729> because<00:04:39.880> if<00:04:40.599> they<00:04:40.900> were<00:04:40.960> we<00:04:41.349> probably

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
point because if they were we probably

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.610 
point because if they were we probably
would<00:04:41.800> have<00:04:41.860> heard<00:04:41.979> about<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.219> already<00:04:43.500> so<00:04:44.500> who

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
would have heard about it already so who

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.050 
would have heard about it already so who
else<00:04:44.770> are<00:04:44.950> they<00:04:45.039> going<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.280> get<00:04:45.400> I<00:04:45.460> really

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
else are they going to get I really

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.300 
else are they going to get I really
don't

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
don't

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.670 
don't
at<00:04:46.400> this<00:04:46.550> point<00:04:46.790> so<00:04:47.090> I<00:04:47.330> do<00:04:47.840> think<00:04:48.350> Justice

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
at this point so I do think Justice

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.320 
at this point so I do think Justice
League<00:04:48.860> has<00:04:49.010> the<00:04:49.130> potential<00:04:49.430> to<00:04:49.580> be<00:04:49.850> a<00:04:50.060> better

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
League has the potential to be a better

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.060 
League has the potential to be a better
movie<00:04:50.660> I<00:04:51.020> think<00:04:51.320> it<00:04:51.380> has<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.500> potential<00:04:51.890> to

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
movie I think it has the potential to

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.750 
movie I think it has the potential to
outsell<00:04:52.700> Avengers<00:04:53.360> 2<00:04:53.540> but<00:04:54.260> I'd<00:04:55.010> have<00:04:55.220> to<00:04:55.280> say

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
outsell Avengers 2 but I'd have to say

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
outsell Avengers 2 but I'd have to say
that<00:04:55.910> I<00:04:56.000> don't<00:04:56.060> think<00:04:56.390> it's<00:04:56.480> going<00:04:56.570> to<00:04:56.630> happen

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
that I don't think it's going to happen
