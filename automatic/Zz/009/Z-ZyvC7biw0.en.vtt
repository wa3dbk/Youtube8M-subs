00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.140 
spider-man the Marvel's a select
spider-man<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:23.250> also<00:03:23.519> here's<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.790> comparison

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
spider-man and also here's a comparison

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.199 
spider-man and also here's a comparison
to<00:03:24.450> Iron<00:03:24.630> Man<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.579> 6-inch<00:03:26.579> figure<00:03:26.849> is

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
to Iron Man to the 6-inch figure is

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.210 
to Iron Man to the 6-inch figure is
really<00:03:27.419> cool<00:03:27.660> it's<00:03:28.349> a<00:03:28.440> little<00:03:28.980> bit<00:03:29.069> bigger

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
really cool it's a little bit bigger

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.920 
really cool it's a little bit bigger
than<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.579> Iron<00:03:29.819> Man<00:03:30.000> figure<00:03:30.329> and<00:03:30.599> in<00:03:30.690> reality

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
than the Iron Man figure and in reality

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.449 
than the Iron Man figure and in reality
I<00:03:31.109> think<00:03:31.169> Iron<00:03:31.500> Man<00:03:31.650> would<00:03:31.769> be<00:03:31.889> bigger<00:03:32.069> due<00:03:32.310> to

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
I think Iron Man would be bigger due to

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.990 
I think Iron Man would be bigger due to
the<00:03:32.579> giant<00:03:33.569> you<00:03:33.629> know<00:03:33.840> iron<00:03:34.430> titanium<00:03:35.430> you

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
the giant you know iron titanium you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.330 
the giant you know iron titanium you
know<00:03:36.120> suit<00:03:36.359> but<00:03:37.169> that's<00:03:37.620> -<00:03:37.739> pretty<00:03:38.010> cool<00:03:38.220> it

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
know suit but that's - pretty cool it

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.039 
know suit but that's - pretty cool it
almost<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:39.060> criticize<00:03:39.419> so<00:03:39.569> if<00:03:39.629> you<00:03:39.720> have<00:03:39.810> them<00:03:39.930> a

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
almost I criticize so if you have them a

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.629 
almost I criticize so if you have them a
little<00:03:40.079> bit<00:03:40.379> further<00:03:40.500> apart<00:03:40.709> they<00:03:41.430> actually

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
little bit further apart they actually

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.099 
little bit further apart they actually
look<00:03:41.849> like<00:03:41.879> they're<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.329> exact<00:03:42.540> same<00:03:42.569> size<00:03:42.930> so

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
look like they're the exact same size so

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.770 
look like they're the exact same size so
they<00:03:43.199> can<00:03:43.319> fight<00:03:43.500> side-by-side

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780
