that these are real sort since there are
brushed<00:02:53.870> aluminum<00:02:54.350> but<00:02:55.070> if<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:56.030> fake<00:02:56.239> ones<00:02:56.510> it

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
brushed aluminum but if the fake ones it

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.420 
brushed aluminum but if the fake ones it
would<00:02:57.110> definitely<00:02:57.230> be<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.620> sort<00:02:57.890> of<00:02:57.950> darker

metal gunmetal and also the writing on
here<00:03:02.120> monster<00:03:02.600> will<00:03:02.989> be<00:03:03.140> raised<00:03:03.440> it'll<00:03:04.280> be<00:03:04.340> a

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
here monster will be raised it'll be a

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.509 
here monster will be raised it'll be a
much<00:03:04.790> larger<00:03:05.209> riding<00:03:05.739> also<00:03:06.739> on<00:03:06.920> it'll<00:03:07.250> start

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
much larger riding also on it'll start

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.280 
much larger riding also on it'll start
pretty<00:03:07.910> much<00:03:08.060> breaking<00:03:08.329> apart<00:03:08.600> if<00:03:08.989> its<00:03:09.110> face

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
pretty much breaking apart if its face

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.259 
pretty much breaking apart if its face
yeah<00:03:09.650> pretty<00:03:10.130> much<00:03:10.220> fall<00:03:10.670> apart<00:03:10.940> in<00:03:11.120> like<00:03:11.239> a

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
yeah pretty much fall apart in like a

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.660 
yeah pretty much fall apart in like a
day<00:03:11.510> Z<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:12.230> most<00:03:12.560> probably<00:03:12.860> were<00:03:13.040> they<00:03:13.430> sound

pretty good not as good as a Bose as my

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.530 
pretty good not as good as a Bose as my
base<00:03:18.410> in<00:03:18.650> years<00:03:18.860> but<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.880> base<00:03:20.060> is<00:03:20.090> pretty

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
base in years but the base is pretty

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.140 
base in years but the base is pretty
damn<00:03:20.690> good<00:03:20.900> still<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:22.070> sound<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.610> crisp<00:03:22.940> it's
