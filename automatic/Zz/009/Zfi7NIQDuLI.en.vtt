AIDS<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.309> point<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.850> being<00:00:32.910> made<00:00:33.180> is

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
AIDS is the point that is being made is

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.260 
AIDS is the point that is being made is
that<00:00:34.500> what<00:00:35.809> appeared<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:37.100> trivial<00:00:38.270> and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
that what appeared to be trivial and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.650 
that what appeared to be trivial and
somewhat<00:00:40.230> inaccurate<00:00:41.059> prophecies<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.300> indeed

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
somewhat inaccurate prophecies if indeed

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.369 
somewhat inaccurate prophecies if indeed
they<00:00:42.840> are<00:00:42.870> prophecies<00:00:44.090> mean<00:00:45.090> naught<00:00:45.420> when<00:00:46.110> you

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
they are prophecies mean naught when you

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.850 
they are prophecies mean naught when you
compare<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:46.980> what<00:00:47.960> science<00:00:48.960> has<00:00:49.200> given<00:00:49.710> you

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
compare it to what science has given you

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.660 
compare it to what science has given you
that's<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.940> only<00:00:50.969> that's<00:00:51.300> big<00:00:51.570> made<00:00:51.809> right<00:00:52.800> so

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
that's the only that's big made right so

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.299 
that's the only that's big made right so
just<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.329> as<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.989> said<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.010> lot<00:00:56.280> of

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
just like as I said you have a lot of

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.459 
just like as I said you have a lot of
facts<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.910> theories<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.270> science<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.260> put

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
facts and theories and science you put

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.020 
facts and theories and science you put
them<00:00:58.559> together<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.399> kind<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.640> predict

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
them together and you kind of predict

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.209 
them together and you kind of predict
the<00:01:00.120> future<00:01:00.300> same<00:01:01.260> thing<00:01:01.469> with<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> Bible<00:01:02.070> if

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the future same thing with the Bible if

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.369 
the future same thing with the Bible if
you<00:01:02.399> are<00:01:02.520> wise<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.820> smart<00:01:03.359> enough<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:04.199> can

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
you are wise and smart enough you can

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.410 
you are wise and smart enough you can
read<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.430> figure<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:05.909> what's<00:01:06.299> going

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
read and you can figure out what's going

read and you can figure out what's going
on<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.990> there<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.439> predict<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> future<00:01:08.549> okay

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
on in there and predict the future okay

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.670 
on in there and predict the future okay
that's<00:01:09.720> all<00:01:09.869> I'm<00:01:10.049> saying

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
what you could predict okay example of

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.179 
what you could predict okay example of
what<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.810> might<00:01:18.930> predict<00:01:19.380> if<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.740> understand

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
what you might predict if you understand

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.499 
what you might predict if you understand
Bible<00:01:20.640> what<00:01:20.820> enough<00:01:21.500> that's<00:01:22.500> what<00:01:23.360> what<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.479> a

definition of tradition you are going to

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.630 
definition of tradition you are going to
say<00:01:27.960> thick<00:01:28.259> shades<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.860> are<00:01:28.979> going<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.400> tell

going<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.850> happen<00:01:33.210> you're<00:01:33.990> gonna<00:01:34.110> lay<00:01:34.409> out<00:01:34.590> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
going to happen you're gonna lay out a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.890 
going to happen you're gonna lay out a
time<00:01:34.979> limit<00:01:35.369> for<00:01:35.520> when<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
time limit for when this is going to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.960 
time limit for when this is going to
happen<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:37.950> going<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.280> falsifiable

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
happen and it's going to be falsifiable

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.330 
happen and it's going to be falsifiable
so<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.600> when<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.930> doesn't<00:01:40.290> happen<00:01:40.799> by<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
prediction you know that golf thing a

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.889 
prediction you know that golf thing a
lot<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.110> things<00:01:58.290> gonna<00:01:58.500> start<00:01:58.920> from<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.899> not

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
lot of things gonna start from that not

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.420 
lot of things gonna start from that not
many<00:02:01.049> people<00:02:01.200> will<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.649> able<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.860> stop<00:02:02.130> that

Gulf oil
we<00:02:23.490> gotta<00:02:23.730> have<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.210> use<00:02:24.420> something<00:02:24.690> nuclear

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
we gotta have to use something nuclear

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.870 
we gotta have to use something nuclear
okay<00:02:26.670> but<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.600> will<00:02:28.280> but<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.520> will

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
question and when I ask a question that

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.370 
question and when I ask a question that
is<00:02:47.340> when<00:02:47.670> I'm<00:02:47.820> expecting<00:02:48.360> an<00:02:48.450> answer<00:02:48.600> not

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
is when I'm expecting an answer not

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.610 
is when I'm expecting an answer not
before<00:02:50.090> you<00:02:51.090> entered<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:51.990> call<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.470> the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
before you entered this call and the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.680 
before you entered this call and the
first<00:02:52.890> thing<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.220> said<00:02:53.430> was<00:02:53.730> what<00:02:54.510> do<00:02:54.600> you

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
first thing you said was what do you

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.240 
first thing you said was what do you
think<00:02:54.870> about<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.170> prophecies<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.800> Bible

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
think about the prophecies in the Bible

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.810 
think about the prophecies in the Bible
and<00:02:56.690> Aaron<00:02:57.710> went<00:02:58.710> off<00:02:58.920> on<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.130> tangent<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.700> you

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
and Aaron went off on a tangent that you

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.000 
and Aaron went off on a tangent that you
didn't<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:01.140> next<00:03:01.380> thing<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.770> said

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
didn't like and the next thing you said

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.080 
didn't like and the next thing you said
was<00:03:02.390> 1967<00:03:03.470> 1947<00:03:04.470> do<00:03:04.590> they<00:03:04.710> ring<00:03:04.890> any<00:03:05.070> bells<00:03:05.280> and

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
was 1967 1947 do they ring any bells and

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.030 
was 1967 1947 do they ring any bells and
when<00:03:06.240> you<00:03:06.360> said<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.660> presumably<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.680> the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
when you said that presumably in the

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.340 
when you said that presumably in the
case<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.910> 1947<00:03:09.600> you're<00:03:09.870> talking<00:03:10.110> about<00:03:10.260> the

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
case of 1947 you're talking about the

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.930 
case of 1947 you're talking about the
creation<00:03:10.470> of<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.860> State<00:03:11.070> of<00:03:11.100> Israel<00:03:11.250> which

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
creation of the State of Israel which

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.640 
creation of the State of Israel which
you<00:03:12.150> think<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.570> predicted<00:03:12.990> in<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.110> Bible<00:03:13.170> and

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
you think is predicted in the Bible and

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.820 
you think is predicted in the Bible and
you<00:03:14.220> think<00:03:14.400> it's<00:03:14.520> predicted<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.000> occur<00:03:15.210> in

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
you think it's predicted to occur in

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.490 
you think it's predicted to occur in
1947<00:03:16.830> now<00:03:17.460> you<00:03:18.120> were<00:03:18.210> then<00:03:18.390> asked<00:03:18.960> to<00:03:19.290> provide

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
1947 now you were then asked to provide

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.920 
1947 now you were then asked to provide
an<00:03:20.010> example<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.820> prediction<00:03:21.390> with<00:03:21.900> a

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
an example of a prediction with a

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.840 
an example of a prediction with a
specific<00:03:22.470> date<00:03:22.680> something<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.430> will<00:03:23.550> happen

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
specific date something that will happen

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.210 
specific date something that will happen
in<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.150> future<00:03:24.300> with<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.870> date<00:03:25.140> preferably<00:03:25.980> at

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
in the future with a date preferably at

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.830 
in the future with a date preferably at
least<00:03:26.490> as<00:03:26.670> precise<00:03:27.060> as<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.330> date<00:03:27.600> of<00:03:27.630> the

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
least as precise as the date of the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.080 
least as precise as the date of the
creation<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.320> Israel<00:03:28.440> which<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.310> claim<00:03:29.910> is

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
creation of Israel which you claim is

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.850 
creation of Israel which you claim is
very<00:03:30.300> precise<00:03:30.660> or<00:03:31.080> at<00:03:31.170> least<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.560> year

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
very precise or at least to the year

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.230 
very precise or at least to the year
which<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.430> quite<00:03:32.550> precise<00:03:32.940> when<00:03:33.120> you're

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
which is quite precise when you're

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.280 
which is quite precise when you're
talking<00:03:33.510> about<00:03:33.540> something<00:03:33.840> that<00:03:33.990> happened

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
talking about something that happened

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.160 
talking about something that happened
two<00:03:34.350> millennia<00:03:34.740> after<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.160> was<00:03:35.280> written<00:03:35.430> and

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
two millennia after it was written and

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.960 
two millennia after it was written and
Europe<00:03:37.170> failed<00:03:37.800> to<00:03:38.010> do<00:03:38.130> so<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.580> here's<00:03:38.820> the

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
Europe failed to do so and here's the

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.930 
Europe failed to do so and here's the
thing<00:03:39.180> if<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:40.470> can<00:03:40.680> make<00:03:40.890> valid<00:03:41.490> predictions

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
thing if you can make valid predictions

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.480 
thing if you can make valid predictions
from<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.240> Bible<00:03:42.540> in<00:03:42.690> this<00:03:42.840> method<00:03:43.050> you<00:03:43.490> should

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
from the Bible in this method you should

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.340 
from the Bible in this method you should
be<00:03:44.610> able<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.940> provide<00:03:45.570> us<00:03:45.630> with<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:46.020> large

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
be able to provide us with a large

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.720 
be able to provide us with a large
number<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.770> predictions<00:03:47.130> that<00:03:47.370> have<00:03:47.490> been

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
number of predictions that have been

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.210 
number of predictions that have been
made<00:03:47.970> by<00:03:48.300> scholars<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:49.050> this<00:03:49.320> sort<00:03:49.590> so-called

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
made by scholars of this sort so-called

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.730 
made by scholars of this sort so-called
Bible<00:03:50.580> code<00:03:50.820> numerologists<00:03:51.690> there<00:03:52.440> should<00:03:52.620> be

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
Bible code numerologists there should be

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.530 
Bible code numerologists there should be
a<00:03:52.770> huge<00:03:53.340> list<00:03:53.730> of<00:03:53.880> things<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.330> they<00:03:54.450> are

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
a huge list of things that they are

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.390 
a huge list of things that they are
preparing<00:03:55.080> for<00:03:55.290> that<00:03:55.470> they<00:03:55.560> have<00:03:55.590> calculated

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
preparing for that they have calculated

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.860 
preparing for that they have calculated
in<00:03:56.520> the<00:03:56.640> same<00:03:56.850> method<00:03:57.240> as<00:03:57.330> they<00:03:57.480> used<00:03:57.660> to

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
in the same method as they used to

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.010 
in the same method as they used to
calculate<00:03:58.260> things<00:03:58.740> after<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.970> fact<00:04:00.000> no<00:04:00.870> one

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
calculate things after the fact no one

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.780 
calculate things after the fact no one
calculated<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.800> creation<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.520> State<00:04:02.760> of

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
calculated the creation of the State of

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.510 
calculated the creation of the State of
Israel<00:04:02.970> in<00:04:03.390> 1947<00:04:04.290> but<00:04:04.800> for<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.310> fact

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
Israel in 1947 but for the fact

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.580 
Israel in 1947 but for the fact
everyone's<00:04:06.330> able<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.660> do<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:06.870> after<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.380> fact
