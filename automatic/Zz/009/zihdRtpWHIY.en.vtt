 everything they need to know to form 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.300

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.120

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.400
 nexus 7 to each of my subscribers 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.010

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.200
 impossible so I do not have more than 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.140
