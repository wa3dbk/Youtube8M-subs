00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
cells are fundamentally different than

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.370 
cells are fundamentally different than
conventional<00:02:02.880> cells<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.750> notice<00:02:04.079> all<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
conventional cells you notice all the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.770 
conventional cells you notice all the
metal<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.710> on<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.950> back<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:06.450> allows<00:02:06.750> us

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
metal is on the back and this allows us

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.469 
metal is on the back and this allows us
to<00:02:07.590> use<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.979> metal<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.429> back<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
to use that metal on the back as the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.080 
to use that metal on the back as the
foundational<00:02:10.170> support<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.069> cell

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
foundational support of the cell

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.000 
foundational support of the cell
it<00:02:12.599> means<00:02:12.780> we<00:02:12.930> can<00:02:13.050> also<00:02:13.170> make<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.500> fill<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
it means we can also make the fill the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.339 
it means we can also make the fill the
silicon<00:02:14.430> much<00:02:14.610> thinner<00:02:14.959> meaning<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.200> is

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
silicon much thinner meaning that it is

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.020 
silicon much thinner meaning that it is
actually<00:02:16.739> allowed<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.220> flex<00:02:17.489> a<00:02:17.640> little<00:02:17.760> bit

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
actually allowed to flex a little bit

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.809 
actually allowed to flex a little bit
and<00:02:18.239> as<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.050> can<00:02:19.200> see<00:02:19.280> we've<00:02:20.280> got<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.489> curved

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
and as you can see we've got a curved

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.729 
and as you can see we've got a curved
glass<00:02:21.300> surface<00:02:21.930> we've<00:02:22.110> got<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.379> match<00:02:22.500> up<00:02:22.709> to

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
glass surface we've got to match up to

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.880 
glass surface we've got to match up to
here<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.030> ability<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.540> bend<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.739> very

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
here so the ability to bend is is very

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.390 
here so the ability to bend is is very
good<00:02:27.170> additionally<00:02:28.170> we<00:02:28.830> have<00:02:28.950> much<00:02:29.160> higher

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
good additionally we have much higher

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.630 
good additionally we have much higher
power<00:02:29.730> density<00:02:29.989> than<00:02:30.989> conventional<00:02:31.590> cells<00:02:31.830> so

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
power density than conventional cells so

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.309 
power density than conventional cells so
that<00:02:32.670> means<00:02:32.970> out<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.150> out<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.049> same

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
that means out of out of the same

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.890 
that means out of out of the same
space-constrained<00:02:35.280> area<00:02:35.910> we<00:02:36.569> can<00:02:36.720> actually

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
space-constrained area we can actually

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.930 
space-constrained area we can actually
harvest<00:02:37.470> fifty<00:02:37.890> percent<00:02:38.190> more<00:02:38.400> energy<00:02:38.790> than

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
harvest fifty percent more energy than

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.180 
harvest fifty percent more energy than
conventional<00:02:39.000> cells<00:02:39.780> could<00:02:40.019> I'm<00:02:41.010> actually

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
conventional cells could I'm actually

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.589 
conventional cells could I'm actually
quite<00:02:41.430> excited<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.940> work<00:02:42.060> on<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.239> project

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
quite excited to work on this project

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.350 
quite excited to work on this project
because<00:02:43.319> when<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.620> was<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.860> kid<00:02:43.920> all<00:02:44.430> we<00:02:45.209> would

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
because when I was a kid all we would

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.660 
because when I was a kid all we would
ever<00:02:45.450> see<00:02:45.569> when<00:02:46.349> you<00:02:46.470> mix<00:02:46.620> solar<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.340> cars

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
ever see when you mix solar and cars

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.170 
ever see when you mix solar and cars
with<00:02:48.599> these<00:02:48.720> small<00:02:49.190> very<00:02:50.190> impractical<00:02:50.519> cars

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
with these small very impractical cars

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.020 
with these small very impractical cars
that<00:02:51.660> flew<00:02:51.870> across<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.170> australian<00:02:52.829> desert

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
that flew across the australian desert

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.550 
that flew across the australian desert
this<00:02:54.030> project<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.540> extremely<00:02:55.079> exciting

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
this project is extremely exciting

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.800 
this project is extremely exciting
because<00:02:55.769> here<00:02:56.130> we're<00:02:56.280> actually<00:02:56.489> taking<00:02:56.849> real

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
because here we're actually taking real

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.830 
because here we're actually taking real
solar<00:02:58.079> panels<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:59.180> we're<00:03:00.180> adapting<00:03:00.420> them<00:03:00.810> to

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
solar panels and we're adapting them to

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.830 
solar panels and we're adapting them to
fit<00:03:01.680> on<00:03:01.799> top<00:03:01.829> of<00:03:02.129> a<00:03:02.220> car<00:03:02.459> but<00:03:03.269> it's<00:03:03.420> not<00:03:03.569> a

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
fit on top of a car but it's not a

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.509 
fit on top of a car but it's not a
lightweight<00:03:04.200> car<00:03:05.010> that's<00:03:05.190> going<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.370> fly

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
lightweight car that's going to fly

across<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.879> Australian<00:03:06.450> outback<00:03:06.620> it's<00:03:07.620> an

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
across the Australian outback it's an

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.440 
across the Australian outback it's an
everyday<00:03:08.099> car<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.700> we<00:03:08.790> could<00:03:08.940> expect<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.269> see

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
everyday car that we could expect to see

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.150 
everyday car that we could expect to see
in<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.629> cities<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:09.930> on<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.290> highways<00:03:10.680> this

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
in the cities and on the highways this

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.559 
in the cities and on the highways this
solution<00:03:11.579> where<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.120> couple<00:03:12.450> the

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
solution where you couple the

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.000 
solution where you couple the
infrastructure<00:03:13.049> with<00:03:13.379> the<00:03:13.500> solar<00:03:13.739> on<00:03:13.920> the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
infrastructure with the solar on the

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.030 
infrastructure with the solar on the
vehicle<00:03:14.569> essentially<00:03:15.569> isn't<00:03:16.380> reliant<00:03:16.829> on<00:03:16.980> a

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
vehicle essentially isn't reliant on a

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.000 
vehicle essentially isn't reliant on a
grid<00:03:17.340> anymore<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.540> if<00:03:18.780> you're<00:03:18.989> in<00:03:19.139> an<00:03:19.739> area

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
grid anymore and so if you're in an area

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.000 
grid anymore and so if you're in an area
that<00:03:20.160> doesn't<00:03:20.790> have<00:03:21.049> electricity<00:03:22.049> either

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
electricity this concept will still work

electricity this concept will still work
it's<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.780> free-standing<00:03:28.049> concept<00:03:28.769> at<00:03:28.889> Ford

it's a free-standing concept at Ford
we're<00:03:29.459> really<00:03:29.670> concerned<00:03:29.940> about<00:03:30.389> the
