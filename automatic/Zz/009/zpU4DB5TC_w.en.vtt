00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
making water for a diorama can be very

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.070 
making water for a diorama can be very
very<00:00:05.339> simple<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:05.910> just<00:00:06.480> need<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.720> start<00:00:06.930> out

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
very simple you just need to start out

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.070 
very simple you just need to start out
with<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.290> flat<00:00:07.649> base<00:00:08.300> insert<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.420> mounting<00:00:09.809> peg

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
with a flat base insert a mounting peg

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.470 
with a flat base insert a mounting peg
to<00:00:10.530> hold<00:00:10.740> your<00:00:11.010> creation<00:00:11.700> whatever<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.330> want

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
to hold your creation whatever you want

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.560 
to hold your creation whatever you want
to<00:00:12.570> have<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:13.080> water<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:14.330> carefully<00:00:15.330> think

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
to have on the water and carefully think

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.750 
to have on the water and carefully think
about<00:00:15.690> what<00:00:16.199> kind<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.650> water<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.100> want<00:00:17.310> choppy

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
about what kind of water you want choppy

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.710 
about what kind of water you want choppy
flat<00:00:18.720> muddy<00:00:20.119> anyway<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> started<00:00:21.480> out<00:00:21.630> with

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
flat muddy anyway I started out with

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.660 
flat muddy anyway I started out with
this<00:00:21.900> with<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.140> dark<00:00:22.380> blue<00:00:22.560> base<00:00:22.890> because<00:00:23.640> I

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
this with the dark blue base because I

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.849 
this with the dark blue base because I
want<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.300> kind<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.570> an<00:00:24.689> oceanic<00:00:25.140> thing

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
want this to be kind of an oceanic thing

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.220 
want this to be kind of an oceanic thing
and<00:00:26.160> I'm<00:00:27.150> gonna<00:00:27.269> be<00:00:27.390> using<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.720> very<00:00:27.930> simple

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
and I'm gonna be using a very simple

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.840 
and I'm gonna be using a very simple
process<00:00:29.810> basically<00:00:31.219> drilled<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.369> hole<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
process basically drilled a hole in the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.810 
process basically drilled a hole in the
bottom<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.300> my<00:00:33.510> model<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.399> put<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> mounting

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
bottom of my model and put a mounting

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.299 
bottom of my model and put a mounting
peg<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.239> base<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:37.230> what<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.010> want<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.219> do

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
peg in the base and what you want to do

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.860 
peg in the base and what you want to do
for<00:00:38.579> composition<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.540> want<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.719> make<00:00:39.840> sure

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
for composition is you want to make sure

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.799 
for composition is you want to make sure
that<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.379> don't<00:00:40.620> go<00:00:40.860> exactly<00:00:41.610> from<00:00:42.149> diagonal

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
that you don't go exactly from diagonal

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.920 
that you don't go exactly from diagonal
to<00:00:42.960> diagonal<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:44.460> want<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.700> make<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.360> try

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
to diagonal you want to make you do try

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.170 
to diagonal you want to make you do try
to<00:00:45.960> want<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.770> slightly<00:00:47.160> offset<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.090> it

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
to want to have it slightly offset so it

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.330 
to want to have it slightly offset so it
doesn't<00:00:48.420> look<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:50.180> affected<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> speak

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
doesn't look so it affected so to speak

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.580 
doesn't look so it affected so to speak
so<00:00:53.340> once<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> model<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.809> place<00:00:55.020> and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
so once you have the model in place and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.350 
so once you have the model in place and
you<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.860> kind<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.100> start<00:00:56.340> moving<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.090> around

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
you can kind of start moving it around

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.819 
you can kind of start moving it around
to<00:00:57.629> where<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> position<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.710> you

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
to where you get the position that you

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.860 
to where you get the position that you
really<00:00:59.160> want<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.789> be<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> full

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
really want it to be in for the full

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.799 
really want it to be in for the full
time<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:02.430> course<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> model<00:01:03.000> during<00:01:03.660> this

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
time and of course the model during this

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.060 
time and of course the model during this
all<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.260> drying<00:01:04.500> time<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.860> under

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
all this drying time is under

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.780 
all this drying time is under
construction

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
construction

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.510 
construction
you<00:01:06.330> start<00:01:06.600> by<00:01:06.780> thinking<00:01:07.710> about<00:01:07.799> how<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.220> want

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
you start by thinking about how you want

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.380 
you start by thinking about how you want
to<00:01:08.610> arrange<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.680> compositionally<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
to arrange it compositionally and then I

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.590 
to arrange it compositionally and then I
usually<00:01:13.020> use<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.740> sharpie<00:01:14.430> marker<00:01:14.460> at<00:01:15.090> some

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
usually use a sharpie marker at some

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.020 
usually use a sharpie marker at some
point<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.080> start<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.619> drawing<00:01:16.979> arrows<00:01:17.369> onto

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
point to start just drawing arrows onto

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.730 
point to start just drawing arrows onto
the<00:01:18.119> base<00:01:18.299> showing<00:01:18.930> where<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.140> want<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> wave

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the base showing where I want the wave

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.170 
the base showing where I want the wave
trap<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.280> go<00:01:20.720> from<00:01:21.720> spot<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.049> spot<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:23.180> then

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
trap to go from spot to spot and then

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.960 
trap to go from spot to spot and then
you<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.689> make<00:01:24.840> up<00:01:24.990> your<00:01:25.140> mind<00:01:25.380> as<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.970> just

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
you can make up your mind as to just

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.539 
you can make up your mind as to just
exactly<00:01:27.570> how<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.439> want<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.860> build<00:01:29.070> up<00:01:29.280> your

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
exactly how you want to build up your

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.940 
exactly how you want to build up your
waves<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.150> what<00:01:30.420> medium<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.020> want<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.320> use<00:01:31.500> to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
waves and what medium you want to use to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.510 
waves and what medium you want to use to
build<00:01:31.979> up<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> waves<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:33.380> found<00:01:34.380> one<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.340> is

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
build up the waves I found one that is

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.270 
build up the waves I found one that is
like<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.329> said<00:01:36.450> every<00:01:37.439> house<00:01:37.590> has<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
like I said every house has it and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.940 
like I said every house has it and
that's<00:01:38.880> toilet<00:01:39.299> paper<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.810> use<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> mixture<00:01:40.619> of

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that's toilet paper I use a mixture of

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.800 
that's toilet paper I use a mixture of
thin<00:01:41.850> down<00:01:42.470> blue<00:01:43.470> acrylic<00:01:44.100> plain<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.810> white

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
thin down blue acrylic plain and white

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.920 
thin down blue acrylic plain and white
glue<00:01:46.790> you<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.060> also<00:01:48.240> use<00:01:48.479> future

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
glue you can you also use future

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.590 
glue you can you also use future
although<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.740> don't<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.189> smell

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
although I just don't like the smell

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.420 
although I just don't like the smell
anything<00:01:51.600> too<00:01:51.869> stiff<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.409> paper<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:53.100> you

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
anything too stiff in the paper as you

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.880 
anything too stiff in the paper as you
brush<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:55.079> here<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.590> see<00:01:55.770> I've

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
brush it on so here you can see I've

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.770 
brush it on so here you can see I've
drawn<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> vortices<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:58.610> pill<00:01:59.780> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
drawn in the vortices of the pill the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.889 
drawn in the vortices of the pill the

pillbox fans and that's gonna show me
where<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.140> want<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.439> build<00:02:04.710> up<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.280> waves<00:02:05.549> to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
where I want to build up the waves to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.029 
where I want to build up the waves to
make<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.420> look<00:02:06.659> like<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.409> aircraft<00:02:07.860> is

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
make it look like that the aircraft is

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.100 
make it look like that the aircraft is
actually<00:02:08.160> taking<00:02:08.700> off<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.599> just<00:02:09.750> take<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> piece

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
actually taking off so just take a piece

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.610 
actually taking off so just take a piece
of<00:02:10.140> toilet<00:02:10.379> paper<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:11.720> tear<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.840> off

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
of toilet paper and tear it off

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.740 
of toilet paper and tear it off
and<00:02:14.250> then<00:02:14.930> start<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.080> apply<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:18.330> mixture

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
and then start to apply the the mixture

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.100 
and then start to apply the the mixture
of<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.290> blue<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.220> white<00:02:20.430> glue<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.989> you

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
of the blue and the white glue and you

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.500 
of the blue and the white glue and you
just<00:02:22.260> kind<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.500> blot<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.010> on<00:02:23.129> in<00:02:23.459> some<00:02:24.000> spots<00:02:24.300> to

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
just kind of blot it on in some spots to

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.070 
just kind of blot it on in some spots to
hold<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.870> in<00:02:24.930> place<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.610> then<00:02:26.610> gently<00:02:27.330> because

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
hold it in place and then gently because

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.080 
hold it in place and then gently because
tissue<00:02:28.680> paper<00:02:28.980> does<00:02:29.310> tear<00:02:29.610> unless<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:29.970> buy

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
tissue paper does tear unless you buy

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.380 
tissue paper does tear unless you buy
that<00:02:30.269> really<00:02:30.480> thick<00:02:30.720> stuff<00:02:31.879> slowly<00:02:32.879> work<00:02:33.209> it

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
that really thick stuff slowly work it

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.900 
that really thick stuff slowly work it
around<00:02:34.099> it<00:02:35.099> doesn't<00:02:35.310> really<00:02:35.489> matter<00:02:35.700> what

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
around it doesn't really matter what

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.119 
around it doesn't really matter what
kind<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.239> paper<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.660> use<00:02:36.900> as<00:02:37.530> far<00:02:37.799> as<00:02:37.920> tissue

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
kind of paper you use as far as tissue

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.390 
kind of paper you use as far as tissue
goes<00:02:38.519> I<00:02:38.819> just<00:02:38.970> GP<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:40.049> always<00:02:40.560> around<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.250> it's

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
goes I just GP is always around and it's

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.369 
goes I just GP is always around and it's
relatively<00:02:42.000> inexpensive<00:02:42.150> which<00:02:43.049> is<00:02:43.200> why<00:02:43.319> I

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
relatively inexpensive which is why I

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.289 
relatively inexpensive which is why I
like<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:43.739> because<00:02:44.700> you're<00:02:44.790> gonna<00:02:44.910> be<00:02:45.090> building

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
like it because you're gonna be building

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.289 
like it because you're gonna be building
up<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.660> lot<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.900> layers<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.349> this<00:02:46.680> over<00:02:47.130> time<00:02:47.340> and

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
up a lot of layers of this over time and

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.819 
up a lot of layers of this over time and
that's<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.690> big<00:02:48.840> prop<00:02:49.110> that's<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.530> big<00:02:49.650> thing

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
that's the big prop that's the big thing

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.559 
that's the big prop that's the big thing
with<00:02:49.950> doing<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.400> way<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.819> that<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.269> is

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
with doing it this way is that it is

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.509 
with doing it this way is that it is
time<00:02:51.900> intensive<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.860> have<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.160> build<00:02:53.310> up

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
time intensive you have to build up

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.850 
time intensive you have to build up
layer<00:02:53.790> on<00:02:54.030> layer<00:02:54.079> slowly<00:02:55.079> and<00:02:55.349> let<00:02:55.440> each<00:02:55.650> one

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
layer on layer slowly and let each one

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.410 
layer on layer slowly and let each one
dry<00:02:56.160> in<00:02:56.340> between<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.790> can't<00:02:57.000> do<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.269> whole

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
dry in between you can't do the whole

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.839 
dry in between you can't do the whole
thing<00:02:57.450> all<00:02:57.840> at<00:02:57.989> once<00:02:58.170> or<00:02:59.010> it'll<00:02:59.400> just<00:02:59.430> you'll

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
thing all at once or it'll just you'll

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.030 
thing all at once or it'll just you'll
end<00:02:59.970> up<00:03:00.030> with<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.269> mess

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
end up with a mess

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.350 
end up with a mess
so<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.099> just<00:03:02.280> keep<00:03:02.400> on<00:03:02.549> applying<00:03:02.790> and

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
so you just keep on applying and

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.979 
so you just keep on applying and
applying<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.170> applying<00:03:05.690> batting<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.780> down

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
applying and applying batting it down

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.760 
applying and applying batting it down
you<00:03:07.410> don't<00:03:07.590> really<00:03:07.709> brush<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.250> on<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.670> all
