three and then two to again and then one

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.150 
three and then two to again and then one
and<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.900> will<00:02:55.170> be<00:02:55.350> where<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.650> taught<00:02:55.920> the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
and this will be where I taught the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.980 
and this will be where I taught the
class<00:02:56.459> will<00:02:56.790> be<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:59.540> tool<00:03:00.540> out<00:03:00.750> here<00:03:01.850> to<00:03:02.850> go<00:03:03.030> on

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
class will be and tool out here to go on

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.240 
class will be and tool out here to go on
this<00:03:04.260> side

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.780 

so<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.060> front<00:03:08.330> will<00:03:08.540> be<00:03:08.660> 5<00:03:08.900> why<00:03:09.250> I'm<00:03:10.250> going

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
so the front will be 5 why I'm going

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:21.510 
so the front will be 5 why I'm going
back<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.960> out<00:03:12.110> four<00:03:12.950> times<00:03:16.210> and<00:03:17.210> this<00:03:17.420> on<00:03:17.630> v2

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.580 

all<00:03:22.520> right<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:23.690> then<00:03:23.870> we<00:03:23.990> go<00:03:24.020> to<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.410> nose

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
all right and then we go to the nose

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.100 
all right and then we go to the nose
cone

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.050 

to<00:03:28.110> one<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.850> one

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
to one to one

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.340 
to one to one
so<00:03:30.960> it's<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.410> one<00:03:32.100> pattern<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.000> use<00:03:33.930> this<00:03:34.080> four

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
so it's to one pattern I use this four

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:50.960 
so it's to one pattern I use this four
times<00:03:34.560> going<00:03:34.950> down<00:03:37.370> 1<00:03:44.390> 1<00:03:45.950> s<00:03:46.950> 1<00:03:47.400> 2<00:03:47.730> 3<00:03:48.090> 4<00:03:48.800> so<00:03:49.970> how

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
times going down 1 1 s 1 2 3 4 so how

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.640 
times going down 1 1 s 1 2 3 4 so how
did<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.210> use<00:03:51.390> for<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.780> beginning<00:03:52.230> part<00:03:52.410> of<00:03:52.470> nose

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
did I use for the beginning part of nose

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.770 
did I use for the beginning part of nose
cone<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.190> will<00:03:53.610> from<00:03:53.880> here<00:03:54.090> just<00:03:54.300> one<00:03:54.540> down

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
cone and will from here just one down

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:05.000 
cone and will from here just one down
one<00:03:55.110> out<00:03:55.370> five<00:03:56.370> times<00:04:03.620> right<00:04:04.620> there<00:04:04.830> we<00:04:04.890> go

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
one out five times right there we go

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.470 
one out five times right there we go
four<00:04:05.520> blocks<00:04:05.550> down<00:04:06.030> from<00:04:06.600> here<00:04:07.850> those<00:04:08.850> four

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
four blocks down from here those four

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.890 
four blocks down from here those four
blocks<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.590> then<00:04:10.830> we<00:04:10.950> know<00:04:11.070> darling<00:04:11.340> back

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
blocks and then we know darling back

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:19.820 
blocks and then we know darling back
five<00:04:12.900> times<00:04:13.910> using<00:04:14.910> this<00:04:15.030> is<00:04:15.210> 1<00:04:15.450> so<00:04:15.810> 2<00:04:16.260> 3<00:04:17.510> 4<00:04:18.830> 5

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
five times using this is 1 so 2 3 4 5

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.830 
five times using this is 1 so 2 3 4 5
and<00:04:20.390> I'm<00:04:21.390> giving<00:04:21.750> one<00:04:21.959> block<00:04:22.290> back<00:04:22.650> in<00:04:23.040> this<00:04:23.310> -

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
and I'm giving one block back in this -

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.340 
and I'm giving one block back in this -
to<00:04:24.840> block<00:04:25.140> pattern<00:04:25.770> back<00:04:26.190> four<00:04:26.580> times<00:04:27.920> so<00:04:30.350> two

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
to block pattern back four times so two

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:39.470 
to block pattern back four times so two
and<00:04:33.500> another<00:04:34.500> 2<00:04:34.800> so<00:04:35.250> that's<00:04:35.460> 4<00:04:35.730> times<00:04:36.710> go<00:04:37.710> 3<00:04:38.480> 3

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
and another 2 so that's 4 times go 3 3

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.930 
and another 2 so that's 4 times go 3 3
down<00:04:39.780> I<00:04:40.140> mean<00:04:40.410> one<00:04:40.890> down<00:04:41.100> three<00:04:41.280> back<00:04:41.610> on<00:04:41.640> this

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
down I mean one down three back on this

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.350 
down I mean one down three back on this
one

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
one

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.790 
one
and<00:04:42.810> then<00:04:43.620> some<00:04:44.100> movie<00:04:44.460> 4

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
and then some movie 4

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.910 
and then some movie 4
and<00:04:46.800> then<00:04:47.070> you<00:04:47.220> go<00:04:47.400> 5<00:04:48.270> back<00:04:49.050> on<00:04:49.260> this<00:04:49.440> one<00:04:49.680> and

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
and then you go 5 back on this one and

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.740 
and then you go 5 back on this one and
then<00:04:50.670> another<00:04:50.820> 5

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.150 

five<00:04:55.440> so<00:04:55.800> used<00:04:56.100> to<00:04:56.280> hold<00:04:57.440> so<00:04:58.440> go<00:04:58.650> back<00:04:58.860> up<00:04:59.040> to

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
five so used to hold so go back up to

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.280 
five so used to hold so go back up to
the<00:04:59.280> nose<00:04:59.460> part<00:04:59.820> and<00:05:00.240> we'll<00:05:00.510> do<00:05:00.630> a<00:05:00.660> sidebar

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
the nose part and we'll do a sidebar

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.010 
the nose part and we'll do a sidebar
here<00:05:01.700> so<00:05:02.700> this<00:05:02.850> comes<00:05:03.120> out<00:05:03.270> one<00:05:03.510> one<00:05:04.440> were<00:05:04.650> out

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
here so this comes out one one were out

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.230 
here so this comes out one one were out
this<00:05:07.020> one's<00:05:07.260> one<00:05:07.470> one<00:05:08.400> out<00:05:08.900> to<00:05:09.900> back<00:05:10.610> on<00:05:11.610> up<00:05:11.850> to

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
this one's one one out to back on up to

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:20.120 
this one's one one out to back on up to
that<00:05:14.270> three<00:05:15.270> distinct<00:05:15.840> size<00:05:16.970> 1<00:05:17.970> 2<00:05:18.510> 2<00:05:18.990> &amp;<00:05:19.230> 3<00:05:19.350> will

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
that three distinct size 1 2 2 &amp; 3 will

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:29.060 
that three distinct size 1 2 2 &amp; 3 will
be<00:05:20.280> three<00:05:20.670> wide<00:05:21.090> three<00:05:21.720> times<00:05:22.020> so<00:05:22.620> 3<00:05:25.940> 3<00:05:27.620> 3<00:05:28.620> this

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
be three wide three times so 3 3 3 this

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:35.770 
be three wide three times so 3 3 3 this
one<00:05:29.280> will<00:05:29.460> be<00:05:30.560> for<00:05:32.660> this<00:05:33.660> one<00:05:34.050> come<00:05:34.260> up<00:05:34.290> and<00:05:34.620> b25

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
one will be for this one come up and b25

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.810 
one will be for this one come up and b25
and<00:05:36.780> this<00:05:37.169> will<00:05:37.350> come<00:05:37.650> up<00:05:37.770> and<00:05:38.040> this<00:05:38.400> will<00:05:38.640> be

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
and this will come up and this will be

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.290 
and this will come up and this will be
another<00:05:39.120> five<00:05:42.200> then<00:05:43.200> that<00:05:43.380> connects<00:05:43.680> to<00:05:43.860> the

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
another five then that connects to the

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:50.000 
another five then that connects to the
hall<00:05:45.950> as<00:05:46.950> they<00:05:47.490> go<00:05:47.700> back<00:05:47.910> out<00:05:48.680> so<00:05:49.680> this<00:05:49.890> is<00:05:49.980> a

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
hall as they go back out so this is a

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.880 
hall as they go back out so this is a
basic<00:05:50.370> outline<00:05:50.610> for<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.350> lowest<00:05:52.350> portion<00:05:52.620> of

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
basic outline for the lowest portion of

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.909 
basic outline for the lowest portion of
the<00:05:53.040> 7<00:05:53.310> 4<00:05:53.490> 7<00:05:53.700> no<00:05:54.660> you<00:05:55.020> see<00:05:55.200> it<00:05:55.320> better<00:05:55.500> was<00:05:55.740> this

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
the 7 4 7 no you see it better was this

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.370 
the 7 4 7 no you see it better was this
code<00:05:56.160> in<00:05:56.400> and<00:05:57.210> I'll<00:05:57.330> start<00:05:57.720> doing<00:05:57.990> that<00:05:58.110> in<00:05:58.169> the

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
code in and I'll start doing that in the

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.200 
code in and I'll start doing that in the
next<00:05:58.590> video<00:05:58.860> and<00:05:59.250> I'll<00:05:59.520> try<00:05:59.700> explain<00:06:00.090> the

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
next video and I'll try explain the

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.800 
next video and I'll try explain the
pattern<00:06:00.540> that<00:06:00.810> is<00:06:01.560> used<00:06:01.740> in<00:06:01.919> drilling<00:06:02.130> and

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
pattern that is used in drilling and

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.409 
pattern that is used in drilling and
filling<00:06:03.810> in<00:06:04.110> the<00:06:04.140> walls<00:06:04.470> area<00:06:05.120> so<00:06:06.120> I<00:06:06.150> guess

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
filling in the walls area so I guess

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.410 
filling in the walls area so I guess
I'll<00:06:06.570> see<00:06:06.690> you<00:06:06.720> in<00:06:06.840> the<00:06:06.900> next<00:06:07.140> video
