00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.820
 hello everyone I hope you go 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.680
 link so today I'm going to you 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.109
 show how I'm doing my oil bath 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.930
 for the hair I use several 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.590
 different cities that I appreciate for 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.090
 their moisturizing properties to I like 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.670
 do my oil bath 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.289
 once a month for when I feel that 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.890
 my hair is a little dull and a little 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.410
 dry 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.399
 I also like this bath 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.800
 oil all night 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.390
 I find that the result is a lot 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.910
 better when you leave it much longer 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.460
 long what is normal and it leaves 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.190
 my super soft super soft hair 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.230
 brilliant do not hesitate to try to 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.719
 your side tell me what you 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.180
 think about next week 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.579
 I prefer to heat my oils 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.260
 bain-marie rather comic round because 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:04.170
 that it will allow me to keep all 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:07.110
 the properties to oils I'm going so 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.090
 start by adding a spoonful to 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.830
 shea butter soup that goes 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.810
 restore shine to my hair 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.890
 but who will also feed them 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.780
 deeply i will then add a 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.420
 tablespoon of walnut oil 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.580
 coconut that will not only feed and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:29.820
 high school my hair but also make them 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.560
 brilliant I will then added two 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.659
 tablespoons of pomace oil 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.479
 grape that this oil has properties 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.200
 repairers on damaged hair and 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.200
 brittle 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.530
 I will also add oil from 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.470
 macadamia which this oil to the rich 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.340
 in omega 9 and what will allow to 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.790
 to limit the aggressions of the hair and 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.130
 finally i will add 5 drops 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.140
 of sage essential oil that is 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.890
 very good for promoting the growth of 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.170
 hair 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.390
 I'm going to mix all that and I'm going 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.360
 leave to the mixture in a bain-marie 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.890
 to warm my oils and 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.080
 in the meantime I will prepare my 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.220
 hair so I separated my hair into 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.220
 four and i'll start with wet 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.020
 slightly my hair 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.890
 so when I'm going to apply my 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.050
 oils on my wet hair oil 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:33.200
 will help trap the hydration 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:35.630
 in my hair so section by 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.310
 section I will start by applying 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.310
 the oil on my long hours 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.390
 and I'll split into two smaller ones 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.180
 sections to be able to apply 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:59.340
 correctly on the entire hair 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.340
 I can also begin to unravel 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.660
 and so I read well with my hands to 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:10.900
 to be able to penetrate not only 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:13.030
 water but also the eight the assets and 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:19.690
 so I keep working on my 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:21.430
 section now that I applied the 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.790
 oils on malonga 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.370
 I will now apply the mixture 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.900
 Oil at my root and therefore 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.920
 as I put in some essential oil 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.230
 of sage and sage to lets 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.540
 promote the growth of hair that I 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.550
 prefers to apply that too to 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.040
 root level and I'm going 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.750
 finally massaged my scalp co 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.690
 to promote traffic 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.640
 blood but also to penetrate 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.640
 the assets in my scalp 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.050
 now that I applied my mix 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.680
 oil on all of my hair 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.700
 I just bring back but a little bun 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.590
 in height 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.900
 it will be more comfortable to be able to 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.580
 sleep at night so to be able to 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.040
 promote the absorption of all its 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.489
 active in the oils in my hair 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.410
 pretty much that there is an atmosphere 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.180
 hot enough so what am I going to do 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.330
 I'm going to add a towel 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.070
 hot on my hair 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.260
 so I just use a little 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.310
 towel that I wet and that I 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.410
 heated in the microwave and so 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.900
 this attention is not necessary either 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.820
 the towel is super hot not 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.820
 more but just hot 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.240
 and I'm applying it after 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.770
 applied my oils to my hair and 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.770
 I'm doing it right in front of 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:05:00.750
 I use my elastic to be sure 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:04.440
 that it's going to stay all night and so 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:07.020
 on top I will add to my hat 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.660
 from where I finally bought a hat 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.850
 because the plastic bags at the 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.490
 stop a moment and so to avoid 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.570
 that to him he finds himself on my 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.090
 pillow 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.720
 I'm just going to actually tie the front 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.550
 of my head 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:28.190
 so if the oil is cool scarf is going 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.190
 recover all oils what 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.890
 so here we are going to let the whole 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.810
 night and so the next morning under the 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.810
 shower i'm going to take off my mob 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.660
 removed my super hat with 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.040
 cupcakes and my towel finally is 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.230
 besides, my towel was always 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.210
 a little bit hot so must say that 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.580
 it worked well 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.410
 so my hair is super soft and that 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.640
 it's super good too thanks to the oil 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:09.940
 essential sage and so after that I 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.190
 am going to do a light shampoo for me 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.020
 get rid of the excess oil have 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.810
 everything that was not captured in the 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.030
 hair to instead of leaving it on top 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.370
 and that it makes indeed a super fat 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.710
 a little disgusting so I'll remove everything 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:28.000
 that's what the hair needs 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:30.730
 the hair will keep it and so here is the 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.050
 result after finishing my watch and 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:38.260
 go so my hair is super bright 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:40.120
 super soft and soft I find that the 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.080
 oil bath is a must for my 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.990
 kinky hair 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.820
 the result is always great and 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.160
 from time to time I like to change the 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.160
 oils according to the need of my hair 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.100
 thank you for watching my video and I 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.100
 find you soon lease 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.690
 OK what
