00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.220
 the television rather you are delicious 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.799
 potatoes and the truth the only thing they have 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.050
 what to do is cut it in is called the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.080
 Dad cut French as is here 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.570
 we have and the joke is to wash them 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.830
 perfectly rinse every 30 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.449
 minutes until the water is 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.250
 perfectly transparent as we have 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.350
 here we can make a close out there 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.390
 there comes prevents it is completely 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.550
 transparent water and it's time to 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.130
 Take them out and put them in some towels 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.349
 absorbent paper as there as there and 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.469
 then he believes the 26 I will not put them 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.170
 the one that just decided in life that 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.960
 I will try to cook the least without salt 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.059
 Yesterday I read a story about 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.829
 of sodium and I think it's one of the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.960
 white powders that harm us the most 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.670
 then from now on we are going to 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.559
 try to substitute a lot of salt for 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.660
 some other ingredient for spices or 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.340
 for something that gives us better 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.780
 flavor although we will not discard it 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.789
 in case you but always like the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.829
 smaller amount and we're going to go back to 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.629
 teach our people to the family 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.920
 so as not to consume it for the time being 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.920
 remove the salt shakers from the table 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.670
 that is until before lunch and at the destination 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.320
 that is the worst of the pilots is now 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.450
 here we have to put salt I'm not going to 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.430
 put salt more than when they leave man and 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.340
 well let's start by putting them to 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.470
 fry in very hot oil there I will have 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.540

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.630
 about 3 to 4 minutes while we are going to give 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.259
 a secret tip of how to keep 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.909
 fresh potatoes once split like this 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.229
 we are openings we return to do 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.890
 the sauces with which to accompany these 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.890
 delicious potatoes 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.119
 when you have spare potatoes and are 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.799
 peeled put in the refrigerator the only thing 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.070
 what will happen is that they spoil to the day 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.500
 next the best thing is cold water get in 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.320
 her the potatoes and keep them that way but 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.930
 to have more security add a little 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.550
 of lemon juice and they will be preserved 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.100
 best 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.900
 we're back and well I'll start 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.460

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.740
 message for these three delicious 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.480
 sauces to not always use the capture 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.950
 we look at cups with these caps while 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.119
 let's give a variation to our 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.600

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.830
 in house greater mayonnaise with a miserable 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.420

 saffron from the salt I brought the saffron 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.800
 there are many this I do not know if it is the 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.210
 original saffron or not the thing is that the 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.750
 that they sell in the super is the one that 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.100
 brothers works I did not buy it for this one 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.480

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.130
 that is not state is already talking is 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.900
 much more expensive than gold for example in 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.090
 kilos is much more case remember that 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.790

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.670
 pistils just imagine how many 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.230

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.270
 up fragments of iodine suddenly as 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.910
