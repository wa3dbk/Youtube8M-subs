 Using God to stick with Ikima is doing with the Hey paper napkin in a large number in his house 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:57.350

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:04.250
 Ney this because I'm using the handle bread without gold this is overlap two sheets 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:08.840
 Open doing Bae loan travel was written I use only those who have this pattern 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.880
 Yes I was able to divide it all into one with such feeling 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:18.329
 But only it was peeled off this it all the time being public 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:20.490
 This'll put things is pretty tiny and fine things so that you fit more of such fine pattern 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:24.090

 Yes, the floor of the temporary wood is now complete 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.320

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.380
 For the first time 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:57.009

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.730
 It will stick 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:56.410
 I thought it was a small amount because of debt , but it seems like it's getting wet a lot . 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:02.230

 Ma 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:12.140
 earth 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:14.270

 Kana ahead of, or rather use what God 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:51.430

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:56.700
 We finally squeezed down to three types to make it a green system 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:05:02.460
