 later from 11 am to well hours 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.940
 19 we immediately start talking immediately 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.730
 more or less questions you have 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.440
 place then how do you conquer 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.640
 a town then to conquer a town 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.650
 or a nation 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.180
 must first declare 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.250
 declare enemies 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.480
 your own country with that town slash 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.190
 nation and then go to their chang e 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.320
 place a science and a torch on it 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.340
 so we will give the start we say to the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.440
 conquest of the clapperboard 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.440
 many of you ask us but it is possible 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.450
 cremate an out post near the city 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.910
 since they have walls then no 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.250
 attached to the city to the walls can not 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.200
 to be cremated to be cremated there is the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.090
 classic rule of thirteen junk ie 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.950
 you have to be away in 13 there is also 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.810
 from last to last plot climate 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.549
 of the city to be able to call a post office 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.040
 and then claim harvey but Roman up to 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.470
 arrive at the walls the lots signed 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.510
 will be back to normal after the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.119
 war then the designer lots do not 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.700
 will return to normal after the war because 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.229
 precisely if a lot is won 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.320
 can be changed as if it were 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.119
 just the pvp will be everywhere and more dp yes 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.799
 will be activated everywhere indeed for you 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.100
 defend your plots you will have to 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.780
 kill enemy people as much as we do 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.090
 he wants to win a lot then 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.030
 first lot with 60 life points 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.000
 while the om bloc or your tease 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.729
 pound will have 120 these lots lose 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.530
 one life point every 5 seconds for each 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.600
 number of people up to a maximum of 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.549
 five then the maximum you can do 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.170
 lose every five seconds and 5 of life 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.869
