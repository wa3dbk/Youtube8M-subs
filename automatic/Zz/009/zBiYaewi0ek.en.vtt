ebrill we have a subclavian axillary

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.980 
ebrill we have a subclavian axillary
brachial<00:00:06.420> arteries<00:00:07.170> for<00:00:07.290> your<00:00:07.440> arteries<00:00:08.990> I'm

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
brachial arteries for your arteries I'm

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.499 
brachial arteries for your arteries I'm
kind<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.440> showing<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.219> poverty<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:12.000> story

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
kind of showing you the poverty of story

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.870 
kind of showing you the poverty of story
this<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.809> Radio<00:00:13.610> Farda

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
this is Radio Farda

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.790 
this is Radio Farda
ulnar<00:00:15.120> artery<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.929> an<00:00:16.020> interosseous<00:00:16.350> we

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
ulnar artery this is an interosseous we

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.040 
ulnar artery this is an interosseous we
really<00:00:17.760> have<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.000> worry<00:00:18.119> about<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.990> is

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
really have to worry about that this is

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.300 
really have to worry about that this is
the<00:00:19.199> palmar<00:00:19.650> arch<00:00:22.039> superficial<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.189> is

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the palmar arch superficial this is

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.210 
the palmar arch superficial this is
dorsal<00:00:23.760> column<00:00:24.000> arch<00:00:24.650> so<00:00:25.650> here<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.010> easy

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
dorsal column arch so here it's easy

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.830 
dorsal column arch so here it's easy
when<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.240> your<00:00:27.480> bones<00:00:27.630> go

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
when it's like this your bones go

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.470 
when it's like this your bones go
straight<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.890> radius<00:00:29.340> radial<00:00:30.090> artery

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
straight so this is radius radial artery

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.179 
straight so this is radius radial artery
ulnar<00:00:30.900> artery<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.949> gets<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.130> little

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
ulnar artery here it gets a little

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:47.510 
ulnar artery here it gets a little

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
tricky subclavian axillary brachial

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.150 
tricky subclavian axillary brachial
right<00:00:47.670> here<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.149> one's<00:00:48.360> deep<00:00:48.660> fry<00:00:48.930> Q<00:00:49.160> deep

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
right here this one's deep fry Q deep

arterial I did

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.930 
arterial I did
this<00:01:12.490> is<00:01:12.670> external<00:01:13.570> carotid<00:01:13.990> reading<00:01:14.940> coming

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
this is external carotid reading coming

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.420 
this is external carotid reading coming
crowded<00:01:16.360> external<00:01:16.840> carotid<00:01:16.990> artery

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430

artery

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.900 

you<00:01:26.440> have<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.590> super<00:01:26.890> scapular<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.670> throw<00:01:27.850> a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
you have a super scapular and throw a

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.080 
you have a super scapular and throw a
code<00:01:28.150> or<00:01:28.330> so<00:01:28.660> I<00:01:29.640> think<00:01:30.640> this<00:01:30.820> is<00:01:30.970> super

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
code or so I think this is super

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.820 
code or so I think this is super
scapular<00:01:31.660> and<00:01:31.690> throughout<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.200> dorsal<00:01:32.590> I'll

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
scapular and throughout the dorsal I'll

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.750 
scapular and throughout the dorsal I'll
look<00:01:33.220> it<00:01:33.370> up<00:01:33.400> to<00:01:33.670> make<00:01:33.820> sure<00:01:33.850> which<00:01:34.240> ones<00:01:34.450> which

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.470 

so<00:01:37.720> you<00:01:37.810> have<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.080> know<00:01:38.200> super<00:01:38.530> scapular<00:01:39.480> are

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
so you have to know super scapular are

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.600 
so you have to know super scapular are
the<00:01:40.570> veins<00:01:40.810> you<00:01:40.990> have<00:01:41.080> subclavian<00:01:41.710> cephalic

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
the veins you have subclavian cephalic

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:57.420 
the veins you have subclavian cephalic
and<00:01:45.570> that's<00:01:46.570> one<00:01:46.780> from<00:01:49.260> goes<00:01:50.260> just<00:01:50.619> Alec<00:01:56.430> Alec

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
and that's one from goes just Alec Alec

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.200 
and that's one from goes just Alec Alec
is<00:01:58.020> right<00:01:59.020> right<00:01:59.530> okay<00:01:59.979> let<00:02:00.640> me<00:02:00.700> go<00:02:00.880> check<00:02:01.060> on

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
is right right okay let me go check on

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.369 
is right right okay let me go check on
this<00:02:01.390> so<00:02:01.869> 25<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.590> 15<00:02:02.950> a<00:02:02.979> little
