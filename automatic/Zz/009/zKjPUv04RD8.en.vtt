00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
as you can see I've kind of made my

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.800 
as you can see I've kind of made my
foundation<00:02:29.430> for<00:02:29.700> my<00:02:29.849> crappy<00:02:30.690> little

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
foundation for my crappy little

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.500 
foundation for my crappy little
structure<00:02:31.590> here<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.670> don't<00:02:32.970> know<00:02:33.030> why<00:02:33.209> did

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
structure here and I don't know why did

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.750 
structure here and I don't know why did
this<00:02:33.690> with<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.049> wood<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:35.190> makes<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
this with the wood just makes the

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.490 
this with the wood just makes the
basement<00:02:36.239> seem<00:02:36.480> even<00:02:36.720> more<00:02:36.750> elegant<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.319> guess

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
basement seem even more elegant I guess

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.140 
basement seem even more elegant I guess
so<00:02:37.980> yeah<00:02:38.099> that's<00:02:38.250> what's<00:02:38.459> going<00:02:38.610> on<00:02:38.790> with<00:02:39.000> me

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
so yeah that's what's going on with me

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.490
