00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
my opinion now I'll go over all the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.929 
my opinion now I'll go over all the
reasons<00:00:28.650> why<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.830> think<00:00:28.920> he's<00:00:29.250> terrible<00:00:29.640> as<00:00:29.820> I

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
reasons why I think he's terrible as I

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.720 
reasons why I think he's terrible as I
try<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.210> take<00:00:30.630> him<00:00:30.779> out<00:00:30.869> here<00:00:31.199> first<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.160> all<00:00:32.309> he

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
try to take him out here first of all he

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.200 
try to take him out here first of all he
just<00:00:33.000> flies<00:00:33.270> around<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.680> very<00:00:34.980> hard<00:00:35.399> to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
just flies around and is very hard to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.170 
just flies around and is very hard to
actually<00:00:36.450> locate<00:00:36.960> um<00:00:37.440> because<00:00:38.370> he'll<00:00:38.670> fly<00:00:38.910> in

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180

patterns that aren't really in my mind
very<00:00:41.750> acceptable<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> boss<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.410> fly<00:00:43.620> in

obviously<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.479> over<00:01:45.840> power<00:01:45.990> level<00:01:46.350> eight

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
obviously if over power level eight

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.920 
obviously if over power level eight
would<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:46.799> been<00:01:46.920> available<00:01:47.659> by<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.720> time

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
would have been available by the time

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.280 
would have been available by the time
this<00:01:49.409> boss<00:01:49.619> was<00:01:49.890> actually<00:01:50.340> released<00:01:50.759> um<00:01:51.290> it

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
this boss was actually released um it

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.139 
this boss was actually released um it
would<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.619> been<00:01:52.740> even<00:01:52.950> harder<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.399> kill<00:01:53.610> now

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
would have been even harder to kill now

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.580 
would have been even harder to kill now
he<00:01:54.210> didn't<00:01:54.570> end<00:01:54.689> up<00:01:54.810> dropping<00:01:54.990> any<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.500> his

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
he didn't end up dropping any of his

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.260 
he didn't end up dropping any of his
baby<00:01:55.799> dragons<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.369> stage<00:01:56.640> because<00:01:56.880> his<00:01:57.090> AI

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
baby dragons on the stage because his AI

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.700 
baby dragons on the stage because his AI
kind<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.750> glitched<00:01:57.930> out<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.259> he<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.469> flew

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
kind of glitched out and he just flew

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.859 
kind of glitched out and he just flew
around<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.250> stuff<00:01:59.549> but<00:02:00.180> basically<00:02:00.570> there

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
around and stuff but basically there

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.560 
around and stuff but basically there
he'll<00:02:01.500> drop<00:02:01.759> three<00:02:02.759> little<00:02:02.969> dragons<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
he'll drop three little dragons on the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.660 
he'll drop three little dragons on the
stage<00:02:03.780> which<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.110> jump<00:02:04.590> basically<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
stage which can jump basically all the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.760 
stage which can jump basically all the
way<00:02:05.759> across<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.420> stage<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.020> that's<00:02:07.469> pretty

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
way across the stage and that's pretty

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.559 
way across the stage and that's pretty
irritating<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.489> my<00:02:08.640> opinion<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.300> they'll

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
irritating in my opinion and they'll

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.140 
irritating in my opinion and they'll
just<00:02:09.750> apply<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.800> fire<00:02:11.190> damage<00:02:11.550> over<00:02:11.760> time<00:02:11.970> to

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
just apply a fire damage over time to

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.110 
just apply a fire damage over time to
you<00:02:12.239> over<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:12.750> over

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
you over and over

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.420 
you over and over
over<00:02:13.360> again<00:02:13.709> we'll<00:02:14.709> see<00:02:14.890> what<00:02:15.010> kind<00:02:15.099> of<00:02:15.250> loot

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
over again we'll see what kind of loot

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.920 
over again we'll see what kind of loot
he<00:02:15.640> dropped<00:02:15.909> here<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.299> looks<00:02:16.480> like<00:02:16.540> it's

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
he dropped here it looks like it's

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.020 
he dropped here it looks like it's
primarily<00:02:17.470> money<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:18.159> couple<00:02:18.400> health<00:02:18.730> files

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
primarily money a couple health files

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.809 
primarily money a couple health files
some<00:02:19.450> iridium<00:02:20.129> um<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.909> that<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.120> blue<00:02:22.330> shield<00:02:22.900> I

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
some iridium um is that a blue shield I

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.070 
some iridium um is that a blue shield I
don't<00:02:24.819> know<00:02:24.970> if<00:02:25.090> he<00:02:25.209> actually<00:02:25.569> has<00:02:25.780> any

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
don't know if he actually has any

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.229 
don't know if he actually has any
legendary<00:02:26.530> drops<00:02:26.890> assigned<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.549> him<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.849> assume

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
legendary drops assigned to him I assume

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.420 
legendary drops assigned to him I assume
he<00:02:28.390> does<00:02:28.629> he<00:02:28.930> also<00:02:29.110> dropped<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.620> purple<00:02:29.950> pistol

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
he does he also dropped a purple pistol

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.000 
he does he also dropped a purple pistol
a<00:02:30.640> green<00:02:31.269> sniper<00:02:31.569> there<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.890> know

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
a green sniper there and you know

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.339 
a green sniper there and you know
basically<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.879> just<00:02:34.360> don't<00:02:34.569> like<00:02:34.750> this<00:02:34.930> boss<00:02:35.170> at

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
basically I just don't like this boss at

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.110 
basically I just don't like this boss at
all<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.680> think<00:02:36.129> it's<00:02:36.250> kind<00:02:36.459> of<00:02:36.519> silly<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:37.090> you

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
all I think it's kind of silly that you

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.630 
all I think it's kind of silly that you
can<00:02:37.329> have<00:02:37.510> characters<00:02:38.110> who<00:02:38.379> are<00:02:38.640> designed

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
can have characters who are designed

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.699 
can have characters who are designed
specifically<00:02:40.209> with<00:02:40.480> melee<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.079> mind<00:02:41.379> like

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
specifically with melee in mind like

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.520 
specifically with melee in mind like
Krieg<00:02:42.129> and<00:02:42.519> zero<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.299> they<00:02:43.810> can<00:02:43.959> have<00:02:44.110> builds

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
Krieg and zero and they can have builds

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.369 
Krieg and zero and they can have builds
that<00:02:44.680> exist<00:02:45.069> solely<00:02:45.310> for<00:02:45.730> melee<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.420> then<00:02:47.200> you

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
that exist solely for melee and then you

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.720 
that exist solely for melee and then you
can<00:02:47.500> have<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.680> boss<00:02:47.920> like<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:48.459> which<00:02:48.700> is

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
can have a boss like this which is

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.380 
can have a boss like this which is
nearly<00:02:49.120> impossible<00:02:49.359> to<00:02:49.959> melee<00:02:50.319> and<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:52.269> know

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
nearly impossible to melee and you know

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.630 
nearly impossible to melee and you know
it's<00:02:52.690> very<00:02:52.870> easy<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.470> execute<00:02:53.769> off<00:02:54.099> of<00:02:54.400> this

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
it's very easy to execute off of this

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.099 
it's very easy to execute off of this
it's<00:02:54.879> very<00:02:55.060> easy<00:02:55.239> to<00:02:55.390> get<00:02:55.480> knocked<00:02:55.780> off<00:02:56.049> of

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
it's very easy to get knocked off of

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.050 
it's very easy to get knocked off of
this<00:02:56.319> by<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.650> little<00:02:57.010> dragons<00:02:57.400> in<00:02:57.549> fact<00:02:57.819> and

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
this by the little dragons in fact and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.170 
this by the little dragons in fact and
it's<00:02:58.900> just<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.349> really<00:02:59.769> really<00:03:00.040> bad<00:03:00.370> boss<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:01.060> my

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
it's just a really really bad boss in my

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.050 
it's just a really really bad boss in my
opinion<00:03:01.799> one<00:03:02.799> saving<00:03:03.159> grace<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.670> fight<00:03:03.849> is

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
opinion one saving grace of the fight is

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.940 
opinion one saving grace of the fight is
that<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:04.329> can<00:03:04.569> hide<00:03:04.870> over<00:03:05.170> there<00:03:05.409> and<00:03:05.680> kill

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
that you can hide over there and kill

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.830 
that you can hide over there and kill
him<00:03:05.980> through<00:03:06.430> this<00:03:06.579> gate<00:03:06.879> kind<00:03:07.480> of<00:03:07.569> like<00:03:07.690> you

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
him through this gate kind of like you

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.020 
him through this gate kind of like you
can<00:03:07.870> kill<00:03:08.170> badass<00:03:08.590> asaurus<00:03:09.010> rex<00:03:09.069> by<00:03:09.700> hiding

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
can kill badass asaurus rex by hiding

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.180 
can kill badass asaurus rex by hiding
behind<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.359> little<00:03:10.480> barrier<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.170> stuff

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
behind the little barrier and stuff

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.369 
behind the little barrier and stuff
other<00:03:12.549> than<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:12.819> though<00:03:13.329> this<00:03:13.629> boss<00:03:13.840> really

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
other than that though this boss really

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.470 
other than that though this boss really
has<00:03:14.590> no<00:03:14.890> redeeming<00:03:15.069> qualities<00:03:15.370> it's<00:03:16.120> very

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
has no redeeming qualities it's very

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.900 
has no redeeming qualities it's very
very<00:03:16.750> very<00:03:17.049> very<00:03:17.470> poor<00:03:17.859> in<00:03:18.099> my<00:03:18.280> opinion<00:03:18.730> I

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
very very very poor in my opinion I

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.000 
very very very poor in my opinion I
guess<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:19.569> did<00:03:19.720> drop<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:20.109> fair<00:03:20.380> amount<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.739> gear

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
guess it did drop a fair amount of gear

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
guess it did drop a fair amount of gear
and<00:03:21.190> stuff<00:03:21.400> like<00:03:21.549> that

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
and stuff like that

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.180 
and stuff like that
and<00:03:22.120> maybe<00:03:22.750> at<00:03:22.930> lower<00:03:23.109> difficulties<00:03:23.799> it's<00:03:23.980> not

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
and maybe at lower difficulties it's not

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.830 
and maybe at lower difficulties it's not
quite<00:03:24.430> as<00:03:24.579> annoying<00:03:24.880> where<00:03:25.239> damage<00:03:25.480> over<00:03:25.810> time
