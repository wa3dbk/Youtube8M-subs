00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
this will kind of be slow I just got it

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.359 
this will kind of be slow I just got it
today<00:00:30.590> but<00:00:31.590> pretty<00:00:31.890> much<00:00:32.040> you're<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
today but pretty much you're going to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.290 
today but pretty much you're going to
get<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> chrome<00:00:33.000> install<00:00:33.420> dmg<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:35.059> it's<00:00:36.059> pretty

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
get a chrome install dmg and it's pretty

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.549 
get a chrome install dmg and it's pretty
much<00:00:36.450> just<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> open<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.290> I'm<00:00:37.380> going

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
much just going to open it so I'm going

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.990 
much just going to open it so I'm going
to<00:00:37.620> actually<00:00:37.770> fast-forward<00:00:38.730> through<00:00:38.879> this

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
to actually fast-forward through this

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.240 
to actually fast-forward through this
part<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.050> don't<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.440> watch<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.890> but

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
part so you don't have to watch this but

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.650 
part so you don't have to watch this but
that's<00:00:41.520> pretty<00:00:41.940> much<00:00:42.180> what's<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.600> to

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
that's pretty much what's going to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.610 
that's pretty much what's going to
happen

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.830 

okay<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:49.580> it's<00:00:49.850> towards<00:00:50.330> the<00:00:50.450> end<00:00:50.540> of

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
okay so it's towards the end of

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.260 
okay so it's towards the end of
verifying<00:00:51.410> it<00:00:51.650> and<00:00:52.550> it's<00:00:52.700> just<00:00:52.850> checking<00:00:53.090> the

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
verifying it and it's just checking the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.970 
verifying it and it's just checking the
volumes<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:53.840> mounting<00:00:54.350> and<00:00:54.500> finishing<00:00:54.860> and

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
volumes and mounting and finishing and

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.890 
volumes and mounting and finishing and
all<00:00:55.040> that<00:00:55.190> stuff<00:00:55.400> so<00:00:55.640> what<00:00:56.300> you<00:00:56.420> want<00:00:56.660> to<00:00:56.720> do<00:00:56.810> is

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
all that stuff so what you want to do is

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.049 
all that stuff so what you want to do is
you<00:00:57.020> just<00:00:57.050> drag<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.620> google<00:00:58.100> chrome<00:00:58.280> into<00:00:58.850> the

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
you just drag the google chrome into the

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.729 
you just drag the google chrome into the
blue<00:00:59.270> folder<00:00:59.690> which<00:00:59.840> is<00:00:59.989> your<00:01:00.110> Applications

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
blue folder which is your Applications

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.780 
blue folder which is your Applications
folder<00:01:01.420> now<00:01:03.040> as<00:01:04.040> you<00:01:04.339> can<00:01:04.400> see<00:01:04.460> in<00:01:04.699> the

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
folder now as you can see in the

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.060 
folder now as you can see in the
Launchpad<00:01:05.270> area<00:01:05.300> I<00:01:05.810> actually<00:01:06.200> it<00:01:06.410> shows<00:01:06.890> like

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
Launchpad area I actually it shows like

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.380 
Launchpad area I actually it shows like
downloading<00:01:07.580> stuff<00:01:07.700> that's<00:01:07.940> not<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.119> Google

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
downloading stuff that's not a Google

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.150 
downloading stuff that's not a Google
Chrome<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:08.900> stuff<00:01:09.080> like<00:01:09.200> Xcode<00:01:09.710> and<00:01:09.740> stuff

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
Chrome and stuff like Xcode and stuff

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.430 
Chrome and stuff like Xcode and stuff
but<00:01:11.090> pretty<00:01:11.360> much<00:01:11.420> it'll<00:01:11.750> pop<00:01:11.960> up<00:01:11.990> to<00:01:12.290> where<00:01:12.380> it

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
but pretty much it'll pop up to where it

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.530 
but pretty much it'll pop up to where it
says<00:01:12.560> copying<00:01:13.070> Google<00:01:13.550> Chrome<00:01:13.760> applications

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
says copying Google Chrome applications

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.570 
says copying Google Chrome applications
and<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.740> I'm<00:01:15.860> going<00:01:16.010> to<00:01:16.070> fast<00:01:16.220> forward<00:01:16.340> through

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
and so I'm going to fast forward through

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.190 
and so I'm going to fast forward through
this<00:01:16.760> part

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.600 

okay<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.260> how's<00:01:22.500> about<00:01:22.650> five<00:01:22.950> seconds<00:01:23.430> left

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
okay so how's about five seconds left

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.240 
okay so how's about five seconds left
and<00:01:24.260> starts<00:01:25.260> just<00:01:25.410> copying<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:25.980> to<00:01:26.010> your

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
and starts just copying it to your

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.150 
and starts just copying it to your
Applications<00:01:26.820> folder<00:01:26.940> and<00:01:27.830> that's<00:01:28.830> actually

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
Applications folder and that's actually

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.770 
Applications folder and that's actually
pretty<00:01:29.280> much<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.880> I'm<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.030> exiting<00:01:30.630> out

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
pretty much it so I'm just exiting out

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.980 
pretty much it so I'm just exiting out
of<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> app<00:01:31.110> right<00:01:31.740> now<00:01:31.800> and<00:01:32.870> I'm<00:01:33.870> actually

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
of the app right now and I'm actually

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.390 
of the app right now and I'm actually
going<00:01:34.260> on<00:01:34.410> in<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> launchpad<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.160> see

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
going on in the launchpad and you see

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.490 
going on in the launchpad and you see
there's<00:01:35.760> Google<00:01:36.180> Chrome<00:01:36.480> it<00:01:36.870> takes<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.230> little

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
there's Google Chrome it takes a little

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.350 
there's Google Chrome it takes a little
bit<00:01:37.620> to<00:01:37.920> load<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.520> an<00:01:38.670> SSD<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.210> might

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
bit to load if you're on an SSD it might

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.510 
bit to load if you're on an SSD it might
be<00:01:39.510> faster<00:01:39.690> which<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.650> will<00:01:40.800> have<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.980> video<00:01:41.460> on

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
be faster which I will have a video on

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.370 
be faster which I will have a video on
installing<00:01:42.150> SSD<00:01:42.630> if<00:01:42.720> y'all<00:01:42.930> want<00:01:43.080> to<00:01:43.170> know<00:01:43.260> how

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
installing SSD if y'all want to know how

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.020 
installing SSD if y'all want to know how
