00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
some are stronger than others it just

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:36.560 
some are stronger than others it just
depends<00:01:31.759> and<00:01:33.860> you<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:35.130> change<00:01:35.880> weapons<00:01:36.210> by

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
depends and you can change weapons by

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.140 
depends and you can change weapons by
clicking<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.920> box<00:01:38.189> up<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:38.490> but

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
clicking on that box up there but

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.880 
clicking on that box up there but
obviously<00:01:39.780> i<00:01:39.869> only<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.259> pistol<00:01:40.710> right<00:01:40.860> now

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
obviously i only have pistol right now

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.969 
obviously i only have pistol right now
so<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.340> can't<00:01:41.640> change<00:01:42.479> weapons<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.229> hopefully

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
so I can't change weapons but hopefully

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.730 
so I can't change weapons but hopefully
i'll<00:01:44.100> have<00:01:44.250> enough<00:01:44.689> to<00:01:45.689> maybe<00:01:45.840> buy<00:01:46.170> something

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
i'll have enough to maybe buy something

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.240 
i'll have enough to maybe buy something
if<00:01:47.490> nothing<00:01:48.229> obviously<00:01:49.229> at<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.530> save<00:01:49.740> up<00:01:49.950> for

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
if nothing obviously at the save up for

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.560 
if nothing obviously at the save up for
it<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.579> keep<00:01:50.729> going<00:01:50.909> through<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.240> levels

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
it and you keep going through the levels

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.600 
it and you keep going through the levels
and<00:01:51.920> eventually<00:01:52.920> you'll<00:01:53.070> get<00:01:53.189> enough<00:01:53.430> money

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
and eventually you'll get enough money

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.649 
and eventually you'll get enough money
to<00:01:54.000> buy<00:01:54.600> another<00:01:55.409> weapon

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.399 

this<00:02:01.659> game<00:02:01.869> is<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.640> very<00:02:03.640> addicting<00:02:04.149> I<00:02:04.390> think<00:02:05.289> it

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
this game is a very addicting I think it

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:06.840 
this game is a very addicting I think it
could<00:02:05.560> have<00:02:05.680> been<00:02:05.770> better<00:02:05.829> because<00:02:06.280> sometimes

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
could have been better because sometimes

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.380 
could have been better because sometimes
as<00:02:07.689> you<00:02:07.869> progress<00:02:08.670> there<00:02:09.670> is<00:02:09.819> a<00:02:09.849> noticeable

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
as you progress there is a noticeable

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.670 
as you progress there is a noticeable
amount<00:02:10.989> of<00:02:11.140> lag<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.900> think<00:02:14.230> they<00:02:14.349> made<00:02:14.560> it

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
amount of lag and I think they made it

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.470 
amount of lag and I think they made it
they<00:02:15.160> should<00:02:15.190> have<00:02:15.489> made<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.209> aliens

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
they should have made it so the aliens

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.800 
they should have made it so the aliens
died<00:02:17.050> in<00:02:17.110> different<00:02:17.590> ways<00:02:18.000> no<00:02:19.000> matter<00:02:19.209> where

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
died in different ways no matter where

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.970 
died in different ways no matter where
you<00:02:19.840> shoot<00:02:20.200> them<00:02:20.380> their<00:02:20.620> heads<00:02:20.800> always

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
you shoot them their heads always

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.620 
you shoot them their heads always
explode<00:02:21.459> when<00:02:21.670> they<00:02:21.700> die<00:02:21.940> which<00:02:22.269> is<00:02:22.300> kind<00:02:22.599> of

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
explode when they die which is kind of

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.660 
explode when they die which is kind of
retarded<00:02:24.630> then<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.750> can<00:02:25.900> clearly<00:02:26.400> shoot<00:02:27.400> them

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
retarded then you can clearly shoot them

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.850 
retarded then you can clearly shoot them
in<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.480> stomach<00:02:29.019> and<00:02:29.140> our<00:02:29.290> heads<00:02:29.470> will<00:02:29.650> still

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
in the stomach and our heads will still

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.070 
in the stomach and our heads will still
explode<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.880> does<00:02:31.060> make<00:02:31.180> any<00:02:31.420> sense<00:02:34.080> but

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
explode that does make any sense but

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.449 
explode that does make any sense but
hopefully<00:02:35.590> they'll<00:02:35.769> be<00:02:35.799> updates<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.370> this

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
hopefully they'll be updates to this

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.110 
hopefully they'll be updates to this
game<00:02:36.670> soon<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:38.769> then<00:02:39.310> they'll<00:02:39.790> make<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:39.970> a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
game soon and then they'll make it a

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.270 
game soon and then they'll make it a

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.520 
expecting it to really drain it because
you<00:05:01.280> know<00:05:01.550> it<00:05:01.730> was<00:05:01.880> a<00:05:01.910> decent<00:05:02.260> looking<00:05:03.260> game

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
you know it was a decent looking game

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.230 
you know it was a decent looking game
but<00:05:03.800> to<00:05:04.100> my<00:05:04.250> surprise<00:05:04.280> it<00:05:04.850> really<00:05:05.030> didn't<00:05:05.210> take

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
but to my surprise it really didn't take

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.410 
but to my surprise it really didn't take
much<00:05:05.540> battery<00:05:05.900> at<00:05:06.020> all<00:05:06.790> so<00:05:07.790> I<00:05:07.820> was<00:05:08.000> able<00:05:08.150> to

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
much battery at all so I was able to

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.770 
much battery at all so I was able to
play<00:05:08.960> for<00:05:09.370> additional<00:05:10.370> a<00:05:10.580> couple<00:05:11.210> hours<00:05:11.360> on

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
play for additional a couple hours on

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.450 
play for additional a couple hours on
the<00:05:12.230> same<00:05:12.470> day<00:05:12.830> of<00:05:13.580> the<00:05:13.700> battery<00:05:14.860> or<00:05:15.860> that<00:05:16.190> same

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
the same day of the battery or that same

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:23.710 
the same day of the battery or that same
day<00:05:21.490> if<00:05:22.490> we<00:05:22.550> have<00:05:22.730> five<00:05:22.940> hundred<00:05:23.300> dollars<00:05:23.540> we

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
day if we have five hundred dollars we

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.800 
day if we have five hundred dollars we
still<00:05:24.050> don't<00:05:24.230> have<00:05:24.290> enough<00:05:25.210> to<00:05:26.210> buy<00:05:26.540> a<00:05:26.570> weapon

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.320 
still don't have enough to buy a weapon
but<00:05:27.200> as<00:05:27.380> you<00:05:27.500> can<00:05:27.590> see<00:05:27.770> now<00:05:28.160> we<00:05:28.220> have<00:05:28.520> the

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
but as you can see now we have the

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.690 
but as you can see now we have the
option<00:05:29.480> to<00:05:29.750> buy<00:05:29.900> that<00:05:30.230> health<00:05:30.470> is<00:05:30.800> one<00:05:31.610> hundred

option to buy that health is one hundred
twenty<00:05:31.910> dollars<00:05:32.540> so<00:05:33.530> if<00:05:33.680> you<00:05:33.830> would<00:05:34.010> want<00:05:34.250> to
