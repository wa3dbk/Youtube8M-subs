00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
the idea of physical immortality is

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.140 
the idea of physical immortality is
impossible<00:00:13.070> because<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.639> end<00:00:14.849> of

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
impossible because the end of

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.040 
impossible because the end of
immortality<00:00:16.020> never<00:00:16.619> comes<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.480> you<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:18.779> never

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
immortality never comes so you can never

immortality never comes so you can never
achieve<00:00:20.119> physical<00:00:21.119> immortality<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:22.199> can

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
achieve physical immortality you can

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.640 
achieve physical immortality you can
only<00:00:22.619> be<00:00:23.039> achieving<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.820> all<00:00:24.630> there<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
only be achieving it all there is in the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.500 
only be achieving it all there is in the
universe<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.359> energy<00:00:27.470> thought<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.680> form<00:00:28.949> and

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
universe is energy thought and form and

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.290 
universe is energy thought and form and
the<00:00:30.510> form<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.990> created<00:00:31.199> by<00:00:31.650> thought<00:00:32.040> all<00:00:32.880> form

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the form is created by thought all form

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.930 
the form is created by thought all form
is<00:00:33.510> created<00:00:33.660> by<00:00:34.020> thought<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.610> body<00:00:35.790> is

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
is created by thought and so the body is

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.790 
is created by thought and so the body is
created<00:00:36.420> by<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.660> thought<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.290> all<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.620> our

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
created by the thought and all of our

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.830 
created by the thought and all of our
personal<00:00:38.340> realities<00:00:38.850> are<00:00:39.059> created<00:00:39.450> by

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
personal realities are created by

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.630 
personal realities are created by
thought<00:00:40.140> which<00:00:40.379> means<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:41.040> everybody<00:00:41.280> is

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
thought which means that everybody is

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.540 
thought which means that everybody is
responsible<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.660> their<00:00:42.780> own<00:00:42.899> death<00:00:43.550> however

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
responsible for their own death however

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.529 
responsible for their own death however
when<00:00:45.480> people<00:00:45.510> believe<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:47.129> they<00:00:47.399> accept<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
when people believe and they accept the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.389 
when people believe and they accept the
belief<00:00:48.840> system<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> death<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.860> inevitable

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
belief system the death is inevitable

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.209 
belief system the death is inevitable
the<00:00:50.670> under<00:00:50.969> control<00:00:51.449> then<00:00:52.170> they're<00:00:52.500> actually

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the under control then they're actually

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.930 
the under control then they're actually
giving<00:00:54.090> their<00:00:54.840> control<00:00:55.550> or<00:00:56.719> to<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> belief<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
giving their control or to a belief and

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.319 
giving their control or to a belief and
so<00:00:59.940> if<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.870> start<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.739> idea<00:01:02.100> that

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
so if you start with the idea that

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.880 
so if you start with the idea that
everybody<00:01:03.329> creates<00:01:03.930> your<00:01:04.110> own<00:01:04.260> death<00:01:04.559> then

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
everybody creates your own death then

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.620 
everybody creates your own death then
the<00:01:05.100> question<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.850> how<00:01:06.090> does<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.450> actually

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
the question is how does that actually

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.100 
the question is how does that actually
work<00:01:07.040> before<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.130> use<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.210> term<00:01:09.420> or<00:01:09.780> coined

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
work before you use the term or coined

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.740 
work before you use the term or coined
the<00:01:10.229> term<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.470> unconscious<00:01:11.130> death<00:01:11.340> urge<00:01:12.380> and

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
the term the unconscious death urge and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.450 
the term the unconscious death urge and
he<00:01:15.750> wrote<00:01:15.960> an<00:01:16.110> essay<00:01:16.290> about<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.979> unconscious

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
he wrote an essay about the unconscious

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.429 
he wrote an essay about the unconscious
Authority<00:01:18.119> which<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.810> most<00:01:18.990> brilliant

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
Authority which is the most brilliant

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.859 
Authority which is the most brilliant
thing<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.860> was<00:01:20.009> ever<00:01:20.250> written<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.970> I've

however<00:01:29.430> when<00:01:29.670> he<00:01:29.880> died<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.810> idea<00:01:31.259> or<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
however when he died the idea or the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.530 
however when he died the idea or the
knowledge<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.520> unconscious<00:01:33.030> Authority

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
knowledge of the unconscious Authority

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.240 
knowledge of the unconscious Authority
went<00:01:33.720> back<00:01:33.900> into<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> unconscious<00:01:35.009> of

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
went back into the unconscious of

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.289 
went back into the unconscious of
psychotherapy<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.530> has<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:38.009> since<00:01:39.000> surfaced

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
psychotherapy and has not since surfaced

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.800 
psychotherapy and has not since surfaced
except<00:01:40.579> by<00:01:41.579> psychotherapists<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.689> have

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
except by psychotherapists that have

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.149 
except by psychotherapists that have
been<00:01:42.960> influenced<00:01:43.619> by<00:01:43.649> some<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.070> my<00:01:44.220> books<00:01:44.810> and

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
been influenced by some of my books and

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.280 
been influenced by some of my books and
so<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.280> unconscious<00:01:47.820> death<00:01:48.119> urghhh<00:01:48.390> afraid

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
so the unconscious death urghhh afraid

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.950 
so the unconscious death urghhh afraid
defines<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.189> unconscious<00:01:50.850> as<00:01:51.060> simply<00:01:51.509> memory

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
defines the unconscious as simply memory

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.490 
defines the unconscious as simply memory
and<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:54.030> whole<00:01:54.210> insurance<00:01:54.420> industry<00:01:55.380> is

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
and the whole insurance industry is

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.459 
and the whole insurance industry is
based<00:01:55.829> upon<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.490> idea<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:59.180> people<00:02:00.180> die<00:02:00.689> at

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
based upon the idea that people die at

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.200 
based upon the idea that people die at
approximately<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.159> same<00:02:02.250> age<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
approximately the same age and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.380 
approximately the same age and
approximately<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.899> same<00:02:04.140> symptoms<00:02:04.560> as<00:02:05.390> their

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
approximately the same symptoms as their

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.609 
approximately the same symptoms as their
parent<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.049> same<00:02:07.290> sex<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.849> entire

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
parent of the same sex so the entire

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.720 
parent of the same sex so the entire
multibillion-dollar

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
multibillion-dollar

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.080 
multibillion-dollar
industries<00:02:12.300> based<00:02:12.629> upon<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.650> desert<00:02:14.090> which

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
industries based upon the desert which

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.470 
industries based upon the desert which
people<00:02:15.569> never<00:02:15.720> think<00:02:16.019> about<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:19.230> have

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
people never think about and so I have

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.600 
people never think about and so I have
when<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.510> became<00:02:21.900> enlightened<00:02:22.080> about<00:02:22.709> death

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
when I became enlightened about death

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.520 
when I became enlightened about death
and<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.060> death<00:02:24.269> urge<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.810> how<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.080> works<00:02:25.290> and

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
and the death urge and how it works and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.820 
and the death urge and how it works and
healed<00:02:25.739> me<00:02:25.950> on<00:02:26.010> deserts<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.879> I<00:02:26.970> became<00:02:27.830> very

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
healed me on deserts and I became very

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.059 
healed me on deserts and I became very
curious<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.239> just<00:02:30.510> fascinated<00:02:31.200> by<00:02:31.530> death<00:02:31.890> and

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
curious and just fascinated by death and

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.610 
curious and just fascinated by death and
how<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.310> works<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:33.140> realized<00:02:34.140> there<00:02:34.440> was

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
how it works and realized there was

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.710 
how it works and realized there was
actually<00:02:35.099> a<00:02:35.130> cause-and-effect<00:02:35.430> relationship

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
actually a cause-and-effect relationship

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.300 
actually a cause-and-effect relationship
and<00:02:36.720> anybody<00:02:36.930> could<00:02:37.290> call<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.680> study<00:02:37.950> because

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
and anybody could call it study because

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.490 
and anybody could call it study because

orders for the clarity even though it
they<00:03:16.950> are<00:03:17.299> it's<00:03:18.299> impossible<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.230> achieve<00:03:19.579> and

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
they are it's impossible to achieve and
