of<00:00:59.789> these<00:00:59.850> things<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> rather<00:01:00.629> hidden

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
of these things can be a rather hidden

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.219 
of these things can be a rather hidden
hindrance<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.370> these<00:01:02.940> systems<00:01:03.480> very<00:01:03.809> hard<00:01:04.080> to

but<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.799> clearly<00:01:08.040> not<00:01:08.479> intensifying<00:01:09.479> as

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
but this is clearly not intensifying as

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.539 
but this is clearly not intensifying as
we<00:01:10.170> might<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.470> expected<00:01:10.590> based<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.400> its

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
structure is very good if we look at the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.770 
structure is very good if we look at the
microwave<00:01:16.860> past<00:01:17.189> from<00:01:17.759> about<00:01:18.119> six<00:01:18.390> hours<00:01:18.509> ago

see<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> visible<00:01:42.329> imagery<00:01:42.600> here<00:01:42.750> so

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
see that on the visible imagery here so

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.660 
see that on the visible imagery here so
this<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.200> not<00:01:43.380> dying<00:01:43.799> off<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.490> not

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
this is not dying off this is not

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.819 
this is not dying off this is not
dissipating<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.990> low<00:01:46.140> level<00:01:46.290> structure

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.789 
dissipating and a low level structure
this<00:01:47.009> robust<00:01:47.430> means<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.939> air<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.360> a

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
this robust means that air is a

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.109 
this robust means that air is a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
converging into those cloud bands and

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.090 
converging into those cloud bands and
may<00:01:51.360> promote<00:01:51.689> more<00:01:52.409> thunderstorm<00:01:52.979> activity

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
may promote more thunderstorm activity

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.639 
may promote more thunderstorm activity
to<00:01:53.579> renew<00:01:53.970> itself<00:01:54.390> during<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.350> overnight

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
to renew itself during the overnight

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.620 
to renew itself during the overnight
hours<00:01:55.799> sometimes<00:01:56.520> these<00:01:56.729> weaker<00:01:57.119> systems<00:01:57.479> do

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
hours sometimes these weaker systems do

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.030 
hours sometimes these weaker systems do
a<00:01:57.659> lot<00:01:57.899> better<00:01:58.049> during<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.560> overnight<00:01:58.860> hours

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
a lot better during the overnight hours

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.179 
a lot better during the overnight hours
as<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.969> atmosphere<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.659> less<00:02:01.079> stable<00:02:01.439> when

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
as the atmosphere is less stable when

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.889 
as the atmosphere is less stable when
the<00:02:02.369> sun<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.610> not<00:02:02.880> out<00:02:02.939> warming<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.659> middle

the sun is not out warming the middle

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.480 
the sun is not out warming the middle
atmosphere<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.799> may<00:02:05.009> still<00:02:05.310> have<00:02:05.460> a

the<00:02:46.890> factors<00:02:47.250> we<00:02:47.370> talked<00:02:47.580> about<00:02:47.790> yesterday

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
the factors we talked about yesterday

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.670 
the factors we talked about yesterday
start<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.600> come<00:02:48.780> into<00:02:48.930> play<00:02:49.050> we<00:02:49.470> get

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
start to come into play we get

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.350 
start to come into play we get
accelerating<00:02:50.370> trade<00:02:50.640> winds<00:02:50.880> in<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.150> dry

accelerating trade winds in a dry
airmass<00:02:51.660> really<00:02:52.560> makes<00:02:52.739> it<00:02:52.920> harder<00:02:53.310> for<00:02:53.489> these

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
airmass really makes it harder for these

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.729 
airmass really makes it harder for these
storms<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.540> maintain<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> healthy<00:02:55.290> circulation

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739

and thunderstorm activity and there may

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.670 
and thunderstorm activity and there may
be<00:02:57.510> an<00:02:57.720> upper<00:02:57.930> trough<00:02:58.140> in<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.440> Eastern

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
southwesterly wind shear as this gets

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.560 
southwesterly wind shear as this gets
closer<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.430> Lesser<00:03:02.670> Antilles<00:03:02.700> but<00:03:03.330> what's

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
closer to the Lesser Antilles but what's

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.470 
closer to the Lesser Antilles but what's
really<00:03:03.780> important<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:05.340> next<00:03:05.370> 24<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.209> 48

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
really important is the next 24 to 48

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.840 
really important is the next 24 to 48
hours<00:03:06.720> because<00:03:07.080> if<00:03:07.320> Danny<00:03:07.590> can<00:03:08.400> strengthen

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
hours because if Danny can strengthen

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.270 
hours because if Danny can strengthen
into<00:03:09.239> a<00:03:09.270> hurricane<00:03:09.480> as<00:03:09.900> forecast<00:03:10.440> then<00:03:11.100> it

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
into a hurricane as forecast then it

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.800 
into a hurricane as forecast then it
will<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:11.640> able<00:03:11.820> to<00:03:11.910> survive<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.570> remain<00:03:12.690> a

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
will be able to survive and remain a

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.170 
will be able to survive and remain a
potent<00:03:13.290> storm<00:03:13.530> as<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:13.890> moves<00:03:14.310> into<00:03:15.060> the

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
potent storm as it moves into the

potent storm as it moves into the
islands<00:03:15.720> however<00:03:16.080> storms<00:03:17.040> like<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:17.250> if<00:03:17.610> they

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
islands however storms like this if they

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
struggle and don't become strong then

which<00:03:34.290> is<00:03:34.440> similar<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.830> what<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.040> European

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
which is similar to what the European

like<00:05:39.660> this<00:05:39.840> there<00:05:40.320> may<00:05:40.530> be<00:05:40.560> multiple<00:05:40.919> threats

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
like this there may be multiple threats

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.710 
like this there may be multiple threats
we've<00:05:41.700> already<00:05:41.850> had<00:05:42.060> a<00:05:42.120> couple<00:05:42.360> that<00:05:42.630> have

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
we've already had a couple that have

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.260 
we've already had a couple that have
made<00:05:42.840> it<00:05:42.990> close<00:05:43.290> and<00:05:43.560> this<00:05:44.400> will<00:05:44.640> be<00:05:44.820> another

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
made it close and this will be another

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.840 
made it close and this will be another
shot<00:05:45.720> perhaps<00:05:46.200> at<00:05:46.440> getting<00:05:47.400> some<00:05:47.640> tropical

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
shot perhaps at getting some tropical

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.580 
shot perhaps at getting some tropical
weather<00:05:48.270> toward<00:05:48.750> the<00:05:48.930> island<00:05:49.290> so<00:05:49.380> this<00:05:49.500> will

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
weather toward the island so this will

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.110 
weather toward the island so this will
be<00:05:49.680> worth<00:05:49.800> keeping<00:05:50.160> an<00:05:50.250> eye<00:05:50.310> on<00:05:50.340> as<00:05:50.730> well

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
be worth keeping an eye on as well

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.210 
be worth keeping an eye on as well
alright<00:05:51.990> that's<00:05:52.169> it<00:05:52.260> for<00:05:52.440> today<00:05:52.650> thanks<00:05:53.190> for

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220
