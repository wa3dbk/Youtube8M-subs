battery pack the new battery pack that's
in<00:01:02.220> the<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.399> think<00:01:02.790> of<00:01:02.879> 79<00:01:03.180> 38<00:01:03.720> train<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:05.460> second

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
in the I think of 79 38 train the second

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.660 
in the I think of 79 38 train the second
the<00:01:06.479> newer<00:01:06.659> battery<00:01:07.080> pack<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> 79<00:01:08.070> 38

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the newer battery pack in the 79 38

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.510 
the newer battery pack in the 79 38
train<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:10.259> the<00:01:10.470> same<00:01:10.679> size<00:01:11.009> as<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
train is the same size as the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.540 
train is the same size as the
rechargeable<00:01:12.270> pack<00:01:12.539> and<00:01:12.979> it<00:01:13.979> should<00:01:14.250> fit<00:01:14.399> in

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
rechargeable pack and it should fit in

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.240 
rechargeable pack and it should fit in
there<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:14.850> well<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.300> takes<00:01:15.539> six<00:01:16.050> AAS<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:17.039> same

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
there as well it takes six AAS the same

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.120 
there as well it takes six AAS the same
as<00:01:17.429> this<00:01:17.580> beast<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.530> but<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.649> not<00:01:19.830> high

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
as this beast here but it's not high

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.490 
as this beast here but it's not high
like<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.490> power<00:01:21.090> function<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.020> only<00:01:22.320> thing

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
like this power function the only thing

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.320 
like this power function the only thing
I<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.920> check<00:01:23.100> out<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.729> whether<00:01:23.970> this

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
I have to check out is whether this

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.050 
I have to check out is whether this
connector<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.830> same<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.429> that<00:01:26.910> new

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
connector is the same on that new

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.400 
connector is the same on that new
battery<00:01:27.330> pack<00:01:27.509> because<00:01:27.690> I<00:01:27.869> don't<00:01:28.080> have<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> new

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
battery pack because I don't have a new

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.410 
battery pack because I don't have a new
battery<00:01:28.619> pack<00:01:28.890> here<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.159> check<00:01:29.369> out<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:30.330> all

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
battery pack here to check out it's all

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.180

have<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:30.929> online<00:01:31.289> and<00:01:31.590> check<00:01:31.649> that<00:01:31.950> them

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
have to go online and check that them

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.180 
have to go online and check that them

9 volt pins on it off it's kind of hard

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.240 
9 volt pins on it off it's kind of hard
to<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.220> there<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:51.590> it<00:01:52.590> would<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:52.860> fit<00:01:53.130> on

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
to see there but it would just fit on

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.010 
to see there but it would just fit on
there's<00:01:53.460> got<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> metal<00:01:54.000> contacts<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.750> there

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
there's got the metal contacts on there

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.200

for the for for the for stud connector
for<00:02:00.210> 90<00:02:00.420> volts<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.229> may<00:02:01.469> be<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.710> one<00:02:02.130> on

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280

that new battery pack I am Not sure even

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.160 
that new battery pack I am Not sure even
though<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.860> says<00:02:05.009> power<00:02:05.399> functions<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.090> the

power functions which is available from
from<00:02:20.910> Lego<00:02:21.739> so<00:02:23.030> came<00:02:24.030> back<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.420> question

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
from Lego so came back to the question

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.979 
from Lego so came back to the question
if<00:02:24.959> can<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:25.320> use<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.769> within<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.910> coach<00:02:27.630> Carr

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
if can we use this within the coach Carr

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.860 
if can we use this within the coach Carr
not<00:02:28.620> just<00:02:28.859> to<00:02:29.010> conceal<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.609> from<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:30.570> way<00:02:30.720> it

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
not just to conceal it from the way it

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.280 
not just to conceal it from the way it
looks<00:02:31.079> like<00:02:31.320> here<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.640> tender<00:02:33.239> what<00:02:34.109> the

looks like here in the tender what the

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.560 
looks like here in the tender what the
answer<00:02:34.739> is<00:02:34.790> this<00:02:35.989> well<00:02:36.989> I<00:02:37.290> don't<00:02:37.530> think<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.570> not

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
answer is this well I don't think so not

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.259 
answer is this well I don't think so not
my<00:02:39.870> opinion<00:02:40.380> because<00:02:40.920> just<00:02:41.820> ripped<00:02:42.060> out<00:02:42.239> all

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
my opinion because just ripped out all

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.610 
my opinion because just ripped out all
the<00:02:42.600> seats<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.019> everything<00:02:43.350> out<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.500> the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
the seats and everything out of the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.820 
the seats and everything out of the
coach<00:02:43.799> car<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.670> was<00:02:44.850> still<00:02:45.120> sit<00:02:45.720> pretty<00:02:46.049> high

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
coach car it was still sit pretty high

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.120 
coach car it was still sit pretty high
basically<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:50.780> would<00:02:50.930> sit<00:02:51.260> like<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:51.500> and

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
basically it would sit like that and

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.800 
basically it would sit like that and
still<00:02:52.430> sitting<00:02:52.820> high<00:02:52.970> as<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.300> can<00:02:53.330> see<00:02:53.660> up

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
still sitting high as you can see up

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.840 
still sitting high as you can see up
here<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.710> would<00:02:54.890> have<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:55.130> build<00:02:55.580> it<00:02:55.700> up

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
here so you would have to build it up

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.740 
here so you would have to build it up
with<00:02:56.030> this<00:02:56.930> up<00:02:57.260> at<00:02:57.620> least<00:02:58.070> another<00:02:59.030> full<00:02:59.450> brick

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
with this up at least another full brick

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.060 
with this up at least another full brick
height<00:03:00.020> in<00:03:00.350> order<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.250> compensate<00:03:01.670> for<00:03:02.240> this

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
height in order to compensate for this

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.240 
height in order to compensate for this
inside<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.280> car<00:03:05.170> might<00:03:06.170> work<00:03:06.200> might<00:03:07.040> look<00:03:07.190> a

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
inside the car might work might look a

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.920 
inside the car might work might look a
little<00:03:07.730> taller<00:03:08.740> might<00:03:09.740> look<00:03:09.860> like<00:03:10.690> but<00:03:11.690> if<00:03:11.780> I

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
little taller might look like but if I

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.570 
little taller might look like but if I
could<00:03:12.110> get<00:03:12.290> two<00:03:12.440> rechargeable<00:03:12.710> battery<00:03:13.340> pack

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
could get two rechargeable battery pack

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.120 
could get two rechargeable battery pack
I<00:03:13.960> would<00:03:14.960> use<00:03:15.200> that<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.800> it<00:03:16.640> has<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:17.980> width<00:03:18.980> of

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
I would use that and it has a width of

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.940 
I would use that and it has a width of
four<00:03:19.400> studs<00:03:19.850> so<00:03:20.600> yeah<00:03:21.080> with<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.440> four<00:03:21.650> studs

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
four studs so yeah with the four studs

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.890 
four studs so yeah with the four studs
so<00:03:22.130> it<00:03:22.250> fits<00:03:22.520> within<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.910> tender<00:03:23.330> and<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.810> would

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
so it fits within the tender and I would

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.680 
so it fits within the tender and I would
definitely<00:03:24.050> fit<00:03:24.500> within<00:03:24.740> this<00:03:25.570> you're<00:03:26.570> going

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
definitely fit within this you're going

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.360 
definitely fit within this you're going
to<00:03:26.750> have<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> longer<00:03:27.140> run<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:27.590> your<00:03:27.740> cable<00:03:28.160> from

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
to have a longer run of your cable from

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.820 
to have a longer run of your cable from
here<00:03:28.760> up<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:29.240> your<00:03:29.390> engine<00:03:29.780> because<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:30.709> got

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
here up to your engine because you got

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.980 
here up to your engine because you got
to<00:03:30.920> go<00:03:31.040> from<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.459> through<00:03:31.910> your<00:03:32.030> tender<00:03:32.420> it

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
to go from that through your tender it

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.870 
to go from that through your tender it
up<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.320> your<00:03:33.410> engine<00:03:33.770> so<00:03:34.310> if<00:03:34.550> you're<00:03:34.700> going

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
up to your engine so if you're going

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.310 
up to your engine so if you're going
with<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.090> rechargeable<00:03:35.540> battery<00:03:35.870> pack<00:03:36.140> it

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
with the rechargeable battery pack it

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.290 
with the rechargeable battery pack it
just<00:03:36.800> makes<00:03:37.010> sense<00:03:37.100> to<00:03:37.400> stick<00:03:37.610> it<00:03:37.730> into<00:03:37.880> tender

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
just makes sense to stick it into tender

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.060 
just makes sense to stick it into tender
instead<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.720> putting<00:03:38.990> it<00:03:39.020> in<00:03:39.200> here<00:03:39.440> so<00:03:39.920> I<00:03:39.950> do

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
instead of putting it in here so I do

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.949 
instead of putting it in here so I do
see<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.490> point<00:03:40.730> trying<00:03:41.240> to<00:03:41.360> conceal<00:03:41.750> this

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
see the point trying to conceal this

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.550 
see the point trying to conceal this
within<00:03:42.620> this<00:03:43.930> because<00:03:44.930> it's<00:03:45.080> just<00:03:45.110> too<00:03:45.290> high

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
within this because it's just too high

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.620 
within this because it's just too high
for<00:03:45.800> the<00:03:45.860> tender<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.340> I<00:03:46.700> agree<00:03:47.030> it<00:03:47.209> does<00:03:47.240> look

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
for the tender and I agree it does look

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.860 
for the tender and I agree it does look
ugly<00:03:47.990> into<00:03:48.230> tender<00:03:48.640> but<00:03:49.640> from<00:03:50.450> what<00:03:50.570> the

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
ugly into tender but from what the

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.990 
ugly into tender but from what the
amount<00:03:51.050> of<00:03:51.110> times<00:03:51.320> as<00:03:51.500> i<00:03:51.620> run<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:52.010> train<00:03:52.250> just

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
amount of times as i run the train just

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.520 
amount of times as i run the train just
leave<00:03:53.209> it<00:03:53.360> in<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.570> tender<00:03:53.870> for<00:03:54.019> now<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:54.380> use
