00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
the textures weren't fully rendered and

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.670

I<00:00:18.359> didn't<00:00:18.600> really<00:00:18.720> even<00:00:18.960> notice<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
I didn't really even notice it and the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.929 
I didn't really even notice it and the
gameplay<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:20.070> was<00:00:20.189> too<00:00:20.340> focused<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:20.880> the

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
gameplay I was too focused on the

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.370 
gameplay I was too focused on the
gameplay<00:00:21.119> like<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.480> game<00:00:21.630> still<00:00:21.930> looks<00:00:22.140> way

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
gameplay like the game still looks way

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.859 
gameplay like the game still looks way
better<00:00:22.619> than<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.490> previous<00:00:23.939> gen<00:00:24.359> consoles

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
better than the previous gen consoles

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.570 
better than the previous gen consoles
but<00:00:25.380> yeah<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.650> didn't<00:00:25.980> notice<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.430> actually

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
don't know the technical details you

don't know the technical details you
know<00:00:49.289> fully<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.489> be<00:00:50.670> make<00:00:50.820> it

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
know fully but it's going to be make it

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.040 
know fully but it's going to be make it
download<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> make<00:00:51.449> your<00:00:51.600> game<00:00:51.719> prettier

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
download to make your game prettier

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.049

basically<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.680> what<00:00:52.860> happens<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
basically is what happens and and

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.540 
basically is what happens and and
apparently<00:00:54.629> when<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> download<00:00:55.530> bar<00:00:56.070> gets<00:00:56.370> to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
apparently when the download bar gets to

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.330 
apparently when the download bar gets to
complete<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.600> not<00:00:57.899> always<00:00:58.440> complete<00:00:59.070> like

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
complete it's not always complete like

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.470 
complete it's not always complete like
that<00:00:59.699> doesn't<00:00:59.910> mean<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.329> necessarily

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
that doesn't mean it's necessarily

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.420 
that doesn't mean it's necessarily
complete<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.530> give<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.920> few<00:01:02.129> more<00:01:02.250> minutes

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
complete so give it a few more minutes

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.830 
complete so give it a few more minutes
like<00:01:02.640> apparently<00:01:03.000> for<00:01:03.149> cod<00:01:03.329> ghosts'<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.690> takes

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
like apparently for cod ghosts' it takes

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.750 
like apparently for cod ghosts' it takes
about<00:01:03.930> 10<00:01:04.290> minutes<00:01:04.650> after<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.369> put<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.580> disc

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
about 10 minutes after you put the disc

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.420 
about 10 minutes after you put the disc
in<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.000> console<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:08.100> know<00:01:08.220> be

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
in the console for it to you know be

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.950 
in the console for it to you know be
fully<00:01:08.760> downloaded<00:01:09.180> by<00:01:09.240> itzá<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:09.840> yeah<00:01:09.900> you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
fully downloaded by itzá but yeah you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.899
