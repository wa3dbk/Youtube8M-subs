00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and back and he built his own headers

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.760 
and back and he built his own headers
out<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.390> kit<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.750> wrapped<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.620> has<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
out of a kit and wrapped it and it has a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.650 
out of a kit and wrapped it and it has a
little<00:00:38.040> 3-inch<00:00:38.370> v<00:00:38.610> band<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.239> goes<00:00:39.390> into<00:00:39.570> a
