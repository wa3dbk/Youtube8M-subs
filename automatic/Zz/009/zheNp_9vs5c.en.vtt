00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.950
 grainy vigorously scanty as one sees 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:15.059
 delicious wholemeal rolls and many 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:17.940
 Consumers like to access if I 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.560
 now a big milk bun so can 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.359
 I eat two is still not full 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.330
 because i think that it is for the digestion 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.980
 The best is when the fiber of the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.660
 stomach needs to work more and therefore 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.550
 contains better substances 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.790
 we are just looking for it a bit 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.110
 to feed healthier and yes just with 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.300
 you might pay attention to the huts 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.520
 but a little bit reinforced on that 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.800
 often consumers are tricked 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.899
 in our research with hidden 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.399
 camera we have discovered many bakers 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.010
 cheat at supposed 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.680
 wholemeal rolls are the ingredients 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.260
 for a honest wholemeal roll 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.210
 wholemeal sourdough yeast salt water 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.770
 a bit of rape seed oil gives 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.730
 baker master subjugate rapid one at that 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.410
 Enough then at the end 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.080
 honest tasty perfect 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.860
 to bake buns 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.590
 the decisive factor is above all the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.150
 Vollkornmehl share so it writes that 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.450
 german food book in his 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.460
 guidelines for bread and biscuits 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.770
 the cereal in the wholegrain bread roll has to be added 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.530
 at least 90 percent wholegrain 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.659
 its products 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.900
 we want to keep ours 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.680
 bakers at it and buy one 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.540
 random at four large 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.100
 North German bakery chains from 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.000
 Allwörden only here 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.369
 dat backhus and boy on the world 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.009
 biggest becker fair the südback let 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.570
 We blindly test the buns of four 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.880
 master baker with longtime 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.320
 work experience they all bake 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.540
 exclusively with traditional 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.729
 recipes and can be based on 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.979
 chrome smell and color assess ob 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.170
 it's a real wholemeal bun 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.810
 first the wholewheat bun from backhus 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.009
 this is one of the few that are not 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.009
 my hand that is totally difficult 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.890
 test now passed the bun of alba 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.930
 someone wants wholemeal with dark color 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:25.530
 pretend experts do not fall for it 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:27.300
 then has the bun of only here too 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.920
 here the crumb unnaturally dark 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.920
 apparently also made 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.580
 finally the bun of boy 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.490
 I would not have felt it anymore 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.490
 that can be so 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.769
 failed the conclusion of our tester 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.209
 three out of four rolls far below 90% 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.129
 wholegrain flour share 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.790
 only exception the bun of 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.170
 Bacchus only here writes us for that 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.360
 our wholemeal roll used 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.819
 cereals are completely out of full 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.330
 grain also grounded by omnivores and 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:14.190
 young people stay completely calm 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.140
 Can we believe that we are still buying 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.910
 once a turn with hidden camera 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.069
 first at the bakery of 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.590
 Allwörden expressly we ask 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.630
 wholemeal roll this is ours 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.720
 wholemeal rolls you want to have that 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.060
 Exactly say we can go to the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.850
 list of ingredients because the must for 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.310
 loose goods can show any load and 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.980
 lo and behold, our bun does not have 90 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.980
 but only 68 percent wholegrain flour 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.760
 then just ask the bakery here again 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.180
 We look for the wholemeal roll and want 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:54.890
 the ingredient list will see the next one 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:58.100
 surprise an ingredient list does me 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.000
 Sorry but we do not have that if 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.110
 that is a clear violation of the 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.060
 food labeling regulation at 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.269
 only here does the consumer not learn 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.060
 what exactly is in the back then finally 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.220
 the bakery boy pretty weird 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.620
 What we experience here we ask for the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.260
 wholemeal roll but that gives it up 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.220
 not once anymore 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.440
 that does not mean anymore 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.110
 wholemeal roll we have renamed it 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.389
 in black bread rolls is but 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.150
 same thing in it 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:31.340
 aha interesting if that something with ours 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.080
 first inquiry has to do we look 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.830
 us the ingredient list on the receipt 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.930
 in a total of only 44% wholegrain share 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.820
 so it was never a real one 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.010
 wholemeal roll we ask again 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.930
 to enlightenment 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.039
 Young's answer we are constantly developing 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.020
 our range continues 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.760
 each customer can use the ingredients completely 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.630
 transparent of our website 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.630
 remove 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.590
 One week earlier we had a boy 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.870
 ever after the ingredients in the 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.580
 wholemeal rolls asked only three days 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.360
 afterwards it was made from the wholemeal roll 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.280
 then suddenly the black bread rolls 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.830
 weird on the website of young 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.930
 we can not find a wholegrain now 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.630
 a black bread bun and so too 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.030
 No ingredients 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.650
 that looks like a game of hide and seek 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.740
 at least the little bakers around the 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.080
 corner honest we will buy again 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.630
 ask like diner wholemeal roll that 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.150
 judgment of our experts benevolent 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.010
 nod at the bread from the baker 1 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.000
 no tricks dark colored crumb 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.000
 everything OK 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:43.819
 the bun from the second becker 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.819
 take up 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.840
 and becker number three 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.560
 For me, this is a colored one 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.560
 wheat buns 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.980
 that is this is for my terms 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.170
 very clear bank with 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.420
 conclusion of the master baker also two of 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.360
 flunked three baker around the corner 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.950
 only one answer to our questions he asked 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.080
 lead no in his assortment 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.850
 wholemeal roll and he has his 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.260
 Employees apparently not enough 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:23.960
 We had that trained in the shop 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.980
 somehow differently experienced because here too 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.110
 we had with a hidden camera 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:30.530
 shopped and wholemeal rolls 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:34.169
 asked this is almost all wholegrain 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:36.360
 which bun do you want? 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.759
 we'll ask the spelled bun 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.110
 after all , after the ingredient list 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:43.270
 they are here 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:47.230
 and we also find the left bun 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:49.200
 wholegrain share only 70 percent we 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.120
 ask for clarification 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:55.360
 there must have happened to us a mistake 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.880
 the bun is 100% whole grain but me 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:02.290
 ask again after a good five minutes 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:05.560
 the call then takes the colleagues 

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:07.750
 clearly say 100% in the bakery 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.180
 wholegrain the boss sat next to it and has 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.010
 he had nodded at us 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.560
 written assured he does not lead 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.790
 wholemeal buns are not funny at all 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:21.850
 that's funny though 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:24.340
 consumer is clearly annoying it is 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.770
 sad sad was once again with 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.720
 play our health 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.250
 why the whole lot of bakers 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.590
 only take such baking mix 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.890
 Volker Becker Rasche shows us how 

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.470
 going 

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:37.540
 retorted products produced by 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.520
 big baking companies a few 

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:42.010
 shovel baking agent wheat flour water 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:48.580
 and yeast the instant mix for fast 

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:49.030
 then bun, then finally something like that 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.410
 do 

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.780
 there are colleagues who might 

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:55.480
 vital we need 

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:58.210
 fortunately not such 

00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:00.400
 Becker is increasingly rare and also 

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:04.530
 that's why wholemeal rolls have theirs 

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.530
 often does not lose names
