00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
take some and melt the solder and just

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.930 
take some and melt the solder and just
lift<00:02:27.380> it<00:02:27.500> up<00:02:27.650> which<00:02:27.829> is<00:02:27.860> what<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.160> did<00:02:28.489> with<00:02:28.640> mine

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
lift it up which is what I did with mine

lift it up which is what I did with mine
you<00:02:29.150> can<00:02:29.299> kind<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.799> see<00:02:30.799> maybe<00:02:31.069> a<00:02:31.250> little<00:02:31.519> bit

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
you can kind of see maybe a little bit

you can kind of see maybe a little bit
it's<00:02:31.930> lift<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.079> up<00:02:33.200> right<00:02:33.410> there<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.950> second

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
it's lift it up right there the second

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.110 
it's lift it up right there the second
one<00:02:34.790> down<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.540> right<00:02:36.459> or<00:02:37.459> whatever<00:02:37.819> you

one down to the right or whatever you
you<00:02:38.480> get<00:02:38.629> what<00:02:38.750> I'm<00:02:38.840> talking<00:02:39.140> about<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.760> once

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
you get what I'm talking about and once

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
you do that just reassemble everything

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.360 
you do that just reassemble everything
put<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.150> back<00:02:44.329> in<00:02:44.629> and<00:02:44.900> then<00:02:45.829> your<00:02:46.040> turn

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
put it back in and then your turn

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.930 
put it back in and then your turn
signals<00:02:47.260> should<00:02:48.260> slow<00:02:48.680> down<00:02:48.709> from<00:02:49.430> your<00:02:49.610> hyper

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
signals should slow down from your hyper

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:57.880 
signals should slow down from your hyper

you<00:03:09.440> will<00:03:09.560> find<00:03:10.000> turn<00:03:11.000> signals<00:03:12.400> they<00:03:13.400> will<00:03:13.730> be

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
you will find turn signals they will be

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.670 
you will find turn signals they will be
taking<00:03:14.270> a<00:03:14.360> little<00:03:14.600> faster<00:03:15.170> that<00:03:15.440> is<00:03:15.530> your

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
taking a little faster that is your

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.010 
taking a little faster that is your
stock<00:03:16.040> will<00:03:16.340> be<00:03:16.840> but<00:03:17.840> nothing<00:03:18.560> extreme<00:03:19.220> so

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
stock will be but nothing extreme so

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:29.720 
stock will be but nothing extreme so
there's<00:03:21.020> your<00:03:21.170> fix<00:03:21.440> good<00:03:22.040> look
