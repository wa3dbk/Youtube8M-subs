row I actually ended up we finished
through<00:06:06.970> the<00:06:07.150> video<00:06:07.389> with<00:06:07.570> me<00:06:07.690> just<00:06:07.960> openly

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
through the video with me just openly

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.770 
through the video with me just openly
sobbing<00:06:09.060> there's<00:06:10.060> a<00:06:10.150> few<00:06:10.300> like<00:06:10.449> that<00:06:10.630> they

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
sobbing there's a few like that they

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.090 
sobbing there's a few like that they
really<00:06:11.080> were<00:06:11.199> we're<00:06:11.590> kind<00:06:11.770> of<00:06:11.830> gotten<00:06:12.040> away

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
really were we're kind of gotten away

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.230 
really were we're kind of gotten away
from<00:06:12.190> that<00:06:12.370> I<00:06:12.520> think<00:06:12.729> we<00:06:12.820> need<00:06:12.880> to<00:06:13.000> go<00:06:13.090> back

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
from that I think we need to go back

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.870 
from that I think we need to go back
maybe<00:06:13.840> I<00:06:13.930> don't<00:06:14.050> know<00:06:14.260> I<00:06:14.520> got<00:06:15.520> pretty<00:06:15.699> good<00:06:15.760> at

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
maybe I don't know I got pretty good at

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.640 
maybe I don't know I got pretty good at
stopping<00:06:16.120> like<00:06:16.389> I<00:06:16.479> said<00:06:16.690> so<00:06:16.900> well<00:06:17.260> we<00:06:17.380> don't<00:06:17.530> I

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
stopping like I said so well we don't I

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.840 
stopping like I said so well we don't I
mean<00:06:17.770> we<00:06:17.830> don't<00:06:17.889> do<00:06:18.070> the<00:06:18.160> painful<00:06:18.460> memories<00:06:18.490> as

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
mean we don't do the painful memories as

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.250 
mean we don't do the painful memories as
often<00:06:19.090> as<00:06:19.210> we<00:06:19.240> do<00:06:19.360> other<00:06:19.510> videos<00:06:19.840> like<00:06:20.050> echo

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
often as we do other videos like echo

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.629 
often as we do other videos like echo
screens<00:06:20.590> or<00:06:20.710> 16-bit<00:06:21.160> gems<00:06:21.370> but<00:06:21.520> they

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
screens or 16-bit gems but they

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:22.890 
screens or 16-bit gems but they
certainly<00:06:21.790> are<00:06:22.030> a<00:06:22.060> lot<00:06:22.240> of<00:06:22.270> fun<00:06:22.510> to<00:06:22.600> do<00:06:22.720> there

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
certainly are a lot of fun to do there

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.780 
certainly are a lot of fun to do there
are<00:06:22.990> only<00:06:23.050> open<00:06:23.380> sketches<00:06:24.010> that<00:06:24.040> we<00:06:24.280> do<00:06:24.400> yeah

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
are only open sketches that we do yeah

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.520 
are only open sketches that we do yeah
absolutely<00:06:25.030> the<00:06:25.720> problem<00:06:26.020> is<00:06:26.139> making<00:06:26.440> sure

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
absolutely the problem is making sure

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.310 
absolutely the problem is making sure
that<00:06:26.560> it<00:06:26.740> doesn't<00:06:26.889> get<00:06:27.450> played<00:06:28.450> out<00:06:28.479> sits

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
that it doesn't get played out sits

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.750 
that it doesn't get played out sits
right<00:06:29.470> I<00:06:29.530> guess<00:06:29.860> and<00:06:30.190> we<00:06:30.340> don't<00:06:30.430> want<00:06:30.520> to<00:06:30.669> use

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
right I guess and we don't want to use

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.280 
right I guess and we don't want to use
the<00:06:30.910> same<00:06:31.090> jokes<00:06:31.330> every<00:06:31.630> time<00:06:31.840> either<00:06:32.020> and

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
the same jokes every time either and

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.690 
the same jokes every time either and
we're<00:06:32.470> not<00:06:32.560> very<00:06:32.680> creative<00:06:32.889> so<00:06:33.340> you<00:06:33.400> know<00:06:33.610> it

we're not very creative so you know it

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.010 
we're not very creative so you know it
