 but Japan in the winter that reminds me as the Buddhist it same crap 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.270
 Driven on average Toyota then finally do the whole may well baffled especially in 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.540
 Toto Wolff Shogun 2 not always winter is because after that comes 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.110
 Spring and summer and fall per round go by in the shed to one 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.930
 Light is a season but the coolest is the spring in the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.770
 Songs cherry blossoms from the tree this would have the city the the 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.519
 Card is released in contrast to Enke eggs 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.270

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.630
 still high and Robin Szolkowy out their capitals 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.950
 hereby protect five by or middle to hedge better Poom protect 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.480
 can 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.740
 Rheine units construction show helpful 2-test IKOM track of troops so can 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.109
 I compare them better 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.059
 the Mannheim is also in the adjacent important buildings 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.590
 for example in the harbor or farm 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.440
 if I have the squatters I can weaken the hostile economy 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.920
 I will attack directly 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.470
 Speaking of attacking 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.179
 You do not win the Japanese Emperor Grone in the lottery but in war 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.049
 here my fleet blocks the enemy trading port and has 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.210
 at the same time deposed her arts 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.970
 this time besieged the enemy Rusalka 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.850
 he knew how to dice and says that the states and I can 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.190
 they eventually occupy or plunder the latter 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.859
 Cult club but the citizens 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.170
 So let's go 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.870
 if I have no desire for war, of course, in addition to diplomacy. "That works 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.689
 how to adopt an Embraer by giving suggestions to other factions 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:27.760
 under wide 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.030
 I can also forge my daughters to forge alliances 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.290
 opposing leaders marry stupid only that the girls still 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.670
 Minors are with 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.170
 male relatives Speedy state offices to their loyalty too 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.789
 to back up 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.460
 otherwise they will end up over the enemy 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.090
 Also important is that Minden with the flowery name of the championship 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.510
 Arts specializing in the warpath Bushido the new 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.820
 Unlocking military technology or taking the peaceful path of Chi's under 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.310
 strengthens another economy 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.910
 that's one of a few years' research 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.140
 and of course in Shogun 2 there are also special units of diplomats more hostile 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.510
 Metzker around who bribed from the police recognized cities and so on 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.650
 Can not persuade side change any question the man needs to get away and shag around 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.540
 a mini-job whose files did Shogun 2 invest with the movie 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:35.999
 Staudt 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.099
 also 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.290
 So the agent's story 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.260
 through successes you become the amp and I can specialize it for 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.870
 Example of sabotage or murder attempts and not only in salt all 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.319
 Characters have in such a talent tree so also general and 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.560
 that's good news after all, a pinch of roleplaying finally has 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.030
 still no title damaged
