00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.319 
tends to curl when you knit it even
though<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.270> made<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.440> border<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.579> I

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
though I made this with a border and I

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.069

just<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.750> know<00:00:46.730> try<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.789> flatten<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.750> out<00:00:48.870> that

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
just you know try to flatten it out that

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.410 
just you know try to flatten it out that
way<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.289> still<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.800> have<00:00:50.000> things<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.210> this

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
flat knitted project and I would

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.880

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
this so that you know the steam could

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.030 
this so that you know the steam could
penetrate<00:02:30.330> through<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:30.930> or<00:02:31.050> whatever<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.650> don't

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
penetrate through it or whatever I don't

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.070 
penetrate through it or whatever I don't
move<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.550> too<00:02:32.730> fast<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.180> don't<00:02:33.240> wrap<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.930> like

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
move it too fast I don't wrap it like

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.960 
move it too fast I don't wrap it like
