00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
were just seemed like we were in slow

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.990 
were just seemed like we were in slow
motion<00:02:49.530> after<00:02:50.100> we<00:02:50.220> turned<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.550> ball<00:02:50.670> over<00:02:50.730> and

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
motion after we turned the ball over and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.750 
motion after we turned the ball over and
they<00:02:51.090> exported<00:02:51.830> like<00:02:52.830> 21<00:02:53.280> answer<00:02:53.550> common

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
they exported like 21 answer common

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.449 
they exported like 21 answer common
point<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.810> just<00:02:54.959> really<00:02:55.320> really<00:02:56.250> was

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
point so it just really really was

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.160 
point so it just really really was
frustratin<00:02:57.090> from<00:02:57.510> office<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.870> lot<00:02:58.019> of

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
frustratin from office a lot of

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.080 
frustratin from office a lot of
standpoint<00:02:58.470> going<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:58.980> go<00:02:59.070> out<00:02:59.130> there<00:02:59.220> and

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
standpoint going to go out there and

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.690 
standpoint going to go out there and
really<00:03:00.330> had<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.410> throw<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.739> ball<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.250> when

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
really had to throw the ball and when

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.880 
really had to throw the ball and when
you<00:03:02.730> have<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:03.120> throw<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.390> ball<00:03:03.540> like<00:03:03.720> that

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
you have to throw the ball like that

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.290 
you have to throw the ball like that
obviously<00:03:04.890> puts<00:03:05.400> off<00:03:05.580> its<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.850> lot<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:06.120> tough

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
obviously puts off its a lot of tough

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.610 
obviously puts off its a lot of tough
situation<00:03:06.840> puts<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.080> back<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.290> tough

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
situation puts the back a tough

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.090 
situation puts the back a tough
situation<00:03:08.750> it's<00:03:09.750> just<00:03:09.930> not<00:03:09.989> not<00:03:10.500> not<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.890> way

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
situation it's just not not not the way

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.160 
situation it's just not not not the way
you<00:03:11.160> want<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.580> you<00:03:12.090> know<00:03:12.209> being<00:03:12.600> in<00:03:12.720> position

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
you want to you know being in position

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.440 
you want to you know being in position
within<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.500> road

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
within the road

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.710 
within the road
how<00:03:15.450> important<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:15.930> chemistry<00:03:16.400> office<00:03:17.720> it's

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
how important is chemistry office it's

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.030 
how important is chemistry office it's
overwhelmingly<00:03:19.409> important<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:19.920> know<00:03:20.010> I

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
overwhelmingly important you know I

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.250 
overwhelmingly important you know I
think<00:03:20.129> it's<00:03:20.430> sometimes<00:03:21.390> misunderstanding

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
think it's sometimes misunderstanding

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.949 
think it's sometimes misunderstanding
you<00:03:22.620> know<00:03:22.709> how<00:03:23.239> important<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.299> is<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.480> have<00:03:24.840> a

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
you know how important it is to have a

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.320 
you know how important it is to have a
continuity<00:03:25.440> kind<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.430> developed<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:26.940> think<00:03:27.239> we

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
continuity kind of developed I think we

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.750 
continuity kind of developed I think we
developed<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.870> over<00:03:28.220> obviously<00:03:29.220> nine<00:03:29.430> games

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
developed that over obviously nine games

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.360 
developed that over obviously nine games
and<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:30.120> bill<00:03:30.420> Phillip<00:03:31.049> righteous<00:03:31.440> was<00:03:31.769> you

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
and then bill Phillip righteous was you

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.309 
and then bill Phillip righteous was you
know<00:03:32.489> not<00:03:32.519> with<00:03:32.849> us<00:03:32.970> today<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.510> don't<00:03:34.170> think

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
know not with us today I don't think

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.839 
know not with us today I don't think
that<00:03:34.379> had<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.650> great<00:03:34.950> effect<00:03:35.069> on<00:03:35.430> us<00:03:35.580> but<00:03:35.790> I

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
that had a great effect on us but I

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.309 
that had a great effect on us but I
think<00:03:35.879> the<00:03:36.150> fact<00:03:36.360> came<00:03:36.599> on<00:03:36.750> us<00:03:36.840> when<00:03:36.989> Brandon

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
think the fact came on us when Brandon

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.490 
think the fact came on us when Brandon
actually<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.799> his<00:03:38.280> backup<00:03:38.700> went<00:03:38.879> down<00:03:39.030> and

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
actually the his backup went down and

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.289 
actually the his backup went down and
you<00:03:40.500> know<00:03:40.620> we<00:03:40.739> had<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:40.950> kind<00:03:41.160> of<00:03:41.220> shuffle<00:03:42.180> some

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
you know we had to kind of shuffle some

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.960 
you know we had to kind of shuffle some
guys<00:03:42.480> in<00:03:42.720> there<00:03:42.840> then<00:03:43.019> obviously<00:03:43.670> by<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.730> time

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
guys in there then obviously by the time

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.850 
guys in there then obviously by the time
I<00:03:45.000> I<00:03:45.150> went<00:03:46.019> out<00:03:46.110> in<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.290> fourth<00:03:46.500> quarter<00:03:46.709> he

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
I I went out in the fourth quarter he

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.710 
I I went out in the fourth quarter he
know<00:03:47.040> this<00:03:47.430> kind<00:03:47.640> of<00:03:47.730> already<00:03:47.940> over<00:03:48.329> we<00:03:48.629> had

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
know this kind of already over we had

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.600 
know this kind of already over we had
already<00:03:48.870> pretty<00:03:49.140> much<00:03:49.349> dropped<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.190> bomb<00:03:50.370> so

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
already pretty much dropped the bomb so

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.330 
already pretty much dropped the bomb so
to<00:03:50.670> speak<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.379> but<00:03:52.379> you<00:03:52.859> know<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:52.980> think<00:03:53.190> that

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
to speak and but you know I think that

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.940 
to speak and but you know I think that
definitely<00:03:53.459> had<00:03:53.730> an<00:03:53.849> effect<00:03:53.910> on<00:03:54.239> this<00:03:54.359> early

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
definitely had an effect on this early

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.099 
definitely had an effect on this early
in<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.010> game
