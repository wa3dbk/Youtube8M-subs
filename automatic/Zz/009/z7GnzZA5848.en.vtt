00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
four or so I think I don't remember how

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.540 
four or so I think I don't remember how
many<00:02:55.150> ate<00:02:55.600> yesterday<00:02:55.870> but<00:02:56.500> something<00:02:57.430> like

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
many ate yesterday but something like

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.290 
many ate yesterday but something like
that<00:02:57.790> oh<00:02:59.310> one<00:03:00.310> other<00:03:00.430> thing<00:03:00.550> I<00:03:00.820> wanted<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.090> talk

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
that oh one other thing I wanted to talk

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.250 
that oh one other thing I wanted to talk
about<00:03:01.360> was<00:03:01.630> drinking<00:03:01.960> water<00:03:03.780> while<00:03:04.780> i<00:03:04.810> was<00:03:05.020> on

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
about was drinking water while i was on

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:13.620 
about was drinking water while i was on
juice<00:03:05.980> fast<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:10.080> still<00:03:11.080> now<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:12.850> idea<00:03:13.360> is<00:03:13.480> to

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
juice fast and still now the idea is to

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.120 
juice fast and still now the idea is to
have<00:03:13.840> at<00:03:14.290> least<00:03:14.320> 64<00:03:15.190> ounces<00:03:15.550> of<00:03:15.730> water<00:03:16.350> now<00:03:17.350> do

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
have at least 64 ounces of water now do

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.730 
have at least 64 ounces of water now do
you<00:03:18.190> think<00:03:18.400> about<00:03:18.520> it<00:03:18.940> 64<00:03:19.720> ounces<00:03:20.020> of<00:03:20.200> water<00:03:20.440> a

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
you think about it 64 ounces of water a

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.820 
you think about it 64 ounces of water a
lot<00:03:21.160> of<00:03:21.400> water<00:03:21.670> drink<00:03:22.180> if<00:03:22.750> you<00:03:22.960> are<00:03:23.320> not<00:03:23.530> used

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
lot of water drink if you are not used

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.730 
lot of water drink if you are not used
to<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:27.300> so<00:03:28.300> if<00:03:28.390> you<00:03:28.510> start<00:03:28.690> drinking<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.410> it's

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
to it so if you start drinking it it's

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.590
