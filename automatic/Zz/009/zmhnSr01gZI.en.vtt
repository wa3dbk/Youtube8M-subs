loc<00:01:07.110> method<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.590> very<00:01:07.740> simple<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.760> love<00:01:09.150> to

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
loc method is very simple and I love to

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.480 
loc method is very simple and I love to
do<00:01:09.810> simple<00:01:10.380> things<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.979> don't<00:01:11.040> want<00:01:11.280> anything

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
too tedious or too time-consuming I've

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.310 
too tedious or too time-consuming I've
been<00:01:14.520> trying<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.030> loc<00:01:15.540> method<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:16.080> about

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
been trying the loc method for about

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.070 
been trying the loc method for about
five<00:01:16.950> or<00:01:17.189> six<00:01:17.400> days<00:01:17.670> or<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.750> pretty<00:01:18.960> much

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
five or six days or so and I pretty much

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.190 
five or six days or so and I pretty much
see<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.920> my<00:01:20.310> hair<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.790> really<00:01:21.330> starting<00:01:21.869> to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
see that my hair is really starting to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.950 
see that my hair is really starting to
retain<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.369> moisture<00:01:23.670> throughout<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.720> day

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
retain the moisture throughout the day

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.440 
retain the moisture throughout the day
much<00:01:25.470> better<00:01:25.799> than<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.250> was<00:01:26.280> before<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.360> I'm

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
much better than it was before so I'm

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.140 
much better than it was before so I'm
thinking<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.200> maybe<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.979> might<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.790> stick

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
thinking that maybe I might just stick

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.929 
thinking that maybe I might just stick

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
or the loc method the L stands for

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.410 
or the loc method the L stands for
