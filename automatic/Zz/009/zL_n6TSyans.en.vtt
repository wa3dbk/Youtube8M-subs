 femeti as always I hope you are 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.630
 super mega tricks good minus one more time 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.450
 to this series of tricks and tips on 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.219
 halo 4 so it is after a time of no 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.710
 upload one more episode of this series 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.930
 I decided to do it with this good this is not 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.430
 a trick but yes that is a tip are 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.109
 Tips on how to use properly 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.330
 base 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.640
 one of my favorite vehicles without a doubt 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.140
 since it is lethal as you can see I have been 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.509
 almost like three casualties and it's just going 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.180
 starting the game and the truth is that 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.580
 the base is very lethal but you have to know 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.590
 use it I liked it a lot so 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.570
 I'm not an expert but I do know that after 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.650
 some advice the first classic that 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.480
 equality is that they do not get 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.850
 shoot like crazy is to look for 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.640
 their prey they make to one and leave on 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.770
 that normally what I do is use 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.470
 pure the fuel cannon is to say a 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.330
 I shoot a death I do not start shooting 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.090
 see if I kill them with the clear turret 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.920
 that it's very ridiculous to be there shooting 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.750
 to a turret because you care too much 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.970
 normally when you go like this with cannon 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.340
 fuel that you center more here came 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.840
 a killing that is five without dying is 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.070
 a very powerful vehicle as he said 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.780
 continuation now 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.100
 on this map of exa and what I 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.140
 I usually do is go around 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.030
 circles but every 23 laps I go to 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.680
 backwards here as you can see I focus 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.750
 I always do not start shooting like 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.670
 crazy is what I advise you should not 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.369
 to do is better to look for the surprise me 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.070
 there I have another one that when you go down is 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.660
 important that you keep well 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.119
 concentrate, keep yourself well 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.030
 concentrated because in an oversight you 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.940
 They can steal because when you defend yourself 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.229
 a lot when you go down a lot it's very easy 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.790
 that they steal the base from a single jump 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.190
 they can steal it or they can give you 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.720
 the plasma gun then this that 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.729
 I do chase this until I want 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.080
 kill him do not do it here a very 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.580
 important I shot him I start to 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.940
 shoot when I see that it starts to spin 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.140
 the cannon flogged me ok why because 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.450
 obviously he had only rotated what is 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.369
 in a bit then if I put it in 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.670
 liters and I was going to normal I could have 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.740
 killed that is very important, be careful 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.899
 priority are the enemies but keep in 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.590
 account that if there is an empty 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.110
 I forgive a room or a scorpion to those 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.030
 are your priorities ok you always have 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.460
 to be very careful of the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.940
 scorpion and above all 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.190
 the chaos of the fourth chaos is very powerful 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.540
 with only one that tdt can even 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.520
 destroy or that so you have to have 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.960
 be careful what else you have 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.490
 to be careful from the types that 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.470
 they have plasma gun you have to 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.510
 compose from the ramÃ³n guzmÃ¡n then 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.490
 cast then as I tell you the base is 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.400
 very porous but you know it when 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.050
 descend use many liters you like 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.480
 are always remains still a bit see that 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.670
 what liters ok here came out the guardo 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.470
 that I started to clean everything started 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.120
 hear below normally I do not read 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.760
 because if I rise it's easier than me 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.050
 ok and now I'm going over the room 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.420
 I hope here I hope I wait until 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.430
 I have a safe shot there killed him 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.380
 there is not going to give time so I finished 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.730
 going no and for good lords I think that 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.680

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.510
