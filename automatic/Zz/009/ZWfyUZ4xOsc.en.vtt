someone out there actually knows the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.930 
someone out there actually knows the
difference<00:00:23.210> but<00:00:23.360> I<00:00:23.420> am<00:00:23.680> NOT<00:00:24.680> up<00:00:25.430> to<00:00:25.490> date<00:00:25.820> on

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
difference but I am NOT up to date on

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.330

these<00:00:26.060> these<00:00:26.300> s<00:00:26.480> chassis<00:00:26.869> cars<00:00:27.080> here<00:00:27.340> but

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
these these s chassis cars here but

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.210 
these these s chassis cars here but
anyways<00:00:28.670> I<00:00:28.700> thought<00:00:29.470> because<00:00:30.470> I<00:00:30.500> like<00:00:30.980> them<00:00:31.070> so

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.069 
anyways I thought because I like them so
much<00:00:31.340> because<00:00:31.550> I<00:00:31.699> don't<00:00:31.940> really<00:00:32.090> have<00:00:32.300> much

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
much because I don't really have much

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.200 
much because I don't really have much
personal<00:00:33.560> experience<00:00:33.980> with<00:00:34.130> with<00:00:34.489> them<00:00:34.670> in<00:00:35.060> my

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
personal experience with with them in my

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.880 
personal experience with with them in my
past<00:00:35.510> I<00:00:35.900> thought<00:00:36.079> it<00:00:36.260> would<00:00:36.350> be<00:00:36.440> kind<00:00:36.680> of<00:00:36.739> cool

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
past I thought it would be kind of cool

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.550 
past I thought it would be kind of cool
to<00:00:37.210> for<00:00:38.210> myself<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:38.780> for<00:00:38.810> anybody<00:00:39.140> else<00:00:39.350> who's

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
to for myself and for anybody else who's

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.500 
to for myself and for anybody else who's
interested<00:00:40.010> in<00:00:40.040> these<00:00:40.220> these<00:00:40.460> Honda's<00:00:40.850> do<00:00:41.420> you

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
interested in these these Honda's do you

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.430 
interested in these these Honda's do you
actually<00:00:41.600> get<00:00:42.340> as<00:00:43.340> much<00:00:43.520> detail<00:00:43.940> as<00:00:44.030> possible

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
actually get as much detail as possible

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.200 
actually get as much detail as possible
with<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:45.559> limitations<00:00:46.190> of<00:00:46.399> my<00:00:46.430> camera<00:00:47.000> and

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
with the limitations of my camera and

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.240 
with the limitations of my camera and
the<00:00:47.450> lighting<00:00:47.750> in<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:47.899> warehouse<00:00:48.200> and<00:00:48.470> things

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
the lighting in the warehouse and things

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.360 
the lighting in the warehouse and things
like<00:00:49.399> that<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:49.880> I<00:00:50.149> figured<00:00:51.010> let<00:00:52.010> me<00:00:52.100> get<00:00:52.250> as

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
like that so I figured let me get as

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.590 
like that so I figured let me get as
much<00:00:52.640> as<00:00:52.850> possible<00:00:53.030> so<00:00:53.600> I<00:00:53.630> can<00:00:55.090> show<00:00:56.090> it<00:00:56.120> off<00:00:56.329> to

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
much as possible so I can show it off to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.270 
much as possible so I can show it off to
the<00:00:56.690> world<00:00:56.809> and<00:00:57.200> keep<00:00:57.559> it<00:00:57.680> as<00:00:57.770> a<00:00:57.860> record<00:00:58.129> for

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280
