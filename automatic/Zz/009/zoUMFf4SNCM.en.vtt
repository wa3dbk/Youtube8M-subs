exactly<00:02:25.860> how<00:02:26.550> much<00:02:26.790> I'm<00:02:27.720> going<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.320> put<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:29.360> its

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
exactly how much I'm going to put to its

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.300 
exactly how much I'm going to put to its
comes<00:02:30.900> with<00:02:31.110> practice<00:02:31.290> based<00:02:31.890> on<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.160> amount

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
comes with practice based on the amount

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.400 
comes with practice based on the amount
of<00:02:32.460> chicken<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:32.940> have<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:34.140> i'm<00:02:34.260> waiting

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
of chicken that you have so i'm waiting

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.650 
of chicken that you have so i'm waiting
for<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.770> oil<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.130> get<00:02:35.340> hot<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:36.170> hold<00:02:37.170> on<00:02:38.660> now

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
for the oil to get hot so hold on now

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.660 
for the oil to get hot so hold on now
the<00:02:39.720> best<00:02:40.020> part<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.470> use<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.950> steel<00:02:41.250> chicken

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
the best part to use the steel chicken

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.600 
the best part to use the steel chicken
in<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:42.090> like<00:02:42.600> an<00:02:42.750> iron<00:02:43.080> cast<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.770> cast<00:02:44.040> iron<00:02:44.250> pot

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
in is like an iron cast a cast iron pot

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.020 
in is like an iron cast a cast iron pot
but<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.620> don't<00:02:46.620> feel<00:02:46.770> like<00:02:46.890> using<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.670> i'm

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
but I don't feel like using it so i'm

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.300 
but I don't feel like using it so i'm
using<00:02:48.270> my<00:02:48.420> regular<00:02:48.960> but<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.680> one<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.070> easier

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
using my regular but this one is easier

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.730 
using my regular but this one is easier
for<00:02:50.820> me<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.770> handle<00:02:52.910> you<00:02:53.910> know<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.870> it's<00:02:55.200> just

my<00:02:55.950> preference<00:02:56.390> today<00:02:59.570> this<00:03:00.570> is<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:01.560> is

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
my preference today this is this is

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.560 
my preference today this is this is
really<00:03:01.950> clumsy<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.760> gotta<00:03:02.940> bear<00:03:03.180> with<00:03:03.210> me

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
really clumsy so you gotta bear with me

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.650 
really clumsy so you gotta bear with me
so<00:03:03.930> i'm<00:03:04.050> using<00:03:04.260> about<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.830> amount<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.280> sugar

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.010 

the<00:03:09.660> oil<00:03:09.900> spot<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:11.390> now<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:12.450> want<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.840> let

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
the oil spot and now you want to let

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.520 
the oil spot and now you want to let
that<00:03:13.200> sugar<00:03:16.940> brown<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.020> gotta<00:03:19.230> make<00:03:19.500> sure

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
that sugar brown and you gotta make sure

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.600 
that sugar brown and you gotta make sure
that<00:03:20.070> it's<00:03:20.280> not<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:20.970> doesn't<00:03:21.000> um<00:03:22.280> when<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.400> put

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
that it's not it doesn't um when you put

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.160 
that it's not it doesn't um when you put
your<00:03:23.640> chicken<00:03:24.180> in<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:25.430> is<00:03:26.430> not<00:03:26.780> too<00:03:27.780> black

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
your chicken in that is not too black

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.400 
your chicken in that is not too black
because<00:03:28.800> if<00:03:29.010> it's<00:03:29.220> if<00:03:29.640> it's<00:03:29.820> black<00:03:30.300> it<00:03:30.510> is<00:03:30.630> like

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
because if it's if it's black it is like

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.570 
because if it's if it's black it is like
burnt<00:03:31.740> your<00:03:32.610> chicken<00:03:33.030> will<00:03:33.210> taste<00:03:33.570> bitter<00:03:33.960> um
