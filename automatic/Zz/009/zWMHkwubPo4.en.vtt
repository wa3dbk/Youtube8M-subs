I've<00:02:12.170> seen<00:02:12.230> from<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.400> direction<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.940> the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
I've seen from the direction that the

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.490 
I've seen from the direction that the
flames<00:02:14.300> are<00:02:14.480> coming<00:02:14.660> from<00:02:14.960> so<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:15.470> can

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
flames are coming from so you can

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.870 
flames are coming from so you can
actually<00:02:15.830> use<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.010> as<00:02:16.190> an<00:02:16.400> indicator<00:02:16.760> of

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
actually use that as an indicator of

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.900 
actually use that as an indicator of
which<00:02:17.090> way<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.390> flames<00:02:17.660> are<00:02:17.750> coming<00:02:17.990> from<00:02:21.910> the

which way the flames are coming from the

which way the flames are coming from the
to<00:02:23.390> oblivion<00:02:23.750> double<00:02:24.290> slam<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.070> bit<00:02:25.310> odd

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
to oblivion double slam is a bit odd

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.220 
to oblivion double slam is a bit odd
because<00:02:28.330> there's<00:02:29.330> there's<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.870> little<00:02:30.080> bit<00:02:30.200> of

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.930 
because there's there's a little bit of
a<00:02:30.290> delay<00:02:30.560> when<00:02:30.710> it's<00:02:30.830> coming<00:02:31.100> down<00:02:31.280> and

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
a delay when it's coming down and

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.880 
a delay when it's coming down and
there's<00:02:32.630> two<00:02:32.810> hits<00:02:33.050> that<00:02:33.470> come<00:02:33.620> out<00:02:33.740> really

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
there's two hits that come out really

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.360 
there's two hits that come out really
fast

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
fast

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.370 
fast
so<00:02:34.580> if<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:34.850> mess<00:02:35.240> up<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.420> timing<00:02:35.660> too<00:02:36.050> early

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
so if you mess up the timing too early

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.650 
so if you mess up the timing too early
or<00:02:36.410> too<00:02:36.500> late<00:02:36.790> you're<00:02:37.790> gonna<00:02:38.090> get<00:02:38.390> hit<00:02:38.630> no

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
or too late you're gonna get hit no

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:54.250 
or too late you're gonna get hit no
matter<00:02:38.870> what

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.460 

time<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.980> surrender<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.640> your<00:02:57.060> destiny<00:02:57.810> in

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
time to surrender to your destiny in

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.900 
time to surrender to your destiny in

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
Oblivion actually one thing that's a

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.720 
Oblivion actually one thing that's a
little<00:03:03.090> weird<00:03:03.330> is<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:05.069> double

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
little weird is that the double

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.759 
little weird is that the double
projectile<00:03:06.360> thing<00:03:07.019> that<00:03:07.170> he<00:03:07.290> did<00:03:07.470> have<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.709> be

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
projectile thing that he did have to be

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.830 
projectile thing that he did have to be
any<00:03:07.950> last<00:03:08.250> round<00:03:08.519> that's<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.330> only<00:03:09.510> time<00:03:09.690> he

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
any last round that's the only time he

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.259 
any last round that's the only time he
ever<00:03:09.870> uses<00:03:10.349> it<00:03:10.379> you'd<00:03:11.310> think<00:03:11.370> he<00:03:11.730> would<00:03:11.940> have

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
ever uses it you'd think he would have

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.119 
ever uses it you'd think he would have
started<00:03:12.840> this<00:03:13.140> round<00:03:13.410> with<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.680> two<00:03:13.860> were<00:03:14.010> at

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
living in double slam it's actually

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.470 
living in double slam it's actually
pretty<00:03:38.040> hard<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.310> dodge<00:03:39.560> Ken<00:03:41.480> increasing

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
pretty hard to dodge Ken increasing

pretty hard to dodge Ken increasing
difficulty<00:03:42.930> quite<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.140> bit<00:03:44.870> that<00:03:45.870> was<00:03:46.079> just<00:03:46.410> sad

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
difficulty quite a bit that was just sad

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.680 
difficulty quite a bit that was just sad
why<00:03:46.920> did<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.040> get<00:03:47.160> hit<00:03:47.310> by<00:03:47.430> that

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.570 

one<00:03:51.620> thing<00:03:51.770> I<00:03:51.860> do<00:03:51.920> want<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.190> say<00:03:52.340> is<00:03:52.460> they

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
one thing I do want to say is they

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.670 
one thing I do want to say is they
really<00:03:52.790> do<00:03:52.910> like<00:03:53.090> Missouri's<00:03:53.540> design<00:03:53.900> mainly

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
really do like Missouri's design mainly

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.490 
really do like Missouri's design mainly
because<00:03:55.070> it<00:03:55.160> makes<00:03:55.310> me<00:03:55.400> think<00:03:55.640> of<00:03:55.900> Diablo<00:03:56.900> from

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
because it makes me think of Diablo from

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.450 
because it makes me think of Diablo from
the<00:03:57.620> Diablo<00:03:57.950> games<00:03:59.410> just<00:04:00.410> a<00:04:00.590> lot<00:04:00.860> similarities

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
the Diablo games just a lot similarities

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:19.949 
the Diablo games just a lot similarities
but<00:04:04.460> I<00:04:04.490> think<00:04:04.760> it's<00:04:05.060> about<00:04:05.300> time<00:04:05.540> to<00:04:05.600> end<00:04:05.810> it

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.650 

and<00:04:20.959> that's<00:04:21.170> it<00:04:21.290> for<00:04:21.470> Mouser

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
and that's it for Mouser

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.090 
and that's it for Mouser
he's<00:04:23.660> actually<00:04:23.840> pretty<00:04:24.050> hard<00:04:24.350> I<00:04:24.560> got<00:04:24.770> stuck<00:04:25.010> on

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
he's actually pretty hard I got stuck on

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.430 
he's actually pretty hard I got stuck on
the<00:04:25.160> first<00:04:25.460> time<00:04:25.670> I<00:04:25.760> played<00:04:25.820> through<00:04:29.200> one<00:04:30.200> week
