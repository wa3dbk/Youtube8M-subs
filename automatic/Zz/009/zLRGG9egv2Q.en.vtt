thirteen centimeters long that's just
under<00:01:15.780> 41<00:01:16.440> inches<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.670> should<00:01:17.940> fit<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.330> the

4.2 kilos so it doesn't seem heavy to
carry<00:01:23.640> around<00:01:23.790> either<00:01:24.230> let's<00:01:25.230> have<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.410> quick

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
carry around either let's have a quick

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.490 
carry around either let's have a quick
look<00:01:25.740> at<00:01:25.890> how<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.190> works<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:27.540> seat<00:01:27.810> folds<00:01:28.290> down

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
look at how it works the seat folds down

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.460 
look at how it works the seat folds down
and<00:01:28.890> locks<00:01:29.220> into<00:01:29.490> position<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.840> legs<00:01:31.110> also

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
and locks into position the legs also

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.590 
and locks into position the legs also
lock<00:01:31.950> into<00:01:32.250> place<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.730> this<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.970> important<00:01:33.450> as

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
lock into place and this is important as

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.810 
lock into place and this is important as
if<00:01:33.750> like<00:01:33.960> me<00:01:34.260> you<00:01:34.800> tend<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> get<00:01:35.310> up<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.640> lot

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
if like me you tend to get up a lot

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.030 
if like me you tend to get up a lot
during<00:01:36.330> training<00:01:36.840> courses<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.530> either<00:01:37.800> use
