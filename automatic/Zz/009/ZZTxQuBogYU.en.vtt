 this tv an exit like this here is this 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.169
 and as such 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:19.169
 a CA 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.470
 So you connect another account. 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.470
 your computer, I do not know how it is 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.940
 after commenting vga cable from your computer and from the tv 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.379
 concerned with such 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.140
 Who's going to tell me if I'm produced? 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.350
 usually it is growing or it is happening 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.450
 the body recommends that the team chapel 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.090
 it's the beginning of the previous year 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.390
 is here 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.790
 is that of the rival goal 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.149
 so it ends up being one of the options 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.149
 provided by the then technician Ricardo Aguiar 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.060
 he lost one is for small margin only 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.740
 the loss of the mandate of the team mayor 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.880
 there is nothing 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.880
 I've always loved 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.810
 the image will look like the leg 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.200
 On TV 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.200
 if you choose the correct option 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.009
 everything that happens on one screen will happen practically that in the other 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.890
 the small river neighborhood issue 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.520
 You get two monitors. 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.240
 It's just a very important tip that I would like to highlight for you. 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.950
 when they arrived on Sunday you are left with two different monitors 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.640
 be very careful but if you pass the document you have an open program 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.350
 our tv when you take everything that few will take care of that 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.299
 program 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.109
 it will stand or lie 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.029
 identification will be issued by tvi 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:19.249
 so it's going to be very annoying you're going to have to be taken so you do not touch 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:20.719
 during the afternoon 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.339
 What does the room call the TV? 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:24.349
 so far 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.659
 The window from here to fall back to be able to walk again so much 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.279
 important when criminalizing 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:34.819
 inside the river back on the 15th 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.819

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.199
 O 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:45.289
 very well these other options that I never had to use much 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:48.289
 but by the way 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.599
 6th 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.619
 subway

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.319
 of what is the high 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.629

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.509
 will the workforce also 3 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:19.589

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:28.259
