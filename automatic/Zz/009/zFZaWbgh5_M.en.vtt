00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.530
 for everyone but especially for 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.510
 women have little wheezes happens to be 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.389
 a simple annoyance to become 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.520
 our worst nightmare if you what 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.619
 they tried everything and they can not reduce their 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.630
 waist move with the exercises that 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.579
 I am going to present you below are 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.140
 very easy to do and they will not be taken away 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.880
 a long time since they are part of a 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.309
 routine that do not take more than 10 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.300
 minutes let's discover it in the 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:32.300
 begin section 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.390
 effectively with the exercises that 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.890
 I'm going to show you're going to achieve a waist 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.870
 small and attractive let's make them 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.430
 for the first exercise we stopped with 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.700
 the legs separated and slightly 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.190
 flexed 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.230
 take some dumbbells and then go up the 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.050
 right arm while moving your torso 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.880
 towards the left side from the waist 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.030
 Your co should touch your hip every time 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.829
 lower your arm 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.199
 two movements of each side repeating 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.850
 ten times and then four movements 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.850
 on each side with the same repetition 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.200
 for the next exercise stop from 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.130
 new with the legs separated and a 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.130
 little bent 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.719
 between the hands are carried the 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.850
 arms at shoulder height without 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.679
 move legs or arms flex 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.530
 in se with the trunk to the side and 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.240
 then return to the center repeat now 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.680
 on the opposite side and back again in 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.870
 center 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.190
 with this will work the obliques that are 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.560
 the muscles on the sides of your 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.590
 abdomen do three sets of 10 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.689
 repetitions 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.799
 now they have their arms out to 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.799
 the height of your shoulders 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.479
 without moving legs or arms 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.180
 make circles with your waist as if 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.520
 had a hula hoop 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.710
 It is important that they do not go too fast 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.600
 but rather that they make them complete 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.570
 so that the muscles of the area work 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.210
 abdominal 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.810
 at 10 repetitions to one side and 10 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.810
 so the other 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.790
 next we will do exercises of 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.200
 waist twist for that they have to 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.150
 place a bar behind your 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.340
 neck that is resting on your shoulders 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.910
 your forearms should pass over 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.010
 the bar 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.020
 keeping the right back should 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.330
 rotate the upper body of a 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.810
 side to side without moving the feet first 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.520
 on one side and then on the other 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.520
 do 20 rotations per side 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.040
 the next exercise is also with the 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.710
 bar but instead of rotating we go down to a 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.690
 side and towards the other continuously 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.690
 do 20 repetitions per side 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.730
 for the next exercise they rest 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.860
 aim the arms sideways 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.840
 next to the legs and elevate the most 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.350
 that can the fact is that they should be 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.050
 well stretched 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.390
 from there take them to the side of being 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.640
 possible to touch the floor and then return 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.940
 in the center do the work towards the other 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.920
 side 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.430
 You can also do this exercise with 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.430
 the legs flexed 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.270
 again on the floor we reflect the 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.890
 knees and we put our hands to the 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.720
 head flexing the elbows 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.630
 now we take the right elbow to the 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.819
 left leg which rises to gala 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.410
 now on the other side 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.410
 these are crossed crunches 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.760
 for the last exercise we went to bed 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.610
 with arms extended to the sides 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.860
 of the body we lift our legs up 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.550
 at an angle of 90 degrees from the ground and 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.810
 we raise the shoulder blades at the same time 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.250
 we send our arms forward 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.710
 tightening the abs 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.470
 we inhale in five times and exhale 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.819
 also in 5 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.170
 we repeat for a minute 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.720
 what did these exercises seem like? 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.130
 they were very exhausting to achieve 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.410
 best results I recommend 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.539
 do it every day and there is something very 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.460
 important and from the waist before 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.680
 start doing them so that each 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.410
 week go see the changes this 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.660
 will help motivate each day more and clear 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.330
 always accompany him with an excellent 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.949
 food and lots of water do not forget that 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.350
 you can see them again on the page 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.300
 internet that is on your screen and already 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.710
 that we talk about food I do not know if 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.750
 you have heard about the root of 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.850
 ginger is a root that has 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.080
 great natural properties and that we 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.080
 provides mineral vitamins 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.370
 antioxidants and amino acids but what 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.289
 better is that with them you can 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.180
 prepare healthy and delicious drinks 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.260
 as we will see next in 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.260
 simple and healthy 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.650
 that's how ginger is a flavor root 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.510
 strong we could say that a little 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.250
 spicy but it has properties 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.560
 natural anti-inflammatory that help 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.600
 to fight diseases like the flu the 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.600
 arthrosis and is also auxiliary to 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.130
 combat some digestive problems 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.050
 here we are going to teach you how to prepare three 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.780
 delicious and healthy drinks with 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.790
 ginger 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.500
 the first is a ginger tea for 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.680
 inflammation of the throat and stomach 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.930
 to prepare it we need a piece of 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.990
 ginger root two cups of water 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.930
 boiled honey or brown sugar 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.120
 taste an apple 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.150
 and lemon if we want to give it a 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.949
 touch of flavor peel the ginger and what 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.380

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:50.710
 minutes we leave it there until it boils 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.330

 add a few drops of lemon 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.900
 the next is a ginger juice for 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.610
 the varicose veins since it helps the 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.599
 the blood circulation 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.729

 in the extractor we serve the juice that has 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:30.120
 taken finally we are going to prepare a 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.669
 sensitive juice to eliminate some 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.130

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.009
 ingredients and ready 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.990
 What is it
