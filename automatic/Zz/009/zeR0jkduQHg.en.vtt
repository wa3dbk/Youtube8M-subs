although<00:01:58.950> science<00:01:59.399> now<00:01:59.640> is<00:02:00.149> shifting<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.750> lot

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
although science now is shifting a lot

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.090 
although science now is shifting a lot
so<00:02:01.290> science<00:02:01.649> doesn't

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
so science doesn't

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.730 
so science doesn't
Methos<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.729> science<00:02:03.450> right<00:02:03.630> now<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.439> big

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
Methos in science right now the big

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.100 
Methos in science right now the big
thing<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.729> we<00:02:05.909> are<00:02:06.000> all<00:02:06.180> one<00:02:06.420> concept<00:02:06.960> that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
thing is the we are all one concept that

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.779 
thing is the we are all one concept that
they're<00:02:07.350> proving<00:02:07.710> all<00:02:07.830> over<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.190> place<00:02:08.429> I

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
they're proving all over the place I

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.600 
they're proving all over the place I
mean<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.450> there<00:02:10.140> all<00:02:10.410> sorts<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:11.009> films<00:02:11.489> are

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
mean and there all sorts of films are

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.229 
mean and there all sorts of films are
out<00:02:11.730> books<00:02:12.060> are<00:02:12.209> out<00:02:12.330> now<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:14.239> there's

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
out books are out now on that so there's

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.140 
out books are out now on that so there's
there's<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.630> lot<00:02:15.959> of<00:02:16.489> information<00:02:17.489> right<00:02:17.970> now

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
there's a lot of information right now

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.760 
there's a lot of information right now
if<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.600> want<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.840> get<00:02:18.930> me<00:02:19.050> for<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.290> science<00:02:19.620> of

what<00:02:37.200> what<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.739> that<00:02:38.400> separates<00:02:38.790> us<00:02:38.970> from

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
what what is it that separates us from

things what does the gift were gifted
with<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:44.300> say<00:02:46.160> what<00:02:47.160> separates<00:02:47.610> us<00:02:47.760> from

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
with I say what separates us from

with I say what separates us from
everybody<00:02:48.150> else<00:02:57.080> supposedly<00:02:58.080> what<00:02:58.680> science

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
everybody else supposedly what science

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.470 
everybody else supposedly what science
that<00:02:59.250> separates<00:02:59.790> us<00:02:59.880> from<00:02:59.940> everything<00:03:00.330> else

that separates us from everything else

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.960 
that separates us from everything else
is<00:03:00.750> our<00:03:01.110> ability<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.040> communicate<00:03:02.340> into

is our ability to communicate into

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.259 
is our ability to communicate into
things<00:03:03.380> well<00:03:04.380> how<00:03:05.310> well<00:03:05.519> would<00:03:05.700> we<00:03:05.760> score<00:03:06.120> on

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
things well how well would we score on

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:13.819 
things well how well would we score on
that<00:03:06.450> do<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.660> think<00:03:11.989> we<00:03:12.989> don't<00:03:13.140> score<00:03:13.530> very

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
that do you think we don't score very

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.979 
that do you think we don't score very
well<00:03:13.890> on<00:03:14.190> either<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.940> those<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.180> are<00:03:15.510> using

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
well on either of those and are using

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.170 
well on either of those and are using
our<00:03:16.140> ability<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.500> think<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:17.070> our<00:03:17.670> ability<00:03:18.150> to

our ability to think and our ability to

communicate we have verbal skills we

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.050 
communicate we have verbal skills we

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
definitely do that's all they're all

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.320

forms of communication that that they

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.910 
forms of communication that that they
use<00:03:47.540> but<00:03:48.230> they<00:03:48.349> also<00:03:48.530> communicate

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
use but they also communicate

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.160 
use but they also communicate
telepathically<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:50.660> only<00:03:50.870> thing<00:03:51.050> an

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
telepathically the only thing an

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.690 
telepathically the only thing an
interesting<00:03:51.650> thing<00:03:51.800> is<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.220> they

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
interesting thing is that they

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.890 
interesting thing is that they
communicate<00:03:52.880> telepathically<00:03:53.330> with

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
communicate telepathically with

communicate telepathically with
everything<00:03:54.500> around<00:03:54.620> them<00:03:55.010> all<00:03:55.700> living<00:03:56.239> beings

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
everything around them all living beings

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.460 
everything around them all living beings
except<00:03:57.530> us<00:03:57.890> who<00:03:58.700> feel<00:03:59.300> that<00:03:59.660> because<00:04:00.080> we<00:04:00.230> talk

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
except us who feel that because we talk

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.100 
except us who feel that because we talk
we<00:04:01.099> are<00:04:01.430> far<00:04:01.760> superior<00:04:01.970> to<00:04:02.300> everybody<00:04:02.720> and

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
we are far superior to everybody and

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.690 
we are far superior to everybody and
it's<00:04:03.290> actually<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.739> opposite<00:04:04.160> because<00:04:04.550> we

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
it's actually the opposite because we

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.750 
it's actually the opposite because we
talk<00:04:04.910> we<00:04:05.090> miss<00:04:05.360> 90%<00:04:06.110> of<00:04:06.200> what's<00:04:06.380> around<00:04:06.500> us<00:04:06.799> we

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
talk we miss 90% of what's around us we

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.210 
talk we miss 90% of what's around us we
really<00:04:08.120> missed<00:04:08.450> a<00:04:08.720> ton<00:04:09.230> of<00:04:09.290> communication

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
really missed a ton of communication

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.289 
really missed a ton of communication
because<00:04:10.340> we're<00:04:10.640> talking<00:04:10.819> all<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.269> time

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
because we're talking all the time

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.809 
because we're talking all the time
instead<00:04:11.900> of<00:04:12.049> listening<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:12.830> this<00:04:13.610> is

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
instead of listening and this is

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.210 
instead of listening and this is
something<00:04:14.209> that<00:04:14.600> we<00:04:14.840> have<00:04:15.049> been<00:04:15.500> taught<00:04:15.890> and

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
something that we have been taught and

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.250 
something that we have been taught and
we<00:04:16.489> have<00:04:16.700> learned<00:04:17.000> it's<00:04:17.479> something<00:04:17.840> that<00:04:17.959> we

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
we have learned it's something that we

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.330 
we have learned it's something that we
can<00:04:18.440> easily<00:04:19.070> change<00:04:20.979> listening<00:04:21.979> is<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.190> skill

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
can easily change listening is a skill

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.080 
can easily change listening is a skill
and<00:04:22.930> it<00:04:23.930> is<00:04:24.080> something<00:04:24.290> you<00:04:24.470> can<00:04:24.620> learn<00:04:24.910> but<00:04:25.910> we

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
and it is something you can learn but we

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.659 
and it is something you can learn but we
frequently<00:04:26.419> learn<00:04:27.040> most<00:04:28.040> of<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.250> time<00:04:28.430> we

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
frequently learn most of the time we

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.810 
frequently learn most of the time we
learn<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:29.210> listen<00:04:29.540> to<00:04:29.690> verbal<00:04:30.820> communication

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
learn to listen to verbal communication

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.129 
learn to listen to verbal communication
that's<00:04:32.090> what<00:04:32.240> we're<00:04:32.360> taught<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.600> listen<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:33.050> me

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
that's what we're taught to listen to me

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.770 
that's what we're taught to listen to me
we<00:04:33.260> don't<00:04:33.380> do<00:04:33.530> all<00:04:33.710> that<00:04:33.950> either<00:04:34.070> but<00:04:34.540> we<00:04:35.540> don't

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
we don't do all that either but we don't

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.440 
we don't do all that either but we don't
listen<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.560> silences<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:37.490> that's<00:04:38.240> where

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
listen to the silences and that's where

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.630 
listen to the silences and that's where
all<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.810> communications<00:04:39.470> are<00:04:39.620> coming<00:04:39.890> in<00:04:40.010> now

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
all the communications are coming in now

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.000 
all the communications are coming in now
the<00:04:40.700> great<00:04:41.000> thing<00:04:41.030> is<00:04:41.450> that<00:04:41.690> all<00:04:42.320> of<00:04:42.470> you<00:04:42.680> here

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
the great thing is that all of you here

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.760 
the great thing is that all of you here
and<00:04:43.490> anybody<00:04:43.880> I've<00:04:44.030> ever<00:04:44.060> met<00:04:44.300> is<00:04:45.110> naturally

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
and anybody I've ever met is naturally

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.320 
and anybody I've ever met is naturally
telepathic<00:04:46.490> so<00:04:46.640> I'm<00:04:46.729> not<00:04:46.850> going<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.060> have<00:04:47.210> to

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
telepathic so I'm not going to have to

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.969 
telepathic so I'm not going to have to
teach<00:04:47.510> you<00:04:47.630> how<00:04:47.660> to<00:04:47.900> be<00:04:48.200> telepathic<00:04:48.650> this

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
teach you how to be telepathic this

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.320 
teach you how to be telepathic this
weekend<00:04:49.310> that's<00:04:49.460> not<00:04:49.640> what<00:04:49.760> this<00:04:49.880> is<00:04:49.940> about

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
weekend that's not what this is about

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.990 
weekend that's not what this is about
but<00:04:51.169> hopefully<00:04:51.560> what<00:04:51.740> you<00:04:51.860> will<00:04:52.100> learn<00:04:52.340> is<00:04:52.970> how

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
but hopefully what you will learn is how

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.909 
but hopefully what you will learn is how
you<00:04:53.390> already<00:04:53.900> are<00:04:54.140> telepathic

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
you already are telepathic

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.830 
you already are telepathic
and<00:04:55.310> how<00:04:55.430> you<00:04:55.490> are<00:04:55.669> already<00:04:55.970> receiving<00:04:56.210> things

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
and how you are already receiving things

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.409 
and how you are already receiving things
because<00:04:57.560> you'd<00:04:57.710> all<00:04:57.979> do<00:04:58.220> and<00:04:58.460> it's<00:04:58.760> as<00:04:58.880> natural

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
because you'd all do and it's as natural

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.870 
because you'd all do and it's as natural
as<00:04:59.600> your<00:04:59.780> breathing<00:05:00.190> so<00:05:01.190> because<00:05:01.520> of<00:05:01.700> that

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
as your breathing so because of that

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.140 
as your breathing so because of that
it's<00:05:02.570> also<00:05:02.870> as<00:05:03.350> difficult<00:05:04.070> to<00:05:04.340> become<00:05:04.910> aware

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
it's also as difficult to become aware

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.659 
it's also as difficult to become aware
of<00:05:05.350> how<00:05:06.350> many<00:05:06.530> of<00:05:06.620> you<00:05:06.740> are<00:05:06.770> aware<00:05:07.039> of<00:05:07.190> every

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
of how many of you are aware of every

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.840 
of how many of you are aware of every
breath<00:05:07.850> you<00:05:07.910> take<00:05:09.220> I've<00:05:10.220> never<00:05:10.460> met<00:05:10.639> anybody

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
breath you take I've never met anybody

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.850 
breath you take I've never met anybody
that<00:05:11.060> is<00:05:11.330> you<00:05:11.780> can<00:05:11.990> really<00:05:12.110> focus<00:05:12.410> on<00:05:12.740> your

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
that is you can really focus on your

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.140 
that is you can really focus on your
breathing<00:05:13.039> and<00:05:13.460> that's<00:05:13.610> a<00:05:13.700> great<00:05:13.850> meditation

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
breathing and that's a great meditation

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.909 
breathing and that's a great meditation
er<00:05:14.479> that<00:05:14.600> means<00:05:14.780> you<00:05:15.110> can<00:05:15.229> really<00:05:15.440> focus<00:05:15.620> on

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
er that means you can really focus on

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.460 
er that means you can really focus on
your<00:05:16.010> breathing<00:05:16.190> and<00:05:16.580> you<00:05:17.539> can<00:05:17.750> you<00:05:18.050> can<00:05:18.229> train

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
your breathing and you can you can train

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.779 
your breathing and you can you can train
yourself<00:05:18.590> to<00:05:18.860> do<00:05:19.039> that<00:05:19.190> but<00:05:19.370> you<00:05:19.490> won't<00:05:19.610> do<00:05:19.760> it

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
yourself to do that but you won't do it

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:21.610 
yourself to do that but you won't do it
all<00:05:19.970> the<00:05:20.060> time<00:05:20.300> I<00:05:20.600> mean<00:05:20.870> breathing<00:05:21.229> is<00:05:21.320> just<00:05:21.500> an

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
all the time I mean breathing is just an

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.440 
all the time I mean breathing is just an
automatic<00:05:21.950> thing<00:05:22.280> right<00:05:22.550> so<00:05:22.880> it's<00:05:23.090> all<00:05:23.180> of<00:05:23.330> the

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
automatic thing right so it's all of the

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.770 
automatic thing right so it's all of the
time

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
time

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.120 
time
that<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:23.990> communication<00:05:24.590> that<00:05:24.680> comes<00:05:24.950> in

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
that the communication that comes in

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.330 
that the communication that comes in
you're<00:05:25.670> constantly<00:05:26.330> constantly<00:05:27.340> filtering

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
you're constantly constantly filtering

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.060 
you're constantly constantly filtering
it<00:05:28.730> in<00:05:28.910> and<00:05:29.840> where<00:05:30.020> that<00:05:30.230> plays<00:05:30.500> out<00:05:30.680> where<00:05:30.950> you

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
it in and where that plays out where you

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.550 
it in and where that plays out where you
hear<00:05:31.400> that<00:05:31.610> is<00:05:31.820> actually<00:05:32.330> within<00:05:32.780> the<00:05:33.020> own

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
hear that is actually within the own

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.129 
hear that is actually within the own
voice<00:05:33.889> your<00:05:34.310> own<00:05:34.430> voice<00:05:34.669> in<00:05:34.700> your<00:05:35.030> head<00:05:35.240> so<00:05:36.110> I

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
voice your own voice in your head so I

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:38.620 
voice your own voice in your head so I
assume<00:05:36.590> that<00:05:36.620> everybody<00:05:37.130> here<00:05:37.490> has<00:05:37.639> a<00:05:38.419> voice

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
assume that everybody here has a voice

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.330 
assume that everybody here has a voice
in<00:05:38.810> their<00:05:38.930> head<00:05:38.960> your<00:05:39.200> voice<00:05:39.440> right<00:05:39.650> you<00:05:40.160> think

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
in their head your voice right you think

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.490 
in their head your voice right you think
to<00:05:40.490> yourself<00:05:40.550> everybody<00:05:41.240> because<00:05:42.050> I<00:05:42.139> had<00:05:42.350> one

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
to yourself everybody because I had one

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.930 
to yourself everybody because I had one
of<00:05:42.590> our<00:05:42.650> chopper<00:05:42.860> one<00:05:43.130> person<00:05:43.490> insisted<00:05:43.910> that

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
of our chopper one person insisted that

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.390 
of our chopper one person insisted that
they<00:05:44.210> didn't<00:05:45.520> his<00:05:46.520> wife<00:05:47.230> said<00:05:48.230> just<00:05:49.160> kind<00:05:49.280> of

looking<00:05:50.050> and<00:05:51.400> by<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.460> end<00:05:52.700> of<00:05:52.820> two<00:05:53.060> days<00:05:53.380> I

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
looking and by the end of two days I

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:04.270

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
thought they'd have a voice in his head

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.350 
thought they'd have a voice in his head
and<00:06:04.790> as<00:06:05.919> his<00:06:06.919> wife<00:06:07.220> had<00:06:07.490> some<00:06:07.640> choice<00:06:07.940> comments

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
and as his wife had some choice comments

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.159 
and as his wife had some choice comments
make<00:06:10.390> so<00:06:11.390> that<00:06:11.540> was<00:06:11.630> his<00:06:11.720> big<00:06:11.930> breakthrough

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169
