00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello viewers of my channel today i 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.889
 would like to share those things 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.139
 which I bought for my knitting and so 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.560
 Perhaps I'll start with the tools and I wanted 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.520
 I would like to make a reservation right away what will happen 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.689
 Some of what I bought this month 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:30.320
 because half stupidly forgot to buy 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:31.560
 here and so will start the tools I bought 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:39.290

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:44.879
 sleeps circular can say so it 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:47.969
 number two number three and number five k 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:57.660
 Sorry, we have nothing in town 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:01:01.160
 needles here this is the company Byzantium yes except 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.229
 such spokes unfortunately in our city 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:10.200
 buy nothing at least how much i 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:14.490
 I did not find it, but I also bought myself 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.119
 hook number seven and with hooks we in 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.720
 the situation in the city is the same 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.790
 besides hooks firm gamma and here 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.740
 some unknown 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.240
 I unfortunately no longer saw hooks 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:37.740
 next let's go to 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:43.170
 yarn in the yard on February 23 and there was a lot 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.210
 purchased in connection with this 2 hinge from 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.270
 pehorka 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.530
 pehorka popular gray and such 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.420
 beautiful blue it will surely be 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:00.000
 my close defenders of the fatherland on 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:04.110
 gifts yarn is pretty good she 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.479
 I like it and I have not acquired it 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.479
 I remember what I was getting 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.970
 I knit a hat with a beard out of it 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.130
 actually this yarn me then 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:29.670
 I liked it because she 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:35.610
 pretty how to say pretty fat and 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:40.050
 she has a good composition of 50 percent wool 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:47.930
 50 percent acrylic as 33 meters and 100 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:51.540
 gram recommend knitting needles number six but 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.360
 for my how to say for my loose 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.970
 knitting even I would say number five 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:03.180
 Well so be stout and I see 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.740
 these threads knitting number 4 is obtained 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.370
 pretty tight 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:13.650
 she mittens the most it if of course I 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.720
 would take knit I do not know sweater I would 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:26.550
 of course I used probably needles number 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:29.820
 5 Well, this is not exactly further I bought here 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.610
 such a yarn, too, from infantry called 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.770
 children's novelty she won her 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.650
 I do not know the color of what she will do 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.700
 up to 100 percent acrylic and very yarn 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.700
 very budget 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:49.080
 so gently gently lilac 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:53.239
 gentle purple color most likely I 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:58.709
 I will knit for myself she squeaks and 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:01.220
 thread on whether you can see here or 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:08.730
 No, but I noticed that not. pretty 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:11.910
 uneven that is but no not everywhere 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:18.770
 of course you can just meet the plot 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:21.360
 where the threads are different thickness minutes 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:24.170
 I just have a drawing person 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:29.700
 eye viewer and very well developed therefore 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:34.500
 I notice all these braids so as Th 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:38.760
 say spokes number three is recommended so 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.920
 50 grams two hundred meters but at the very 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:47.190
 I will repeat that I conquered this 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:47.880
 color and tie life do not know soon 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.510
 Total 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:55.020
 but again because something for yourself 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:57.890
 last yarn strings too yarn from 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:03.630
 trinity this month I somehow 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:05.370
 unawareness deal persistently made porn 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.740
 domestic manufacturer 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.650
 but actually I liked the color 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.800
 again and I liked the fact that they drank 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:18.830
 ribbon such yarn ribbon I never 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:23.970
 still with this did not work here she is pleased 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:27.750
 I think quality one hundred percent 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.330
 cotton 170 meters per hundred grams what else 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.900
 they can be said but you had 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:37.050
 only two colors are presented such a rose 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.110
 wreaths and and so this blue stopped 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.270
 I am of course blue that I plan to knit 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:46.230
 from this yarn I plan to tie myself on 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:51.030
 summer tunic most likely on one shoulder 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:54.120
 or something like that 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.660
 but again this is just purely for yourself 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:01.580
 and on this my purchases are dedicated 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:07.710
 knitting this month finished 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:11.990
 I summarize it all I need so little 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:16.140
 spend more on your favorite hobby 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:20.790
 but basically I still wanted to buy 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:24.690
 Alize as she both so brilliant with 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:29.550
 I see the sequin 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:31.020
 general and I did not have enough yarn I wanted 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:36.930
 purchase but 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:43.740
 unfortunately but unfortunately I'm just stupid 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:46.590
 I forgot not and why again I repeat 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:50.099
 why so few to buy for the snip 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:54.860
 the simple reason is that from the family budget 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:56.639
 since i'm not a working loafer and 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:02.340
 I have a seed budget 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:06.240
 a certain amount of money and that money i 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:15.169
 I spend on exactly what you need specifically 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:21.990
 me and so since i spent 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:24.180
 a little bit of yarn left me and I 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:29.280
 You can say so even more somewhere 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:33.379
 and it happened that this is all that came out in 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:36.090
 overall roughly speaking to my good husband 

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:39.270
 periodically do me some 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:43.259
 gifts and meets me and we are with him 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:45.479
 sometimes he takes me by the hand 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:47.940
 go yarn shop choose something 

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:51.509
 such a direct wow this can happen 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:54.440
 in the middle of the month and that is a huge 

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:57.509
 thanks, by the way, honey, thank you 

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.750
