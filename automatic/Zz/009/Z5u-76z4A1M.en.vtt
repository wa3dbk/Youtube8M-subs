00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
apparently me and my friend will not be

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.530 
apparently me and my friend will not be
doing<00:06:15.320> the<00:06:15.770> bean<00:06:15.890> boozled<00:06:16.310> challenge<00:06:16.540> the

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
doing the bean boozled challenge the

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.450 
doing the bean boozled challenge the
reason<00:06:18.020> why<00:06:18.140> we're<00:06:18.410> not<00:06:18.440> gonna<00:06:18.830> be<00:06:19.040> doing<00:06:19.190> it

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
reason why we're not gonna be doing it

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.870 
reason why we're not gonna be doing it
is<00:06:19.610> because<00:06:20.830> last<00:06:21.830> time<00:06:21.980> we<00:06:22.100> did<00:06:22.370> it<00:06:22.400> we<00:06:22.850> got

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
is because last time we did it we got

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.680 
is because last time we did it we got
sick<00:06:23.780> Shanna<00:06:24.290> didn't<00:06:24.890> go<00:06:25.010> well<00:06:25.250> with<00:06:25.400> us

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
sick Shanna didn't go well with us

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.820 
sick Shanna didn't go well with us
because<00:06:26.690> the<00:06:26.810> jelly<00:06:27.020> beans<00:06:27.260> were<00:06:27.410> apparently

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
because the jelly beans were apparently

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.070 
because the jelly beans were apparently
expired<00:06:28.400> and<00:06:30.070> another<00:06:31.070> thing<00:06:31.600> on<00:06:32.600> the<00:06:32.810> bright

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
expired and another thing on the bright

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.870 
expired and another thing on the bright
side<00:06:33.110> since<00:06:34.040> we're<00:06:34.250> gonna<00:06:34.370> be<00:06:34.460> doing<00:06:34.760> that

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
side since we're gonna be doing that

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.840 
side since we're gonna be doing that
challenge<00:06:35.570> we<00:06:36.110> will<00:06:36.260> be<00:06:36.440> willing<00:06:36.830> to<00:06:37.070> do<00:06:37.280> some
