00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
way if I even that it could have just

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:23.110 
way if I even that it could have just
been<00:06:15.020> appointed<00:06:21.430> right<00:06:22.430> that's<00:06:22.880> it<00:06:23.000> goes

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
been appointed right that's it goes

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.790 
been appointed right that's it goes
really<00:06:23.330> simple<00:06:23.840> really<00:06:24.080> easy<00:06:24.230> it<00:06:24.500> really<00:06:24.680> just

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
really simple really easy it really just

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.080 
really simple really easy it really just
depends<00:06:25.070> on<00:06:25.190> your<00:06:25.280> style<00:06:25.640> how<00:06:25.940> you're

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
depends on your style how you're

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.090 
depends on your style how you're
presenting<00:06:26.300> it<00:06:26.750> but<00:06:27.350> you<00:06:27.710> know<00:06:27.830> the<00:06:27.920> way<00:06:28.070> I

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
presenting it but you know the way I

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.950 
presenting it but you know the way I
would<00:06:28.460> do<00:06:28.610> it<00:06:28.790> you<00:06:29.420> know<00:06:29.510> you<00:06:29.630> might<00:06:29.780> look<00:06:29.900> the

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
would do it you know you might look the

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.450 
would do it you know you might look the
way<00:06:30.110> Jess<00:06:30.320> doesn't<00:06:30.680> the<00:06:30.740> way<00:06:30.830> I<00:06:30.860> might<00:06:31.130> do<00:06:31.310> it

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
way Jess doesn't the way I might do it

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.580 
way Jess doesn't the way I might do it
is<00:06:31.640> when<00:06:32.090> I<00:06:32.120> force<00:06:32.420> the<00:06:32.630> cards<00:06:32.930> to<00:06:33.170> them<00:06:33.380> I

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
is when I force the cards to them I

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.950 
is when I force the cards to them I
probably<00:06:34.070> wouldn't<00:06:34.400> even<00:06:34.550> that's<00:06:34.880> the<00:06:35.000> Jack<00:06:35.270> I

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
probably wouldn't even that's the Jack I

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.140 
probably wouldn't even that's the Jack I
probably<00:06:36.320> get<00:06:36.500> them<00:06:36.680> to<00:06:36.950> hold<00:06:37.400> two<00:06:37.730> cards<00:06:38.030> in

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
probably get them to hold two cards in

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.540 
probably get them to hold two cards in
their<00:06:38.300> hands<00:06:38.720> and<00:06:38.840> say<00:06:39.260> you<00:06:40.100> know<00:06:40.190> let's<00:06:40.400> hold

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550
