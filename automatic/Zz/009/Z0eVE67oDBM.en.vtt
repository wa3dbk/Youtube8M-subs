there<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.920> think<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:20.640> strikes<00:01:21.000> me<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.390> that

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
there I think what strikes me is that

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.990 
there I think what strikes me is that
EBS<00:01:22.799> was<00:01:23.009> probably<00:01:23.400> one<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> first

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
EBS was probably one of the first

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.929 
EBS was probably one of the first
institutions<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.930> really<00:01:25.259> marry<00:01:25.939> languages

with<00:01:27.360> business<00:01:27.810> skills<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> business

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
with business skills with a business

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.950 
with business skills with a business
course<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.850> not<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.180> put<00:01:30.630> them<00:01:30.720> alongside

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.660 
course but not just put them alongside
each<00:01:31.320> other<00:01:31.439> but<00:01:31.710> actually<00:01:31.799> intertwine<00:01:32.460> them
