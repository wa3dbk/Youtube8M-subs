 hello here is the second part of the 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.790
 series on decoration of pencils 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.290
 this time we will decorate our 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.120
 pencils with thread and newspaper 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.790
 among other materials 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.830
 I was used wooden pens and 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.070
 first of all I deleted the brand 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.110
 with acetone to make this design 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.780
 He used thread and a pencil was painted with 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.440
 nail polish when the painting of 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.120
 Nails beech dried cut a piece of yarn 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.520
 place one end of the thread in 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.970
 the tip of the pencil and white glue 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.970
 about him 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.309
 after turning it around 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.309
 pen 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.380
 in the lower part it rolls the thread 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.950
 giving two or three laps and fixing it with 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.950
 glue 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.060
 place another thread and follow the same 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.360
 steps but orienting it to the side 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.360
 opposite 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.590
 then cut the leftover ends 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.600
 to finish on the surface of the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.940
 pencil the thread with white glue enamel 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.340
 Transparent nails or varnish 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.770

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.110
 pencil of the color that you prefer always 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.940
 let it be a clear tone too 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.940
 you will need a newspaper sheet 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.260
 impregnates a piece of cotton with 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.260
 alcohol and pass it on the sheet 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.610

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.520
 press and unwind 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.800
 the letters will be printed on the 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:19.550
 pencil to fix them better covers the 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:21.680
 surface with transparent varnish for 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.530
 do this third design you will need a 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.450

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.190
 marker on a square of the handkerchief 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.190
 and form the design you prefer 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.130
 then cut out the box and separate the 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.130
 panel layers 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.770
 cut strips of approximately 15 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.030
 centimeters uses white glue to 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.190
 stick those strips on the pencil 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.350
 Check to make some glue on 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.770
 the wood and sticks one end of 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.770
 strip 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.650
 covers the rest of the strip with comma 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.280
 when you have covered the entire surface 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.030
 wait you sic and then you can sharpen it 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.030

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.700
 the procedure is similar to the previous 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.689
 cut out strips of paper and stick it on the 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.689
