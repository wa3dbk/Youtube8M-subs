00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840 

I<00:00:00.329> don't<00:00:01.230> talk<00:00:01.410> about<00:00:01.530> a<00:00:01.680> really<00:00:02.129> basic<00:00:02.310> but

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
I don't talk about a really basic but

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.390 
I don't talk about a really basic but
really<00:00:03.360> fundamental<00:00:04.049> aspect<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:04.740> modo<00:00:05.009> and

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
really fundamental aspect of modo and

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.099 
really fundamental aspect of modo and
that<00:00:05.609> is<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.850> difference<00:00:06.210> between<00:00:06.299> item<00:00:06.899> mode

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
that is the difference between item mode

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.530 
that is the difference between item mode
and<00:00:07.350> component<00:00:08.010> mode<00:00:08.160> in<00:00:08.580> modo<00:00:09.120> there's<00:00:09.450> this

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
and component mode in modo there's this

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.780 
and component mode in modo there's this
really<00:00:09.840> wonderful<00:00:10.139> ability<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:11.099> always<00:00:11.429> be

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
really wonderful ability to always be

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.310 
really wonderful ability to always be
able<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.059> directly<00:00:12.599> access<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.710> select<00:00:14.099> the

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
able to directly access and select the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.650 
able to directly access and select the
polygons<00:00:16.320> edges<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.369> vertices<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:18.119> make<00:00:18.480> up

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
polygons edges and vertices that make up

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.140 
polygons edges and vertices that make up
your<00:00:18.810> mesh<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:20.310> don't<00:00:20.550> have<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.880> go<00:00:21.000> into

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
your mesh and you don't have to go into

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.120 
your mesh and you don't have to go into
some<00:00:21.449> kind<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.810> special<00:00:22.140> sub-object<00:00:22.980> mode

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
some kind of special sub-object mode

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.970 
some kind of special sub-object mode
like<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.490> do<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.789> some<00:00:24.060> programs<00:00:24.890> but<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
like you do in some programs but the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.700 
like you do in some programs but the
problem<00:00:26.279> with<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.619> to<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
problem with that is that to the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.550 
problem with that is that to the
untrained<00:00:28.859> eye<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.340> might<00:00:29.670> look<00:00:29.820> as<00:00:30.000> if<00:00:30.560> item

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
untrained eye it might look as if item

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.920 
untrained eye it might look as if item
mode<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.099> polygon<00:00:32.579> mode<00:00:32.790> or<00:00:33.149> one<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> same

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
mode and polygon mode or one on the same

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.540 
mode and polygon mode or one on the same
thing<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.530> they're<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:34.920> they're<00:00:35.340> very

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
thing but they're not they're very

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.610 
thing but they're not they're very
different<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.329> i'm<00:00:36.719> going<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.020> show<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.290> why

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
different and i'm going to show you why

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.170 
different and i'm going to show you why
so<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> first<00:00:38.219> thing<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.430> need<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.610> do<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.030> hit

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
so the first thing you need to do is hit

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.869 
so the first thing you need to do is hit
leo<00:00:39.360> key<00:00:39.750> on<00:00:39.840> your<00:00:39.870> keyboard<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.680> go<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> show

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
leo key on your keyboard and go to show

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.150 
leo key on your keyboard and go to show
centers<00:00:42.390> selected<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.290> now<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.129> see

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
centers selected and now you can see

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.740 
centers selected and now you can see
it's<00:00:44.489> drawn<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> center<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.420> middle<00:00:45.690> of

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
it's drawn the center in the middle of

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.860 
it's drawn the center in the middle of
my<00:00:45.809> mesh<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.399> am<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:48.059> I'm<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.510> polygon

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.840 
my mesh now if I am if I'm in polygon
mode<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.920> modo<00:00:50.129> when<00:00:50.399> nothing<00:00:50.760> is

selected<00:00:51.000> everything<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.750> selected<00:00:52.230> I

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
selected everything is selected I

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.209 
selected everything is selected I
activate<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> move<00:00:53.520> tool<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.539> move<00:00:55.219> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
activate the move tool and I move the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.430 
activate the move tool and I move the
mesh<00:00:56.430> over<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.420> can<00:00:57.600> see<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> center

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
mesh over you can see that the center

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.310 
mesh over you can see that the center
stays<00:00:58.800> where<00:00:59.129> where<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.879> however<00:01:00.840> let<00:01:01.230> me

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
stays where where it is however let me

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.290 
stays where where it is however let me
just<00:01:01.500> undo<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:01.980> action<00:01:02.190> if<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
just undo this action if I was to do the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.660 
just undo this action if I was to do the
same<00:01:03.539> thing<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.140> item<00:01:04.650> mode<00:01:04.860> select<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> mesh

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
same thing in item mode select the mesh

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.780 
same thing in item mode select the mesh
and<00:01:06.200> move<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.320> over<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.490> takes

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
and move it over you can see it takes

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.260 
and move it over you can see it takes
the<00:01:09.030> center<00:01:09.720> with<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:11.060> that's<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the center with it so that's the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.660 
the center with it so that's the
fundamental<00:01:12.450> difference<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.950> modo

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
fundamental difference and a modo

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.370 
fundamental difference and a modo
basically<00:01:15.299> component<00:01:15.900> mode<00:01:16.020> which<00:01:16.350> is

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
basically component mode which is

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.550 
basically component mode which is
polygon<00:01:17.040> edges<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.820> vertices<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.840> reserved

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
polygon edges and vertices is reserved

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.980 
polygon edges and vertices is reserved
for<00:01:19.740> modeling<00:01:20.610> operations<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.780> should

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
for modeling operations and you should

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.520 
for modeling operations and you should
not<00:01:22.380> do<00:01:23.040> modeling<00:01:23.939> transformed<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.869> item<00:01:25.320> mode

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
not do modeling transformed in item mode

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.640 
not do modeling transformed in item mode
item<00:01:26.340> mode<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:27.330> things<00:01:27.960> like<00:01:28.200> scene

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
item mode is for things like scene

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.210 
item mode is for things like scene
layout<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.479> animation<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.100> imagine<00:01:32.100> if

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
layout and animation and imagine if

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.219 
layout and animation and imagine if
you'd<00:01:32.460> brought<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.240> mesh<00:01:33.750> from<00:01:33.930> another

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
you'd brought in a mesh from another

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.969 
you'd brought in a mesh from another
application<00:01:34.710> such<00:01:35.189> as<00:01:35.220> ZBrush<00:01:36.180> or<00:01:36.390> Maya<00:01:36.630> and

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
application such as ZBrush or Maya and

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.429 
application such as ZBrush or Maya and
you<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.369> performed<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.180> transform<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.049> item

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
you you performed a transform in item

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.560 
you you performed a transform in item
mode<00:01:40.650> or<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.280> would<00:01:41.430> happen<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.329> would

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
mode or what would happen is it would

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.149 
mode or what would happen is it would
move<00:01:42.810> your<00:01:42.990> pivot<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.710> when<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.950> brought

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
move your pivot so that when you brought

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.590 
move your pivot so that when you brought
your<00:01:44.340> mesh<00:01:44.549> back<00:01:44.850> into<00:01:45.210> your<00:01:45.329> other

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
your mesh back into your other

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.990 
your mesh back into your other
application<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.920> pivot<00:01:47.310> would<00:01:47.490> move<00:01:47.700> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
application the pivot would move and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.460 
application the pivot would move and
that<00:01:48.060> your<00:01:48.420> whole<00:01:48.630> geometry<00:01:48.960> would<00:01:49.350> have

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
that your whole geometry would have

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.080 
that your whole geometry would have
shifted<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.009> another<00:01:50.040> place<00:01:50.549> it'd<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:50.939> even

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
shifted to another place it'd be even

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.030 
shifted to another place it'd be even
worse<00:01:51.360> if<00:01:51.630> you'd<00:01:51.750> scaled<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.290> or<00:01:52.409> rotated<00:01:52.950> it

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
worse if you'd scaled it or rotated it

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.350 
worse if you'd scaled it or rotated it
you'd<00:01:53.189> get<00:01:53.369> very<00:01:53.640> unpredictable<00:01:54.060> results

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
you'd get very unpredictable results

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.039 
you'd get very unpredictable results
another<00:01:57.360> thing<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.630> should<00:01:57.840> know<00:01:58.020> about

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
another thing you should know about

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.050 
another thing you should know about
motor<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.740> when<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:58.979> create<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> new<00:01:59.340> mesh<00:01:59.670> item

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
motor is when you create a new mesh item

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.760 
motor is when you create a new mesh item
it's<00:02:00.240> always<00:02:00.509> going<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> create<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.290> item

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
it's always going to create the item

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.620 
it's always going to create the item
center<00:02:02.189> at<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.340> world<00:02:02.640> center<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.240> if<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.479> hit

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
center at the world center so if I hit

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.080 
center at the world center so if I hit
end<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.229> create<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> new<00:02:04.649> match<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:05.759> see

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
end to create a new match you can see

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.869 
end to create a new match you can see
it's<00:02:06.500> set<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> world<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.069> item<00:02:08.429> center<00:02:08.789> in

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
it's set the world the item center in

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.130 
it's set the world the item center in
the<00:02:08.940> world<00:02:08.970> center<00:02:09.539> right<00:02:09.780> there<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
the world center right there in the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.559 
the world center right there in the
middle

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
middle

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.039 
middle
and<00:02:10.659> so<00:02:11.290> if<00:02:11.409> you<00:02:11.530> draw<00:02:11.739> your<00:02:11.890> geometry<00:02:12.900> here<00:02:13.900> in

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
and so if you draw your geometry here in

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.509 
and so if you draw your geometry here in
the<00:02:14.200> Otherworld<00:02:14.709> centered<00:02:15.189> and<00:02:15.340> that's

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
the Otherworld centered and that's

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:16.709 
the Otherworld centered and that's
absolutely<00:02:15.819> fine<00:02:15.999> it's<00:02:16.239> not<00:02:16.359> going<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.599> be<00:02:16.689> a

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:16.719 
absolutely fine it's not going to be a

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.459 
absolutely fine it's not going to be a
problem<00:02:16.980> but<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:19.510> might<00:02:19.689> find<00:02:19.930> yourself<00:02:20.079> let

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:20.469 
problem but you might find yourself let

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:22.770 
problem but you might find yourself let
me<00:02:20.499> just<00:02:20.709> turn<00:02:20.889> this<00:02:20.950> mesh<00:02:21.310> on<00:02:21.489> where<00:02:22.150> I'm<00:02:22.420> you

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
me just turn this mesh on where I'm you

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.220 
me just turn this mesh on where I'm you
create<00:02:23.109> a<00:02:23.139> new<00:02:23.230> item<00:02:23.499> and<00:02:24.840> you're<00:02:25.840> adding<00:02:26.109> to

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
create a new item and you're adding to

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.039 
create a new item and you're adding to
an<00:02:26.319> existing<00:02:26.530> mesh<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:28.299> say<00:02:28.569> draw<00:02:28.870> out<00:02:29.019> a

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
an existing mesh so you say draw out a

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.459 
an existing mesh so you say draw out a
cylinder<00:02:29.620> somewhere<00:02:30.370> out<00:02:30.400> here<00:02:30.549> and<00:02:31.409> let<00:02:32.409> me

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469 
cylinder somewhere out here and let me

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.140 
cylinder somewhere out here and let me
just<00:02:32.650> drop<00:02:32.799> the<00:02:32.920> tool<00:02:33.159> hide<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:33.730> car<00:02:33.969> again

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
just drop the tool hide the car again

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.759 
just drop the tool hide the car again
you<00:02:34.689> can<00:02:34.810> see<00:02:34.870> what's<00:02:35.139> happened<00:02:35.560> you've

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
you can see what's happened you've

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.520 
you can see what's happened you've
created<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.370> geometry<00:02:37.239> out<00:02:37.269> here<00:02:37.419> but<00:02:38.379> your

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
created the geometry out here but your

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.470 
created the geometry out here but your
item<00:02:38.859> Center<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.370> here<00:02:39.639> so<00:02:39.879> if<00:02:39.969> you<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.239> go<00:02:40.359> into

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
item Center is here so if you to go into

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.209 
item Center is here so if you to go into
item<00:02:40.930> mode<00:02:41.169> and<00:02:41.499> select<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.859> rotate<00:02:41.980> tool

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:42.219 
item mode and select the rotate tool

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.729 
item mode and select the rotate tool
well<00:02:43.180> that's<00:02:43.599> probably<00:02:44.049> not<00:02:44.169> what<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.409> want

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
well that's probably not what you want

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.459 
well that's probably not what you want
and<00:02:45.069> so<00:02:45.909> how<00:02:46.120> do<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.329> fix<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:46.719> it's<00:02:47.019> really

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:47.469 
and so how do you fix this it's really

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.409 
and so how do you fix this it's really
simple<00:02:47.709> first<00:02:48.579> of<00:02:48.699> all<00:02:48.790> make<00:02:48.969> sure<00:02:49.180> you're<00:02:49.359> in

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:49.419 
simple first of all make sure you're in

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.360 
simple first of all make sure you're in
item<00:02:49.719> mode<00:02:49.930> otherwise<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.439> won't<00:02:50.620> work<00:02:50.680> go<00:02:51.310> to

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
item mode otherwise it won't work go to

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.209 
item mode otherwise it won't work go to
edit<00:02:52.169> center<00:02:53.169> to<00:02:53.290> bounding<00:02:53.680> box<00:02:53.889> and<00:02:54.129> you<00:02:54.189> can

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:54.219 
edit center to bounding box and you can

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.129 
edit center to bounding box and you can
see<00:02:54.489> there's<00:02:54.669> a<00:02:54.760> bunch<00:02:54.969> of<00:02:55.120> options<00:02:55.299> here<00:02:55.569> you

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
see there's a bunch of options here you

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.080 
see there's a bunch of options here you
probably<00:02:56.439> want<00:02:56.709> Center<00:02:57.159> and<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.430> can<00:02:57.730> see<00:02:57.939> the

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
probably want Center and you can see the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.640 
probably want Center and you can see the
center<00:02:58.419> is<00:02:58.480> now<00:02:58.599> jumped<00:02:59.079> to<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.379> middle<00:02:59.620> of

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
center is now jumped to the middle of

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.860 
center is now jumped to the middle of
the<00:02:59.709> mesh<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.280> now<00:03:00.849> if<00:03:01.060> I<00:03:01.150> select<00:03:01.329> my<00:03:01.480> rotate

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
the mesh and now if I select my rotate

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.089 
the mesh and now if I select my rotate
tool<00:03:02.139> that's<00:03:02.980> exactly<00:03:03.609> what<00:03:04.449> I<00:03:04.480> want<00:03:04.689> it<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.780> do

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
tool that's exactly what I want it to do

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.470 
tool that's exactly what I want it to do
the<00:03:06.099> other<00:03:06.250> thing<00:03:06.489> is<00:03:06.639> you<00:03:06.669> can<00:03:06.969> actually<00:03:07.000> move

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
the other thing is you can actually move

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.869 
the other thing is you can actually move
the<00:03:07.540> center<00:03:08.010> manually<00:03:09.010> if<00:03:09.159> you<00:03:09.280> want<00:03:09.519> so<00:03:09.790> if

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
the center manually if you want so if

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.759 
the center manually if you want so if
you<00:03:10.030> find<00:03:10.359> the<00:03:10.540> item<00:03:10.989> button<00:03:11.230> in<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.590> toolbar

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
you find the item button in the toolbar

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.729 
you find the item button in the toolbar
click<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.579> hold<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:13.000> until<00:03:13.269> you<00:03:13.449> get<00:03:13.739> center

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
click and hold it until you get center

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.219 
click and hold it until you get center
and<00:03:14.979> now<00:03:15.009> you<00:03:15.699> can<00:03:16.030> select<00:03:16.209> that<00:03:16.449> Center<00:03:16.989> and

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:17.229 
and now you can select that Center and

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.460 
and now you can select that Center and
move<00:03:17.919> it<00:03:18.129> rotate<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.299> whatever<00:03:20.139> you<00:03:20.199> want<00:03:20.319> to

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
move it rotate it whatever you want to

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.920 
move it rotate it whatever you want to
do<00:03:20.650> i<00:03:20.859> drop<00:03:21.489> that<00:03:21.729> and<00:03:22.030> go<00:03:22.120> back<00:03:22.299> into<00:03:22.329> item

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
do i drop that and go back into item

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.499 
do i drop that and go back into item
mode<00:03:23.560> you<00:03:24.250> can<00:03:24.280> see<00:03:24.609> now<00:03:24.819> if<00:03:24.939> activate<00:03:25.419> the

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:25.509 
mode you can see now if activate the

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:27.569 
mode you can see now if activate the
rotate<00:03:25.840> tool<00:03:25.870> that's<00:03:26.769> where<00:03:27.009> the<00:03:27.099> transform

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
rotate tool that's where the transform

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.670 
rotate tool that's where the transform
is<00:03:27.669> going<00:03:27.819> to<00:03:27.879> take<00:03:28.060> place<00:03:28.090> from<00:03:28.540> okay<00:03:29.470> I<00:03:29.500> hope

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
is going to take place from okay I hope

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.020 
is going to take place from okay I hope
