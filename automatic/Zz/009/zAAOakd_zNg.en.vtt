don't<00:01:12.000> give<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> right<00:01:12.479> perspective<00:01:13.970> ok<00:01:14.970> so

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
don't give the right perspective ok so

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.370 
don't give the right perspective ok so
look<00:01:15.560> it's<00:01:16.560> jam-packed<00:01:17.390> with<00:01:18.390> cards<00:01:18.810> see<00:01:19.259> all

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
look it's jam-packed with cards see all

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.030 
look it's jam-packed with cards see all
the<00:01:19.470> cards<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.890> there<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:22.380> let's<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.799> see<00:01:22.950> if

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the cards in there so let's just see if

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.039 
the cards in there so let's just see if
we<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.310> squeeze<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.759> few<00:01:24.060> out<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:27.049> it's

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
we can squeeze a few out of here it's

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.380 
we can squeeze a few out of here it's
hard<00:01:28.290> it's<00:01:28.680> hard<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.920> get<00:01:29.070> them<00:01:29.159> out<00:01:29.390> without

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
hard it's hard to get them out without

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.390 
hard it's hard to get them out without
flipping<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> whole<00:01:31.229> board<00:01:31.560> which<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.220> what<00:01:32.369> I

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
flipping the whole board which is what I

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.810 
flipping the whole board which is what I
can<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:32.909> but<00:01:33.090> let's<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.479> wait<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.700> let's<00:01:35.909> see

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
can do but let's just wait so let's see

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.520 
can do but let's just wait so let's see
so<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:40.140> you're<00:01:40.350> making<00:01:41.420> this<00:01:42.530> is

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
so this is what you're making this is

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.310 
so this is what you're making this is
the<00:01:43.920> solution<00:01:44.630> int<00:01:45.630> 1<00:01:46.079> &amp;<00:01:46.680> 2<00:01:47.399> okay

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
the solution int 1 &amp; 2 okay

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.080 
the solution int 1 &amp; 2 okay
here's<00:01:49.320> what<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.590> looks<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:49.979> now<00:01:50.939> you're

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
here's what it looks like now you're

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.319 
here's what it looks like now you're
probably<00:01:51.299> all<00:01:51.479> saying<00:01:52.790> if<00:01:53.790> you're<00:01:54.000> gonna<00:01:54.060> do

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329

one and I'm gonna say absolutely
unequivocally<00:01:57.240> no<00:01:57.630> I'm<00:01:58.079> not<00:01:58.320> because<00:01:59.570> you

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
unequivocally no I'm not because you

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.330 
unequivocally no I'm not because you
know<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> video<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.500> probably<00:02:01.920> screw<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.250> up

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
know in the video I probably screw it up

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.040 
but look if I'm looking at this I have
to<00:02:05.340> make<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.719> can<00:02:06.960> kind<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.409> maybe

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
to make that so you can kind of maybe

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.479 
to make that so you can kind of maybe
put<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.229> together<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.340> don't

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
put this together but you just don't

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.550 
put this together but you just don't
know<00:02:11.730> till<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.090> actually<00:02:12.300> get<00:02:12.720> near<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
know till you actually get near the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.420 
know till you actually get near the
and<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.370> puzzle<00:02:15.590> so<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.650> kind<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.069> see<00:02:17.250> that

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
and of the puzzle so I kind of see that

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.000 
and of the puzzle so I kind of see that
in<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.819> upper<00:02:17.970> left<00:02:18.390> corner<00:02:18.660> yeah<00:02:19.530> give<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.980> a

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
in the upper left corner yeah give you a

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.130 
in the upper left corner yeah give you a
down<00:02:20.340> perspective<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.660> kind<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.930> see

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
down perspective so you can kind of see

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.030 
down perspective so you can kind of see
this<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.349> little<00:02:22.650> differently<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:25.040> remember

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
this a little differently so remember

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.000 
this a little differently so remember
that<00:02:26.220> was<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.319> looks<00:02:28.349> like<00:02:28.650> there's<00:02:28.890> a

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
that was that so it looks like there's a

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.180 
that was that so it looks like there's a
square<00:02:29.489> e<00:02:29.520> triangle<00:02:30.239> here<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:31.349> this<00:02:31.530> direction

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
square e triangle here in this direction

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.030 
square e triangle here in this direction
and<00:02:32.910> then<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:33.450> here<00:02:36.260> so<00:02:37.260> we're<00:02:37.440> kind<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.830> you

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.789 
is there an expert out there I'm sure
there<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.680> how<00:02:47.670> many<00:02:47.880> ways<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.120> do<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.709> it

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
there is how many ways to do it and it

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.500 
there is how many ways to do it and it
looks<00:02:49.950> like<00:02:50.100> there's<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.370> piece<00:02:50.549> here<00:02:50.910> like

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
looks like there's a piece here like

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.800 
looks like there's a piece here like
this<00:02:51.780> no<00:02:52.590> that's<00:02:52.799> not<00:02:53.100> there<00:02:53.480> I've<00:02:54.480> already

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
this no that's not there I've already

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.580 
this no that's not there I've already
messed<00:02:54.989> up<00:02:56.239> okay<00:02:57.239> see<00:02:58.019> I<00:02:58.760> stink

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
messed up okay see I stink

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.520 
messed up okay see I stink
so<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.769> that<00:03:01.799> piece<00:03:02.310> then<00:03:03.209> another<00:03:03.989> triangle

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
so is that piece then another triangle

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.210 
so is that piece then another triangle
piece<00:03:04.860> like<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:07.560> triangle<00:03:07.860> piece

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
piece like that and a triangle piece

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.449 
piece like that and a triangle piece
like<00:03:08.489> that<00:03:09.200> then<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.230> square<00:03:11.750> then<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:13.459> see

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
like that then a square then this see

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.539 
like that then a square then this see
how<00:03:14.549> that<00:03:14.790> helps<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.299> guess<00:03:15.780> I'm<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:15.989> youngster

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
how that helps I guess I'm a youngster

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.009 
how that helps I guess I'm a youngster
not<00:03:17.549> good<00:03:17.790> at<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.150> but<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:18.329> can<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.750> imagine

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
not good at it but you can you imagine

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.479 
not good at it but you can you imagine
trying<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.680> figure<00:03:19.950> out<00:03:19.980> some<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.370> these

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489
