00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910
 to 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:08.690
 if we told you it's fast we 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.879
 We would be lying because it flies 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:15.309
 from Beijing we bring you a first 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:17.450
 look at the gigabyte xx 99 m gaming 5 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.039
 brings endless news and 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.810
 characteristics so we will try 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.570
 break them down without losing your head for 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.610
 the road all this is what comes to us 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.320
 in the box of the motherboard we have for 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.989
 one side of the cable for presley with 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.239
 nvidia graphics cards we have for 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.520
 another side two sata cables for the 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.079
 hard disks we continue with this that 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.239
 would be the sheet or plate for 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.670
 Normal connectors once installed 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.320
 plate we continue with the disc 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.800
 installation of the license plate drivers 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.260
 base a manual with instructions and about 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.999
 all information related to the plate and 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.989
 its operation to know what is each 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.989
 etc. 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.129
 a driver installation manual 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.739
 that is to say what we had on the disk in 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.000
 that cd and finally some warnings 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.000
 about installation 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.700
 plate supports 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.650
 i7 core intel hardware processors 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.710
 extreme edition that also have 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.820
 support for ram ddr 4 memory if 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.650
 you have been shot and you have 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.260
 fixed the unfair these slots here 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.880
 we have annette ddr4 watts with 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.350
 speeds that start from two thousand 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.350
 133 megahertz 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.490
 with respect to hard drives one point 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.950
 Very interesting about this motherboard is 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.319
 that we have right here called room 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.140
 express this is to combine the 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.609
 efficiency of sata ports and the 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.499
 speed of the pci express ports 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.840
 to get read speeds and 

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:47.189
 writing very high especially when 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.189
 use ssd drives 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.950
 as you can see in this plant that 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.900
 appears right here this motherboard comes 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.420
 with a technology called 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.550
 audio app a proprietary technology 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.410
 gb that allows the maximum 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.820
 technical specifications for audio 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.430
 that you are listening in this way 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.600
 besides that the audio ports are 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.910
 fenced and we have not commented 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.910
 you will get an optimal sound quality 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:14.170
 for music for your games so one 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.170
 absolute investment 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.560
 among other things you want to save a 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.600
 kind of express 3.0 with what 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.990
 you can place two graphic cards 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.580
 so much envy is to read is how to eat 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.950
 that is crossfire so you can 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.540
 use the maximum graphic potential that 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.550
 your computer can support this 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.740
 remember that it is in a tiny size 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.440
 this motherboard fits in any type 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.270
 of hunting is relatively small the house 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.100
 of these minis 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.080
 we could say that from gigabytes it 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.880
 have been wet by the players to 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.010
 miniaturized range features 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.080
 high on a plate that measures a half and a half 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:54.370
 and just for that reason it is already a product 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.370
 remarkable I'm torreyes and this is 20
