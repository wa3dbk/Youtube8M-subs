00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
 today we will see how to dimension the openings 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.649
 or windows and patio doors 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.030
 in this case the dimension is a bit 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.120
 different from the one we learned 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.880
 until now as the dimensioning does not 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.810
 will happen with some lines of quota but 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.730
 will happen with the lines we will build 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.699
 perpendicular to the legal profession 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.260
 same in particular by following these 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.750
 rules 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.269
 let's see how we quote a window there 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.390
 let's put on the odds and build one 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.700
 line that starts from the central point of the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.239
 glass line to the outside 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.290
 having activated the garden to the outside and 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.450
 long point 25 after that from the same 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.190
 point inward 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.820
 we're going to build a long line 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:55.530
 point 5 we will introduce the text 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.530
 taking as a reference the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.609
 central point of the line from 0 5 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.500
 the height of the text will be precisely one e 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.549
 the glorious aran of the text will be in 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.090
 this case 90 centi 90 degrees 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.820
 after that we're going to write the alt 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.530
 the height and width in this case 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.030
 the 120 window then we will write 120 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.790
 and press twice enter for 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.330
 accept this dimension you see that in 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.040
 this case, however, the number is not found 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.740
 in the correct position then 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:40.619
 we will move down by step 1 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:46.079
 sorry for point 2 and to the left of point 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:49.920
 05 and now we're going to copy the same as 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.360
 himself in a horizontal line to a 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:58.320
 distance also of point 2 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.659
 this is the dimension in this case us 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.329
 we will have 120 that width and 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.479
 this one we will modify in 110 that 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.810
 the height of the window 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.959
 in the same way we will go to quote the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.810
 door window and doors reminding us 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.840
 that the windows and French windows 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.980
 they should always be quoted inwards 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.900
 of the building while the door to the doors 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.480
 in general they must be listed on the inside 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.860
 of the arc we see how it works in 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.760
 this case I can safely 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.640
 copy this element making this 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:41.160
 as a point of reference and I will go 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:44.700
 to copy here now I'll have to go to 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:50.819
 change the 110 for that 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:55.760
 French window jumps 210 for the door 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:57.989
 I'll have to make a change instead, let's say 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:03.860
 relatively simple so I can 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:07.379
 go and copy this item again 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.360
 I'll bring it here, but we said that 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.250
 we want to quote with inside 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.200
 of the arc to quote it inside 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.739
 of the arc I do nothing other than 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.310
 then mirror this element with the 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.900
 mirror command sp individual thing 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:29.270
 mirror 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:32.750
 individual the axis of mirror gate of 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:35.200
 you source objects so you see that 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.420
 now I will have this dimension again 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.800
 with the difference that it is mirrored 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.440
 compared to the axis of the door itself 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.630
 therefore it is inside the arc in 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:53.240
 this case I'll have to go and write though 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:56.030
 after going to change the odds to 210 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.520
 of the height of the door and 80 of the 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.250
 width I will make a little adjustment 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.590
 because this 80 you see is not found 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.160
 centrally aligned in 210 lo 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:11.140
 we will move upwards from step 05 into 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:15.160
 so as to make it more correct and 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:19.640
 let's say beautiful from the point of view 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:24.250
 aesthetic we can make ours 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:28.850
 faster design by building in first 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.160
 all possible let's say odds that there 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.870
 can be useful to build the 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.420
 our design in this case for 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:42.830
 example we can copy the dimension 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:47.330
 of the door after which we can 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:51.830
 mirror us with respect to a line 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:54.290
 any horizontal and see that already 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.940
 we prepared it and ready for two 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.940
 after which it hides we copy again 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:13.029
 and we can rotate it with respect to a 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:17.319
 angle with respect to a central point like 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:21.279
 this by an angle of minus 90 in this 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:24.599
 chance you see that we would already be ready to 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:28.719
 part of the design we could keep them 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:35.019
 for as many times as possible 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:35.619
 useful all the dimensions we have 

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:38.319
 need 

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:41.979
 in the same way we can do with the 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:46.419
 quotas with three digits as for example 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:51.569
 these are the 120 210 we can still have 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:56.589
 copy anywhere outside 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:58.679
 mirror with respect to any axis 

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:58.679
 horizontal 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:08.240
 and again rotate after copying 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:27.930
 compared to a central point and rotate them 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:33.569
 of minus 90 and also in this case you see 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:36.300
 that we can go and build them all 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:39.020
 the odds that can be useful to us and 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.360
 that we will always have available both for 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.460
 the quotas with two digits and three digits 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.529
 follow by three digits three digits which 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.139
 we can simply go and copy 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:52.319
 where we need them 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:56.419
 then go to change allows 

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:56.419
 the actual size of the windows
