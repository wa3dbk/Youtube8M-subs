00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.849
 clash today today i peak 2 leila 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.870
 finally i'm eight 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.120
 peak up by 3 multiply as many as six 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.039
 I have even a million elixir 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.770
 maximum amount 4 million 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.880
 something else you need to be storage in order 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.380
 to deliver 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.590
 running on the third day after drinking set 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.019
 balls will also try to attack 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.210
 the balls will be me soon 5 leyla 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.000
 in the meantime, while we are still an adversary 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.430
 which could attack our 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.230
 new peaks tack see come across for now 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.860
 not really guys this like no no no 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.110
 will not go 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.860
 it will come too easy few resources 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.550
 at the cottage more interesting for this guy 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.770
 also does not suit us next 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.979
 This 1 7 LVL fence itself is the elixir 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.920
 Chik 189 thousand elixir. we would 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.159
 not bad take ourselves so we act on 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.900
 I need to think about the former scheme to start 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.490
 clear us a bit of territory for baking 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.290
 so that they are here almost all the same almost 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.790
 the middle 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.250
 in order to destroy the main up 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.150
 we throw for the person what king so for 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.220
 To take but they are based on it 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.530
 I decided to go there to throw a runaway drink 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.090
 partner , etc. worth a look 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.760
 handle this we do n't handle 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.979
 handle here baker damn this already 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.080
 the first to ban at all and attention already 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.479
 almost all of his spirit already 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.860
 little red went life okay kinda 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.190
 went to the middle and you put about all the same 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.229
 they decided and decided to go here 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.140
 mall to be honest any differences 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.880
 between the first and second revamped i'm not 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.430
 probably found the same story 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.180
 hacks with magicians when big difference 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.880
 Only between the fourth and pack 5 I hope 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.459
 I hope that if I have if 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.560
 accumulate 6 million elixir and 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.900
 put a bake on the update on the third level 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.860
 I hope they do not grieve me and really 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.730
 will be smarter than that or at least let 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.920
 will be like 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.599
 and more viable as I have them 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.819
 there are already a few all already 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.860
 reds yes awesome threw spellcheck 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.250
 and she guys are walking around coming out of 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.769
 him this bad tesla like not 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.670
 strongly opinions ok rushed pay 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.920
 attention ok everything is fine 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.620
 how many 3 pieces and one half dead and all 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.239
 already dead understood all three things pet 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.190
 some bows of plank left 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:55.239
 so new lexer chick i took all 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:59.470
 why she came, I took what I throw 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:02.079
 threw sang 2 guys I you just expel 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.209
 why go to the fire when the bow is near 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.090
 it would be necessary to break the fence and destroy 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.010
 this bow and and sang you gone sang 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.750
 it turns out just the same but he does not 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.670
 desired okay yes traps that i like 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.680
 though the trap has no effect on it bakers 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.109
 not all the same two left they needed 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.959
 was altogether one could get by with just 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:26.829
 1 sport is not one that principle 2 fought 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:30.069
 custody is obtained more than a little more life 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:33.010
 but you yourself watched their properties but such 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.139
 I seemed to see you so soon 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.530
 take it so either you need them somehow 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:40.599
 brothers miksovat than necessarily 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.150
 the next peak we will wait only 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:47.250
