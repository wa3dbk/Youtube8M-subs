00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.399
 good since teaching a little the breeder 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.799
 I have hellenas that I have here that is for 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:08.929
 raise elena snails are super 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.140
 effective to finish with the flat or 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.210
 with the plague of snails that you have 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.410
 you realize it 's all full of 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.119
 empty shells 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.000
 and right now he gives me a tour of 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.070
 here 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.690
 Nothing seen like this snail elena 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.110
 has accepted the orbis plan 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.850
 and nothing is eating another elena and 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.680
 another plan orbis 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.600
 Do not be surprised if you go to 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.960
 for him 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.489
 there you can see it introduces the French horn 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.489
 inside and start to eat it 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.370
 do not start devouring inside you can 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.130
 see how the fight is but good 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.920
 fight no because they eat them already 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.590
 you can see 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.010
 the amount of snails that here 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.949
 the dead 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.439
 the snail elena eats all kinds of 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.070
 snails but it's also effective against 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.630
 the seaweed 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.330
 what happens that sometimes when you 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.640
 like to eat some snail 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.170
 those two that you see juntitos that are 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.790
 eating each other or that they are 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.470
 hitting and you understand me what they are 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.080
 doing 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.700
 and nothing because you can see here 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.380
 as it was thrown by the snail and I 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.140
 it is therefore that undoes it inside 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.310
 eat it at the end leave the shell empty 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.450
 but see if they are effective 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.450
 how few are saved 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.479
 all those are snails that have been 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.890
 eaten to the reproduction of the elena is 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.750
 very simple at six months or so 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.509
 start to lay eggs by the glass 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.520
 with the rocks by the stones the 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.920
 Little elena feed on algae and 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.990
 then, well, snails 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.880
 and I 'm telling you it 's the best thing or you're finished 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.760
 with all the snails you have 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.790
 of all types 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.230
 from time to time I miss snails and 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.460
 now here we have a broadside if 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.420
 we can see a little better with the 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.360
 horn 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.020
 that as you give at the end the house at 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.020
 another one is ahead 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.130
 are patients go slow but then at 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.850
 final 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.900
 they end up getting the conch 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.900
 out there another 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.770
 I do not know if he 's behind that snail 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.140
 I may go behind the snail 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.550
 although it seems like a lie, it is a 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.380
 a death race look at you week 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.180
 sometimes they go over and not even 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.500
 you do not feel like it or whatever 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.780
 but it gives me that is that if it has 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.260
 hungry and goes behind e look 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.390
 we finish from the sequence 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.700
 of snail hunting gives me that at 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.620
 final of selena is trying to knock it down 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.620
 the other one is eating it already 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.310
 He put the tube and that then looks at this 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.080
 hacienda and the turn 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.620
 and you can see live to the best that 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.620
 he is going to eat it 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.590
 everything depends on the ability also of the 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.000
 plan orbis in a certain way not 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.000
 it shows the weak flank 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.360
 Well, there you can see that they are 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.470
 tremendously effective if you want 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.930
 remove a plague of snails 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.870
 Deaf people are already sentenced going to 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.800
 be part of it 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.500
 from planner bis cemetery 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.090
