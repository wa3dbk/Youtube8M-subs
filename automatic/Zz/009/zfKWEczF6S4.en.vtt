00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and white which is really odd for the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.429 
and white which is really odd for the
summer<00:01:51.180> because<00:01:51.390> usually<00:01:51.659> summer<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.290> all

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
summer because usually summer is all

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.940 
summer because usually summer is all
about<00:01:52.470> fiber<00:01:53.310> colors<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.119> neons<00:01:55.079> have<00:01:55.290> two

about fiber colors and neons have two
examples<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.180> think<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:57.509> such<00:01:57.840> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869
