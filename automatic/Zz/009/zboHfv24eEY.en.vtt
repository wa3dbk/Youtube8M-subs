00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
going ahead and making a backup just in

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.490 
going ahead and making a backup just in
case<00:02:37.560> if<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.220> unto<00:02:38.670> zip<00:02:39.390> doesn't<00:02:39.810> work<00:02:39.930> say

case if the unto zip doesn't work say

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.900 
case if the unto zip doesn't work say
let's<00:02:40.680> go<00:02:40.769> ahead<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.129> boot<00:02:41.250> into<00:02:41.610> our

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
let's go ahead and boot into our

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.960 
let's go ahead and boot into our
recovery<00:02:42.510> now<00:02:42.989> I<00:02:43.019> already<00:02:43.560> have<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:44.190> bunch<00:02:44.849> of

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
recovery now I already have a bunch of

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.640 
recovery now I already have a bunch of
backups<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.750> don't<00:02:46.050> need<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.230> make<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.410> backup

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
backups so I don't need to make a backup

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.500 
backups so I don't need to make a backup
but<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.250> highly<00:02:47.519> recommend<00:02:47.879> making<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.180> backup

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
touch responses by about 10% 15% but I

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.469 
touch responses by about 10% 15% but I
don't<00:05:42.460> know<00:05:42.550> if<00:05:42.640> my<00:05:42.789> math<00:05:42.970> is<00:05:43.000> right<00:05:43.150> but

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
guys this is just to increase the touch

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.520 
guys this is just to increase the touch
responsiveness<00:05:47.180> so<00:05:47.600> yeah<00:05:48.140> let<00:05:48.260> me<00:05:48.290> go<00:05:48.440> ahead

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
responsiveness so yeah let me go ahead

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.640 
responsiveness so yeah let me go ahead
and<00:05:48.620> type<00:05:49.070> out<00:05:49.280> some<00:05:49.520> stuff<00:05:49.790> just<00:05:49.820> to<00:05:50.150> see<00:05:50.480> if<00:05:51.050> I

and type out some stuff just to see if I
think<00:05:51.710> that<00:05:51.920> it's<00:05:52.130> more<00:05:52.250> responsive<00:05:52.760> let's<00:05:52.910> go

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000
