00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
her hair so so it's something that she's

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.780 
her hair so so it's something that she's
never<00:00:34.420> not<00:00:35.379> known<00:00:35.800> it's<00:00:36.280> never<00:00:36.520> been<00:00:36.730> like

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
never not known it's never been like

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.119 
never not known it's never been like
something<00:00:37.239> that<00:00:37.360> I<00:00:37.420> randomly<00:00:38.350> got<00:00:38.530> thrown<00:00:39.010> on

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
something that I randomly got thrown on

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.729 
something that I randomly got thrown on
her<00:00:39.160> it's<00:00:39.520> just<00:00:39.730> something<00:00:39.850> that<00:00:40.059> she's

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
her it's just something that she's

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.209 
her it's just something that she's
always<00:00:41.739> know<00:00:42.010> I<00:00:42.309> think<00:00:42.730> just<00:00:43.180> like<00:00:43.329> regular

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
always know I think just like regular

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.220 
always know I think just like regular
discipline<00:00:45.219> and<00:00:45.370> how<00:00:45.579> I<00:00:45.610> treat<00:00:46.090> her<00:00:46.300> and<00:00:46.809> stuff

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
discipline and how I treat her and stuff

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.380 
discipline and how I treat her and stuff
like<00:00:47.410> that<00:00:47.579> comes<00:00:48.579> into<00:00:48.789> account<00:00:49.149> what<00:00:49.270> I'm

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
like that comes into account what I'm

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.689 
like that comes into account what I'm
doing<00:00:49.690> her<00:00:49.870> hair<00:00:50.140> there's<00:00:50.890> a<00:00:50.980> level<00:00:51.520> of

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
doing her hair there's a level of

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.549 
doing her hair there's a level of
respect<00:00:52.059> that<00:00:52.210> she<00:00:52.510> has<00:00:52.690> for<00:00:52.719> me<00:00:52.989> and<00:00:53.230> also<00:00:53.530> a

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
respect that she has for me and also a

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.349 
respect that she has for me and also a
little<00:00:53.920> respect<00:00:54.399> that<00:00:54.609> I<00:00:54.670> have<00:00:54.699> for<00:00:54.820> her<00:00:55.120> too

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
little respect that I have for her too

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.250 
little respect that I have for her too
so<00:00:56.140> I<00:00:56.170> think<00:00:56.260> that<00:00:56.440> comes<00:00:56.890> into<00:00:57.129> play<00:00:57.430> um

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
so I think that comes into play um

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.099 
so I think that comes into play um
consistency<00:00:59.260> I<00:00:59.469> do<00:01:00.280> her<00:01:00.460> hair<00:01:00.820> every<00:01:01.750> single

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
consistency I do her hair every single

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.979 
consistency I do her hair every single
day<00:01:02.260> pretty<00:01:02.769> much<00:01:02.859> and<00:01:03.430> so<00:01:04.269> she's<00:01:04.540> just<00:01:04.629> used

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
day pretty much and so she's just used

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.900 
day pretty much and so she's just used
to<00:01:05.230> it<00:01:05.260> it's<00:01:05.560> not<00:01:05.710> like<00:01:05.920> she<00:01:06.430> goes<00:01:06.610> long

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
to it it's not like she goes long

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.400 
to it it's not like she goes long
periods<00:01:07.300> of<00:01:07.360> time<00:01:07.420> without<00:01:07.720> getting<00:01:08.110> her<00:01:08.200> hair

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
periods of time without getting her hair

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.080 
periods of time without getting her hair
done<00:01:08.620> and<00:01:08.800> I<00:01:08.890> just<00:01:09.070> throw<00:01:09.400> it<00:01:09.520> on<00:01:09.610> her<00:01:09.820> and<00:01:10.030> she

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090

being a lot of pain and there shouldn't
be<00:01:22.060> I<00:01:22.330> mean<00:01:22.600> that's<00:01:22.840> not<00:01:23.050> healthy<00:01:23.350> for<00:01:23.500> her

be I mean that's not healthy for her
hair<00:01:24.160> and<00:01:24.900> like<00:01:25.900> why<00:01:26.200> would<00:01:26.350> you<00:01:26.440> want<00:01:26.590> to<00:01:26.620> have

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
hair and like why would you want to have

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.190 
hair and like why would you want to have
flicked<00:01:27.130> paint<00:01:27.460> on<00:01:27.670> your<00:01:27.820> child<00:01:28.150> for<00:01:28.810> no<00:01:28.990> good

flicked paint on your child for no good

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.050 
flicked paint on your child for no good
reason<00:01:29.260> and<00:01:29.980> like<00:01:30.490> think<00:01:30.910> about<00:01:31.150> it<00:01:31.390> if<00:01:31.570> you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
reason and like think about it if you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.030 
reason and like think about it if you
were<00:01:34.060> getting<00:01:34.270> pain<00:01:34.750> inflicted<00:01:35.140> on<00:01:35.530> your<00:01:35.770> head

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
were getting pain inflicted on your head

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.450 
were getting pain inflicted on your head
would<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.670> want<00:01:36.880> to<00:01:36.940> sit<00:01:37.180> there<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.570> take<00:01:37.750> it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
would you want to sit there and take it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.250 
would you want to sit there and take it
probably<00:01:39.460> not<00:01:39.610> having<00:01:40.450> no<00:01:40.600> pain<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:40.870> think

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
probably not having no pain I think

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.900 
probably not having no pain I think
helps<00:01:41.620> a<00:01:41.710> lot<00:01:41.890> because<00:01:42.190> then<00:01:42.460> she<00:01:42.610> can<00:01:42.760> do

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
helps a lot because then she can do

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.090 
helps a lot because then she can do
whatever<00:01:43.360> and<00:01:43.840> as<00:01:44.230> you've<00:01:44.440> seen<00:01:44.650> in<00:01:44.710> some<00:01:45.070> of
