I was at Mardi Gras yesterday in New

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.210 
I was at Mardi Gras yesterday in New
Orleans<00:04:21.329> and<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.750> saw<00:04:21.959> a<00:04:22.230> guy<00:04:22.620> carrying<00:04:22.920> a

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
Orleans and I saw a guy carrying a

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.610 
Orleans and I saw a guy carrying a
six-pack<00:04:23.670> he<00:04:24.630> had<00:04:24.720> one<00:04:24.930> he<00:04:25.110> was<00:04:25.200> drinking<00:04:25.560> his

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
six-pack he had one he was drinking his

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.680 
six-pack he had one he was drinking his
carrying<00:04:25.920> a<00:04:25.980> six-pack<00:04:26.400> so<00:04:26.430> this<00:04:26.670> really<00:04:27.030> seems

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
carrying a six-pack so this really seems

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.310 
carrying a six-pack so this really seems
to<00:04:27.810> be<00:04:27.900> taken<00:04:28.260> off<00:04:28.380> I<00:04:29.780> think<00:04:30.780> it's<00:04:30.990> gonna<00:04:31.080> be<00:04:31.290> a

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
to be taken off I think it's gonna be a

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.250 
to be taken off I think it's gonna be a
success<00:04:31.530> so<00:04:32.360> they<00:04:33.360> say<00:04:33.570> they<00:04:33.750> bonked<00:04:34.080> on<00:04:34.169> the

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
success so they say they bonked on the

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.370 
success so they say they bonked on the
lake<00:04:37.490> this<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.730> pretty<00:04:39.030> good<00:04:39.210> beer<00:04:39.390> and<00:04:39.630> I
