and<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:11.969> have<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.179> disassemble<00:00:12.750> all<00:00:12.870> over<00:00:13.170> again

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
and I have to disassemble all over again

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.560 
and I have to disassemble all over again
and<00:00:13.500> rebuild<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:14.009> will<00:00:14.639> not<00:00:14.790> rebuilt<00:00:15.150> just<00:00:15.330> a

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
and rebuild it will not rebuilt just a

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.779 
and rebuild it will not rebuilt just a
fix<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.260> stuff<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:17.220> get<00:00:17.310> my<00:00:17.460> mind<00:00:17.670> off

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.810 
fix it and stuff so to get my mind off
of<00:00:17.850> sirens<00:00:18.330> for<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:19.350> siren<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.220> way<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.550> made

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
of sirens for that siren this way I made

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.259 
of sirens for that siren this way I made
this<00:00:21.240> siren<00:00:21.980> it<00:00:22.980> looks<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.340> lot<00:00:23.580> like<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.820> federal

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
this siren it looks a lot like a federal

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.950 
this siren it looks a lot like a federal
code<00:00:24.420> siren<00:00:26.330> there's<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.480> picture<00:00:27.779> on<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
code siren there's this picture on the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.200 
code siren there's this picture on the
internet<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.289> found<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:29.010> think<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.640> sign<00:00:29.939> for

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
internet I found I think it's a sign for

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.749 
internet I found I think it's a sign for
that<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.869> looks<00:00:31.170> practically<00:00:32.160> identical<00:00:32.250> to

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
that it looks practically identical to

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.410 
that it looks practically identical to
it<00:00:33.739> this<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.950> only<00:00:35.190> its<00:00:35.489> first<00:00:35.850> coat<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.270> paint

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
it this is only its first coat of paint

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.610 
it this is only its first coat of paint
it's<00:00:36.840> active<00:00:37.170> primer<00:00:37.940> but<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:38.969> made<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:40.170> it

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
it's active primer but I made this so it

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.220 
it's active primer but I made this so it
has<00:00:40.890> protection<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:41.969> my<00:00:42.210> little<00:00:42.660> red<00:00:42.780> sign<00:00:42.989> in

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
has protection for my little red sign in

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.770 
has protection for my little red sign in

circle<00:01:38.100> well<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.329> basically<00:01:39.479> if<00:01:39.930> you've

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
circle well this is basically if you've

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.289 
circle well this is basically if you've
made<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.290> paper<00:01:40.530> sign<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.430> doing<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.119> same

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
made a paper sign just doing the same

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.179 
made a paper sign just doing the same
thing<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.960> sheet<00:01:43.170> metal<00:01:43.320> take<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
thing it's just a sheet metal take the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.499 
thing it's just a sheet metal take the
circle

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
circle

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.990 
circle
I<00:01:45.600> used<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:47.540> giant<00:01:48.540> compass

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
I used this giant compass

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.180 
I used this giant compass
then<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:51.020> middle<00:01:51.230> of<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.410> marked<00:01:51.680> that<00:01:51.920> at

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
then the middle of the marked that at

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.160 
then the middle of the marked that at
the<00:01:52.370> mark<00:01:52.720> where<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.840> compass<00:01:55.990> pinpoint<00:01:56.990> was

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
the mark where the compass pinpoint was

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.620 
the mark where the compass pinpoint was
I<00:01:57.440> cut<00:01:58.070> a<00:01:58.100> line<00:01:58.670> right<00:01:58.850> up<00:01:59.000> to<00:01:59.090> their<00:01:59.180> curved<00:01:59.510> it

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
I cut a line right up to their curved it

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.720 
I cut a line right up to their curved it
up<00:01:59.750> drill<00:02:00.440> some<00:02:00.620> holes<00:02:00.650> stuck<00:02:01.130> some<00:02:01.280> rivets<00:02:01.610> in

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
up drill some holes stuck some rivets in

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.490 
up drill some holes stuck some rivets in
there<00:02:01.880> same<00:02:02.870> with<00:02:03.020> this<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:03.290> this<00:02:03.350> is<00:02:03.470> a

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
there same with this and this is a

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.280 
there same with this and this is a
little<00:02:03.620> bit<00:02:03.770> more<00:02:03.860> trickier<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:05.990> can<00:02:06.140> see

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
little bit more trickier you can see

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.920 
little bit more trickier you can see
it's<00:02:06.440> not<00:02:07.400> a<00:02:07.460> whole<00:02:07.640> cone<00:02:07.850> actually<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.479> had<00:02:08.780> to

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
it's not a whole cone actually I had to

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.200 
it's not a whole cone actually I had to
do<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.920> same<00:02:10.130> thing<00:02:10.369> but<00:02:10.670> then<00:02:10.790> I<00:02:10.850> traced

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
do the same thing but then I traced

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.680 
do the same thing but then I traced
another<00:02:11.540> inside<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.440> then<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.790> just<00:02:14.540> glued

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
another inside and then I just glued

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.240 
another inside and then I just glued
these<00:02:14.840> on<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.110> day<00:02:15.200> they<00:02:15.380> worked<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.800> their

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
these on the day they worked and their

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.940 
these on the day they worked and their
work<00:02:16.460> pretty<00:02:16.700> well<00:02:16.760> they're<00:02:17.570> nice<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.710> see

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
work pretty well they're nice to the see

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.930 
work pretty well they're nice to the see
I<00:02:19.760> think<00:02:20.210> they<00:02:20.300> gradually<00:02:20.630> get<00:02:20.870> larger

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
I think they gradually get larger

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.570 
I think they gradually get larger
there's<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.210> underside<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.340> Scion

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
there's the underside and so the Scion

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.690 
there's the underside and so the Scion
can<00:02:25.910> be<00:02:26.030> heard<00:02:26.210> cut<00:02:26.780> some<00:02:26.960> parts<00:02:27.460> so<00:02:28.460> give<00:02:28.640> me

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
can be heard cut some parts so give me

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.160 
can be heard cut some parts so give me
some<00:02:28.880> feedback<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:29.420> don't<00:02:29.690> know<00:02:29.780> what<00:02:29.960> color

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
some feedback I don't know what color

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.720 
some feedback I don't know what color
should<00:02:30.410> paint<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.770> I<00:02:30.920> think<00:02:31.520> it<00:02:31.610> may<00:02:31.700> be

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
should paint it I think it may be

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.120 
should paint it I think it may be
two-tone<00:02:33.070> I'm<00:02:34.070> thinking<00:02:34.520> red<00:02:34.760> yellow

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
two-tone I'm thinking red yellow

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.760 
two-tone I'm thinking red yellow
silverish<00:02:37.240> so<00:02:38.240> give<00:02:38.930> me<00:02:38.990> feedback<00:02:39.380> I<00:02:39.620> don't

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
silverish so give me feedback I don't

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.820 
silverish so give me feedback I don't
really<00:02:39.920> know<00:02:40.100> what<00:02:40.220> color<00:02:40.810> so<00:02:41.810> yeah<00:02:42.290> I'll<00:02:42.590> turn

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.920 
really know what color so yeah I'll turn
it<00:02:42.920> on<00:02:43.010> for<00:02:43.070> you<00:02:43.310> this<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.540> side<00:02:44.750> without

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
it on for you this is the side without

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.520 
it on for you this is the side without
the<00:02:45.110> cap<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:50.270> then<00:02:50.810> this<00:02:50.900> is<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.140> side<00:02:51.320> with
