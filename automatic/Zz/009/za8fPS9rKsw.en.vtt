00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.310
 ah 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.619
 welcome to gallery nights tv today 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.110
 we present to matilde marÃ­n in the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.110
 photography section note 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.910
 particularly my position has to do 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.059
 with commitment and being a witness 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.920
 of this time because the artists I know 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.530
 as an artist that we can not change the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.510
 world but we can show the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.710
 things that we see differently then in 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.710
 that is my commitment 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.290
 or 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:14.380
 what unifies my work so I see it from 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.819
 some way is let's say a sensitivity 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.670
 let's say it is being done as a 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:21.770
 travel in the work and the way of 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.640
 My work is by series or I 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.950
 started a series of works sometimes go 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.780
 living together 12-10 and it is in some way that 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.359
 I express the theme I express the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.409
 technical possibilities the possibilities 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.409
 visuals of that work 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.660
 right now I'm working on a 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.210
 photographic series that starts around 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.700
 of 5 years ago has to do with the 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.580
 headlights with some headlights of the world headlights 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.980
 emblematic lighthouses that somehow 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.440
 they guided their light and the destiny of 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.630
 men and I'm in the part of 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.820
 final production of this series for 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.600
 can show it is a very series 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.600
 special for me 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.560

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.540
