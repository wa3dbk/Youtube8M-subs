South America and much of the world now
I'm<00:02:17.240> gonna<00:02:17.330> be<00:02:17.510> controversial<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.350> think<00:02:18.709> they

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
I'm gonna be controversial I think they

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.949 
I'm gonna be controversial I think they
should<00:02:19.100> be<00:02:19.190> using<00:02:19.370> these<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:20.450> orange<00:02:20.720> balls

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
should be using these the orange balls

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.050 
should be using these the orange balls
and<00:02:21.200> actually<00:02:22.070> they're<00:02:22.220> starting<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.640> they're

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
and actually they're starting to they're

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.150 
and actually they're starting to they're
certainly<00:02:23.420> using<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.840> new<00:02:24.350> tennis<00:02:24.709> rackets

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
certainly using the new tennis rackets

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.920 
certainly using the new tennis rackets
night<00:02:26.290> but<00:02:27.290> um<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:28.000> like<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.239> orange<00:02:29.450> balls<00:02:29.750> I

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
night but um I like the orange balls I

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.120 
night but um I like the orange balls I
think<00:02:29.959> low-compression

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
think low-compression

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.979 
think low-compression
give<00:02:31.700> yourself<00:02:32.090> time<00:02:32.360> that's<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.870> whole

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
give yourself time that's the whole

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.570 
give yourself time that's the whole
point<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.440> mini<00:02:33.650> tennis<00:02:33.920> for<00:02:34.400> me

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
point of mini tennis for me

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.940 
point of mini tennis for me
low-compression<00:02:35.570> balls<00:02:36.019> giving<00:02:36.380> children

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
low-compression balls giving children

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.030 
low-compression balls giving children
more<00:02:37.640> time<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.930> hit<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.200> ball<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.590> trouble<00:02:39.950> is

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
more time to hit the ball the trouble is

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.240 
more time to hit the ball the trouble is
it's<00:02:40.220> not<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:41.360> is<00:02:41.720> everything<00:02:42.350> we've<00:02:42.950> built

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
it's not that is everything we've built

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.440 
it's not that is everything we've built
around<00:02:43.670> it

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.910
