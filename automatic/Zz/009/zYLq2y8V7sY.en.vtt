and<00:00:09.960> this<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:11.010> exact<00:00:11.280> same<00:00:11.519> thing<00:00:11.759> that

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
and this is the exact same thing that

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.820 
and this is the exact same thing that
we've<00:00:12.059> been<00:00:12.210> seen<00:00:12.450> for<00:00:12.480> leaks<00:00:12.929> for<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.590> past

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
we've been seen for leaks for the past

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.260 
we've been seen for leaks for the past
couple<00:00:14.070> months<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.960> basically

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
couple months and it is basically

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.000 
couple months and it is basically
exactly<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.570> same<00:00:18.779> there's<00:00:19.050> nothing<00:00:19.619> really

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
exactly the same there's nothing really

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.070 
exactly the same there's nothing really
surprising<00:00:20.580> or<00:00:20.699> knew<00:00:20.880> about<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.050> is

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
surprising or knew about it so this is

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.750 
surprising or knew about it so this is
what<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.410> looks<00:00:22.619> like<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:23.100> nineteen<00:00:23.580> percent

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760

four-inch at 326 pixels per inch and

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.020 
four-inch at 326 pixels per inch and
inside<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.410> does<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.219> LTE<00:00:35.579> that

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
inside of it it does have the LTE that

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.139 
inside of it it does have the LTE that
we<00:00:36.120> have<00:00:36.300> been<00:00:36.450> seeing<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.469> also<00:00:37.649> has<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:38.340> 5

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
we have been seeing and it also has a 5

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.139 
we have been seeing and it also has a 5
gigahertz<00:00:39.540> band<00:00:39.840> with<00:00:40.440> Wi-Fi<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.910> up

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
gigahertz band with Wi-Fi and that is up

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.680 
gigahertz band with Wi-Fi and that is up
to<00:00:42.360> 150<00:00:43.320> megabits<00:00:43.770> per<00:00:43.860> second<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.510> does

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
to 150 megabits per second and it does

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.080 
to 150 megabits per second and it does
have<00:00:45.899> an<00:00:46.020> a6<00:00:46.559> chip<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.129> that's<00:00:47.670> two<00:00:47.940> times

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
have an a6 chip and that's two times

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.810 
have an a6 chip and that's two times
faster<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.840> two<00:00:49.469> times<00:00:49.739> faster<00:00:50.129> graphics<00:00:50.340> and

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
faster in two times faster graphics and

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.100 
faster in two times faster graphics and
cpu<00:00:51.390> then<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.289> a5<00:00:52.860> had<00:00:53.190> now<00:00:53.930> battery<00:00:54.930> life<00:00:55.079> is

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
cpu then the a5 had now battery life is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.569 
cpu then the a5 had now battery life is
pretty<00:00:55.559> good<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.100> get<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.460> eight

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
pretty good you can get up to eight

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.260 
pretty good you can get up to eight
hours<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:57.000> talking<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.370> LTE<00:00:59.370> browsing<00:01:00.000> up<00:01:00.120> to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
hours on talking in LTE browsing up to

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.180 
hours on talking in LTE browsing up to
eight<00:01:00.390> hours<00:01:00.660> that's<00:01:00.870> pretty<00:01:01.260> good<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.680> they

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
eight hours that's pretty good and they

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.570 
eight hours that's pretty good and they
also<00:01:02.340> have<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.090> new<00:01:03.379> isight<00:01:04.379> camera<00:01:04.409> which<00:01:05.400> is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
also have the new isight camera which is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.280 
also have the new isight camera which is
the<00:01:05.670> same<00:01:05.880> eight<00:01:06.119> megapixel<00:01:06.750> sensor<00:01:07.110> as

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the same eight megapixel sensor as

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.399 
the same eight megapixel sensor as
before<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.340> they<00:01:08.490> also<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:09.000> new<00:01:09.750> panorama

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
before but they also have new panorama

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.530 
before but they also have new panorama
mode<00:01:10.680> for<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> camera<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.090> take<00:01:12.210> up

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
mode for the camera so you can take up

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.760 
mode for the camera so you can take up
to<00:01:12.600> twenty<00:01:13.020> eight<00:01:13.140> megapixel<00:01:14.240> panorama<00:01:15.240> mode

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
to twenty eight megapixel panorama mode

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.070 
to twenty eight megapixel panorama mode
pictures<00:01:16.770> which<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.310> basically<00:01:18.080> multiple
