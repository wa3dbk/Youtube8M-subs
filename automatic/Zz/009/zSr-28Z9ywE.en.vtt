I was recently in the sampling it's

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.070 
I was recently in the sampling it's
something<00:00:13.410> something<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.549> rarely<00:00:14.940> do<00:00:15.330> but

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
something something that I rarely do but

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.990 
something something that I rarely do but
I<00:00:16.560> was<00:00:17.070> listening<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.550> friend<00:00:17.759> of<00:00:17.820> Mines

I was listening to a friend of Mines

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.540 
I was listening to a friend of Mines
band<00:00:18.270> called<00:00:18.509> December<00:00:18.900> flood<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.349> just<00:00:20.220> burned

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
band called December flood I just burned

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.010 
band called December flood I just burned
through<00:00:20.579> the<00:00:20.759> new<00:00:20.880> record<00:00:21.239> and<00:00:21.390> trying<00:00:21.899> to

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
through the new record and trying to

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.780 
through the new record and trying to
pick<00:00:22.290> up<00:00:22.439> some<00:00:22.500> samples<00:00:23.040> from<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.309> and<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.520> found

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:23.790 
pick up some samples from it and I found

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.429 
pick up some samples from it and I found
one<00:00:24.000> very<00:00:24.809> simple<00:00:26.840> sample<00:00:27.840> there's<00:00:28.290> really

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
one very simple sample there's really

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.080 
one very simple sample there's really
not<00:00:28.619> much<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.579> didn't<00:00:29.790> take<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:29.939> much

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
not much to it it didn't take that much

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.609 
not much to it it didn't take that much
work<00:00:30.270> to<00:00:30.599> really<00:00:30.779> chop<00:00:30.989> it<00:00:31.200> up<00:00:31.259> or<00:00:31.439> anything

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
work to really chop it up or anything

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:43.710 
work to really chop it up or anything
but<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.430> track<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.180> was<00:00:33.270> from<00:00:33.510> was<00:00:33.690> this

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.560 

that<00:00:44.230> songs<00:00:44.440> called<00:00:44.650> believe<00:00:44.980> and<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:46.270> sample

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
that songs called believe and the sample

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.120 
that songs called believe and the sample
I<00:00:46.630> chose<00:00:46.900> is<00:00:47.110> just<00:00:47.290> from<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.620> ending<00:00:47.890> of<00:00:48.010> the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
I chose is just from the ending of the

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:57.119 
I chose is just from the ending of the
song

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.790 

so<00:00:57.760> it's<00:00:58.329> the<00:00:58.420> easy<00:00:58.600> sample<00:00:59.199> just<00:00:59.320> chop<00:00:59.620> that

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
so it's the easy sample just chop that

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.150 
so it's the easy sample just chop that
up<00:01:00.010> just<00:01:00.250> use<00:01:00.399> that<00:01:00.609> last<00:01:00.850> note<00:01:01.210> at<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.539> end<00:01:02.160> so

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
up just use that last note at the end so

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:19.370 
up just use that last note at the end so
this<00:01:03.280> is<00:01:03.370> what<00:01:03.519> I<00:01:03.550> came<00:01:03.670> up<00:01:03.820> with

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.670 

right<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.909> because<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.270> sample<00:01:21.840> or<00:01:22.530> that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
right so because that sample or that

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.289 
right so because that sample or that
song<00:01:22.920> rather<00:01:23.159> than<00:01:23.369> see<00:01:23.490> makes<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.880> master

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
song rather than see makes it master

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.270 
song rather than see makes it master
than<00:01:24.420> everything<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.409> had<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:26.000> throw<00:01:27.000> some

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
than everything so I had to throw some

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.920 
than everything so I had to throw some
EQ<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:29.850> take<00:01:30.000> out<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.270> high-pass

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
EQ on it and just take out a high-pass

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.350 
EQ on it and just take out a high-pass
filter<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:32.009> just<00:01:32.070> take<00:01:32.520> out<00:01:32.700> all<00:01:32.940> that<00:01:33.119> bowl

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
filter and just take out all that bowl

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.550 
filter and just take out all that bowl
line<00:01:33.509> because<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.840> gotta<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.020> filled<00:01:34.320> up<00:01:34.439> with

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
line because it gotta be filled up with

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.920 
line because it gotta be filled up with
the<00:01:34.740> bass<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.159> kick<00:01:35.340> drum<00:01:35.580> or<00:01:35.610> whatever<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the bass and kick drum or whatever and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.130 
the bass and kick drum or whatever and
I'm<00:01:37.049> using<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.500> roland<00:01:38.220> spds<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.840> reason<00:01:40.080> I

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
I'm using the roland spds the reason I

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.630 
I'm using the roland spds the reason I
like<00:01:40.350> doing<00:01:40.649> this<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:41.130> kind<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.460> like

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
like doing this it's kind of like

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.370 
like doing this it's kind of like
sometimes<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.450> reason<00:01:42.659> why<00:01:42.750> people<00:01:42.930> have<00:01:43.080> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
sometimes the reason why people have the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.990 
sometimes the reason why people have the
you<00:01:43.710> know<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.039> MPC<00:01:44.580> they<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
you know and the MPC they like the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.940 
you know and the MPC they like the
feeling<00:01:45.330> of<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> pads<00:01:45.720> because<00:01:46.619> I'm<00:01:46.860> a

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
feeling of the pads because I'm a

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.940 
feeling of the pads because I'm a
drummer<00:01:47.190> you<00:01:48.149> know<00:01:48.240> I've<00:01:48.390> kind<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.259> locked

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
drummer you know I've kind of locked

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.559 
drummer you know I've kind of locked
into<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.190> groove<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.000> little<00:01:51.240> bit<00:01:51.330> more

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
into that groove just a little bit more

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.169 
into that groove just a little bit more
when<00:01:52.050> I<00:01:52.080> use<00:01:52.289> the<00:01:52.440> sticks<00:01:52.740> hit<00:01:53.429> the<00:01:53.550> pads<00:01:53.819> then

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
when I use the sticks hit the pads then

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.330 
when I use the sticks hit the pads then
on<00:01:54.569> the<00:01:54.750> keyboard<00:01:55.140> because<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.500> does<00:01:56.039> make<00:01:56.250> a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
on the keyboard because it does make a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.830 
on the keyboard because it does make a
difference<00:01:56.369> depending<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.330> surface<00:01:57.690> that

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
difference depending on the surface that

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.899 
difference depending on the surface that
you're<00:01:57.990> used<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.319> playing<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.340> keyboardist

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
you're used to playing on so keyboardist

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.969 
you're used to playing on so keyboardist
might<00:02:00.060> want<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.330> play<00:02:01.050> all<00:02:01.200> their<00:02:01.350> samples<00:02:01.800> and

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
might want to play all their samples and

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.710 
might want to play all their samples and
percussion<00:02:02.789> on<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> piano<00:02:03.300> because<00:02:03.479> that's

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
percussion on the piano because that's

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.020 
percussion on the piano because that's
what<00:02:03.990> they<00:02:04.110> do<00:02:04.170> since<00:02:05.100> I'm<00:02:05.220> a<00:02:05.340> drummer<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.789> like

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
what they do since I'm a drummer I like

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:24.080 
what they do since I'm a drummer I like
using<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.390> sticks

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:59.010 

the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.630 

so<00:03:00.020> I<00:03:00.080> had<00:03:00.230> this<00:03:00.350> idea<00:03:00.530> of<00:03:00.830> kind<00:03:01.070> of<00:03:01.220> making<00:03:01.400> it

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
so I had this idea of kind of making it

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.530 
so I had this idea of kind of making it
a<00:03:01.820> little<00:03:02.540> tribal<00:03:02.980> by<00:03:03.980> throwing<00:03:04.250> up<00:03:04.520> a<00:03:04.790> floor

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
a little tribal by throwing up a floor

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:20.130 
a little tribal by throwing up a floor
atonement<00:03:06.100> let's<00:03:07.100> try<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.490> out

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.270 

now<00:03:21.140> with<00:03:21.290> most<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.560> these<00:03:21.680> sounds<00:03:22.100> that<00:03:22.130> I've

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280

been putting in aren't quantized because
I'm<00:03:25.130> going<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.340> trying<00:03:25.520> to<00:03:25.580> capture<00:03:25.850> just<00:03:26.420> my

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
I'm going to trying to capture just my

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.330 
I'm going to trying to capture just my
own<00:03:26.750> natural<00:03:27.320> groove<00:03:27.620> because<00:03:27.830> this<00:03:28.100> traffic

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
own natural groove because this traffic

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.460 
own natural groove because this traffic
intelligent<00:03:29.210> really<00:03:29.510> really<00:03:29.750> laid-back

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
intelligent really really laid-back

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.100 
intelligent really really laid-back
so<00:03:31.190> without<00:03:31.820> quantizing<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:32.780> really<00:03:32.990> just

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
so without quantizing and really just

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.290 
so without quantizing and really just
feeling<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.740> can<00:03:34.370> really<00:03:34.580> bring<00:03:34.850> out<00:03:35.120> that

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
feeling it can really bring out that

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.810 
feeling it can really bring out that
groove<00:03:35.600> even<00:03:35.990> more<00:03:36.230> rather<00:03:36.710> than<00:03:36.860> having<00:03:37.190> the

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
groove even more rather than having the

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.270 
groove even more rather than having the
computer<00:03:38.180> do<00:03:38.300> it<00:03:38.420> for<00:03:38.630> you<00:03:38.720> let's<00:03:39.710> add<00:03:40.070> some
