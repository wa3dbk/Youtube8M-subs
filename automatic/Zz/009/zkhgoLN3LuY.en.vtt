kids

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.050 
kids
the<00:02:21.580> main<00:02:22.150> problem<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:22.930> faced<00:02:23.410> was

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
the main problem that I faced was

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.430 
the main problem that I faced was
integrating<00:02:25.060> these<00:02:25.209> kids<00:02:25.570> with<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.080> regular

integrating these kids with the regular

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.620 
integrating these kids with the regular
kids<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:28.450> hence<00:02:28.750> then<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.709> heard<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.850> animal

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
kids and hence then I heard of animal

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.840 
kids and hence then I heard of animal
angels<00:02:31.989> foundation<00:02:32.680> heard<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.700> dog

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
angels foundation heard of the dog

therapy<00:02:34.330> for<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.570> first<00:02:34.810> time<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.440> like

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
therapy for the first time and I like

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.070 
therapy for the first time and I like
the<00:02:35.800> idea<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.430> just<00:02:37.180> thought<00:02:37.390> give<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.840> try

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
the idea I just thought give it a try

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.040 
the idea I just thought give it a try
and<00:02:38.350> now<00:02:38.890> we<00:02:38.950> have<00:02:39.190> done<00:02:39.940> almost<00:02:40.330> five<00:02:40.870> to

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
and now we have done almost five to

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.290 
and now we have done almost five to
seven<00:02:41.320> sessions<00:02:41.530> with<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.010> kid<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.430> it's

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
seven sessions with the kid and it's

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.340 
seven sessions with the kid and it's
going<00:02:43.540> great

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
going great

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.750 
going great
so<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.739> thought<00:02:44.860> five<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.190> seven<00:02:45.430> sessions

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
so you thought five to seven sessions

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.000 
so you thought five to seven sessions
what<00:02:45.940> kind<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.269> therapies<00:02:46.800> do<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:47.890> all<00:02:47.980> have

some of the kids hypotonic hyper so they

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.810 
some of the kids hypotonic hyper so they
need<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.870> occupational<00:02:53.650> therapy<00:02:54.070> to<00:02:54.370> get
