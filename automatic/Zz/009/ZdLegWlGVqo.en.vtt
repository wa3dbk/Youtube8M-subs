00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.230
 today I'm going to tell you about an essential oil 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.940
 of exceptional qualities the oil 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.750
 Zara ravin essential name botanical name 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.810
 cynamon canfora is an essential oil 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.849
 that I consider basic especially in the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.710
 natural first-aid kit of the season 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.750
 winter because for several reasons in 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.720
 first place because it is one of the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.390
 essential oils with greater potential 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.489
 antiviral but contrary to what 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.900
 occurs with other essential oils with 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.650
 the same potential that they are 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.930
 extremely strong both in form 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.290
 external as it forms as internally 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.570
 The essential oil of Ravin Sara is very 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.879
 well tolerated has a high degree of 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.409
 safety can be used even in 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.059
 the children although with the due 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:55.920
 precautions for example in women 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.320
 pregnant women that do not suit 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.930
 use it during the first three 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.239
 months of pregnancy on the other hand too 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.519
 It has a very interesting feature 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.700
 which is a powerful neurotoxic that is 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.220
 It is a powerful invigorating energizer 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.320
 but without being stimulating without being 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.500
 exciting so in states in the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.750
 that one is going through some process 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.510
 viral in which it is more decayed then 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.370
 this essential oil has this 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.840
 complementary activity that can come 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.350
 very well 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.329
 about ravin sara I'm going to do 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.950
 a paragraph before continuing to talk about 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.469
 its properties and is that you will have seen 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.079
 that in the title of the video put rabbin 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:40.049
 sahara in parentheses rethinking by 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.509
 what then because this essential oil 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.090
 for many years he has been confused 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.640
 by rethinking then in many 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.219
 publications articles you will see that 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.079
 when they talk about rethinking they actually 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.990
 they are referring to this essential oil 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.270
 to Rabbi Sara though the rethink now 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.280
 will think aromatic has nothing to do 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.439
 with the rage and sara that is of the oil 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.539
 essential that we are talking about today that is 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.630
 you are going to acquire the essential oil of 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.819
 ravin sara you must and if you buy it in 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.679
 marks like pra narÃ³n for example that 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.840
 they have both very well differentiated not 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.849
 there is no problem the problem will be if 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.579
 you buy it from brands that you can still 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.290
 that have this confusion and maybe what 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.510
 will be selling under another name or 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.060
 when they investigate about this oil 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.160
 Sometimes they can talk about ravin zara but 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.000
 they will mention it as rethink so it is 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.160
 very important to have 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.170
 is advanced grows in madagascar can 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.030
 get to have a height of about 15 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.010
 meters in that area the oil 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.350
 essential of healthy ravin know him as 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.150
 the oil that heals everything has a 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.490
 aroma similar to eucalyptus but 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.850
 rather softer among its properties 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.160
 apart from those that we have already mentioned is 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.700
 Anticatarral antibacterial expectorant 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.590
 It has a high content of antioxidants 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.020
 and also contributes to an adequate and 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.120
 correct lung function so it 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.250
 he has traditionally used it throughout 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.280
 type of viral infections since flu 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.850
 viral hepatitis herpes mononucleosis 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.550
 viral enteritis as well as 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.300
 expectorant and anticatarral when 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.730
 There are colds, bronchitis, rhinopharyngitis 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:21.180
 sinusitis also when there is insomnia 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.180
 depression anguish deep fatigue 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.260
 good as we will use it we can 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.420
 use it as a preventative in times of 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.880
 epidemics of flu when you have to go to 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.280
 crowded places of people meters 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.780
 supermarkets hospitals when we have 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.880
 a meeting at home to which he will go 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.130
 Many people can use it as 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.530
 preventive a very simple way in 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.930
 diffusion with any of the devices 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.210
 that sell for the diffusion of oils 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.300
 essentials simply by spreading nole 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.330
 spreading it in the environment already 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.310
 works as a preventive another way is 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.620
 applying it directly on the 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.780
 skin can be applied because it is very 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.880
 well tolerated in general either by 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.970
 example one or two droplets on the wrists 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.890
 and we apply it on the wrists and then 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.720
 We gently rub a wrist against the 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.620
 another can also be applied in the 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.690
 plant of the feet in the thorax in the 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.640
 solar plexus in the lower abdomen in the 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.260
 solar plexus area and lower abdomen 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.620
 It usually works very well also for 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.230
 give us that extra dose of energy that 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.370
 sometimes we need or along the 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.130
 column 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.770
 people who are very sensitive to 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.260
 this essential oil can dilute it by 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.510
 example in proportion of 1 a drop of 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.790
 ravin sara essential oil and a drop 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:42.100
 of any vegetable vegetable oil 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.100
 such as olive oil, hazelnut 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.080
 and when we want to use it, not only 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.470
 as preventive but in viral states 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.200
 in nervous problems we can use it from 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.030
 internal way knowing very well how 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.290
 essential oils are used in a 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.880
 internal you have to have many 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.290
 precautions you have to know very well what 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.180
 what is being done and you have to have very 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.460
 Of course, any oil does not work 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.520
 essential for internal use have to be 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.380
 those who sell specifically for such 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.080
 order and that is very clear in the container 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.900
 that are suitable for that purpose as 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.430
 would usually use in internal use 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.830
 that should always be a very 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.270
 timely with knowledge of the cause and 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.330
 shape 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.850
 a short time then we would take a 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.910
 small spoon we would fill it with 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.880
 olive oil for example or honey or 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.280
 of whole sugar cane and we would throw 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.040
 One or two drops of essential oil 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.690
 Ravin Sara is then placed below 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.910
 the tongue for a few seconds between 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.000
 a few seconds and a minute and swallowed 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.830
 the essential oil in times of flu 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.110
 colds etc and a synergy that 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.970
 it works wonderfully well that is 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.000
 mixing ravin essential oil 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:00.450
 Sara either with the eucalyptus radiata 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.740
 or with nya uli's on the other hand 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.660
 make it very clear that the oils 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.940
 essentials you never ever have to 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.970
 use them on mucous eyes ears 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.530
 et cetera you never have to put them in these 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.130
 sites that before using an oil 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.180
 essential you have to know very well how 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.420
 use it because essential oils 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.640
 they are very very active substances that 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.980
 they have hundreds of very active molecules 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.680
 medicinally so you have to 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.740
 know very well its correct use because 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.310
 if not later we can have surprises 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.420
 unpleasant 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.130
 also 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.200
 precisely on the subject of oils 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.030
 essential, it is very important 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.100
 quality of them that are oils 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.710
 essentials that have been extracted by 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.660
 steam distillation that has been 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.210
 Respected the whole distillation process 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.550
 all the right time for each plant 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.590
 I mean it's an integral distillation if 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.930
 can be chemo type 2 to have very 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.660
 clear differences between plants 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.280
 better and if they can be biological is still 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.200
 better now there are more and more 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.470
 brands in the market fortunately 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.780
 but be very clear that even though 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.700
 it does not mean that they are of higher quality 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.710
 they are going to be more expensive we have oils 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.660
 essentials of very good quality to 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.030
 affordable prices so you have to 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.800
 look for them and above all be clear that a 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.510
 when using essential oils yes 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.700
 that it is very important not to use 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:21.480
 any essential oil but look 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:23.040
 those that are of true good quality 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.750
