00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.880
 fairly common practice from the first

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.830
 some park attendants are 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.620
 trained to use details

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.850
 purify the air of the ashes of the 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.920
 corpses 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.650
 these ashes tend to create 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.280
 a very fine dust that can 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.590

 Arctic living in large groups 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.310
 it is said that when their population 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.950
 grows too much and resources for 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.139

 lemmings in nature would not commit 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.729
 never such a suicide for 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.500
 to realize the scene in fact the authors 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:48.830
 of the documentary took a group of 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.539
 lemmings and brought back to Canada there 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.120
