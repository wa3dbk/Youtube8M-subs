bundles and a closure I feel like my

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.390 
bundles and a closure I feel like my
peruvian<00:03:01.900> hair<00:03:02.110> was<00:03:02.260> just<00:03:02.320> a<00:03:02.560> little<00:03:02.740> bit<00:03:03.040> more

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
peruvian hair was just a little bit more

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.820 
peruvian hair was just a little bit more
heavy<00:03:03.850> and<00:03:04.209> may<00:03:04.330> sound<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.750> little<00:03:04.780> crazy<00:03:05.230> but

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
heavy and may sound a little crazy but

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.500 
heavy and may sound a little crazy but
that's<00:03:06.430> just<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.570> me<00:03:07.810> um<00:03:08.910> what<00:03:09.910> I<00:03:09.940> love<00:03:10.209> more

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
that's just to me um what I love more

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.720 
that's just to me um what I love more
about<00:03:10.840> this<00:03:11.019> hair<00:03:11.290> then<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.709> peruvian<00:03:12.400> hair

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
about this hair then the peruvian hair

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.140 
about this hair then the peruvian hair
is<00:03:12.910> that<00:03:13.720> it's<00:03:14.110> so<00:03:14.290> much<00:03:14.769> more<00:03:15.070> attainable<00:03:15.459> to

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
is that it's so much more attainable to

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.940 
is that it's so much more attainable to
me<00:03:16.330> like<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.690> curl<00:03:16.989> pattern<00:03:17.380> doesn't<00:03:17.620> really

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
me like the curl pattern doesn't really

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.729 
me like the curl pattern doesn't really
disappear<00:03:18.670> after<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:19.750> know<00:03:19.870> days<00:03:20.350> of<00:03:20.650> this

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
disappear after you know days of this

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.680 
disappear after you know days of this
being<00:03:21.160> in<00:03:21.310> its<00:03:21.489> natural<00:03:21.700> speed<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:22.480> don't

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
being in its natural speed I don't

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.750 
being in its natural speed I don't
really<00:03:22.810> have<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:23.260> twist<00:03:23.650> this<00:03:23.860> hair<00:03:24.160> up<00:03:24.370> for

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
really have to twist this hair up for

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.880 
really have to twist this hair up for
this<00:03:24.940> little<00:03:25.150> keep<00:03:25.390> it<00:03:25.600> waves<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.230> be<00:03:26.380> popping

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
this little keep it waves to be popping

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.490 
this little keep it waves to be popping
so<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:28.209> me<00:03:28.360> that's<00:03:28.840> something<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.230> love<00:03:29.440> about

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
outside or it is you know humidity in

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.729 
outside or it is you know humidity in
the<00:03:44.680> air<00:03:45.100> it<00:03:45.660> definitely<00:03:46.660> gets<00:03:47.019> us<00:03:47.230> who<00:03:47.410> it's<00:03:47.590> a

the air it definitely gets us who it's a

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.150 
the air it definitely gets us who it's a
natural<00:03:47.950> state<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:48.970> if<00:03:49.330> it's<00:03:50.080> straight<00:03:50.709> if

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
natural state so if it's straight if

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.009 
natural state so if it's straight if
you're<00:03:51.430> wearing<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.120> straight<00:03:52.510> that<00:03:52.810> may

way<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.070> me<00:04:14.490> is<00:04:14.700> just<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:15.090> more<00:04:15.390> beautiful<00:04:15.810> wave

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
way to me is just a more beautiful wave

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.009 
way to me is just a more beautiful wave
like<00:04:17.100> this<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:18.420> maybe<00:04:20.060> 13<00:04:21.060> is<00:04:21.239> old<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.810> me

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
like this is maybe 13 is old of me

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.040

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.420 
plating but still to me this way pattern
is<00:04:25.260> just<00:04:27.680> it's<00:04:28.680> just<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:29.070> little<00:04:29.430> a<00:04:30.240> little<00:04:30.630> more

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
is just it's just a little a little more

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.480 
is just it's just a little a little more
prettier<00:04:32.430> then<00:04:33.330> they're<00:04:33.900> Peruvian<00:04:34.830> natural

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
prettier then they're Peruvian natural

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.150

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.990 
wave and this hair is definitely
definitely<00:04:39.230> softer<00:04:40.230> than<00:04:40.650> Napoleon<00:04:40.830> hair<00:04:41.670> so
