 here it gives us 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.769
 two options one is to add it through 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.810
 a url remember that the url is the one 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.299
 appears in this part of here and you hit it 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.450
 in this part of here you click on 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.310
 accept and you're going to modify this in 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.620
 the case that you have saved it in 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.870
 your computer we click on load 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.000
 file and here we are going to look for the image 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.579
 with which we are going to modify it see there 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.489
 is already we can also change what 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:59.849
 is the size we have the normal that is 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:04.440
 this width is this here I give 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.269
 right click and the big one well the 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.209
 next is to eliminate what the icon is 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.950
 in this case I do not want to remove it if 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.910
 example let's do with someone who does not 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.030
 occupy me here 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.470
 for example this one here right click 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.840
 eliminate and leave if you for example 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.570
 you want to add a new icon to what 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.580
 is your menu let's move the cursor on 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.850
 this part of here and we give you a click 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.800
 here to add here we will look like 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.650
 which is the box that would be what it is 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.500
 the icon we can here put what is the 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.090
 link to the page to be addressed 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.520
 for example I will copy what is the 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.620
 link to my blog and here I'm going to paste 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.260
 right click to paste here is a 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.180
 label if you want to put that is this 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.280
 from here all about windows 8 there 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.200
 here I can modify what is the color 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.930
 I think again what is the range of 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.720
 colors I choose the color I want and 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.970
 accept ok it has already been modified too 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.210
 we can choose what is the size of the 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.210
 same 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.690
 and good in case that for example 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.270
 the page access icon does not 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.810
 like in this part of here we 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.819
 we can modify ok there is already and good 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:18.530
 let's put the icon in large size 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:20.359
 and we're going to give you a click here to create and 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.310
 is going to send me to what is the blog that 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.710
 is the page that I put it out 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.630
 because good this second option is for 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.669
 for example if you eliminated some 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.190
 direct access and they did not want to do it 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.290
 well you guys just give it a 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.750
 click here and it will appear for example 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.850
 I eliminate this they will appear all 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.490
 the shortcuts that you have 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.190
 removed and you click on it to 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.740
 come back because there is already now this 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.870
 third is of options let's go in and 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.240
 good is going to give us here the option of 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.729
 be able to modify what is the background of 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.470

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.749
 of colors one is for what are the 

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:20.339
 icons and the other is for what is the 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:22.889
 ok background 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:25.139
 see this is what the background is for and 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:28.139
 this is what the icons are for 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.210
