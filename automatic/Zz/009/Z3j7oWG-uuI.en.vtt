00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
understand and graphs the system and be

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.620 
understand and graphs the system and be
effective<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.310> way<00:02:30.550> he's<00:02:31.060> gonna<00:02:31.270> give<00:02:31.540> him

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
the ball and make plays we saw a guy

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.160 
the ball and make plays we saw a guy
like<00:02:33.730> Wes<00:02:33.970> Walker<00:02:34.240> come<00:02:34.570> into<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:34.960> system

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
like Wes Walker come into that system

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.650 
like Wes Walker come into that system
that<00:02:35.350> wasn't<00:02:35.860> necessarily<00:02:36.580> productive<00:02:37.030> say

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
that wasn't necessarily productive say

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.850 
that wasn't necessarily productive say
he<00:02:37.810> didn't<00:02:38.020> have<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.230> quarterback<00:02:38.680> or

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
he didn't have the quarterback or

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.950 
he didn't have the quarterback or
whatever<00:02:39.160> he<00:02:39.730> came<00:02:39.970> into<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.360> system<00:02:40.600> he

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
whatever he came into that system he

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.990 
whatever he came into that system he
became<00:02:41.230> one<00:02:41.410> of<00:02:41.530> our<00:02:41.650> superstars<00:02:42.220> in<00:02:42.490> this

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
became one of our superstars in this

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.400 
became one of our superstars in this
league<00:02:43.240> so<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.480> think<00:02:43.570> if<00:02:43.810> these<00:02:43.930> guys<00:02:44.110> can

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
league so I think if these guys can

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.620 
league so I think if these guys can
grasp<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.890> system<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.430> understand<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.120> they

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
grasp the system and understand it they

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.760 
grasp the system and understand it they
don't<00:02:46.840> have<00:02:46.960> to<00:02:47.080> worry<00:02:47.260> about<00:02:47.380> where<00:02:47.710> the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
don't have to worry about where the

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.350 
don't have to worry about where the
balls<00:02:47.980> gonna<00:02:48.220> be<00:02:48.430> they're<00:02:49.030> going<00:02:49.210> to<00:02:49.300> be

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
balls gonna be they're going to be

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.030 
balls gonna be they're going to be
productive<00:02:49.960> they're<00:02:50.140> gonna<00:02:50.290> make<00:02:50.530> plays<00:02:50.740> but

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
productive they're gonna make plays but

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.680 
productive they're gonna make plays but
if<00:02:51.220> their<00:02:51.400> tight<00:02:51.670> ends<00:02:51.970> which<00:02:52.120> are<00:02:52.300> receivers

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
if their tight ends which are receivers

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.810 
if their tight ends which are receivers
