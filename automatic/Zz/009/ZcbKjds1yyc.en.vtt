00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that is the big question guys because I

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.410 
that is the big question guys because I
had<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.250> DeMaria<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.059> be<00:00:54.180> honest

had this with DeMaria and to be honest

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.970 
had this with DeMaria and to be honest
it<00:00:54.539> didn't<00:00:54.809> really<00:00:54.989> affect<00:00:55.170> my<00:00:55.500> opinion<00:00:55.860> of

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
it didn't really affect my opinion of

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.099 
it didn't really affect my opinion of
DeMaria<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.579> thought<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.390> was<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> small

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
DeMaria I thought that it was a small

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.619 
DeMaria I thought that it was a small
thing<00:00:58.680> considering<00:00:59.550> how<00:00:59.820> good<00:01:00.090> he<00:01:00.210> was<00:01:00.239> yes

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
it's tricky you have to force yourself

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.500 
it's tricky you have to force yourself
on<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> correct<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:02.940> most<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> time

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510

but<00:03:39.269> by<00:03:39.389> clipping<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:40.230> defender<00:03:40.769> and

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
but by clipping that defender and

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.860

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
sending it off course it obviously goes

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.780 
sending it off course it obviously goes
into<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.169> back<00:03:43.319> of<00:03:43.349> the<00:03:43.500> net<00:03:43.709> so<00:03:44.190> we<00:03:44.639> thought
