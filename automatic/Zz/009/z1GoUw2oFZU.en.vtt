alright guys I got a oh one expedition
that<00:00:15.880> is<00:00:16.740> got<00:00:17.740> a<00:00:17.770> lot<00:00:17.950> of<00:00:17.980> problems<00:00:18.930> main

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930

light which is always a class-a misfire
it's<00:00:23.920> the<00:00:23.980> only<00:00:24.100> reason<00:00:24.279> it<00:00:24.460> flashes<00:00:25.710> as<00:00:26.710> far

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
it's the only reason it flashes as far

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.550 
it's the only reason it flashes as far
as<00:00:27.189> strategy<00:00:27.700> goes<00:00:28.200> so<00:00:29.200> you<00:00:29.230> know<00:00:29.349> you<00:00:29.439> guys

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
as strategy goes so you know you guys

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
have a type a misfire which can

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.720 
have a type a misfire which can
potentially<00:00:33.430> damage<00:00:33.640> the<00:00:33.910> cat<00:00:34.120> which<00:00:34.989> in<00:00:35.200> that

potentially damage the cat which in that

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.830 
potentially damage the cat which in that
instance<00:00:36.730> you<00:00:36.880> should<00:00:37.030> not<00:00:37.180> be<00:00:37.270> driving<00:00:37.720> it

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
instance you should not be driving it

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.350 
instance you should not be driving it
until<00:00:38.560> it's<00:00:38.680> fixed<00:00:38.920> so<00:00:39.850> we're<00:00:40.030> going<00:00:40.120> to<00:00:40.180> check

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
until it's fixed so we're going to check

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.060 
until it's fixed so we're going to check
it<00:00:40.510> out<00:00:40.600> this<00:00:40.840> one<00:00:41.050> has<00:00:41.260> a<00:00:41.290> codes<00:00:42.040> peel<00:00:42.960> 302<00:00:43.960> and

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
it out this one has a codes peel 302 and

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.020 
it out this one has a codes peel 302 and
305<00:00:45.750> let's<00:00:46.750> get<00:00:47.170> them<00:00:47.260> up<00:00:47.320> on<00:00:47.470> here<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:49.030> a<00:00:49.870> PCM

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
305 let's get them up on here in a PCM

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:00.420 
305 let's get them up on here in a PCM
where<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.120> go<00:00:52.270> where<00:00:52.480> to<00:00:52.510> go<00:00:57.270> 305<00:00:59.310> and<00:01:00.310> of

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
where to go where to go 305 and of

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.100 
where to go where to go 305 and of
course<00:01:00.730> he<00:01:00.910> has<00:01:01.000> camp<00:01:01.390> problems<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.930> then<00:01:05.019> we

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
course he has camp problems and then we

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:12.960 
course he has camp problems and then we
got<00:01:05.259> pending<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:07.090> a<00:01:07.299> 302<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.520> I<00:01:12.549> want<00:01:12.729> to<00:01:12.790> show

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
got pending of a 302 so I want to show

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.929 
got pending of a 302 so I want to show
you<00:01:13.079> this<00:01:14.079> power<00:01:14.590> balance<00:01:15.040> tool<00:01:15.310> we<00:01:15.430> got<00:01:15.640> from

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
you this power balance tool we got from

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.100 
you this power balance tool we got from
Ford<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:16.450> don't<00:01:16.600> know<00:01:16.659> if<00:01:16.720> any<00:01:16.930> other

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
Ford I don't know if any other

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.500 
Ford I don't know if any other
manufacturer<00:01:17.830> has<00:01:18.010> this<00:01:18.340> I<00:01:18.550> have<00:01:19.060> not<00:01:19.210> heard

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
manufacturer has this I have not heard

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.600 
manufacturer has this I have not heard
of<00:01:19.630> it<00:01:19.750> where<00:01:19.870> it's<00:01:19.990> in<00:01:20.050> a<00:01:20.110> graph<00:01:20.610> presentation

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
of it where it's in a graph presentation

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.540 
of it where it's in a graph presentation
like<00:01:21.790> this<00:01:21.820> and<00:01:22.720> we<00:01:22.810> can<00:01:22.990> watch<00:01:23.230> the<00:01:23.680> cylinders

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
like this and we can watch the cylinders

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.360 
like this and we can watch the cylinders
and<00:01:24.820> their<00:01:25.659> acceleration<00:01:26.590> compared<00:01:27.220> to<00:01:27.280> each

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
and their acceleration compared to each

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.100 
and their acceleration compared to each
other<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:27.850> then<00:01:28.450> it<00:01:28.540> puts<00:01:28.720> on<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.900> graph

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
other and then it puts on the graph

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.500 
other and then it puts on the graph
based<00:01:29.470> on<00:01:29.710> that<00:01:29.920> so<00:01:30.550> you<00:01:30.640> can<00:01:30.790> see<00:01:31.000> this<00:01:31.300> one

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
based on that so you can see this one

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.390 
based on that so you can see this one
has<00:01:31.630> negative<00:01:32.610> 30%<00:01:34.350> acceleration<00:01:35.400> compared

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
has negative 30% acceleration compared

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.170 
has negative 30% acceleration compared
to<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:37.180> other<00:01:37.300> cylinders<00:01:38.790> when<00:01:39.790> they're<00:01:39.940> like

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
to the other cylinders when they're like

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.270 
to the other cylinders when they're like
this<00:01:40.210> right<00:01:40.750> around<00:01:40.840> zero<00:01:41.080> they're<00:01:41.740> all<00:01:41.890> hunky

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
this right around zero they're all hunky

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.020 
this right around zero they're all hunky
door<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.520> little<00:01:42.820> bit<00:01:43.060> of<00:01:43.180> waviness<00:01:43.540> to<00:01:43.840> them

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
door a little bit of waviness to them

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.039 
door a little bit of waviness to them
we're<00:01:46.030> basically<00:01:46.180> watching<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.840> power

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
we're basically watching the power

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.730 
we're basically watching the power
contribution<00:01:47.950> so<00:01:48.790> number<00:01:49.450> eight<00:01:49.740> always

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
contribution so number eight always

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.370 
contribution so number eight always
always<00:01:51.130> always<00:01:51.640> always<00:01:52.060> on<00:01:52.510> a<00:01:52.570> gas<00:01:52.870> engine<00:01:53.170> is

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
always always always on a gas engine is

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.940 
always always always on a gas engine is
hi<00:01:53.560> I<00:01:53.830> don't<00:01:54.670> know<00:01:54.729> why<00:01:55.830> it'll<00:01:56.830> always<00:01:56.979> be<00:01:57.130> high

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
hi I don't know why it'll always be high

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.510 
hi I don't know why it'll always be high
and<00:02:00.510> one<00:02:01.510> in<00:02:01.659> five<00:02:01.960> they<00:02:02.890> seem<00:02:03.190> to<00:02:03.280> like<00:02:03.400> to

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
and one in five they seem to like to

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.190 
and one in five they seem to like to
have<00:02:03.790> a<00:02:03.820> little<00:02:04.030> dip<00:02:04.299> to<00:02:04.479> them<00:02:04.630> too<00:02:04.869> you<00:02:05.080> can

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
have a little dip to them too you can

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.680 
have a little dip to them too you can
see<00:02:05.320> number<00:02:05.560> ones<00:02:05.799> going<00:02:06.010> to<00:02:06.070> start<00:02:06.310> that<00:02:06.690> but

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
see number ones going to start that but

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.109 
see number ones going to start that but
what<00:02:08.590> you're<00:02:08.799> looking<00:02:08.830> at<00:02:09.129> on<00:02:09.369> this<00:02:09.580> and<00:02:10.030> it's

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
what you're looking at on this and it's

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.899 
what you're looking at on this and it's
clear<00:02:10.360> as<00:02:10.479> day<00:02:10.509> is<00:02:11.019> a<00:02:11.409> deep<00:02:11.799> V<00:02:12.099> like<00:02:12.370> this<00:02:12.400> a

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
clear as day is a deep V like this a

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.899 
clear as day is a deep V like this a
deep<00:02:13.209> V<00:02:13.450> is<00:02:13.659> a<00:02:13.860> deadness<00:02:14.860> or<00:02:15.549> if<00:02:15.790> you're

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
deep V is a deadness or if you're

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.460 
deep V is a deadness or if you're
driving<00:02:16.209> down<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.330> road<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.170> start

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
driving down the road and you start

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.500 
driving down the road and you start
feeling<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.920> shaking<00:02:18.310> or<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:22.330> like

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
feeling that shaking or that that like

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.510 
feeling that shaking or that that like
jerking<00:02:22.870> sensation

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
jerking sensation

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.460 
jerking sensation
and<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:25.030> happens<00:02:25.330> for<00:02:25.420> like<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.660> fraction<00:02:26.320> of<00:02:26.440> a

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
and it happens for like a fraction of a

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.740 
and it happens for like a fraction of a
second<00:02:26.890> we<00:02:27.520> can<00:02:27.550> see<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.060> on<00:02:28.150> here<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:28.300> will

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
second we can see it on here it will

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.020 
second we can see it on here it will

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
other cylinders fine so I'm going to

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.520 
other cylinders fine so I'm going to
show<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.730> today<00:02:36.820> how<00:02:37.240> to<00:02:37.270> diagnose<00:02:37.870> this

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
show you today how to diagnose this

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.760 
show you today how to diagnose this
once<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.250> get<00:02:39.460> your<00:02:39.640> codes<00:02:40.450> from<00:02:40.810> autozone<00:02:41.590> or

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
once you get your codes from autozone or

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.970 
once you get your codes from autozone or
whatever<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:43.510> see<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.110> cylinder

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
whatever and you see the a cylinder

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.040 
whatever and you see the a cylinder
three<00:02:45.250> or<00:02:45.430> five<00:02:45.670> misfire<00:02:46.120> we<00:02:46.270> can<00:02:46.390> go<00:02:46.510> after<00:02:46.900> it

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
three or five misfire we can go after it

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.540 
three or five misfire we can go after it
and<00:02:47.530> I'm<00:02:47.620> going<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:47.770> show<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.010> how<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.190> do<00:02:48.400> it

and I'm going to show you how to do it

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.100 
and I'm going to show you how to do it
and<00:02:48.700> see<00:02:49.240> you<00:02:49.330> can<00:02:49.510> save<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.750> little<00:02:49.930> bit<00:02:50.020> of

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
and see you can save a little bit of

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:58.670 
and see you can save a little bit of
money<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:52.380> do<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.470> yourself

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.460 

running<00:02:59.680> with<00:02:59.890> deadness<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:01.390> disconnect<00:03:02.140> each

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
running with deadness it disconnect each

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.410 
running with deadness it disconnect each
cylinder<00:03:03.100> one<00:03:03.400> by<00:03:03.520> one

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
cylinder one by one

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.180 
cylinder one by one
you'll<00:03:05.780> see<00:03:05.990> it<00:03:06.080> runs<00:03:06.260> works<00:03:06.530> have<00:03:06.830> got<00:03:07.040> the

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
you'll see it runs works have got the

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.100 
you'll see it runs works have got the
cylinder

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.170 

maybe<00:03:14.110> check<00:03:14.380> them<00:03:14.590> all<00:03:14.709> all<00:03:15.190> crop<00:03:15.640> park<00:03:15.970> began

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
maybe check them all all crop park began

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.260 
maybe check them all all crop park began
and<00:03:16.420> start<00:03:16.630> running<00:03:16.900> worse<00:03:17.050> like<00:03:17.319> that<00:03:17.530> right

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
and start running worse like that right

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.760 
and start running worse like that right
then<00:03:19.270> you<00:03:19.390> come<00:03:19.569> over<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.170> one<00:03:20.380> we<00:03:20.590> know

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
then you come over to the one we know

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.850 
then you come over to the one we know
already<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:21.280> misfiring

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.890 

just<00:03:27.520> number<00:03:27.790> which<00:03:28.660> is<00:03:28.780> number<00:03:29.050> five<00:03:30.900> that

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
just number which is number five that

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.250 
just number which is number five that
one<00:03:33.900> hold<00:03:34.900> it

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
one hold it

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:46.220 
one hold it
nothing<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.930> back<00:03:38.110> in<00:03:38.610> nothing

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.809 

right<00:03:47.230> there<00:03:47.470> Utah's<00:03:47.800> number<00:03:48.099> five<00:03:50.430> again<00:03:51.430> for

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
right there Utah's number five again for

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.850 
right there Utah's number five again for
example

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.310 

shaking<00:03:57.670> away<00:03:57.760> bad<00:03:59.040> let<00:04:00.040> it<00:04:00.130> back<00:04:00.220> in<00:04:01.320> moves

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
shaking away bad let it back in moves

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.900 
shaking away bad let it back in moves
out

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.990 

and<00:04:05.240> that's<00:04:05.480> how<00:04:05.630> you<00:04:05.690> know<00:04:05.930> which<00:04:06.170> one<00:04:06.440> is

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
and that's how you know which one is

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.670 
and that's how you know which one is
contributing<00:04:08.000> or<00:04:08.210> not<00:04:08.360> which<00:04:08.780> is<00:04:08.990> that<00:04:09.500> then

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
contributing or not which is that then

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.910 
contributing or not which is that then
this<00:04:10.630> now<00:04:11.630> what<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:11.840> can<00:04:12.080> do<00:04:12.320> on<00:04:12.350> quill<00:04:12.710> on

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
this now what you can do on quill on

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.740 
this now what you can do on quill on
plug<00:04:13.160> systems<00:04:13.840> let's<00:04:14.840> say<00:04:16.090> number<00:04:17.090> six<00:04:17.540> here

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.470 
plug systems let's say number six here
was<00:04:17.900> misfiring<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:19.250> all<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.120> rest<00:04:20.330> of<00:04:20.360> them

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
was misfiring and all the rest of them

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.380 
was misfiring and all the rest of them
are<00:04:20.570> finds<00:04:20.780> a<00:04:20.930> dead<00:04:21.170> miss<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:23.060> could<00:04:23.210> actually

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
are finds a dead miss you could actually

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.960 
are finds a dead miss you could actually
turn<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.050> car<00:04:24.230> off<00:04:24.260> and<00:04:24.650> swap<00:04:25.580> coils<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.770> then

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
turn the car off and swap coils and then

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.150 
turn the car off and swap coils and then
you'll<00:04:28.970> have<00:04:29.180> to<00:04:29.270> even<00:04:29.360> bolt<00:04:29.720> them<00:04:29.870> in<00:04:30.070> put<00:04:31.070> the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
you'll have to even bolt them in put the

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.990 
you'll have to even bolt them in put the
connectors<00:04:31.490> back<00:04:31.640> on<00:04:31.910> and<00:04:32.210> then<00:04:33.020> you<00:04:33.230> can

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
connectors back on and then you can

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.560 
connectors back on and then you can
start<00:04:35.000> to<00:04:35.090> be<00:04:35.210> able<00:04:35.390> to<00:04:35.480> vehicle<00:04:36.170> again<00:04:36.530> and<00:04:37.570> do

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
start to be able to vehicle again and do

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.360 
start to be able to vehicle again and do
that<00:04:38.750> RPM<00:04:39.260> drop<00:04:39.530> test<00:04:39.800> again<00:04:40.150> now<00:04:41.950> when<00:04:42.950> six

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
was misfiring before they should be

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.320 
was misfiring before they should be
misfiring<00:04:46.310> over<00:04:46.610> here<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.530> vice<00:04:48.530> versa<00:04:48.830> and

misfiring over here and vice versa and
that<00:04:50.330> way<00:04:50.480> you<00:04:50.540> know<00:04:50.840> it's<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.560> coil<00:04:51.860> at<00:04:52.280> that

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
that way you know it's the coil at that

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.900 
that way you know it's the coil at that
point<00:04:52.850> you<00:04:53.120> should<00:04:53.150> change<00:04:53.450> the<00:04:53.570> coil<00:04:53.900> and<00:04:54.140> the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
point you should change the coil and the
