00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:16.560
 Good day to all lovers 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.160
 knitting we recently did a lesson with 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.539
 on knitting here such a square 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.970
 Grandma square in the center of sanctions 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.529
 while I was his counterpart , I mounted the video to me 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.029
 got the idea to make a handbag and here on 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.290
 at a certain stage I want to show you 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.210
 what did i do the map did it if you 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.670
 it will be interesting but you can do it 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.870
 such a 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.680
 first of all yes we have tied you 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.500
 squares I got them 18 pieces and 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.340
 I tied them here in such a canvas 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.440
 Now 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.920
 I made the pattern specially 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.070
 for lining but excluding this one 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:06.100
 parts are we will have pens 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:09.020
 I made the pattern and paid me 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:15.160
 I chose just a plastic folder 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:18.860
 folder and everything and the challenge I got what 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.570
 under the broom I did at 510 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.759
 millimeters more to me 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.080
 had the opportunity to turn it and hem 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.720
 fallen i hands 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.460
 and the folder itself made a few 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.350
 millimeters down to her 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:36.430
 the bad will get in and put them together this 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.830
 all here is a canvas 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:44.690
 warp socker which warp knitted 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.910
 us sending plastic which creates 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.539
 lining seal 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.060
 sleep it turned out that I have no sidewalls that 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.190
 I did 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.069
 sidewall began to knit just like 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:02.300
 knit May on its 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:05.780
 square here is the basis and then I did not 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.349
 perform the corners of the department cool in a circle 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.200
 tied several rows and 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:15.220
 stopping chose a certain 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.590
 the width of the bag and here I tied 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:27.110
 alternating rows of double crochets and 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:30.349
 feeling of emptiness and lining here I have 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.770
 there is a lining and on the side of the fir just 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:36.290
 individual cutouts and hands over 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:41.209
 when I did it 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:45.469
 foundation and baccarin villa hook and just 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:52.069
 here is tied so here pens on me 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:57.310
 the question is how to make a pen 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:03:02.349
 I suggest the pen thought for a long time and 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:07.609
 see here I have a stick 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:12.170
 I am the size of my canvas 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:16.010
 I cut the bitch's wand in half and 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.480
 made here on a spider then you are 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.120
 holes this in order to be 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.349
 opportunity I attach and now I 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:29.209
 I will show you how I plan to do a 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:32.829
 then do and see a man ideally 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.829
 sit and I break it 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.830
 so show my version of the pens one pen 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.250
 I have already stopped and now I will show you how 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.980
 did another said she drilled 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:54.430
 detachment to lead along the edges of their way to the metal 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:55.000
 then gently heel color sewed this 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.980
 pen 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.489
 now i sprained and 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:07.959
 hand lettered thread neatly 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:16.090
 needle in the color of the lining and the very 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:20.470
 knitting food like here so final 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:24.520
 result, I decided two sides by inserting 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.240
 go there bamboo sticks this is a creeper with 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.030
 two sides 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.910
 I decided here's your plasmid 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.979
 as fasteners even completely 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.280
 easy I tried the price at 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:39.430
 as far as possible you dance through 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.460
 in order for georges to be washed 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.580
 magnet has not escaped and here's buttoning 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.510
 we have a handbag like this 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:52.360
 original clutch 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.910
 you can pull it off yourself 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.090
 the square we learned to knit and now 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.150
 collected just such clutches 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:04.419
 so all the best to you before your new 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.860
 lessons to new meetings and you creative 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.860
