00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
place for it to fit these screws have to

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:22.240 
place for it to fit these screws have to
go<00:01:10.500> down<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> long<00:01:11.040> channel

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.630 

so<00:01:22.760> what<00:01:22.910> I<00:01:22.940> usually<00:01:23.000> end<00:01:23.360> up<00:01:23.450> doing<00:01:24.640> because

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
so what I usually end up doing because

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.860 
so what I usually end up doing because
even<00:01:26.000> if<00:01:26.090> you've<00:01:26.180> got<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.360> magnetic

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
even if you've got a magnetic

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.310 
even if you've got a magnetic
screwdriver<00:01:26.990> it<00:01:27.530> tends<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.800> get<00:01:28.310> affected<00:01:29.320> in

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
screwdriver it tends to get affected in

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.410 
screwdriver it tends to get affected in
a<00:01:30.590> while<00:01:31.130> you<00:01:31.280> know<00:01:31.340> these<00:01:31.490> I'll<00:01:31.850> take<00:01:32.120> them<00:01:32.390> to

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
a while you know these I'll take them to

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:44.219 
a while you know these I'll take them to
the<00:01:32.780> screwdriver<00:01:36.850> try<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.000> take<00:01:38.180> them<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.570> the

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.929 

which<00:01:44.710> houses<00:01:44.979> not<00:01:45.280> usually<00:01:45.640> had<00:01:45.790> these

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
which houses not usually had these

00:01:45.939 --> 00:02:03.109 
which houses not usually had these
champions<00:01:46.420> in

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.480 

so<00:02:03.990> because<00:02:04.229> you've<00:02:04.350> got<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.799> long<00:02:05.070> channel

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
so because you've got the long channel

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.650 
so because you've got the long channel
that<00:02:05.789> the<00:02:05.939> things<00:02:06.149> gonna<00:02:06.329> go<00:02:06.600> down<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:12.510> can

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
that the things gonna go down you can

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.220 
that the things gonna go down you can
easily<00:02:12.810> see<00:02:13.140> with<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.319> flashlight<00:02:15.050> it's<00:02:16.050> got
