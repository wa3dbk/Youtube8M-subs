the original books by John Holt and I

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.050 
the original books by John Holt and I
was<00:03:30.930> very<00:03:31.080> impressed<00:03:31.260> with<00:03:31.590> with<00:03:32.250> what<00:03:32.790> he<00:03:32.910> was

was very impressed with with what he was
saying<00:03:33.300> about<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:34.140> school<00:03:34.380> system<00:03:34.770> at<00:03:34.860> that

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
saying about the school system at that

education<00:03:37.890> has<00:03:38.190> now<00:03:38.340> changed<00:03:38.700> in<00:03:39.090> our<00:03:39.240> schools

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
education has now changed in our schools

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.199 
education has now changed in our schools
and<00:03:39.870> we've<00:03:40.380> adopted<00:03:40.650> those<00:03:41.040> very<00:03:41.640> important

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
and we've adopted those very important

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.820 
and we've adopted those very important
new<00:03:42.360> approaches<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.170> which<00:03:43.620> we<00:03:43.800> call

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
new approaches to it which we call

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.949 
new approaches to it which we call
immersive<00:03:44.550> learning<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.480> very<00:03:45.690> best

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
immersive learning and the very best

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.960 
immersive learning and the very best
teaching<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.620> we<00:03:46.740> see<00:03:46.980> in<00:03:47.490> our<00:03:47.640> schools

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
teaching that we see in our schools

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.600 
teaching that we see in our schools
today<00:03:48.320> is<00:03:49.320> based<00:03:49.650> on<00:03:49.860> those<00:03:49.980> fundamental

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
today is based on those fundamental

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.660 
today is based on those fundamental
principles<00:03:50.720> that<00:03:51.720> we<00:03:52.230> let<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.500> child<00:03:52.740> lead

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
principles that we let the child lead

you about this now when you're
unschooling<00:03:57.330> your<00:03:57.540> kids<00:03:57.750> at<00:03:57.840> home<00:03:58.020> or<00:03:58.140> you're

unschooling your kids at home or you're

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.380 
unschooling your kids at home or you're
teaching<00:03:59.010> them<00:03:59.100> really<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.970> puts<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.209> lot<00:04:00.330> of

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
teaching them really that puts a lot of

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.760 
teaching them really that puts a lot of
pressure<00:04:00.660> on<00:04:00.810> their<00:04:00.959> parents<00:04:01.320> to<00:04:01.410> inspire

pressure on their parents to inspire
them<00:04:01.980> with<00:04:02.010> ideas<00:04:02.520> to<00:04:02.700> educate<00:04:03.690> them<00:04:03.840> even<00:04:04.080> if

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
them with ideas to educate them even if

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.900 
them with ideas to educate them even if
that<00:04:04.320> is<00:04:04.440> in<00:04:04.590> their<00:04:04.709> own<00:04:04.830> time<00:04:05.160> tell<00:04:05.700> us<00:04:05.790> what

that is in their own time tell us what

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.500 
that is in their own time tell us what
you<00:04:06.030> had<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.270> do<00:04:06.420> with<00:04:06.600> that<00:04:07.130> well<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.910> taught

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
you had to do with that well I I taught

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.970 
you had to do with that well I I taught
them<00:04:09.720> in<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.959> way<00:04:10.050> that<00:04:10.080> I<00:04:10.290> was<00:04:10.500> trained<00:04:10.830> when

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
them in the way that I was trained when

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.400 
them in the way that I was trained when
I<00:04:11.070> studied<00:04:11.910> education<00:04:12.450> they<00:04:12.660> said<00:04:13.140> the

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
I studied education they said the

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.530 
I studied education they said the
schools<00:04:13.709> will<00:04:13.920> change<00:04:14.310> but<00:04:14.910> they<00:04:15.000> didn't<00:04:15.470> in

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
schools will change but they didn't in

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.580 
schools will change but they didn't in
experimental<00:04:18.540> schools<00:04:18.840> in<00:04:19.049> laboratory

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
experimental schools in laboratory

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.930 
experimental schools in laboratory
schools<00:04:19.950> a<00:04:20.190> lot<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.430> these<00:04:20.520> things<00:04:20.730> were

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
schools a lot of these things were

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.480 
schools a lot of these things were
proven<00:04:21.330> and<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:22.080> works<00:04:22.229> very<00:04:22.410> very<00:04:22.530> well<00:04:23.250> in<00:04:23.430> a

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
proven and it works very very well in a

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.860 
proven and it works very very well in a
family<00:04:24.020> for

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
family for

to say that a child can't learn to read
without<00:04:28.720> being<00:04:29.080> taught<00:04:29.380> is<00:04:29.740> false<00:04:30.010> because

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
without being taught is false because

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.159 
without being taught is false because
all<00:04:30.790> of<00:04:30.820> my<00:04:31.090> children<00:04:31.300> did<00:04:31.600> I<00:04:31.750> know<00:04:31.810> personally

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
learned to read at two or three and then

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.230
