00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello and welcome to two 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.899
 commented the mystical shot at yours 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.220
 Mythical comments and questions goes 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.440
 So let's start 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.620
 now come to say mÃ¼ller that was 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.450
 loud charm writes shows you freeze 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.430
 Little son of a bitch fallberg in hell 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.289
 you do not even have the same level 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.210
 of little stars stare asterisks 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.330
 sternchen you're just one 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.859
 perfect piece of shit yes, so I have to 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.340
 I really wonder now 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.410
 seriously 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.810
 So if someone writes something like that 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.550
 he wants to provoke me with that 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.280
 or he wants to meet me 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.950
 with or in such people 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.200
 really that much that hate that kind of thing 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.640
 one writes about a person one yes 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.290
 I almost do not want to know everyone 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.899
 case very interesting and will not 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.809
 also very interested in what looks like this 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.050
 human being or how does he behave in the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.420
 real life friend sascha because you 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.800
 this is what you see tell me something 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.140
 are you for a person in real life 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.980
 sues as an answer yes somehow with the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.430
 next eggs 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.650
 but for me anyway how do you get 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.080
 to which I loved it is no longer possible 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.369
 june writes the square root of 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.960
 one quarter is not one 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.970
 again what I have learned, I ask myself 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.200
 Again the combination of something in the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.509
 to write comments such a 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.229
 general random information and should 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:26.430
 i knew about a quarter of square 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.840
 a halt half-lasting is a horse 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.320
 Now you have something from me again 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.170
 learned 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.970
 I'm happy about all four 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.680
 every time mega if you have a video 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.810
 Does anyone upload that to someone when they 're on the phone ? 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.759
 You just live the whole day 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.229
 could hear a good injured 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.790
 logan me but the question like that 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.040
 not put in front of me anyway 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.119
 I answer them I do not believe me 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.570
 really impress that 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.460
 Many people think they can not 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.290
 all day because I mean myself 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.700
 I can not live myself all day 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.740
 that could be too much for me 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.920
 exhausting, I mean 70 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.350
 percent needed being a human 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.530
 the say no one here had to place in 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.090
 which depend on the whole time to ring 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.820
 can because eventually you will be the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.649
 too much but also his peace 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.869
 I need more rest than others but 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.760
 thanks for the lob master team writes 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.470
 you might be cool and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.900
 seems to be authentic though 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.540
 somehow all youtuber can be 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:24.610
 push up and become commercial resp 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.470
 mainstream what should i do with such a 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.880
 At the beginning of the comment I mean I ask 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.890
 it is a praise to me or me now 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.360
 he says I'm cool and 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.250
 seem to be authentic 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.680
 then suddenly he talks about everyone 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.640
 youtuber so i belong to youtube 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.410
 also in quotes 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.680
 would have been the one was and 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.750
 can be pushed up and commercial or 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.760
 becoming mainstream is for me that 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.530
 to be opposite of authentic wherein 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.450
 push it up again that's a thing 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.100
 be a video already said I am 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.420
 it does not matter why it too 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.130
 again only the range increases but 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.799
 commercial or mainstream 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.660
 to get money is then 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.280
 but the opposite of authentic 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.810
 because you pretend to be somebody 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.549
 if one is not so he says 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.380
 you seem to be authentic though 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.970
 somehow all youtuber are not 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.140
 authentic if I'm authentic now 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.579
 or not I try authentically too 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.500
 I tried to be like me 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.480
 I'm in my videos and unlike too 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.370
 I do not think so to many others 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.720
 I have to drive this rail now 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.829
 necessarily any things say that 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.269
 want to hear people 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.920
 I have to do some things 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.360
 want to see the people but I do 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.500
 what I bock it comes from the 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.850
 Good reason maybe because I am myself 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.980
 in the core of the thing loud charm 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.870
 for example, that's pretty nice to me 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.860
 I did not criticize that gun 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.150
 do not try commercial 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.070
 or to become humans, however 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.740
 you will see how it all comes 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.150
 Maybe I will go to several reviews 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.170
 comment on it again if you 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.430
 want to be there writes one 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.570
 Comment or something completely 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.840
 swap things are down 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.840
 embarrassed to watch and bye
