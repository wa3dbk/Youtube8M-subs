00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
striders learn something from each

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.520

fighter<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.850> think<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.479> went<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> game

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
fighter so on I think I went with a game

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.010 
fighter so on I think I went with a game
plan<00:01:43.560> first<00:01:44.280> three<00:01:44.579> rounds<00:01:44.729> wasn't<00:01:45.720> working

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
plan first three rounds wasn't working

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.280 
plan first three rounds wasn't working
so<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.200> had<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> box<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.220> box<00:01:47.369> my<00:01:47.970> my<00:01:48.390> opponent<00:01:48.750> yeah

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you were throwing punches in bunches all

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.670 
you were throwing punches in bunches all
night<00:01:51.450> long<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> couple<00:01:52.020> times<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.380> saw<00:01:52.530> I

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
night long a couple times we saw I

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.780 
night long a couple times we saw I
almost<00:01:52.920> looked<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.369> were<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.520> working

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
almost looked like you were just working

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.980 
almost looked like you were just working
the<00:01:53.939> speed<00:01:54.240> bag<00:01:54.390> there<00:01:54.659> with<00:01:54.810> how<00:01:54.930> many

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the speed bag there with how many

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.990 
the speed bag there with how many
punches<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.890> were<00:01:55.979> letting<00:01:56.159> go<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.850> know

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
punches you were letting go but I know

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.700 
punches you were letting go but I know
moving<00:01:57.450> forward<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.110> would<00:01:58.200> probably<00:01:58.680> like

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
moving forward you would probably like

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.469 
moving forward you would probably like
to<00:01:58.890> deliver<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.369> little<00:01:59.610> bit<00:01:59.729> more<00:01:59.880> power<00:02:00.119> on

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
to deliver a little bit more power on

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.300 
to deliver a little bit more power on
some<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.110> those<00:02:01.200> punches<00:02:01.439> maybe<00:02:01.710> sit<00:02:02.009> down<00:02:02.159> on

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
some of those punches maybe sit down on

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.380 
some of those punches maybe sit down on
those<00:02:02.399> punches<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:02.969> something<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.240> you

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
those punches is that something that you

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.789 
those punches is that something that you
can<00:02:03.540> see<00:02:03.659> yourself<00:02:03.780> as<00:02:04.200> some<00:02:04.500> room<00:02:04.649> for

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
can see yourself as some room for

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.080 
can see yourself as some room for
improvement<00:02:04.860> going<00:02:05.460> forward<00:02:05.729> against<00:02:05.939> better

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
improvement going forward against better

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.540 
improvement going forward against better
competition<00:02:06.270> yeah<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.049> feel

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
competition yeah I feel

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.460 
competition yeah I feel
improve<00:02:07.820> a<00:02:07.880> lot<00:02:07.970> of<00:02:08.090> things<00:02:08.270> at<00:02:08.960> the<00:02:09.050> same<00:02:09.200> time

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.960 
improve a lot of things at the same time
I<00:02:09.530> think<00:02:09.710> I<00:02:09.979> was<00:02:10.130> thinking<00:02:10.670> too<00:02:10.700> much<00:02:10.820> of<00:02:11.300> not

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
I think I was thinking too much of not

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.700 
I think I was thinking too much of not
throwing<00:02:13.970> our<00:02:14.090> punches<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.690> get<00:02:14.840> drained<00:02:15.200> for

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
the last rounds but I think I did a 10
