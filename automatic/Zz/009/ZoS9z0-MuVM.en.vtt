00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.291
What if I could
put him in front of you,

00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:05.458
the man that ruined your life?

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.922
If I could guarantee
that you'd get away with it?

00:00:09.416 --> 00:00:10.866
Would you kill him?

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:15.762
Many New-yorkers are leaving the city

00:00:16.012 --> 00:00:18.125
in fear of a fifth attack
by the Fizzle Bomber.

00:00:19.107 --> 00:00:20.708
Maybe he's doing the city a favor.

00:00:20.874 --> 00:00:22.740
That kind of talk
will get you in trouble.

00:00:22.865 --> 00:00:25.250
No worse
than I already been through.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.919
There's something this job has taught me
is that truth is stranger than fiction.

00:00:29.044 --> 00:00:30.708
You're not talking
about bar-tending?

00:00:30.874 --> 00:00:32.250
Not talking about bar-tending.

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:34.666
Follow me right in here.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:36.708
Here we go.

00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:40.036
Deep breaths.

00:00:40.462 --> 00:00:41.583
We're in 1963.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.435
That's impossible.

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:46.498
I'm a temporal agent.
We prevent crime before it takes place.

00:00:46.748 --> 00:00:49.625
The Fizzle Bomber,
his next explosion

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:51.490
will leave 11 000 dead.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.750
You can do this.

00:00:53.764 --> 00:00:54.583
Right.

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:57.417
You have skills
you've never had the chance to use

00:00:57.583 --> 00:00:59.000
and I can give you that chance.

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:02.666
- I get to be a temporal agent?
- If you prove yourself.

00:01:02.874 --> 00:01:05.042
- Do I have a choice?
- You always have a choice.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:07.250
10...

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.416
9...

00:01:08.624 --> 00:01:10.917
I always knew
something was different about me.

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:15.389
You're a gift given to the world
through a predestination paradox.

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:16.903
You're the only one.

00:01:17.414 --> 00:01:19.666
You can save millions of lives.

00:01:25.494 --> 00:01:27.000
You must complete your mission.

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:28.772
You must lay the seeds
for the future.

00:01:29.403 --> 00:01:31.667
Here you are,
that's the beginning of your new life.

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:36.500
I know where I come from.

00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:39.603
Where do all you
zombies come from?

00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:49.625
You're here to create history,
influence what is to come.

00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:53.625
Time catches up with us all.

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:56.625
The path you're on
will take you to your destination.

00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:06.029
