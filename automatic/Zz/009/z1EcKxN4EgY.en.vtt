00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
will work better if you do it exactly in

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.420 
will work better if you do it exactly in
this<00:01:59.790> order<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.689> these<00:02:00.990> examples<00:02:01.469> I've<00:02:01.920> used

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
this order in these examples I've used

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.730 
this order in these examples I've used
the<00:02:02.790> low<00:02:03.000> cross<00:02:03.329> combination<00:02:04.020> meaning<00:02:04.590> that
