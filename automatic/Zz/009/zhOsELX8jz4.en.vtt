00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.410
 welcome to the new video in these 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:11.500
 moments we meet at the stand of 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.990
 sony in this mobile world congress 2014 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.990
 to meet one of your products 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.050
 stars of the year the new xperia z 2 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.619
 good as you can see resembles 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.420
 pretty to the model previous to xperia z 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.280
 1 but it entails many differences 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.900
 to start the view up to the size of 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.930
 the screen has grown we have gone from 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.250
 five inches to 5.2 and we have we 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.710
 Last of using a technology 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.870
 enrolled minus bit color led with what 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.300
 which we extend the whole color palette 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.400
 and on the spectrum, you can see 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.800
 clearly like the red and green color 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.390
 is much more emphasized than 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.760
 we get with that the colors of 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.570
 the screen are much more alive 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.270
 on the other hand 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.920
 we also find a very improvement 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.650
 substantial as far as sound is concerned 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.120
 since we are going to have two speakers 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.280
 which we are going to get a sound 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.229
 stereo one on the top and another on 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.229
 the lower part of the front 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.770
 we have gotten still 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.000
 lighten it not only in size but 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.850
 but in weight is now even more 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.040
 thin than its predecessor and the battery 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.900
 instead of having 3000 milliamps and 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.900
 now opt with 3200 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.380
 the processor is also a processor 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.140
 again we use the snapdragon of 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.700
 qualcomm the model 801 and the improvement that 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.619
 contributes to some of the best performance and 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.600
 less battery consumption we happen to have 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.430
 3 gigs of ram memory when before 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.370
 we had 2 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.990
 one of the things highlight of this 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.420
 model is that it is the first 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.380
 waterproof smartphone that records 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.469
 in 4k 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.000
 that is four times with more quality 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.000
 of the hd format
