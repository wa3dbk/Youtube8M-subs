00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
this is a 2011 Ural theorem it is so

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.490 
this is a 2011 Ural theorem it is so
funky<00:00:23.859> it's<00:00:24.039> cool<00:00:24.310> and<00:00:24.759> I<00:00:25.689> just<00:00:25.779> got<00:00:26.470> done

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
funky it's cool and I just got done

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
of itself is a big attention-getting

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.350 
of itself is a big attention-getting
motorcycle<00:00:31.359> but<00:00:31.899> this<00:00:32.879> generates<00:00:33.879> even<00:00:34.180> more

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
motorcycle but this generates even more

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.329 
motorcycle but this generates even more
attention<00:00:34.839> and<00:00:35.019> it's<00:00:35.769> a<00:00:35.860> different<00:00:36.160> kind<00:00:36.280> of

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:36.339 
attention and it's a different kind of

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:38.040 
attention and it's a different kind of
attention<00:00:36.580> people<00:00:37.239> recognize<00:00:37.660> this<00:00:37.809> as<00:00:37.989> a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
attention people recognize this as a

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.900 
attention people recognize this as a
motorcycle<00:00:38.290> in<00:00:38.710> a<00:00:38.769> sidecar<00:00:39.010> but<00:00:39.640> they

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
motorcycle in a sidecar but they

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.600 
motorcycle in a sidecar but they
recognize<00:00:40.480> it<00:00:40.690> that<00:00:40.720> it<00:00:41.379> is<00:00:41.710> it's<00:00:42.280> old-school

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
recognize it that it is it's old-school

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.750 
recognize it that it is it's old-school
it's<00:00:43.150> something<00:00:43.629> that<00:00:43.870> it's<00:00:44.500> familiar<00:00:45.129> but

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
it's something that it's familiar but

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.149 
it's something that it's familiar but
you<00:00:45.879> don't<00:00:46.089> see<00:00:46.360> very<00:00:46.600> often<00:00:46.930> and<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.920> type<00:00:48.129> of

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
you don't see very often and the type of

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.829 
you don't see very often and the type of
attention<00:00:48.489> that<00:00:48.729> it<00:00:48.909> generates<00:00:49.299> is<00:00:49.449> very<00:00:49.659> may

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
attention that it generates is very may

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.299 
attention that it generates is very may
vary<00:00:50.080> so<00:00:50.440> a<00:00:50.470> lot<00:00:50.619> of<00:00:50.650> people<00:00:50.949> will<00:00:51.070> come<00:00:51.280> over

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
vary so a lot of people will come over

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.399 
vary so a lot of people will come over
and<00:00:51.820> want<00:00:52.360> to<00:00:52.420> talk<00:00:52.600> to<00:00:52.809> me<00:00:52.930> about<00:00:53.080> this

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
and want to talk to me about this

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.229 
and want to talk to me about this
motorcycle<00:00:53.680> and<00:00:54.220> they<00:00:54.519> think<00:00:54.790> that<00:00:54.850> it's<00:00:55.059> old

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
motorcycle and they think that it's old

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.250 
motorcycle and they think that it's old
and<00:00:55.449> they're<00:00:55.540> right<00:00:55.720> I<00:00:55.750> mean<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.080> technology

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
and they're right I mean the technology

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.140 
and they're right I mean the technology
onboard<00:00:57.010> this<00:00:57.159> thing<00:00:57.400> you<00:00:57.610> know<00:00:57.670> harkens<00:00:58.089> back

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
onboard this thing you know harkens back

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.990 
onboard this thing you know harkens back
to<00:00:58.299> world<00:00:58.659> war<00:00:58.839> ii<00:00:59.110> it<00:00:59.500> runs<00:00:59.979> with<00:01:00.430> modern

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
to world war ii it runs with modern

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.229 
to world war ii it runs with modern
efficiency<00:01:01.600> but<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:03.309> is<00:01:03.519> very<00:01:03.790> simplistic

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
efficiency but it is very simplistic

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.899 
efficiency but it is very simplistic
sentence<00:01:04.780> manner<00:01:04.989> it's<00:01:05.770> different<00:01:06.280> F<00:01:06.520> itself

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
sentence manner it's different F itself

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.020 
sentence manner it's different F itself
-<00:01:07.150> and<00:01:07.360> it's<00:01:07.869> ride<00:01:08.110> this<00:01:08.740> is<00:01:08.979> something<00:01:09.460> that

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
- and it's ride this is something that

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.690 
- and it's ride this is something that
because<00:01:10.750> of<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:10.990> sidecar<00:01:11.530> it<00:01:11.830> creates<00:01:12.400> a

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
because of the sidecar it creates a

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.640 
because of the sidecar it creates a
whole<00:01:13.180> different<00:01:13.630> effect<00:01:13.900> it's<00:01:14.170> kind<00:01:14.409> of<00:01:14.470> like

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
whole different effect it's kind of like

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.550 
whole different effect it's kind of like
a<00:01:14.939> free<00:01:15.939> radical<00:01:16.180> spinning<00:01:17.049> out<00:01:17.200> there<00:01:17.439> you

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
a free radical spinning out there you

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.230 
a free radical spinning out there you
just<00:01:17.740> not<00:01:17.920> quite<00:01:18.189> sure<00:01:18.220> what<00:01:18.640> is<00:01:18.790> going<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:19.060> do

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
just not quite sure what is going to do

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.560 
just not quite sure what is going to do
you're<00:01:19.900> going<00:01:20.140> down<00:01:20.289> the<00:01:20.439> freeway<00:01:20.649> and<00:01:21.570> you

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
you're going down the freeway and you

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.480 
you're going down the freeway and you
know<00:01:22.689> with<00:01:23.049> your<00:01:23.229> two<00:01:23.469> little<00:01:23.710> wheels<00:01:24.130> in<00:01:24.310> line

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
know with your two little wheels in line

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.789 
know with your two little wheels in line
with<00:01:24.850> a<00:01:24.880> normal<00:01:25.570> motorcycle<00:01:26.229> you<00:01:26.560> know<00:01:26.649> it's

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
with a normal motorcycle you know it's

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.080 
with a normal motorcycle you know it's
going<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:27.009> track<00:01:27.249> and<00:01:27.460> sometimes<00:01:27.609> you<00:01:27.909> know<00:01:27.999> it

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
going to track and sometimes you know it

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.580 
going to track and sometimes you know it
feels<00:01:28.210> as<00:01:28.420> grooves<00:01:28.659> a<00:01:28.810> little<00:01:29.020> bit<00:01:29.170> but<00:01:29.469> then

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
feels as grooves a little bit but then

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.289 
feels as grooves a little bit but then
with<00:01:29.679> this<00:01:29.799> third<00:01:30.070> wheel<00:01:30.340> out<00:01:30.609> here<00:01:30.909> you<00:01:31.210> know

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
with this third wheel out here you know

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.969 
with this third wheel out here you know
sometimes<00:01:31.719> it<00:01:31.899> kind<00:01:32.109> of<00:01:32.170> wants<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.469> do<00:01:32.649> its<00:01:32.829> own

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
sometimes it kind of wants to do its own

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.789 
sometimes it kind of wants to do its own
thing<00:01:33.039> and<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.659> more<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:34.990> ride<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.590> more

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
thing and the more you ride it the more

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.260 
thing and the more you ride it the more
you<00:01:35.920> become<00:01:36.249> accustomed<00:01:36.369> to<00:01:36.789> this<00:01:36.939> and<00:01:37.210> the

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
you become accustomed to this and the

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.330 
you become accustomed to this and the
more<00:01:37.479> you<00:01:37.810> can<00:01:38.109> compensate<00:01:38.590> for<00:01:38.890> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
more you can compensate for the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.249 
more you can compensate for the
different<00:01:39.759> effects<00:01:40.090> caused<00:01:40.390> by<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.689> sidecar

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
different effects caused by the sidecar

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.139 
different effects caused by the sidecar
it's<00:01:42.159> not<00:01:42.280> just<00:01:42.460> going<00:01:42.579> down<00:01:42.789> the<00:01:42.909> freeway

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
it's not just going down the freeway

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.879 
it's not just going down the freeway
when<00:01:43.840> you're<00:01:44.049> going<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.259> get<00:01:44.469> some<00:01:44.679> kind<00:01:44.799> of

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:44.889 
when you're going to get some kind of

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:47.099 
when you're going to get some kind of
adverse<00:01:45.249> effect<00:01:45.609> from<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:45.850> sidecar<00:01:46.359> it's

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
adverse effect from the sidecar it's

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:48.899 
adverse effect from the sidecar it's
even<00:01:47.439> just<00:01:47.469> around<00:01:47.920> town<00:01:48.159> when<00:01:48.700> you're

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
even just around town when you're

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.669

clutch and giving it some throttle it's

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.399

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
apply some front brake you're going to

you're turning left you kind of want to
throw<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.430> side<00:02:44.670> because<00:02:45.030> you're

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
throw you to that side because you're

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.550 
throw you to that side because you're
not<00:02:45.299> leaning<00:02:45.569> into<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:46.019> like<00:02:46.200> an<00:02:46.379> old

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
not leaning into it like an old

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.680 
not leaning into it like an old
motorcycle<00:02:46.830> but<00:02:47.549> you<00:02:47.670> do<00:02:47.970> lean<00:02:48.330> into<00:02:48.660> it

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
motorcycle but you do lean into it

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.410 
motorcycle but you do lean into it
especially<00:02:49.019> with<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.620> sidehack<00:02:50.280> here<00:02:50.640> you

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
especially with the sidehack here you

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.930 
especially with the sidehack here you
take<00:02:51.599> a<00:02:51.660> right<00:02:51.930> hand<00:02:52.170> corner<00:02:52.560> and

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
take a right hand corner and

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.430 
take a right hand corner and
surprisingly<00:02:53.940> it's<00:02:54.209> very<00:02:54.450> easy<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.870> lift<00:02:55.260> this

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
surprisingly it's very easy to lift this

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.199 
surprisingly it's very easy to lift this
thing<00:02:55.500> up<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:56.040> little<00:02:56.069> bit<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.579> only<00:02:56.730> took<00:02:56.940> me<00:02:57.090> to

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
thing up a little bit it only took me to

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.180 
thing up a little bit it only took me to
the<00:02:57.329> second<00:02:57.720> day<00:02:57.900> at<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.140> very<00:02:58.440> tight<00:02:58.769> kind<00:02:59.130> of

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
the second day at a very tight kind of

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.400 
the second day at a very tight kind of
on-ramp<00:02:59.760> Road<00:03:00.030> where<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.079> know<00:03:01.170> the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
on-ramp Road where the you know the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.280 
on-ramp Road where the you know the
sidecar<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:01.920> coming<00:03:02.250> up<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:03.690> can<00:03:03.870> get<00:03:03.930> away

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
sidecar is coming up you can get away

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.949 
sidecar is coming up you can get away
from<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.920> easily<00:03:05.400> by<00:03:05.579> having<00:03:06.360> some<00:03:06.540> balanced

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
from that easily by having some balanced

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.690 
from that easily by having some balanced
of<00:03:07.049> course<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.379> pallet<00:03:07.769> passenger<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.459> going<00:03:08.640> to

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
of course a pallet passenger is going to

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.640 
of course a pallet passenger is going to
create<00:03:08.879> that<00:03:09.180> but<00:03:09.690> even<00:03:09.989> just<00:03:10.110> throw<00:03:10.349> it<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.560> a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
create that but even just throw it in a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.170 
create that but even just throw it in a
bag<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:11.099> sand<00:03:11.310> or<00:03:11.549> something<00:03:11.760> like<00:03:11.819> that<00:03:12.060> it

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
bag of sand or something like that it

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.180 
bag of sand or something like that it
does<00:03:12.329> make<00:03:12.510> this<00:03:12.690> thing<00:03:12.840> easier<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.530> ride<00:03:13.799> and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
does make this thing easier to ride and

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:25.600 
does make this thing easier to ride and
easier<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.730> navigate<00:03:14.970> right<00:03:15.720> hand<00:03:15.959> corners

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.760 

now<00:03:26.030> I<00:03:26.060> spoke<00:03:26.390> about<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.900> antiquity<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:27.500> this

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
now I spoke about the antiquity of this

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.950 
now I spoke about the antiquity of this
machine<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.460> granted<00:03:29.360> it<00:03:29.480> is<00:03:29.600> it<00:03:29.840> is

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
machine and granted it is it is

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.990 
machine and granted it is it is
simplistic<00:03:30.590> but<00:03:30.830> it<00:03:31.040> does<00:03:31.280> have<00:03:31.490> some<00:03:31.700> modern

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
simplistic but it does have some modern

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.580 
simplistic but it does have some modern
amenities<00:03:32.240> on<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:32.750> especially<00:03:33.170> right<00:03:33.350> here

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
amenities on it especially right here

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.490 
amenities on it especially right here
with<00:03:34.040> this<00:03:34.190> large<00:03:34.490> front<00:03:35.120> Brembo<00:03:35.870> disc<00:03:36.200> brake

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
with this large front Brembo disc brake

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.070 
with this large front Brembo disc brake
a<00:03:36.710> lot<00:03:37.130> of<00:03:37.280> good<00:03:37.430> stopping<00:03:37.760> power<00:03:38.090> here<00:03:38.600> it's<00:03:38.810> a

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
a lot of good stopping power here it's a

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.500 
a lot of good stopping power here it's a
little<00:03:39.320> mushy<00:03:39.560> at<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.340> lever<00:03:40.850> even<00:03:41.300> though<00:03:41.390> it

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
little mushy at the lever even though it

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.060 
little mushy at the lever even though it
has<00:03:41.630> a<00:03:41.660> steel<00:03:41.960> braided<00:03:42.200> line<00:03:42.530> of<00:03:42.680> course<00:03:42.860> that

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
has a steel braided line of course that

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.320 
has a steel braided line of course that
could<00:03:43.190> probably<00:03:43.280> blood<00:03:43.670> out<00:03:43.820> a<00:03:43.850> little<00:03:44.060> bit

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
could probably blood out a little bit

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.750 
could probably blood out a little bit
yeah<00:03:44.960> you<00:03:45.050> can<00:03:45.320> easily<00:03:45.620> lock<00:03:45.980> up<00:03:46.250> this<00:03:46.400> front

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
yeah you can easily lock up this front

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.720 
yeah you can easily lock up this front
end<00:03:47.030> with<00:03:47.630> you<00:03:47.810> know<00:03:47.900> three<00:03:48.200> fingers

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
end with you know three fingers

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.000 
end with you know three fingers
application<00:03:49.780> now<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:51.200> could<00:03:51.470> also<00:03:51.680> be

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
application now that could also be

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.290 
application now that could also be
because<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:52.700> know<00:03:52.730> you're<00:03:52.910> not<00:03:53.030> quite

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
because you know you're not quite

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.880 
because you know you're not quite
getting<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:53.870> weight<00:03:54.050> bias<00:03:54.470> that<00:03:54.590> you<00:03:54.650> would

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
getting the weight bias that you would

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.470 
getting the weight bias that you would
on<00:03:55.010> a<00:03:55.040> normal<00:03:55.100> motorcycle<00:03:55.970> when<00:03:56.090> you<00:03:56.180> hit<00:03:56.360> your

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
on a normal motorcycle when you hit your

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.050 
on a normal motorcycle when you hit your
front<00:03:56.720> brake<00:03:56.870> but<00:03:57.620> um<00:03:57.830> yeah<00:03:58.100> it<00:03:58.460> does<00:03:58.850> have<00:03:58.880> a

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
front brake but um yeah it does have a

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.970 
front brake but um yeah it does have a
lot<00:03:59.300> of<00:03:59.330> good<00:03:59.540> stopping<00:03:59.930> power<00:04:00.080> combined<00:04:00.950> with

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
lot of good stopping power combined with

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.430 
lot of good stopping power combined with
you<00:04:01.430> know<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.700> two<00:04:02.000> rear<00:04:02.360> brakes<00:04:02.720> at<00:04:02.990> the<00:04:03.230> same

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
you know the two rear brakes at the same

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.140 
you know the two rear brakes at the same
time<00:04:03.709> it<00:04:04.190> will<00:04:04.250> haul<00:04:04.459> this<00:04:04.610> machine<00:04:05.000> down

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
time it will haul this machine down

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.570 
time it will haul this machine down
pretty<00:04:05.360> quick<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.740> bike<00:04:06.920> itself<00:04:07.310> it

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
pretty quick and the bike itself it

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.060 
pretty quick and the bike itself it
weighs<00:04:07.790> about<00:04:08.209> you<00:04:08.510> know<00:04:08.630> 800<00:04:09.260> pounds<00:04:09.680> so<00:04:09.770> it's

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
weighs about you know 800 pounds so it's

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.890 
weighs about you know 800 pounds so it's
actually<00:04:10.340> a<00:04:10.610> little<00:04:10.850> bit<00:04:11.090> less<00:04:11.300> than<00:04:11.510> a<00:04:11.630> gold

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
actually a little bit less than a gold

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.030 
actually a little bit less than a gold
wing<00:04:12.760> so<00:04:13.870> with<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:14.990> braking<00:04:15.350> power<00:04:15.500> that<00:04:15.860> you

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
wing so with the braking power that you

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.130 
wing so with the braking power that you
have<00:04:16.250> combined<00:04:17.030> with<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.420> not<00:04:17.750> so<00:04:17.989> much

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
have combined with the not so much

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.620 
have combined with the not so much
horsepower<00:04:18.650> that<00:04:18.920> this<00:04:19.070> thing<00:04:19.280> has<00:04:19.489> you<00:04:20.060> you

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
horsepower that this thing has you you

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.630 
horsepower that this thing has you you
have<00:04:21.019> a<00:04:21.080> pretty<00:04:21.410> safe<00:04:21.680> of<00:04:22.040> braking<00:04:22.490> components

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
have a pretty safe of braking components

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.970 
have a pretty safe of braking components
here<00:04:25.780> now<00:04:26.780> I<00:04:26.840> haven't<00:04:27.200> spent<00:04:27.350> a<00:04:27.470> lot<00:04:27.620> of<00:04:27.650> time

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:15.540 

so<00:05:12.879> this<00:05:13.840> is<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.289> gear<00:05:14.590> up<00:05:14.740> model<00:05:15.099> and<00:05:15.280> what's

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
so this is the gear up model and what's

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.700 
so this is the gear up model and what's
particular<00:05:16.090> about<00:05:16.599> the<00:05:16.780> gear<00:05:16.990> up<00:05:17.110> model<00:05:17.439> is<00:05:17.560> it

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
particular about the gear up model is it

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.140 
particular about the gear up model is it
is<00:05:17.830> accessorized<00:05:18.520> more<00:05:18.759> than<00:05:18.879> some<00:05:19.000> of<00:05:19.090> the

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
is accessorized more than some of the

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.490 
is accessorized more than some of the
other<00:05:19.330> ones<00:05:19.509> you've<00:05:19.689> got<00:05:19.719> to<00:05:19.900> shovel<00:05:20.259> on<00:05:20.379> the

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
other ones you've got to shovel on the

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.230 
other ones you've got to shovel on the
other<00:05:20.620> side<00:05:20.919> you've<00:05:21.129> got<00:05:21.159> the<00:05:21.460> carrying<00:05:22.000> can

other side you've got the carrying can
back<00:05:22.509> here<00:05:22.930> now<00:05:23.620> they<00:05:23.800> say<00:05:24.009> this<00:05:24.159> isn't<00:05:24.550> for

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
back here now they say this isn't for
