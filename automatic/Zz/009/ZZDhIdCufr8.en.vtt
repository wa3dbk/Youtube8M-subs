00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.740
 hello to all guys at the face that 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:18.950
 look at that two blue velvet gameplay 3 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.680
 mv 2 ok this then always a gameplay 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.500
 gpf clan its linking description 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.520
 that the player is called Paduan jtf 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.680
 they love him 95 of belluno and of mila schon 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.880
 to the people of belluno where boys begin 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.570
 immediately to tell you that the rest gameplay 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.910
 then it is a simpler animal 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.309
 I use a console that uses only one 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.250
 I don't know a mendola e claim 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.550
 so it is a nuclear charge at random 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.160
 the est done without rewards ok without 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.079
 sheet metal without any reason why 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.489
 know why it's more difficult but I'm sorry 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.929
 but one gets his ass and everything not 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.140
 Also they do not give a damage also say 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.999
 good and then attention is not over not 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.920
 is that he doesn't do it in team deathmatch 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:04.430
 because it's hard to say why match 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:08.060
 you have limitations of incisions in you have not 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.950
 type the domain that if one holds 19 or 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.930
 two points occupied the hard game of 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.820
 the more the parity lasts much less i 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.880
 fears in fair a joke and then not 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.040
 they reward him if he does well fast defaring 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.600
 we are on an exact console so there is 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.700
 you only tried taking the raid 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.549
 airplane and not clear and I tell you immediately 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.110
 before the frightens you because 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.560
 maybe today I made use I said 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.000
 it will throw away the real king but it is if anything 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.430
 of the map if we see if you see the 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.649
 field does not give us anyone but kills one 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.159
 with the claymore so there is none 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.289
 killing done with rewards in 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.270
 the less he gave him a reward of six 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.700
 good china sorry you told me you do 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.380
 ass not reward you sorry boom 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.049
 revenge lit two people with the claim 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:56.329
 but the point is that in mv 2 call one 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.789
 nuke also with rewards 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.500
 it is not easy no in tim maxxi non ne 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.390
 face to understand it takes very little ie 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.829
 it lasts five or six minutes from waking up 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.000
 from now when the video is 36 minutes long 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.469
 obviously what we saw up 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.960
 to be you do n't do all of them in 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.390
 domain and then if that the difficulty in 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.770
 more than in mv three they started at 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.320
 put the bonus pezzali is that two 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.910
 lost and instead here is no country 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.970
 that is, among those who choose 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.250
 and then never to have inter-agent work 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.160
 unable to play even exactly here use it 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.360
 he uses 2 mp looks at an ass to save himself 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.250
 what half is enough because I don't know why not 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.760
 vannucci inter loria voted him in 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.110
 place 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:37.160
 I know 6 because why not calculated pro 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.610
 his new 2 exists and mv traini uses the 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.970
 web 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.460
 mp 45 silenced and asi among other things 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.500
 what and I think I don't know if to 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.390
 ska band between is another thing that gives 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.600
 annoyances yes but also fake shots always 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.830
 of weapons among me when I play that 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.840
 he had not seen that I had any corpse 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.790
 so I don't know how to answer, I don't know if 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.170
 worn strokes should should have 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.660
 scavenge air because i will be finished i 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.640
 40 type blows hit damage you know I don't 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.560
 I've never seen if I was only on mv 2 e 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.260
 enter the game and sing the years 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.320
 ninety the jackal chosen or fall 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.660
 be warm practically I've never seen 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.210
 I don't know what to say repairing it 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.890
 scavenge asi losche lancer 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.960
 I never use it because I always think 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.390
 that much goes well enough for me with mine 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.030
 premium hold on at least two send you in 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.430
 battles with 30 sleep strokes in the 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.170
 wars are understood loader 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.880
 saving on modern wars then 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.370
 Savings wars seemed to be around the neck 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.990
 among other things, it always turns in the 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.410
 same fucking place but I say but i 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.870
 enemies are not a grenade a grate one 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:44.030
 bomb put the see but here upper 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.040
 overvaluing enemies car must say 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.720
 bomb so much I can stay here without it 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.700
 have no shoulders what protects 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.100
 that so they don't arrive so if I was 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.610
 in the game but that's what I think not 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.010
 they come behind, they don't come though 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.840
 what is there a stuff that not everyone knows 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.390
 a champion tactic with these here 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.270
 fly use the fucking name here 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.510
 the gunner chopper so much I single use 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.040
 they don't use it they would have caused that then 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.190
 which explains why I used it because me 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.050
 I'm so strong that when 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.840
 I crowd when I want to call 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.000
 an American that I beg you if we have 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.250
 when I want to call call a news 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.110
 I call the superg to me and then I don't shoot 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.400
 because I have exact time because I don't shoot 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.010
 because I already know that I will succeed in 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.840
 call it capital you have him running around 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.160
 you hear them I remember how you called 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.670
 the new that at the moment the wreck 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.720
 of firing like crazy girls ai 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.400
 tractors have also destroyed the 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.260
 vehicle and he also did the shit 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.240
 to get in the middle of the map calls 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.840
 She really thought wrong 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.630
 call something else but I hope so 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.250
 let's see how missing an attacker like 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.110
 its menus between bother me know 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.240
 it feeds better because the age believes it and then 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.290
 underneath under the eye what it is 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.480
 in the part that I can always 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.970
 look at them mayor cleat now misses a 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.680
 rapper crack boom blatantly right 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.140
 because I 'm not watching the buoys there 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.740
 bring a nucleus then if you want vi 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.290
 I'll take a year with the pure penis I'll make it 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.090
 the ship was already born but I did that 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.130
 sniper or six 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.110
 but in the servers and the one made on the home 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.419
 if the al fatah if I did the mobster 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.430
 nourishes and therefore in the look is not called 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.260
 own self as at least we hope to 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.470
 countries you see born at least so far here 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.980
 we have the newco in the fray but we have 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.070
 the mob 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.350
 if in others there is a but 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.080
 he plays his moby climb well 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.460
 we are understood but after three smartphones me 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.919
 v2 more beautiful because when you call the 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.980
 news that you will be losing instead is 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.390
 the bar objectively if it is right but with 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.790
 a practice they are playing at 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.580
 domain is showing by taking type 33 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.810
 percent ces send you got the bomb 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.210
 little took the newco me 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.980
 and brought the game to an end I won the 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.450
 game and I received the compliments e 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.820
 insults because the sound is but if a 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.490
 sitter is obvious that if a site is therefore 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.580
 he obviously is a yes here because now 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.050
 dies dies or for boys if the video is 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.340
 liked click on I like me 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.480
 I recommend you go and watch them 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.740
 channel that really deserves 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.740
 hello everyone the next hello video
