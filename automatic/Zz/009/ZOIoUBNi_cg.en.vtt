I'd<00:00:10.320> have<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.620> say<00:00:10.830> what<00:00:11.040> separates<00:00:11.549> our<00:00:11.730> camps

I'd have to say what separates our camps

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.660 
I'd have to say what separates our camps
from<00:00:12.209> the<00:00:12.389> others<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.930> our<00:00:13.320> staff<00:00:13.709> they<00:00:14.400> come

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
from the others is our staff they come

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.790 
from the others is our staff they come
with<00:00:14.820> such<00:00:15.030> high<00:00:15.299> energy<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.110> excitement<00:00:16.199> for

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800

with such high energy and excitement for
the<00:00:16.890> game<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.730> think<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.090> comes<00:00:18.330> from<00:00:18.449> our

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
the game and I think that comes from our

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.970
