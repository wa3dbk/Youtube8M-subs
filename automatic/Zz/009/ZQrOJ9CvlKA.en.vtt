00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.529
 welcome one more day of our channel 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:09.170
 have the video today we bring you that 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.900
 I carry in my bag in my case the backpack 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.910
 school and, where appropriate, the invoice 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.400
 linear before anything else I wanted 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.039
 excuse I do not know how the voice will be noticed 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.300
 but I'm super locked super bad in 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.470
 my class everything is wrong or if I 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:28.079
 they hit so I forgive a tornado 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:30.900
 he has a little bit of himself as a truck driver 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.960
 Well, we started the video 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.610
 well it's here is my backpack that in 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.920
 the video the school supplies not yet the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.379
 had stuck get if something that you 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.410
 I bought it in the same one that 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.090
 call actroid I do not know if you know what it is and 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.309
 I like it a lot because that's how 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.589
 love blacklist communicating the town 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.269
 the truth is pretty big and what I 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.610
 like is that as half and more than fabric 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.350
 then we go when it rains because it does not 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.019
 wet 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.940
 on the outside you see three pockets is 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.940
 tiny and this one is expensive 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.050
 obviously all the books because 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.430
 if it would not be a lot and the first thing that 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.030
 we are here is a pocket 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.030
 tiny 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.810
 then I keep the calculator or the mobile 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.760
 when I have not used it because if there 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.020
 loose by the backpack in the end never what 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.320
 find 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.740
 other things that I always take apart from 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.929
 obviously the books is this necessary 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.900
 from here it's good that all of these know 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.630
 what is in the month this 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.440
 you do not need to be teaching what there is 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.440
 comes 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.950
 apart from this he also brought the portfolio 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:52.630
 just in case it's not that I always carry it 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:57.000
 if anything because I go bus 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:01.220
 why then the technique 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.220
 and another thing that I have 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.740
 this little bag here 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.190
 he is surrounded by my mother 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.569
 that you open it and nothing more and that when 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.340
 have physical education for always 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.819
 I have a spare shirt for the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.330
 moment a small towel to wet 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:25.130
 the base art a little and the deodorant 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:29.270
 physical placement only 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.790
 and well this is all inside and through 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.630
 outside 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.630
 in this void here 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.840
 I always wear a ponytail 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.209
 measure there because if there's not a lot of 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.610
 moments on which the queue depends and 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:49.590
 it's hot and I need it 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.660
 and some currency 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.129
 Well, in case I do not have the wallet and I just 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.870
 get out of physical education and I want to 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.280
 buy a bottle of water or I want to 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.130
 buy me a candy I want to buy 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.640
 anything 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.620
 Y 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.980
 in the other pocket only and 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.470
 exclusively and a packet of letters 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.209
 because many times we have free hours 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.780
 now we are starting after sure 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.490

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.620
 dollars now as long as we have 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:29.459

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.530
 nothing this backpack and that's the whole video 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.500

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.410
