 Pirans continued to erupt 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.990
 even when the world started 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.840
 freeze producing a rich substance

 giants there are plants everywhere and 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.620
 also something else 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.440
 looks like some fucking with 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.900
 an armor is about 600 million long 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.000
 square centimeters the god levels yes

 prehensile 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.490
 the advance of life seems 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.490
 unrestrainable 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.670
 but here there is not much except for some 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.530
 blue and green shark that helps us to 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.140
 there is something down there to stay upright 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.360
 in water 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.650
 it's a strange fish called a stratocaster 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.230
 that his neck allows him to 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.959
 masturbate 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.090
 this is a space bus uses the

 fins as if they were colonies of ancients 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.670
 bacteria and leaves the water directed towards 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.890
 the planet grows and from a creature like 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.400
 This will evolve that all concerns 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:03:00.090
 group and of squares nino sas bird 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:03.750
 slaughterhouses and finally bocelli everywhere 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.060
 let's look at some mosses and some ferns 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.040
 up to 30 20 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.830
 so far the plants have reproduced 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.150
 using only the particles windows that 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.470
 they need cell phones for 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.590
 survive and grow 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.830
 we have come a long way from a cloud 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.050
 of molten rock and dust until a dinner 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.760
 the signifier 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.370
 there are still no humans 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.470
 but there are classic fish themselves and now 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.230
 even the osci is a dragonfly one 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.180
 dragonfly as big as a dragonfly 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.980
 all the oxygen in the atmosphere allows 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.510
 to their efficient system of being 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.579
 more respiratory 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.319
 these creatures called young planets 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.110
 they are among the first ever to have 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.060
 never paid on the mainland are almost 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.840
 identical to the reptilian ancestors who 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.439
 they invade our homes today 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.260
 a thousand full benign spiders all kinds of 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:00.390
 6,000 down the centipedes are almost long 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.799
 two feet and the scorpions have le 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.349
 size of two balls 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.849
 we found ourselves in a lost world 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.849
 inhabited by giants 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.870
 they are monsters 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.160
 this giant is called the net is a 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.160
 abnormal giant 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:37.210
 the egg is an evolutionary progress 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.400
 basic but these eggs contain 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.430
 the chain of the Himalayas fear him 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.820
 animals can leave the water and 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.290
 conquer the water stops the long 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.250
 earth's adventure is not yet 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.139
 over 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.370
 today we have retraced his first 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.320
 four children 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.230
 we will finally see how in a remote valley 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.480
 African 4 million years ago a check 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.910
 she was overwhelmed and killed 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.639
 this is a crucial moment in the 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.250
 text formation but then for 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.580
 hundreds of millions of years does not change 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.280
 incazzano these resemble rocks or 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.760
 even to plants or even to 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.760
 weeps
