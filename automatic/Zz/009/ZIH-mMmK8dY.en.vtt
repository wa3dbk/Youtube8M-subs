moat<00:01:45.090> plug<00:01:45.270> would<00:01:45.450> sit<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.659> part<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.110> ring

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
moat plug would sit on part of this ring

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.249 
moat plug would sit on part of this ring
and<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:47.070> would<00:01:47.189> get<00:01:47.340> kind<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.790> crooked<00:01:48.210> one<00:01:49.140> of

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
and it would get kind of crooked one of

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.690 
and it would get kind of crooked one of
the<00:01:49.320> Zeus<00:01:49.500> buttons<00:01:49.860> would<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.070> tight<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.580> of

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the Zeus buttons would be tight one of

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.460 
the Zeus buttons would be tight one of
them<00:01:50.820> would<00:01:50.939> be<00:01:51.030> loose<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.900> way

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
them would be loose this way

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.010 
them would be loose this way
all<00:01:52.979> three<00:01:53.340> ring<00:01:53.580> spaced<00:01:53.880> exactly<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> same<00:01:54.780> I

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
all three ring spaced exactly the same I

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.780 
all three ring spaced exactly the same I

I<00:02:09.649> had<00:02:09.830> no<00:02:10.039> problems<00:02:10.550> fitting<00:02:10.729> it<00:02:10.910> because<00:02:11.180> I

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
I had no problems fitting it because I

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.030 
I had no problems fitting it because I
used<00:02:11.600> them<00:02:11.780> out<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.170> came<00:02:12.320> from<00:02:12.590> dura<00:02:12.830> light

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
sheet of aluminum that I built the

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.550 
sheet of aluminum that I built the
racecar<00:03:17.820> body<00:03:18.030> out<00:03:18.210> of<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:19.020> traced<00:03:19.260> out<00:03:19.440> the

racecar body out of and I traced out the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.650 
racecar body out of and I traced out the
circle<00:03:19.920> now<00:03:20.460> you<00:03:20.520> notice<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.060> circle<00:03:21.240> here<00:03:21.570> is

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660

actually<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:21.960> little<00:03:22.110> bit<00:03:22.260> there<00:03:22.440> because<00:03:22.710> this

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
actually a little bit there because this

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.800 
actually a little bit there because this
is<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.040> different<00:03:23.400> brand<00:03:23.640> Reed<00:03:23.940> they've<00:03:24.660> had

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
is a different brand Reed they've had

the<00:03:24.930> same<00:03:24.990> brand<00:03:25.410> reading<00:03:25.740> the<00:03:25.800> circle<00:03:26.130> would

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
the same brand reading the circle would

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.070 
the same brand reading the circle would
match<00:03:26.370> pretty<00:03:26.670> good<00:03:26.880> lay<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.630> on<00:03:27.750> your<00:03:27.870> sheet

case<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:37.050> just<00:03:37.080> laid<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.590> on<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.830> wheel<00:03:37.980> flip

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
case I just laid it on the wheel flip

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.250 
case I just laid it on the wheel flip
the<00:03:38.430> wheel<00:03:38.580> over<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.120> use<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.870> sharpie<00:03:40.230> to

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
the wheel over and use the sharpie to

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.540 
the wheel over and use the sharpie to
mark<00:03:40.350> through<00:03:40.710> the<00:03:40.800> holes<00:03:40.980> we<00:03:41.280> got<00:03:41.460> our

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
mark through the holes we got our

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.950 
mark through the holes we got our
locations<00:03:42.090> drilled<00:03:42.330> our<00:03:42.420> holes<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:42.780> put<00:03:42.870> our

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
locations drilled our holes and put our

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.530 
locations drilled our holes and put our
Zeus<00:03:43.170> buttons<00:03:43.560> now<00:03:44.460> we<00:03:44.520> use<00:03:44.820> these<00:03:45.030> because

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
Zeus buttons now we use these because

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.090 
Zeus buttons now we use these because
they<00:03:45.960> have<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.170> little<00:03:46.410> rivets<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.800> hold<00:03:46.980> them

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
they have a little rivets and hold them

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.730 
they have a little rivets and hold them
in<00:03:47.220> they<00:03:47.910> won't<00:03:48.150> get<00:03:48.600> lost<00:03:48.840> but<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.440> can<00:03:49.590> just

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
in they won't get lost but you can just

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.120 
in they won't get lost but you can just
use<00:03:49.890> regular<00:03:50.130> old<00:03:50.490> Zeus

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
use regular old Zeus

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.340 
use regular old Zeus
that's<00:03:51.460> perfectly<00:03:51.820> fine<00:03:52.290> for<00:03:53.290> the

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
right-front however it's a little more

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
be block grant that made a little more

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.340 
be block grant that made a little more
difficult<00:04:07.210> because<00:04:07.330> if<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:07.900> have<00:04:08.050> a<00:04:08.080> wheel

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
difficult because if you have a wheel

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.140 
difficult because if you have a wheel
that<00:04:08.380> doesn't<00:04:09.010> have<00:04:09.130> a<00:04:09.160> big<00:04:09.400> lock<00:04:09.550> ring<00:04:09.820> on<00:04:10.000> it

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
that doesn't have a big lock ring on it

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.880 
that doesn't have a big lock ring on it
then<00:04:10.720> you<00:04:10.810> can't<00:04:11.020> leave<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.290> ring<00:04:11.440> down<00:04:11.680> and

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
then you can't leave the ring down and

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.470 
then you can't leave the ring down and
trace<00:04:12.100> it<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.550> way<00:04:12.700> we<00:04:12.820> did<00:04:12.970> this<00:04:13.180> is<00:04:13.240> I

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
trace it the way we did this is I

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.120 
trace it the way we did this is I
actually<00:04:13.660> measured<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.290> diameter<00:04:14.560> of<00:04:14.980> the

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
actually measured the diameter of the

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.550 
actually measured the diameter of the
wheel<00:04:15.280> where<00:04:15.550> I<00:04:15.610> wanted<00:04:15.850> it<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:16.090> go<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:17.500> you

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
wheel where I wanted it to go and you

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.870 
wheel where I wanted it to go and you
can<00:04:17.800> see<00:04:17.920> right<00:04:18.340> here<00:04:18.489> there's<00:04:18.700> a<00:04:18.760> little

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
can see right here there's a little

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.090 
can see right here there's a little
bitty<00:04:19.120> hole<00:04:19.390> with<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.750> middle<00:04:20.050> I<00:04:20.380> took<00:04:21.010> a

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
bitty hole with the middle I took a

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.770 
bitty hole with the middle I took a
piece<00:04:21.250> of<00:04:21.280> aluminum<00:04:21.820> go<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.330> hole<00:04:22.480> and<00:04:22.630> put

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
piece of aluminum go to the hole and put

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.260 
piece of aluminum go to the hole and put
a<00:04:22.810> bump<00:04:23.050> in<00:04:23.230> it<00:04:23.350> and<00:04:23.920> we<00:04:24.010> tied<00:04:24.220> a<00:04:24.250> string<00:04:24.370> that

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
a bump in it and we tied a string that

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.300 
a bump in it and we tied a string that
there<00:04:25.390> was<00:04:25.540> correct<00:04:25.810> radius<00:04:26.170> tied<00:04:27.160> the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
there was correct radius tied the

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.530 
there was correct radius tied the
straight<00:04:27.550> to<00:04:27.700> a<00:04:27.730> marker<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.240> actually

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
straight to a marker and actually

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.960 
straight to a marker and actually
driving<00:04:28.960> around<00:04:29.170> made<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:29.800> nice<00:04:30.040> circle<00:04:30.520> and

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
driving around made a nice circle and

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.060 
driving around made a nice circle and
cut<00:04:31.180> it<00:04:31.300> out<00:04:31.480> when<00:04:32.200> I<00:04:32.230> cut<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.560> out<00:04:32.680> I<00:04:32.710> actually

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
cut it out when I cut it out I actually

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.070 
cut it out when I cut it out I actually
made<00:04:33.520> it<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.730> little<00:04:33.940> bit<00:04:34.150> bigger<00:04:34.480> than<00:04:34.720> what<00:04:34.780> it

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
made it a little bit bigger than what it

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.870 
made it a little bit bigger than what it
should<00:04:35.110> have<00:04:35.410> been<00:04:35.560> that<00:04:36.220> way<00:04:36.370> when<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.580> put<00:04:36.640> it

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
should have been that way when I put it

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.060 
should have been that way when I put it
in<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.150> wheel<00:04:37.360> I<00:04:37.600> had<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:38.020> trim<00:04:38.320> it<00:04:38.500> but<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:38.860> made

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
in the wheel I had to trim it but I made

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.410 
in the wheel I had to trim it but I made
sure<00:04:39.100> I<00:04:39.250> didn't<00:04:39.490> have<00:04:39.610> any<00:04:39.790> gaps<00:04:40.000> I<00:04:40.240> just

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
sure I didn't have any gaps I just

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.239 
sure I didn't have any gaps I just
trimmed<00:04:40.690> it<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:40.930> little

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:41.249 
trimmed it a little

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:43.459 
trimmed it a little
instead<00:04:41.969> of<00:04:42.119> here<00:04:42.269> and<00:04:42.449> there<00:04:42.569> and<00:04:43.139> this<00:04:43.259> is<00:04:43.319> a

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:43.469 
instead of here and there and this is a

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:44.929 
instead of here and there and this is a
lot<00:04:43.709> more<00:04:43.919> mortis<00:04:44.429> is<00:04:44.579> the<00:04:44.639> reason<00:04:44.909> that

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:44.939 
lot more mortis is the reason that

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:46.459 
lot more mortis is the reason that
happened<00:04:45.389> during<00:04:45.479> I<00:04:45.719> wasn't<00:04:46.049> out<00:04:46.169> there

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:46.469 
happened during I wasn't out there

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:48.469 
happened during I wasn't out there
expensive<00:04:47.309> but<00:04:47.489> this<00:04:47.609> was<00:04:47.759> a<00:04:47.789> lot<00:04:47.969> of<00:04:48.029> work<00:04:48.239> but

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
expensive but this was a lot of work but

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.019 
expensive but this was a lot of work but
it<00:04:48.569> is<00:04:48.599> a<00:04:48.749> cheap<00:04:49.079> way<00:04:49.229> to<00:04:49.259> get<00:04:49.529> it<00:04:49.649> if<00:04:50.489> you<00:04:50.759> make

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:51.029 
it is a cheap way to get it if you make

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:53.659 
it is a cheap way to get it if you make
your<00:04:51.299> own<00:04:51.539> mud<00:04:52.229> plug<00:04:52.499> for<00:04:52.799> a<00:04:52.829> regular<00:04:53.519> wheel

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
your own mud plug for a regular wheel

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.519 
your own mud plug for a regular wheel
that<00:04:53.879> doesn't<00:04:54.149> have<00:04:54.239> the<00:04:54.329> bebop<00:04:54.599> ring<00:04:54.869> you<00:04:55.379> got

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:55.529 
that doesn't have the bebop ring you got

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:56.839 
that doesn't have the bebop ring you got
to<00:04:55.649> have<00:04:55.769> some<00:04:55.979> way<00:04:56.099> to<00:04:56.129> fasten<00:04:56.609> it<00:04:56.699> to<00:04:56.729> the

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
to have some way to fasten it to the

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.479 
to have some way to fasten it to the
wheel<00:04:57.089> so<00:04:57.809> once<00:04:58.169> you<00:04:58.259> get<00:04:58.349> this<00:04:58.529> made<00:04:58.769> let<00:04:59.369> me

00:04:59.479 --> 00:04:59.489 
wheel so once you get this made let me

00:04:59.489 --> 00:05:01.159 
wheel so once you get this made let me
show<00:04:59.639> you<00:04:59.699> how<00:04:59.909> we<00:04:59.969> made<00:05:00.329> the<00:05:00.659> ring<00:05:00.869> that<00:05:01.049> goes

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
show you how we made the ring that goes

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.419 
show you how we made the ring that goes
inside<00:05:01.379> the<00:05:01.679> wheel<00:05:03.589> this<00:05:04.589> is<00:05:04.799> one<00:05:04.979> of<00:05:05.009> my<00:05:05.189> old

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:05.429 
inside the wheel this is one of my old

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:07.729 
inside the wheel this is one of my old
right<00:05:05.699> front<00:05:06.029> wheels<00:05:06.329> this<00:05:07.019> actually<00:05:07.409> has<00:05:07.559> the

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:07.739 
right front wheels this actually has the

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:09.739 
right front wheels this actually has the
ring<00:05:07.919> we<00:05:08.099> made<00:05:08.369> if<00:05:08.669> you<00:05:08.789> can<00:05:08.939> see<00:05:09.119> how<00:05:09.299> tore<00:05:09.599> up

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:09.749 
ring we made if you can see how tore up

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:11.179 
ring we made if you can see how tore up
the<00:05:09.899> wheel<00:05:10.079> is<00:05:10.289> that's<00:05:10.559> the<00:05:10.679> reason<00:05:10.949> I<00:05:11.009> had<00:05:11.159> to

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:11.189 
the wheel is that's the reason I had to

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:14.659 
the wheel is that's the reason I had to
buy<00:05:11.489> one<00:05:11.519> it's<00:05:12.059> already<00:05:12.629> bent<00:05:13.109> all<00:05:14.069> this<00:05:14.279> is<00:05:14.489> is

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
buy one it's already bent all this is is

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.129 
buy one it's already bent all this is is
a<00:05:14.699> piece<00:05:14.759> of<00:05:15.029> round<00:05:15.179> bar<00:05:15.329> and<00:05:15.719> you<00:05:15.809> can<00:05:15.899> get<00:05:16.019> the

a piece of round bar and you can get the

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.559 
a piece of round bar and you can get the
round<00:05:16.289> bar<00:05:16.589> at<00:05:16.769> Lowe's<00:05:17.069> Home<00:05:17.669> Depot<00:05:18.029> someplace

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
plug locks it in the way I made the

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:36.679 
plug locks it in the way I made the
curve<00:05:34.709> in<00:05:34.949> it<00:05:35.069> though<00:05:35.249> as<00:05:35.969> I<00:05:36.149> took<00:05:36.329> a<00:05:36.360> long

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:36.689 
curve in it though as I took a long

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:38.689 
curve in it though as I took a long
piece<00:05:36.959> of<00:05:36.989> metal<00:05:37.349> rod<00:05:37.529> this<00:05:37.979> little<00:05:38.279> round<00:05:38.399> bar

piece of metal rod this little round bar
I<00:05:39.059> took<00:05:39.689> an<00:05:39.809> old<00:05:39.959> Leo<00:05:40.139> like<00:05:40.439> this<00:05:40.649> one<00:05:40.829> and<00:05:41.459> I

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:41.609 
I took an old Leo like this one and I

00:05:41.609 --> 00:05:43.549 
I took an old Leo like this one and I
welded<00:05:41.969> doing<00:05:42.449> round<00:05:42.659> bar<00:05:42.869> in<00:05:43.019> here<00:05:43.229> and<00:05:43.469> I

00:05:43.549 --> 00:05:43.559 
welded doing round bar in here and I

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:45.350 
welded doing round bar in here and I
just<00:05:43.589> started<00:05:44.099> pulling<00:05:44.309> it<00:05:44.549> and<00:05:44.939> I<00:05:45.059> bend<00:05:45.269> it

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
just started pulling it and I bend it

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.899 
just started pulling it and I bend it
around<00:05:45.449> and<00:05:45.929> around<00:05:45.989> and<00:05:46.379> around<00:05:46.469> and<00:05:47.009> I<00:05:47.669> bent

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
around and around and around and I bent

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:49.609 
around and around and around and I bent
it<00:05:47.969> about<00:05:48.239> time<00:05:48.539> and<00:05:48.659> a<00:05:48.719> half<00:05:48.929> around<00:05:49.049> again

00:05:49.609 --> 00:05:49.619 
it about time and a half around again

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:52.129 
it about time and a half around again
and<00:05:49.860> then<00:05:49.919> cut<00:05:50.369> it<00:05:50.489> off<00:05:50.719> even<00:05:51.719> though<00:05:51.809> this<00:05:51.959> is

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
and then cut it off even though this is

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.379 
and then cut it off even though this is
smaller<00:05:52.439> because<00:05:52.709> the<00:05:52.949> metal<00:05:53.339> has<00:05:53.519> got<00:05:54.360> a

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
smaller because the metal has got a

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.149 
smaller because the metal has got a
memory<00:05:54.779> to<00:05:54.959> it<00:05:54.989> it<00:05:55.169> sprung<00:05:55.559> out<00:05:55.739> into<00:05:56.009> this<00:05:56.099> big

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
memory to it it sprung out into this big

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:58.249 
memory to it it sprung out into this big
ring<00:05:56.669> that<00:05:56.969> was<00:05:57.179> something<00:05:57.509> I<00:05:57.839> don't<00:05:58.199> know

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 
ring that was something I don't know

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.649 
ring that was something I don't know
maybe<00:05:58.439> about<00:05:58.619> that<00:05:58.949> large<00:05:59.249> poked<00:06:00.239> it<00:06:00.360> down<00:06:00.509> the

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
maybe about that large poked it down the

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.059 
maybe about that large poked it down the
wheel<00:06:00.809> poked<00:06:01.139> it<00:06:01.289> around<00:06:01.499> and<00:06:01.769> worked<00:06:01.919> it

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 
wheel poked it around and worked it

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:03.169 
wheel poked it around and worked it
until<00:06:02.339> I<00:06:02.399> got<00:06:02.549> it<00:06:02.669> to<00:06:02.759> where<00:06:02.819> I<00:06:02.879> need<00:06:03.059> to<00:06:03.089> be

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:03.179 
until I got it to where I need to be

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:05.989 
until I got it to where I need to be
trimmed<00:06:03.959> off<00:06:04.079> the<00:06:04.139> excess<00:06:04.729> snapped<00:06:05.729> it<00:06:05.879> in

00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:05.999 
trimmed off the excess snapped it in

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:08.149 
trimmed off the excess snapped it in
there<00:06:06.179> and<00:06:06.299> I<00:06:06.389> had<00:06:06.599> my<00:06:06.749> ring<00:06:06.929> in<00:06:07.110> there<00:06:07.229> now

and my ring maid had my mud plug made

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:24.409 
and my ring maid had my mud plug made
and<00:06:22.559> he<00:06:22.709> cost<00:06:22.949> me<00:06:23.159> maybe<00:06:23.339> three<00:06:23.939> dollars<00:06:24.389> to

have a mud plug in the car

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.180 
have a mud plug in the car
would<00:06:25.960> you<00:06:26.050> figure<00:06:26.260> all<00:06:26.500> the<00:06:26.620> materials<00:06:27.070> and

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
would you figure all the materials and

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.550 
would you figure all the materials and
things<00:06:27.450> if<00:06:28.450> you<00:06:28.540> build<00:06:28.750> buy<00:06:28.900> one<00:06:29.110> from<00:06:29.200> a<00:06:29.320> store

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
things if you build buy one from a store

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.650 
things if you build buy one from a store
it<00:06:29.650> cost<00:06:29.890> you<00:06:30.040> a<00:06:30.070> lot<00:06:30.190> more<00:06:30.400> so<00:06:30.730> if<00:06:31.300> you<00:06:31.480> want

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
it cost you a lot more so if you want

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.940 
it cost you a lot more so if you want
