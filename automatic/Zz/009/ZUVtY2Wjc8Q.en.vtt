00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Welcome to the Paris Motor Show, where we have just presented an absolute novelty: the Toyota C-HR prototype. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Characterized by a design result of years of creativity and innovation, the C-HR prototype is the latest in the Toyota revolutionary family of cars. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 And just as the original RAV4 has reinvented the C-SUV segment, so the C-HR prototype aims to redefine the compact crossover market and, in doing so, introduces the innovative hybrid transmission. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 We could not have chosen a better city than Paris to present a prototype that embodies the promise of Akio Toyoda 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 to build cars that excite and make you love driving. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 The C-HR prototype exteriors win in many respects. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 The faceted surfaces recall the shape of a diamond and give the car a fluid and sinuous line, anticipating the stylistic language of the future Toyota models. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Furthermore, the aerodynamic coupe-style roof gives the C-HR prototype an even more appealing look. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Finally, the shiny roof, which contrasts with the body of a bold blue paint, creates plays of light that give the car an irresistible charm. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Another characteristic element is the suspended rear optical unit, which gives an original and high-tech look to the C-HR prototype e, 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 combined with the low, wide and massive shape of the wheel arches, it anticipates the design of future Toyota cars. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 This car will certainly not go unnoticed, also thanks to the exclusive design of the alloy wheels that will emphasize its presence on the road. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 And behind the bold exterior, you'll find an advanced version of our integral hybrid transmission. In addition, thanks to a new platform that allows better handling, dynamic driving is guaranteed. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 In observing the C-HR prototype, imagine a future in which life proceeds at a frenetic pace and a car like this fits perfectly into the urban environment, 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 with all the space, style and energy needed to accompany you in your work and leisure time. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 There was great expectation for this car and so far the reactions have been very positive. Let's have a chat with people and find out what they think. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 This car is definitely extraordinary 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 The decisive and well-defined lines fully reflect the Toyota style. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 She's very beautiful 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 It catches the attention. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 With such a positive reaction here at the stand, I would say that there are all the right prerequisites for introducing the C-HR concept to the market.
