00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:08.320
 [music] 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.590
 hello everyone with you aurum and today i 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.750
 I am in the account of the village where 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.630
 there are seven thousand nine hundred forty four 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.330
 game as you see with the name of the movie I 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.720
 I want to play this village in a competition 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.750
 that is, it will be presented to someone from 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:37.129
 you are actually the story of this village 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.470
 very long, I personally did not buy here 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.660
 where we are and by whom and here bought 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.520
 completely different person to whom i am 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.140
 Miraculously came out I know about that well 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.280
 how would I know for a long time about what is 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.500
 people who like to sell gems cheaper 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.719
 what they cost the store I do not know how 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.590
 way it happens but it's a fact I already 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:03.800
 repeatedly it came across that is 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.649
 I know that many players buy gems 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.920
 it is in people and in fact that’s how it is 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.070
 So 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.729
 and here I came across such a person 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.439
 I was naturally given recommendations about him 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.240
 that is, I would simply not cooperate with him 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.570
 if no one gave a recommendation he 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.130
 he was advised that is rude 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.189
 saying from him where we bought 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.300
 people will become tenths quiet therefore in 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.330
 Generally fear for their villages 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.580
 as if not worth it but on the other hand I 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.850
 just asked to be funny and 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.490
 and created an account from scratch in general just 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.410
 from scratch and asked him to pour and themes 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.810
 so that there were at least builders in the end he 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.270
 even exceeded the norm here we look at 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.000
 amount of genes i'm now course now 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:56.460
 buy right now 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.460
 again houses builders here two times and 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:07.480
 i.e. all principle is cool five houses 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.790
 builders of his hang le prikolno and 4444 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.280
 the demon is actually some kind of fate 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:15.730
 honestly i didn't pick it up think he too 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.250
 that is, what is the meaning of competition competition 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.020
 banal I do not know how simple it is 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.650
 so spontaneously happened therefore 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.840
 no competition 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.510

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.870

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:23.820
 another moment that the village is on android like 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.980

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.990

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.000
 Iyos that is not a principle do not care 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.470
 Well, for people who want to buy 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.110
 the gene is so small lyrical 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.880
 reference retreat is also under 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.590
 do not take this video as hard 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.610
 advertising advertising is not just hard 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.080
 the man gave me an account at all 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.240
 Well that's donated more accurately demon 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.070
 the account is absolutely free 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.350
 can't share not share it 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.780
 Reference I would like to clarify that 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.060
 turning to him you are turning to your 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.790
 fear and risk so if you are afraid 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.010
 somehow lose your account 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.310
 losing money is still something just does not 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.140
 probably not to pay that I can not 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.550
 nothing to guarantee I want to say that 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.490
 he has recommendations 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.930
 I will also buy gems from him now 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.640
 will deal with the second account you're on 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.710
 the main probably I will of course 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.410
 buy gems but about it will 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:26.760
 separate video why am i doing i'm up 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:30.360
 9 tx did not buy at all did not spend 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.600
 money clash and that's why something like this 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.050
 if you have questions write him a nickname then 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.000
 there is 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.090
 I will say that the prices 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.060
 two times cheaper than in the store in general 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.490
 something like this and i'm waiting 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.350
 the winner of this competition is literally 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.310
 in a week we will find out who this 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:52.620
