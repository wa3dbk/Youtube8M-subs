00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.960

 today i'm getting alice david for 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.070
 a little history lesson indeed to 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.930
 Nintendo consoles without mario kart bah 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.300
 it's not really a Nintendo console 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.509
 and that's good since the wiiu home 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.509
 mario kart clip it's great 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.010
 appeared for the first time in 92 on 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.060
 super nintendo super mario kart brings 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.070
 something new 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.080
 the universe of mario bros time of 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.820
 builders and especially the fact of 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.050
 to be able to swing a thing time the 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.520
 looking for banana peels from 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.500
 turtle shells but I know 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.250
 not if you know mario kart but if I 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.270
 know well I spent hours 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.280
 on to pass my license 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.880
 a gorilla is trying to overtake you by 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.720
 right answer wanted to throw skin of 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.770
 banana 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.750
 answer b accelerated answer is wanted 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.750
 throw a shell there I think has a 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.640
 not gackt a little creepy anyway 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.710
 short after this excellent episodes on 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.479
 super nintendo nintendo precisely 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.460
 recurrence this time on nintendo 64 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.320
 always the same fundamentals the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.300
 kart race in the universe of mario 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.190
 bros but this time the system of 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.690
 pieces go away it's scary 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.009
 downright because when you imagine 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.910
 mails that really needs it 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.500
 stuff on others for effect 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.500
 slow down when I do not know but the 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.610
 brothel that it can put on the device 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:41.149
 it's good to want to be closed 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.149
 you must prepare 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.030
 Finally, it's after this episode 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.490
 memorable on nintendo 64 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.930
 we had many adaptations on 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.240
 ten on 3ds 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.310
 the same on game cube there is a little 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.700
 failed initiate being able to play at 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.769
 two on the same card costs it's missed 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.110
 to really wait for a wii version 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.400
 to have mesh catherine of that name and 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.620
 the wii version or with a gameplay 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.030
 just fit and it's not a little junk 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.459
 to drive with a joystick that 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.019
 looks like an ipad that does not play 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.370
 all happy you talk to I'm finally 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.980
 to be able to test this new 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:34.650
 application to tell my car super 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:37.550
 accurate I wanted to go back 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.190
 m but no 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.200
 the touchpad is not that much 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.310
 in fact with a joystick it's not 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:55.030
 necessarily more believers it's not wrong 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:58.280
 on mario kart go question number 35 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.740
 you meet a star answer to 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.670
 you are invincible 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.270
 answer bc the night answer and you 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.270
 make a day
