almost four dollars for the economy

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.020 
almost four dollars for the economy
roller<00:00:31.119> covers<00:00:32.309> these<00:00:33.309> are<00:00:33.430> what<00:00:33.550> I'm<00:00:33.640> talking

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
roller covers these are what I'm talking

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.300 
roller covers these are what I'm talking
about<00:00:35.880> nine<00:00:36.880> inch<00:00:37.150> roller<00:00:37.750> cover

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
about nine inch roller cover

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.100 
about nine inch roller cover
three-eighths<00:00:39.310> inch<00:00:39.670> nap<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:43.270> motivated<00:00:43.990> by

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
three-eighths inch nap so motivated by

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.140 
three-eighths inch nap so motivated by
the<00:00:44.170> high<00:00:44.740> price<00:00:45.070> of<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.370> roller<00:00:45.580> covers<00:00:46.030> I

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
the high price of the roller covers I

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.470 
the high price of the roller covers I
decided<00:00:46.540> that<00:00:47.160> when<00:00:48.160> I<00:00:48.190> was<00:00:48.520> done<00:00:48.790> painting<00:00:49.390> I

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
decided that when I was done painting I

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.180 
decided that when I was done painting I
was<00:00:49.510> going<00:00:49.990> to<00:00:50.110> try<00:00:50.320> to<00:00:50.350> figure<00:00:50.740> out<00:00:50.920> a<00:00:51.130> good

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
was going to try to figure out a good

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.440 
was going to try to figure out a good
way<00:00:51.760> of<00:00:51.790> cleaning<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:52.390> roller<00:00:52.600> cover<00:00:52.900> and

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
way of cleaning the roller cover and

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.700 
way of cleaning the roller cover and
this<00:00:55.450> is<00:00:55.600> what<00:00:55.750> I<00:00:55.780> came<00:00:55.900> up<00:00:56.260> with<00:00:56.440> I<00:00:56.470> haven't

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
this is what I came up with I haven't

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.930 
this is what I came up with I haven't
tried<00:00:57.130> it<00:00:57.400> yet<00:00:59.070> you'll<00:01:00.070> notice<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.579> rollers

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
tried it yet you'll notice the rollers

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.760 
tried it yet you'll notice the rollers
still<00:01:01.239> wrapped<00:01:01.450> in<00:01:01.600> plastic<00:01:01.900> it's<00:01:02.320> still<00:01:02.590> all

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
still wrapped in plastic it's still all

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.859 
still wrapped in plastic it's still all
painting<00:01:03.280> I<00:01:03.460> just<00:01:03.820> wrapped<00:01:04.000> it<00:01:04.119> up<00:01:04.210> in<00:01:04.360> plastic

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
painting I just wrapped it up in plastic

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.460 
painting I just wrapped it up in plastic
so<00:01:05.199> that<00:01:05.350> it<00:01:05.439> wouldn't<00:01:05.619> dry<00:01:06.250> out<00:01:07.079> but<00:01:08.079> this<00:01:08.409> is

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
so that it wouldn't dry out but this is

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.390 
so that it wouldn't dry out but this is
my<00:01:09.510> answer<00:01:10.510> it's<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.530> collection<00:01:11.860> of<00:01:12.100> pipe

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
my answer it's a collection of pipe

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.010 
my answer it's a collection of pipe
fittings<00:01:13.120> that<00:01:13.360> I<00:01:13.390> had<00:01:13.690> around<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.110> shop<00:01:14.880> on

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
fittings that I had around the shop on

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.969 
fittings that I had around the shop on
one<00:01:17.020> end<00:01:17.370> there<00:01:18.370> is<00:01:18.550> a<00:01:18.580> fitting<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.560> tie<00:01:20.560> into<00:01:20.950> a

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
one end there is a fitting to tie into a

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.550 
one end there is a fitting to tie into a
standard<00:01:21.970> garden<00:01:22.180> hose<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.840> then<00:01:23.350> I<00:01:23.409> have

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
standard garden hose and then I have

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.480 
standard garden hose and then I have
some<00:01:23.770> reducers<00:01:24.570> going<00:01:25.570> up<00:01:25.720> to<00:01:26.049> a<00:01:26.380> piece<00:01:27.070> of<00:01:27.250> two

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
some reducers going up to a piece of two

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.539 
some reducers going up to a piece of two
inch<00:01:27.520> inside<00:01:28.090> diameter<00:01:28.890> ABS<00:01:29.890> pipe<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
inch inside diameter ABS pipe and the

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.789 
inch inside diameter ABS pipe and the
way<00:01:33.700> this<00:01:33.940> should<00:01:34.210> work<00:01:34.450> is<00:01:34.810> I<00:01:35.170> should<00:01:35.650> be<00:01:35.680> able

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
way this should work is I should be able

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:42.990 
way this should work is I should be able
to<00:01:38.190> put<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.310> roller<00:01:39.520> cover<00:01:39.880> into<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:42.000> pipe

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
to put the roller cover into the pipe

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.990 
to put the roller cover into the pipe
and<00:01:43.330> turn<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.320> water<00:01:44.500> on<00:01:44.650> and<00:01:45.040> it<00:01:45.790> should

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
and turn the water on and it should

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.500 
and turn the water on and it should
hopefully<00:01:47.549> clean<00:01:48.549> it<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:50.409> think<00:01:50.740> that<00:01:51.159> my

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
hopefully clean it so I think that my

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.890 
hopefully clean it so I think that my
glue<00:01:52.510> is<00:01:52.750> dry<00:01:53.020> enough<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.860> try<00:01:54.460> it<00:01:54.520> out<00:01:54.900> here's

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
glue is dry enough to try it out here's

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.330 
glue is dry enough to try it out here's
the<00:01:56.080> roller<00:01:56.290> cover<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.799> we'll<00:01:56.950> be<00:01:57.070> cleaning

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
the roller cover that we'll be cleaning

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.850 
the roller cover that we'll be cleaning
and<00:01:57.850> it's<00:01:58.060> still<00:01:58.920> saturated<00:01:59.920> with<00:02:00.490> paint<00:02:01.860> so

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
and it's still saturated with paint so

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.170 
and it's still saturated with paint so
no<00:02:03.040> smoking<00:02:03.460> mirrors<00:02:03.759> here

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
no smoking mirrors here

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.229 
no smoking mirrors here
I'll<00:02:04.960> start<00:02:05.890> by<00:02:06.159> attaching<00:02:06.930> my<00:02:07.930> device<00:02:08.349> to<00:02:08.799> a

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
I'll start by attaching my device to a

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:17.509 
I'll start by attaching my device to a
garden<00:02:10.239> hose

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.740 

next<00:02:18.519> I'll<00:02:19.209> insert<00:02:19.689> the<00:02:20.099> roller<00:02:21.099> cover<00:02:21.750> into

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
next I'll insert the roller cover into

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.390 
next I'll insert the roller cover into
the<00:02:23.560> pipe<00:02:23.859> I'm<00:02:24.219> going<00:02:24.879> to<00:02:25.439> keep<00:02:26.439> the<00:02:26.980> roller

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
the pipe I'm going to keep the roller

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
frame on the roller cover because I

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.240 
frame on the roller cover because I
don't<00:02:30.189> want<00:02:30.400> water<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:31.709> go<00:02:32.709> through<00:02:32.739> the

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
don't want water to go through the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.910 
don't want water to go through the
middle<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.299> roller<00:02:34.510> cover<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:35.109> want<00:02:35.379> it<00:02:35.500> to

middle of the roller cover I want it to
go<00:02:36.670> around<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:38.370> where<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.489> paint<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:39.909> so

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
go around the where the paint is so

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.649 
go around the where the paint is so
we'll<00:02:40.629> just<00:02:40.780> put<00:02:41.409> this<00:02:41.560> in<00:02:41.799> here<00:02:42.099> and<00:02:42.629> see<00:02:43.629> what

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.339 
happens
so<00:02:45.310> let's<00:02:45.519> turn<00:02:45.849> on<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.030> water<00:02:49.019> see<00:02:50.019> how<00:02:50.200> it

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
so let's turn on the water see how it

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:58.399 
so let's turn on the water see how it
works<00:02:50.590> oh<00:02:54.329> whoops

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.879 

let's<00:02:59.409> try<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.799> again<00:03:01.349> we<00:03:02.349> need<00:03:02.470> something

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
let's try that again we need something

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.500 
let's try that again we need something
to<00:03:02.919> hold<00:03:03.189> it<00:03:03.400> in<00:03:03.519> there<00:03:03.790> I<00:03:04.049> think<00:03:06.030> just<00:03:07.030> put<00:03:07.269> you

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
to hold it in there I think just put you

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.319 
to hold it in there I think just put you
put<00:03:08.109> you<00:03:08.290> back<00:03:08.500> where<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.799> belong<00:03:10.980> here's<00:03:11.980> a

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
put you back where you belong here's a

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:26.699 
put you back where you belong here's a
high-tech<00:03:13.329> end<00:03:14.040> cap<00:03:20.459> yeah

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:38.309 

a<00:03:33.420> lot<00:03:34.420> of<00:03:34.450> pressure<00:03:34.750> in<00:03:34.989> there<00:03:37.049> think<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:38.140> need

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
a lot of pressure in there think I need

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.630 
a lot of pressure in there think I need
to<00:03:38.349> devise<00:03:38.709> a<00:03:38.739> way<00:03:39.099> to<00:03:40.769> keep<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:42.069> roller<00:03:42.370> in

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
to devise a way to keep the roller in

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:53.610 
to devise a way to keep the roller in
there<00:03:48.810> well<00:03:51.269> I'm<00:03:52.269> out<00:03:52.450> of<00:03:52.480> hands<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:53.109> can't<00:03:53.469> hold

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
there well I'm out of hands I can't hold

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.509 
there well I'm out of hands I can't hold
this<00:03:53.799> in<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.129> camera<00:03:54.519> or<00:03:58.950> maybe<00:03:59.950> some<00:04:00.250> kind<00:04:00.430> of

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
this in the camera or maybe some kind of

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.089 
this in the camera or maybe some kind of
a<00:04:00.609> tie<00:04:00.819> wire<00:04:01.090> around<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.780> end<00:04:01.959> to<00:04:02.650> keep<00:04:02.859> it<00:04:02.980> in

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
a tie wire around the end to keep it in

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:11.220 
a tie wire around the end to keep it in
there<00:04:08.129> so<00:04:09.129> I'll<00:04:09.280> just<00:04:09.459> let<00:04:09.609> this<00:04:09.870> water<00:04:10.870> run

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
there so I'll just let this water run

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.250 
there so I'll just let this water run
until<00:04:11.590> it<00:04:11.769> clear<00:04:12.750> looks<00:04:13.750> like<00:04:13.900> it's<00:04:14.079> still

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
until it clear looks like it's still

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.259 
until it clear looks like it's still
kind<00:04:14.500> of<00:04:14.530> cloudy<00:04:14.829> coming<00:04:15.219> out<00:04:15.340> of<00:04:15.459> there<00:04:15.639> and

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
kind of cloudy coming out of there and

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.210 
kind of cloudy coming out of there and
then<00:04:16.660> we'll<00:04:16.750> take<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.049> roller<00:04:17.229> out<00:04:17.349> and<00:04:17.739> see

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
then we'll take the roller out and see

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.290 
then we'll take the roller out and see
how<00:04:18.310> it<00:04:18.459> looks<00:04:20.220> well<00:04:21.220> here's<00:04:21.400> my<00:04:21.519> solution<00:04:21.729> to

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
how it looks well here's my solution to

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.120 
how it looks well here's my solution to
the<00:04:22.509> roller<00:04:22.750> wanting<00:04:23.199> to<00:04:23.380> come<00:04:23.710> out<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:23.949> end

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
the roller wanting to come out the end

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.629 
the roller wanting to come out the end
of<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.599> sleeve<00:04:25.599> just<00:04:26.190> keep<00:04:27.190> some<00:04:27.400> weight<00:04:27.580> on

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
of the sleeve just keep some weight on

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.000 
of the sleeve just keep some weight on
it<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:31.570> water<00:04:31.780> is<00:04:32.020> on<00:04:32.199> it's<00:04:32.560> been<00:04:32.740> going

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
it and the water is on it's been going

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.969 
it and the water is on it's been going
for<00:04:33.070> a<00:04:33.310> couple<00:04:33.580> of<00:04:33.639> minutes<00:04:33.940> now<00:04:34.860> I've<00:04:35.860> been

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
for a couple of minutes now I've been

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.240 
for a couple of minutes now I've been
kind<00:04:36.250> of<00:04:37.349> moving<00:04:38.349> it<00:04:38.470> around<00:04:38.560> a<00:04:38.889> little<00:04:39.010> bit

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
kind of moving it around a little bit

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:50.150 
kind of moving it around a little bit
like<00:04:39.460> this

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.060 

and<00:04:51.160> I<00:04:51.370> think<00:04:51.610> it's<00:04:52.140> probably<00:04:53.140> pretty<00:04:53.470> clean

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
and I think it's probably pretty clean

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:00.090 
and I think it's probably pretty clean
by<00:04:54.730> now<00:04:56.010> I'll<00:04:57.010> turn<00:04:57.310> off<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.460> water<00:04:57.820> and<00:04:59.100> see

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
by now I'll turn off the water and see

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.900 
by now I'll turn off the water and see
what<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.340> looks<00:05:00.370> like<00:05:01.830> okay<00:05:02.860> water<00:05:03.220> off<00:05:05.910> let's

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
what it looks like okay water off let's

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.860 
what it looks like okay water off let's
see<00:05:07.120> how<00:05:07.270> clean<00:05:07.630> this<00:05:07.840> is<00:05:11.940> here's<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.030> the

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
see how clean this is here's the the

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.620 
see how clean this is here's the the
test<00:05:14.230> that<00:05:14.470> I<00:05:14.560> always<00:05:14.820> use<00:05:15.820> you<00:05:16.000> can<00:05:16.180> squeeze

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
test that I always use you can squeeze

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:24.230 
test that I always use you can squeeze
it<00:05:16.840> and<00:05:18.090> it's<00:05:19.090> pretty<00:05:19.390> good<00:05:19.600> I<00:05:20.970> don't<00:05:21.970> see<00:05:22.210> any

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
it and it's pretty good I don't see any

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.210 
it and it's pretty good I don't see any
any<00:05:25.240> color<00:05:25.540> coming<00:05:25.960> out<00:05:26.140> and<00:05:26.770> that's<00:05:26.950> a<00:05:27.070> lot

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
any color coming out and that's a lot

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.940 
any color coming out and that's a lot
easier<00:05:27.250> than<00:05:27.840> spraying<00:05:28.840> it<00:05:29.110> for<00:05:29.350> ten<00:05:29.590> minutes

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
easier than spraying it for ten minutes

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.000 
easier than spraying it for ten minutes
which<00:05:30.130> is<00:05:30.930> what<00:05:31.930> I've<00:05:32.050> usually<00:05:32.590> done<00:05:32.800> in<00:05:32.920> the

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
which is what I've usually done in the

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.830 
which is what I've usually done in the
past<00:05:33.280> just<00:05:33.610> keep<00:05:34.000> spraying<00:05:34.300> it<00:05:34.450> with<00:05:34.600> a<00:05:34.630> water

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
past just keep spraying it with a water

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.080 
past just keep spraying it with a water
hose<00:05:34.960> and<00:05:35.490> getting<00:05:36.490> all<00:05:36.610> wet

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
hose and getting all wet

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.370 
hose and getting all wet
in<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.660> process<00:05:38.310> but<00:05:40.110> yeah<00:05:41.110> that's<00:05:41.230> pretty

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
in the process but yeah that's pretty

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.730 
in the process but yeah that's pretty
clean<00:05:41.830> I<00:05:42.070> don't<00:05:42.310> see<00:05:42.610> any<00:05:43.140> color<00:05:44.140> in<00:05:44.410> the<00:05:44.530> water

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
clean I don't see any color in the water

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.820 
clean I don't see any color in the water
coming<00:05:45.160> out<00:05:45.630> so<00:05:46.630> that<00:05:46.840> roller<00:05:47.230> is<00:05:47.410> ready<00:05:47.620> for

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
coming out so that roller is ready for

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.640 
coming out so that roller is ready for
another<00:05:48.240> run<00:05:49.240> if<00:05:49.480> I<00:05:49.630> need<00:05:49.780> a<00:05:49.810> second<00:05:50.260> coat<00:05:50.500> on

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
another run if I need a second coat on

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.340 
another run if I need a second coat on
my<00:05:51.130> bedroom<00:05:52.740> so<00:05:54.750> so<00:05:55.750> I<00:05:55.780> think<00:05:55.870> it's<00:05:56.230> a

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
my bedroom so so I think it's a

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:02.310 
my bedroom so so I think it's a
successful<00:05:57.010> project<00:05:58.860> thanks<00:05:59.860> for<00:05:59.980> watching
