00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.400
Colors disappeared from here,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.320
 I’m still shivering

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.580
What I held dear,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.720
is now fading

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.380
I could have helped you,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.900
if only I had been stronger

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.740
The sky began to cry, 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.260
and my tears flowed

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.700
“If only I could turn back time just once”; 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.440
(This strong wind is hunting my heart;)
“If only I could turn back time just once”; 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.980
(This strong wind is hunting my heart;)
my eyes wetted, the time broke

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.000
my eyes wetted, the time broke

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.080
My fingers trembled; I grabbed my staff, 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.520
(everyone is being engulfed in the darkness)
My fingers trembled; I grabbed my staff, 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.720
(everyone is being engulfed in the darkness)

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.840
and whispered
(everyone is being engulfed in the darkness)

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.400
“Why? I don’t want to lose you…” 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.340
(Everything rotted,)
“Why? I don’t want to lose you…” 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.660
(Everything rotted,)

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.180
(the sky tore apart,)
A strong light destroyed the shadows

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.600
(I embrace the uncomfortable feelings of this colorless world)
And then dissolved into a light haze

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.840
“Just don’t stop anymore”;

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.600
 pain, sadness, 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.440
they will completely cease

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.420
“I didn’t understand what you couldn’t say”; 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.300
this important person, this dear scenery;

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.680
 if only I can take them back

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.920
“Please, let’s meet again” 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.360
(“If my only desire,)
“Please, let’s meet again” 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.820
(“If my only desire,)
you say bitterly, with a delicious tone

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.880
you say bitterly, with a delicious tone

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.320
(my only request,)
you say bitterly, with a delicious tone

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:12.040
(will be granted in exchange of that broken heart of mine)
But the time has come, and this tale will soon end

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.220
“Wait, I’m coming right now” 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.800
(Those are the words of my hope, the words of my farewell.”)
“Wait, I’m coming right now” 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.420
(Those are the words of my hope, the words of my farewell.”)
the anxiety increases, your voice trembles

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.300
What you remember is a stretched hand

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:38.760
You grasp that hand which has always hoped for this

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:50.660
Feelings overflew, disappearing into the wind
