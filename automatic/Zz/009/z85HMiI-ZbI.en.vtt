be that free if you if you couldn't had
the<00:01:05.850> right<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.000> think<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> music's<00:01:06.930> more<00:01:07.110> fun

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
the right I think the music's more fun

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.800 
the right I think the music's more fun
when<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.700> haven't<00:01:09.000> played<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.299> song<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.750> a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
when you haven't played a song in a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.620 
when you haven't played a song in a
while<00:01:10.369> you<00:01:11.369> know<00:01:11.549> there<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.119> certain<00:01:12.420> songs

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
while you know there are certain songs

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.109 
while you know there are certain songs
that<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.020> don't<00:01:13.200> get<00:01:13.409> tired<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.890> playing<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:15.090> I

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
that I don't get tired of playing but I

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.060 
that I don't get tired of playing but I
think<00:01:15.450> they<00:01:15.600> benefit<00:01:16.259> from<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.830> little

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
think they benefit from a little

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.429 
think they benefit from a little
distance<00:01:17.280> between<00:01:17.610> now<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.990> last<00:01:19.170> time

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
distance between now and the last time

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.140 
distance between now and the last time
you<00:01:19.470> play<00:01:19.799> them<00:01:21.920> that's<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.070> think<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.939> cool

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you play them that's I think it's a cool

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.100 
you play them that's I think it's a cool
thing<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.530> jam<00:01:25.770> band<00:01:25.979> scene<00:01:26.400> has<00:01:27.110> has

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.090 
know but I know like in the as an
example<00:01:50.460> when<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.700> go<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> studio<00:01:52.100> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
example when you go in the studio the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.980 
example when you go in the studio the
early<00:01:53.460> takes<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:54.060> they're<00:01:54.390> good<00:01:54.659> they're

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
early takes if they're good they're

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.800 
early takes if they're good they're
always<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.530> best<00:01:55.560> thing<00:01:55.890> yes<00:01:56.250> yeah<00:01:56.490> if<00:01:57.479> you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
always the best thing yes yeah if you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.780 
always the best thing yes yeah if you
don't<00:01:58.170> nail<00:01:58.439> something<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.250> first<00:01:59.460> two<00:01:59.640> or

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
don't nail something in the first two or

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.060 
don't nail something in the first two or
three<00:01:59.820> takes<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:01.020> got<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.290> get<00:02:01.380> away<00:02:01.500> from<00:02:01.680> it

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
three takes you got to get away from it

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.830

you just played that you liked and

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.760 
you just played that you liked and
trying<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.690> recreate<00:02:25.080> something<00:02:25.590> that's

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
trying to recreate something that's

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.770 
trying to recreate something that's
already<00:02:25.920> been<00:02:26.040> done<00:02:27.920> but<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.090> now<00:02:30.330> we<00:02:30.390> have

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
already been done but and so now we have

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.960 
already been done but and so now we have
a<00:02:30.810> kind<00:02:31.320> of<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.560> rule<00:02:31.770> of<00:02:31.800> thumb<00:02:31.950> if<00:02:32.520> we<00:02:32.730> play<00:02:32.940> a

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
a kind of a rule of thumb if we play a

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.480 
a kind of a rule of thumb if we play a
song<00:02:33.270> at<00:02:33.450> soundcheck<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.500> sounds<00:02:34.890> good

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
song at soundcheck and it sounds good

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.340 
song at soundcheck and it sounds good
we<00:02:35.910> don't<00:02:36.120> play<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.570> night<00:02:36.810> because<00:02:37.170> we

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
we don't play it that night because we

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.370 
we don't play it that night because we
feel<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:37.709> we<00:02:37.950> just<00:02:37.980> played<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.550> yeah<00:02:39.380> that's

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380

think<00:03:37.560> they<00:03:37.829> get<00:03:37.980> in<00:03:38.160> tune<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.610> music<00:03:38.940> a

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
think they get in tune to the music a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.229 
think they get in tune to the music a
little<00:03:39.030> more<00:03:40.579> but<00:03:41.579> I<00:03:41.610> don't<00:03:41.850> think<00:03:41.940> you<00:03:42.090> can

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
little more but I don't think you can
