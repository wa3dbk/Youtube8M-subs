00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
it so you can take them off so that's

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.500 
it so you can take them off so that's
cool<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:21.730> this<00:02:21.850> one's<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.180> little<00:02:22.270> bit

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
cool so this one's a little bit

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.540 
cool so this one's a little bit
different<00:02:22.900> than<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.230> other<00:02:23.410> one<00:02:23.740> from<00:02:24.280> last

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
different than the other one from last

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.070 
different than the other one from last
year<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.390> looks<00:02:25.600> a<00:02:25.690> little<00:02:25.780> bit<00:02:25.930> more

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
year and it looks a little bit more

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.380 
year and it looks a little bit more
narrow<00:02:26.320> and<00:02:26.740> maybe<00:02:27.190> a<00:02:27.340> little<00:02:27.520> bit<00:02:27.700> longer<00:02:27.910> I

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
narrow and maybe a little bit longer I

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
narrow and maybe a little bit longer I
can't<00:02:29.140> quite<00:02:29.380> remember<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.640> there's<00:02:31.030> that

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
can't quite remember so there's that

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.640 
can't quite remember so there's that
this<00:02:32.410> is<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.160> adventure<00:02:33.250> begins<00:02:34.650> and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
this is and so the adventure begins and

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.970 
this is and so the adventure begins and
I<00:02:35.710> really<00:02:36.040> like<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.520> this<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:36.910> pretty<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.890> I'm

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
I really like this this is pretty so I'm

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.890 
I really like this this is pretty so I'm
just<00:02:39.160> going<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.459> kind<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:39.730> flip<00:02:39.910> through<00:02:40.270> it<00:02:40.300> so

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
just going to kind of flip through it so

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.630 
just going to kind of flip through it so
you<00:02:41.020> can<00:02:41.170> see<00:02:41.380> what<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.680> looks<00:02:41.709> like<00:02:42.070> I<00:02:42.280> got<00:02:42.340> the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
you can see what it looks like I got the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.910 
you can see what it looks like I got the
vertical<00:02:43.150> weekly<00:02:43.510> layout<00:02:43.900> I'm<00:02:44.200> not<00:02:44.860> a

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
vertical weekly layout I'm not a

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.380 
vertical weekly layout I'm not a
horizontal<00:02:45.640> layout<00:02:45.940> kind<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.480> girl<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:48.390> this

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
horizontal layout kind of girl so this

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.350 
horizontal layout kind of girl so this
is<00:02:49.660> what<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.050> looks<00:02:50.290> like<00:02:50.850> has<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.150> full

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360

is what it looks like has the full
calendar<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:55.000> believe<00:02:55.240> these<00:02:55.450> are<00:02:55.480> like<00:02:55.750> gold

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
calendar and believe these are like gold

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.479 
calendar and believe these are like gold
pages<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:56.980> didn't<00:02:57.580> really<00:02:57.730> watch<00:02:58.239> any<00:02:58.540> videos

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
little dots which also I didn't really

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.190 
little dots which also I didn't really
ever<00:03:41.580> use<00:03:42.580> those<00:03:42.880> as<00:03:43.209> part<00:03:43.450> of<00:03:43.510> my<00:03:43.630> designs<00:03:43.989> I

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
ever use those as part of my designs I

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.900 
ever use those as part of my designs I
always<00:03:44.410> cover<00:03:44.769> them<00:03:44.950> up<00:03:45.010> with<00:03:45.070> washi<00:03:45.430> so

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
always cover them up with washi so

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.150 
always cover them up with washi so
that's<00:03:46.239> fine<00:03:46.510> with<00:03:46.720> me<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:47.410> then<00:03:47.950> they<00:03:48.040> also

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
that's fine with me and then they also

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.940 
that's fine with me and then they also
took<00:03:48.370> out<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.850> text<00:03:49.480> right<00:03:49.660> here<00:03:49.690> above<00:03:50.680> the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
took out the text right here above the

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.000 
took out the text right here above the
UM<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:52.390> note<00:03:52.630> section<00:03:52.959> at<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.290> bottom<00:03:53.470> so

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
UM the note section at the bottom so

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.770 
UM the note section at the bottom so
that's<00:03:54.190> pretty<00:03:54.459> cool<00:03:55.470> digging<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:56.920> far

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
that's pretty cool digging that so far

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.190 
that's pretty cool digging that so far
let's<00:03:58.780> see<00:03:59.019> it<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.500> monthly<00:04:00.220> pages<00:04:01.200> look

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
let's see it to the monthly pages look

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.240 
let's see it to the monthly pages look
pretty<00:04:02.470> much<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.650> same<00:04:05.130> when<00:04:06.130> they

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
pretty much the same when they

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.400 
pretty much the same when they
incorporated<00:04:06.790> like<00:04:07.000> a<00:04:07.030> note<00:04:07.330> page<00:04:07.630> at<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.290> end

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
incorporated like a note page at the end

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.199 
incorporated like a note page at the end
of<00:04:08.530> each<00:04:08.620> month<00:04:08.920> that's<00:04:09.250> cool<00:04:09.640> i<00:04:09.670> don't<00:04:09.970> think

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
of each month that's cool i don't think

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.800 
of each month that's cool i don't think
the<00:04:10.330> other<00:04:10.450> one<00:04:10.630> has<00:04:10.840> that

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
the other one has that

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.809 
the other one has that
so<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.590> colors<00:04:13.770> seem<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.250> be<00:04:14.370> somewhat

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
so the colors seem to be somewhat

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.770 
so the colors seem to be somewhat
similar<00:04:15.630> this<00:04:16.200> is<00:04:16.380> kind<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.769> weird<00:04:17.040> color

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
similar this is kind of a weird color

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.170 
similar this is kind of a weird color

think is better quality than the

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.860 
think is better quality than the
previous<00:05:41.610> one<00:05:41.910> and<00:05:42.150> it's<00:05:42.330> got<00:05:42.479> the<00:05:42.600> pretty

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.060 
pattern back here and it's double sided
and<00:05:47.280> then<00:05:48.000> I<00:05:48.030> believe<00:05:48.419> this<00:05:48.690> is<00:05:48.930> yeah<00:05:49.740> this<00:05:49.770> is
