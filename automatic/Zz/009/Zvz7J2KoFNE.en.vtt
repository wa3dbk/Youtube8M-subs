00:00:12.808 --> 00:00:22.808
Hello 
Today i would like to present you the new, aerodynamically optimized 
 race and competition harness made by Swing. The Connect Race.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.066
We put quite some effort into the development and I would 
 like to present you the features from front to back

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:41.945
The speedbag is made from sleek and insulating softshell material, that at the same time 
 is also very light. The speedbag closes with a magnet to avoid any flapping.

00:00:43.915 --> 00:00:51.473
It features an innovative leg suspension for more comfort. The 
 suspension is attached directly at the carbiners. 

00:00:54.668 --> 00:01:00.860
Depending on your personal preferences you may also attach the lower leg suspension here.

00:01:00.672 --> 00:01:08.844
Using the upper and lower leg suspension you can set 
 up the length and the angle of the speedbag.

00:01:08.844 --> 00:01:27.302
Like all other straps, also the suspension is marked for the default position. It is very easy to 
 be changed by loosening the loop and then moving the ball. Afterwards you tighten the loop again.

00:01:27.412 --> 00:01:39.443
There is space for 5 liter water ballast under the seat, with the respective outlet 
 on the side of the harness. Swing also offers the optional water ballast bag.

00:01:39.443 --> 00:01:48.600
The harness is equipped with a carbon seat plate. It is built quite slim 
 for an ergonomic good fit and a good connection to your glider.

00:01:48.576 --> 00:02:15.870
The cockpit features an integrated spoiler for optimized aerodynamics. The cockpit is easy detachable with a zipper. It features a 
 second storage pocket and a third for a high performance battery, to power your heated gloves or instruments.

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:27.200
 It has a neoprene cover to protect your instruments 
 after flight and off you go to the briefing.

00:02:27.197 --> 00:02:56.940
If you would like to exchange the spoiler compartment, that holds further 5 liters of water ballast or other things 
 for the compartment for a second rescue, you just release the two buckles and undo the zipper. 

00:02:57.862 --> 00:03:07.710
Then you can zip in the compartment for the second rescue, 
 which again holds the cockpit attached by a zipper.

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:15.020
Do not forget to attach the V-lines form the frontcontainer to the carabiners!

00:03:15.017 --> 00:03:31.450
As you can see we have a very simple “get up” closing system with a smart anti-fall 
 out security built in. That way you cannot close the cockpit without closing the leg/chest straps.

00:03:32.027 --> 00:03:43.980
The new race and xc harness features larges side pockets. All pockets have little loops 
 to attach your precious belongings, so that they cannot be lost during flight.

00:03:32.027 --> 00:03:43.180
The new race and xc harness features larges side pockets. All pockets have little loops 
 to attach your precious belongings, so that they cannot be lost during flight.

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:49.580
Additionally you have a small pocket for your camera, radio, or mobile phone.

00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:58.810
The cockpit is attached to the chest strap with an additional buckle, 
 so that it also in strong lee-thermals will not jump around.

00:03:59.464 --> 00:04:07.460
The harness has multiple options to be set up. All default positions for an optimum pilot 
 position are marked on the straps. You can order left or right hander rescue release.

00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:21.860
The shoulder straps feature additional padding for more comfort. Also the backrest has additional padding and 
 a mesh, to avoid a sweaty back, if you come low on your XC flight.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:36.960
The shoulder straps are fully equipped with soft Velcro. Firstly to close the gap between 
 the back/shoulders and the aerodynamic rear fairing, secondly to attach all your gadgets.

00:04:36.957 --> 00:04:49.900
The drinking system hose also comes through a hole on the left side or 
 it can be fed through the double layer on the shoulder straps.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:05:06.980
Finally let´s have a look at the inside of the rear 
 fairing. Here you can see the large storage space.

00:05:10.873 --> 00:05:15.310
There is an extra pocket for your drinking system. 

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:32.180
And because the harness is very light some would like to carry it to the takeoff. To avoid damage 
 from the tips of your walking poles, you can secure them in the built in plastic protectors.

00:05:32.182 --> 00:05:44.180
The optional side protectors are built in by sliding them into the harness next to 
 the airbag into the designated pockets and securing them with the designated flap.

00:05:44.516 --> 00:05:54.890
Also quick-out carabiners are mountable, in case you have a 
 steerable reserve, which of course is also mountable.
