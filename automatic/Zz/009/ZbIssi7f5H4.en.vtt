00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 very first video blog on the topic 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.980
 play 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.540
 I'll just stand in front of me 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.509
 I honestly am a state recognized 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.340

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.990

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.180
 So film aunt Munster the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.970
 Chinese princess or from the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.680
 ard series the retirees quietly calm the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.949
 criminal commissioner devalued rico 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.039
 I have played poverty 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.650
 many post and mails get where the 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.540
 question was why I am 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.110
 as an actor as a pair of them 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.140
 and yes, I have that too 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.510
 light mails answered work there 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.960
 I thought now times why I do 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.000
 not just a video tutorial and 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.899
 I'll show you I'll tell you like me 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.230
 actually come to the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.910
 to become an actor and if it is you 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.910
 I would be interested in you too 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.460
 Give a few tips and tricks on the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.469
 Give away and / or jump start 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.700
 give as you actually on the 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.380
 spectacle could come and so 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.640
 at least to my person it is so 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.930
 I always wanted actors 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.650
 that's always my dream job 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.080
 been 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.350
 and I absolutely can not do that 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:21.299
 So recommend this job is really 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:23.729
 a dream think of it but that is 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.610
 unfortunately not the case it really is 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.799
 for that you must also make much much much 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.350
 you have to do a lot and you have to 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.579
 have a lot of luck 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.710
 So, for example, I was lucky 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.280
 that one day in one 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.079
 youth theater actor was there 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.150
 who had given me tips and tricks 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.860
 how I could apply or me 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.619
 could prepare for the roll like 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.060
 the acting schools and without him would be 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.060
 I'm not here today where I am here now 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.390
 should be in this beautiful and 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.710
 little girl hotel room with the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.799
 they are both scary photos to me 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:05.380
 where I am currently for soko munich 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:08.470
 so prepared, and anyway 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.700
 is it really exciting this job? 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:17.610
 to be able to live to experience others 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.610
 to experience figures 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.270
 Now let's get to the question why 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.550
 Do you want to be an actress? 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.340
 You just want to become famous 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.250
 just indicate that you are here full 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.800
 camera stands her rampensÃ¤ue since 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.130
 her horny but no idea 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.350
 Anyway, I just want actors 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.120
 because I like to roll one 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.450
 I want to experience in everyday life 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.340
 not the opportunity to do this 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.840
 I have prerequisites you need around 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.330
 to become an actor 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.940
 So you definitely need each one 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.670
 lot of effort then you need ambition 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.860
 discipline of purpose 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.130
 then you still need to definitely 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.610
 very much patience and above all 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.959
 humor so have let properties 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.030
 Definitely the basic one 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.560
 Being an actor is called but 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.150
 not that you will act if 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.620
 you have these five properties six 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.930
 has properties and I just 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.150
 so you have worked out 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.180
 you definitely have to go to one 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.019
 work because of behavior and behavior 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.850
 especially gestures and facial expressions that is quite 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.799
 quite quite important that she too 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.410
 a foreign perception and a 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.430
 self-perception has only by doing so 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.040
 you may succeed 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.269
 to become an actor and in the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.120
 next video what will I then you 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.850
 a compact give what the books the 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.570
 Of course, very very existentially 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:56.680
 It is important that content woman 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.420
 requires talking and then I then 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.250
 but what am I still on ? 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.080
 preparation believes then comes 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.330
 maybe some contact 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.150
 interested there are a few 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.840
 videos for preparation to speak 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.330
 acting schools and what else do 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.800
 i still do something during my 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.000
 education what you actually stay in 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.609
 the acting school you want that 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.430
 I also like to know and how 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.500
 I apply to the yesterday and how 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.140
 I do not behave when casting 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:30.100
 So these are very very important 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.200
 things that nobody gets told and 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.570
 I can only give you a few small tips 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.640
 but give such insane on 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.300
 you get profound tips 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.130
 at workshops, of course, over 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.440
 actually in berlin or munich or 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.480
 in other cities and if you have the 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.800
 Visiting costs while needing more money 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.300
 But that's definitely worth it 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.850
 I can only give you a few tips 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.570
 given a lot in the way I give you 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.610
 no stress 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.850
 so that you may actress 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.510
 I did not want what you hope for 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.100
 Of course we will meet someday 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.560
 standing together in front of the camera 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.010
 So far, I'm happy if you 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.740
