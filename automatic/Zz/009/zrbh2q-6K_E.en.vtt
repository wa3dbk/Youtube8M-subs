00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.440
Celebrate Urban Birds is a citizen science
project and, in a way, we have two separate

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.160
strong goals.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.600
One of them is to collect data on sixteen
species of birds, especially in urban locations.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.560
And the other is to engage new audiences in
birding, conservation, and citizen sciences.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.340
Let’s call them specimens, all right.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.640
We work in urban locations in the United States,
Mexico, and Canada.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.160
And we work particularly with low-income urban
communities.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.360
The majority of people that we work with don’t
connect with birds, they haven’t been birding,

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.270
they haven’t had opportunities.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:05.150
So what we do is teach people about the birds
that are living outside their door.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.480
And there are lots of birds in cities.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.140
This group will have four students and two
chaperones.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.790
When the kids come to the Lab of Ornithology
for a two-day workshop,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.300
we give them all kinds of different activities
in which to participate.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.039
The big pectoral muscle that they use to flap
attaches to that bone.

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:30.939
The idea here is to have them see different
careers, different opportunities in conservation science

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.680
and also to learn a little bit about what it’s
like to be a part of higher education.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:44.920
For these kids, the opportunity to come here
and the opportunity to get up close with birds

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.340
and people who are in the field, to be able to
record sound themselves,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:58.740
touch the equipment and hear the sounds, to
be able to hold a bird in the hand and let

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.709
it go, it’s an incredible opportunity for them.

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:06.629
An opportunity that they’ve never had anything
close to it.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.420
Thousands of red-winged blackbirds and they’re
almost all males.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.880
I think it’s essential to include diverse
communities in the work that we do.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.890
Those are tree swallows. Perched.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.920
We can’t get good data on birds if we’re
not involved in communities

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.900
from all kinds of different backgrounds and
geographic areas.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.720
When we ask questions as scientists, we’re
asking questions based on our own beliefs

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.849
and our own understanding of the world.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.380
If we don’t have diversity in the sciences,
then all the questions

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.650
that we’re asking come from one viewpoint
or from one understanding of the world.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.120
And that’s not good science.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.670
So apparently there are three birds in nets
over here.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.219
These kids are topnotch.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.439
They’re thinking in interesting, creative ways.

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:06.140
And then they go back to their communities
and they feel like they want to share what

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.160
they’ve learned here.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.340
So they’re starting to build their mud nests.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.629
Many of them take on stewardship projects,
greening projects,

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.900
cleanup projects or simply projects in which
they teach others about birds.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.379
But the biggest thing that we talk to them
about is to think about

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:30.639
themselves and about their futures and what
they can do to have science be a part of their lives.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.900
Their metabolism is very fast, they have to eat a lot of food.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.799
It opens up a whole other world that they’ve
never known or dreamed about because they’ve

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.610
never been a part of it.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.659
It’s life changing for them.
