00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.580 
it will just extinguish the behavior but
you<00:01:13.790> have<00:01:13.939> to<00:01:14.090> do<00:01:14.210> it<00:01:14.329> really<00:01:14.570> quickly<00:01:14.930> you

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
spank your hand like this and you offer

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.569

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
it right back again really fast and if

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:23.889

you<00:01:22.759> do<00:01:22.909> that<00:01:23.090> then<00:01:23.299> they<00:01:23.420> just<00:01:23.600> kind<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:23.780> go

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
you do that then they just kind of go

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.319 
you do that then they just kind of go
Apes<00:01:24.310> sometimes<00:01:25.310> they<00:01:25.460> might<00:01:25.610> even<00:01:25.759> like<00:01:26.090> when

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
Apes sometimes they might even like when

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.240 
Apes sometimes they might even like when
you<00:01:26.420> do<00:01:26.570> it<00:01:26.719> and<00:01:27.500> that<00:01:27.680> means<00:01:27.860> you're<00:01:28.039> really

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
you do it and that means you're really

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.490 
you do it and that means you're really
getting<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.490> message<00:01:28.789> across<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:30.200> again

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
getting the message across and again

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.859 
getting the message across and again
it's<00:01:30.829> teaching<00:01:31.460> your<00:01:31.729> dog<00:01:31.939> that<00:01:32.240> you<00:01:32.659> know<00:01:32.750> I'm

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
it's teaching your dog that you know I'm

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.200 
it's teaching your dog that you know I'm
not<00:01:33.049> supposed<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.590> be<00:01:33.710> biting<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.609> especially

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
not supposed to be biting and especially

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.300 
not supposed to be biting and especially
this<00:01:35.509> person<00:01:35.990> it's<00:01:36.590> interesting<00:01:36.890> however
