00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.570
 hello welcome in this video we're going 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.270
 to explain a bit the mass of this 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.299
 I call bubbles and as seen in 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:19.420
 some video and nothing features 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:23.199
 they are the same as the one that the other mass does not 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.830
 stain is flexible and does not break when 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:29.470
 it is dry it dries in the air we can do 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.539
 figures is more than to make figures 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.740
 it's more for adornment because to do 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.570
 figures the truth that when left 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.370
 also but to line things too 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.100
 you do not need to stick you can cover 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.039
 frames or poliespán balls with her 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.870
 sticks alone between them and you can 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.780
 mix it with the basic colors or 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.579
 among themselves, it is worth painting 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.230
 after dry but I believe with the 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.989
 variety of colors there is not 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.989
 so much you can mix it with each other 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.019
 and for example I 'm going to teach this 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.879
 cake that I made like that from inside 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.860
 they are normal colors and then I have bathed 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.860
 with pompita is white 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.360
 the colors would be for example and colors 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.160
 that if you see it stays down the liquid 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.860
 then as long as the 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.720
 masses we have to remove it because of course 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.720
 to be still but you can see that it is 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.890
 It's super easy, you'll see in a 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.050
 pispás you already have it as if nothing you see 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.170
 and it's good of a feeling and a touch 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.720
 it's cool and it's going to be played 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.080
 colors a little more fluorine as it would be 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.710
 the green the yellow purple orange and 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.619
 such 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.180
 then red black navy blue and this 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.340
 yellow that is mixed but good 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.590
 that you see it well yellow and white 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.350
 that the white one I love and then 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.369
 we have these that are the gold and the 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.170
 silver 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.570
 these are the big boats that would be 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.950
 rather the basics come about 50 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.570
 grams depending on the color because 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.970
 it depends on the color they weigh a little more or less 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.369
 and then we would have the little ones that are 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.950
 the special colors there are glitter 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.780
 that shine and metallic that now 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.310
 let's teach the flow for the moment 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.010
 a look at these you already see that there 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.360
 quite a range of color and if not the white 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.950
 or any of them as you can 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.470
 mix with the other masses you can make 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.180
 a lot of colors now we go back 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.370
 with the little specials so far 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.340
 these would be the special colors of 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.420
 the mass of glitter bubbles that you see 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:32.239
 have as glitter and metallic 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.950
 which are colors as metallic 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.769
 that have a more metallic finish on 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.329
 the blue looks very good the 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.980
 difference between these boats and 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.560
 large is obviously the weight that 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.939
 this expresses about 14 grams and as 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.870
 they are with the most special ones as they come 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:49.219
 little ones and the truth that I use all 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.819
 because they work, each one is good for you 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:54.889
 for one thing and usually those of 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.840
 glitter are also very cool 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.909
 because it has a lot of brilliance and 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.379
 the metal ones to to line some 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.750
 thing for example some brands and they remain 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.150
 very pretty I use them a lot with the other 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.620
 dough for decorating tarts or 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.090
 any detail you want to do 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.129
 imagine what you want to do is a 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.510
 figurine with some pretty edge that you 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.650
 you can put a metal border 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.359
 and here I leave the colors would be 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.459
 orange yellow blue green the white 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:22.040
 that has brightness and the rosita and then the 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.980
 metallic orange green blue metallic 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.470
 purple yellow and like a 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.390
 cherry a coral is a bit special 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.770
 these are the little ones and any of 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.630
 the two colors if you like 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.240
 you put in touch with me and of that 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.800
 I will explain how to get them and nothing 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.660
 I hope you liked this mass that 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.310
 you have a sushi video how to make it go 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.750
 to upload some more video using it 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.750
 good until then
