00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.780
 and here we are with a bomb without which 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.939
 I was not sure if it was not going to be since 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.269
 I've seen that there are many already on youtube 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:24.240
 but I decided to do it since this is 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:27.150
 different most of a boxing from 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.849
 of this Celtic collectible vision that 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.360
 we have seen have been European versions 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.150
 or in this case Spanish what 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.630
 the stores 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:43.620
 have given before the launch day and 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:47.550
 as American versions have not not seen 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.680
 many at least in Spanish and has some 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.320
 small differences which I'm going to 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.910
 show how we can see here is my 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.950
 cute 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.800
 and cute game when I showed him the 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.290
 unboxing would happen and I'm not seeing the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.220
 reflex but good 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.840
 Let's start before we start good 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.330
 always them being the propaganda 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.180
 installed before starting too 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.400
 I want to thank Pedro Romero who 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.390
 in my boxing this one 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.450
 and he advised me that if I did not want the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.780
 digital version I could sell it to something 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.140
 that I did not know was possible and 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.650
 it turns out that only he told me that and the 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.140
 few minutes I will put the code to the 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.040
 sale on the internet and sold unless 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.850
 of a day in less than 24 hours by 45 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.090
 dollars so this this already showed 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.890
 now this collectable edition was 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.610
 paid 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.490
 part with that money 45 dollars us 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.940
 pay with the sale of that digital game 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.830
 and practically it only cost me 15 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.130
 dollars for being the difference the for 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.130
 it 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.079
 let's go back now 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.739
 we can see the box is very different to 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:15.980
 the European version the European one is a 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.980
 color I do not know if golden or color like 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.790
 something like this color that we're 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.989
 watching here 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.510
 Y 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.569
 As I told you, I sold the code for 45 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.180
 dollars and this practically came out on 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.550
 15 dollars since that's what I had to 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.490
 pay with money 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.200
 thank you very much but rosemary and you 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.700
 I wanted to say hello to you 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.520
 good 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.220
 the ones that I'm going to do the most, I could not 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.680
 play it because it sold the code and 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.430
 we started with steam boxing and once 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.450
 very carefully I had no intention 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.340
 is to open the game because as I thought 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.780
 that I was going to be left with the copy of 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.780
 metal no 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.780
 I had no intentions 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.430
 let's bring the figures of the 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.430
 mount 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:21.450
 that by the way the big difference in 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:25.730
 this case is that winning in another in the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.730
 dome of Europeans 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.569
 of luck to have something that makes it 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.850
 see very nice 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:38.000
 as soon as adornment get them 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.640
 however I dream your people with 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.770
 a collectible edition I keep it 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.650
 on the bed if singing had brought to the 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.650
 dome I might not have taken it out 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.700
 these two 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.440
 it looks very good quality 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.730
 it feels very solid plus a plastic 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.730
 cheap 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.010
 and here is the base 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.230
 and you are 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.540
 then they are like strings that go 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.150
 integrating 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.959
 this part of here which I do not know if I'm going 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.959
 to do today back 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.740
 here 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.750
 and elegant 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.520
 but as I told you, I'm going to keep it 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:40.699
 a house such as wine 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:44.800
 because that's the way I 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.800
 collection in boxes 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:51.069
 and I tell you at the same time that this edition 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.469
 It was sold in less than two weeks already 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:55.899
 they had preserved 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:58.899
 I tried to book another one because I knew 

00:04:55.899 --> 00:05:01.360
 that this was going to end quickly and I wanted 

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:03.819
 take advantage of it to be able to sell it in 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.029
 a future in the very near future 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.919
 I mean right now, I know that 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:11.110
 this is going to sell very expensive right now 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.620
 I was seeing it on ebay 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.560
 I'm selling the for $ 100 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.030
 so I was very lucky to book the 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:25.620
 in a few days, the game does not exist 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.620
 It has a very nice golden color 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.040
 let's open it 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.389
 if it's costing a little 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.740
 according to vi it does not bring more 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.410
 European version so let's see if 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.620
 it's the same in this case with the version 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.620
 american 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.260
 I did not want to break 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.229
 ah 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.700
 the code to take them off 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:26.120
 and in the code 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:28.139
 it has a role 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.100
 how should 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.100
 recommending videogames 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:37.209
 and it may be that it is human 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:47.930
 when women as a recommendation 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:52.120
 And if it's true, do not bring a manual to our 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.120
 instructions for how to use it 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:01.600
 when here he is saying that he brings a 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:04.320
 electronic manual and how to see it 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.320
 in the game 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:10.080
 it fits are being all digital now 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.160
 is very bad 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.670
 but it is an exception 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.600
 in all 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:21.460
 I love him 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.460
 that has been all for this 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:32.210
 very nice collection 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:34.960
 with the wii that is not 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.960
 James 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.069
 and the game
