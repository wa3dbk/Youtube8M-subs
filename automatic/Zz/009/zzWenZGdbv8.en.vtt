00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.340 
our deviled eggs obviously we're going
to<00:00:32.390> boil<00:00:32.720> some<00:00:32.960> eggs

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
to boil some eggs

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.689 
to boil some eggs
I've<00:00:33.470> taken<00:00:33.710> some<00:00:33.980> eggs<00:00:34.129> out<00:00:34.340> of<00:00:34.460> the<00:00:34.520> fridge

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
I've taken some eggs out of the fridge

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:35.680 
I've taken some eggs out of the fridge
and<00:00:34.730> allowed<00:00:35.030> them<00:00:35.210> to<00:00:35.239> come<00:00:35.420> to<00:00:35.540> room

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
and allowed them to come to room

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.630 
and allowed them to come to room
temperature<00:00:35.720> this<00:00:36.410> helps<00:00:36.680> to<00:00:36.860> reduce<00:00:37.160> the

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
temperature this helps to reduce the

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.250 
temperature this helps to reduce the
chance<00:00:37.850> of<00:00:37.970> the<00:00:38.090> eggs<00:00:38.269> cracking<00:00:38.750> while<00:00:39.079> they

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
chance of the eggs cracking while they

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.160 
chance of the eggs cracking while they
boil<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:40.250> we<00:00:40.489> pop<00:00:40.699> six<00:00:41.030> eggs<00:00:41.300> into<00:00:41.660> some<00:00:41.960> water

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
we're going to set up a timer for seven

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.450 
we're going to set up a timer for seven
minutes<00:00:48.019> that<00:00:48.110> will<00:00:48.379> allow<00:00:48.710> them<00:00:48.949> to<00:00:48.980> hard

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
minutes that will allow them to hard

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.880 
minutes that will allow them to hard
boil<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.030> then<00:00:50.930> we'll<00:00:51.079> move<00:00:51.199> on<00:00:51.379> our<00:00:51.650> eggs

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890
