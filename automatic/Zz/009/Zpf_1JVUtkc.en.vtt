00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
again the beauty about doing something

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.520 
again the beauty about doing something
around<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.150> neckline<00:01:13.360> is<00:01:13.780> that<00:01:13.960> both<00:01:14.170> sides

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
around the neckline is that both sides

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.370 
around the neckline is that both sides
are<00:01:14.830> symmetrical<00:01:15.790> and<00:01:15.880> equal<00:01:16.390> so<00:01:16.990> in<00:01:17.110> order<00:01:17.260> to

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
are symmetrical and equal so in order to

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.870 
are symmetrical and equal so in order to
make<00:01:17.560> sure<00:01:17.710> that<00:01:17.830> our<00:01:17.890> PIP<00:01:18.220> is<00:01:18.430> equal<00:01:18.760> on<00:01:18.850> both

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
make sure that our PIP is equal on both

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.710 
make sure that our PIP is equal on both
sides<00:01:19.360> you<00:01:19.720> can<00:01:20.049> fold<00:01:20.260> it<00:01:20.380> in<00:01:20.530> half<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:21.720> cut

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
sides you can fold it in half and cut

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.140 
sides you can fold it in half and cut
out<00:01:23.229> whichever<00:01:23.920> side<00:01:24.159> is<00:01:24.190> larger<00:01:24.490> so<00:01:25.060> it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
out whichever side is larger so it

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.880 
out whichever side is larger so it
matches<00:01:25.299> the<00:01:25.540> other<00:01:25.630> side<00:01:25.960> once<00:01:26.650> you're<00:01:26.799> happy

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.480 
start adding on our embellishments to
create<00:01:30.460> a<00:01:30.490> pattern

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.070 

once<00:01:35.490> you're<00:01:35.640> happy<00:01:35.730> with<00:01:35.940> your<00:01:36.060> pattern<00:01:36.540> use

once you're happy with your pattern use

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.020 
once you're happy with your pattern use
a<00:01:37.110> hot<00:01:37.440> glue<00:01:37.620> gun<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:38.070> apply<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.490> gems

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
a hot glue gun to apply the gems

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.660 
a hot glue gun to apply the gems
directly<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> our<00:01:39.780> lucite<00:01:40.350> bin<00:01:43.370> so<00:01:44.370> the<00:01:44.490> next

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
directly to our lucite bin so the next

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.760 
directly to our lucite bin so the next
step<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.150> to<00:01:45.270> glue<00:01:45.480> our<00:01:45.720> bib<00:01:46.050> on<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.620> our

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
you have to do is you got to flip it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.730 
you have to do is you got to flip it
over<00:01:50.400> and<00:01:50.760> as<00:01:51.300> you'll<00:01:51.540> notice<00:01:51.750> there's<00:01:52.380> glue

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
over and as you'll notice there's glue

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.320 
over and as you'll notice there's glue
on<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> back<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:53.520> glued<00:01:53.760> on<00:01:53.910> our<00:01:54.030> gems

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
on the back so we glued on our gems

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.440 
on the back so we glued on our gems
using<00:01:55.290> your<00:01:55.440> fabric<00:01:56.010> and<00:01:56.040> jewel<00:01:56.550> glue<00:01:56.940> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
using your fabric and jewel glue you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.150 
using your fabric and jewel glue you
need<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.720> put<00:01:57.900> glue<00:01:58.200> directly<00:01:58.440> onto<00:01:58.950> those

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
need to put glue directly onto those

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.820 
need to put glue directly onto those
places<00:01:59.520> otherwise<00:02:00.420> you're<00:02:01.260> gonna<00:02:01.320> see<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
places otherwise you're gonna see the

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.590 
places otherwise you're gonna see the
glue<00:02:02.040> from<00:02:02.160> the<00:02:02.310> other<00:02:02.430> side<00:02:02.730> so<00:02:03.120> be<00:02:03.240> careful

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
glue from the other side so be careful

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.480 
glue from the other side so be careful
once<00:02:04.260> you've<00:02:04.410> got<00:02:04.530> dots<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.950> glue<00:02:05.070> all<00:02:05.460> over

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
once you've got dots of glue all over

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.580 
once you've got dots of glue all over
the<00:02:06.210> back<00:02:06.420> side<00:02:06.750> we're<00:02:06.990> gonna<00:02:07.080> flip<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.410> over

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
the back side we're gonna flip it over

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.020 
the back side we're gonna flip it over
and<00:02:07.830> place<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.210> our<00:02:09.240> team<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.790> now<00:02:14.910> we're

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
and place it on to our team so now we're

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.160 
and place it on to our team so now we're
going<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.210> add<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.510> ribbon<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.840> either

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
going to add on the ribbon to either

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.620 
going to add on the ribbon to either
side<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.070> lucite<00:02:17.460> bib<00:02:17.760> we're<00:02:18.330> gonna<00:02:18.450> do

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
side of the lucite bib we're gonna do

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.840 
side of the lucite bib we're gonna do
this<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.110> looks<00:02:19.140> like<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.620> necklace<00:02:20.010> I'm<00:02:20.670> not

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.580 
this so it looks like a necklace I'm not
exactly<00:02:21.120> sure<00:02:21.330> how<00:02:21.510> long<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:22.080> want<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.440> ribbon

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
exactly sure how long I want the ribbon

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.500 
exactly sure how long I want the ribbon
yet<00:02:22.920> because<00:02:23.340> they<00:02:23.430> do<00:02:23.520> want<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:23.970> tie<00:02:24.240> and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
