00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.029 
like with me I've already done this a
couple<00:02:02.840> times<00:02:03.079> just<00:02:03.259> to<00:02:03.409> make<00:02:03.500> sure<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.829> video

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
couple times just to make sure the video

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.960 
couple times just to make sure the video
is<00:02:04.130> not<00:02:04.250> too<00:02:04.490> short<00:02:06.369> unfortunately<00:02:07.369> going<00:02:07.759> to

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
is not too short unfortunately going to

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.729 
is not too short unfortunately going to
be<00:02:08.090> but<00:02:08.420> I'm<00:02:08.720> going<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:08.989> probably<00:02:09.319> put<00:02:09.530> two

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
be but I'm going to probably put two

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.370 
be but I'm going to probably put two
parts<00:02:10.039> in<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.250> video<00:02:10.489> and<00:02:11.450> yeah<00:02:14.230> just<00:02:15.230> because

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
parts in the video and yeah just because

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.410 
parts in the video and yeah just because
this<00:02:15.530> guy<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:16.040> can<00:02:16.489> take<00:02:16.640> him<00:02:16.730> down<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:17.120> quickly

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
this guy I can take him down so quickly

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.180 
this guy I can take him down so quickly
because<00:02:17.660> my<00:02:17.900> characters<00:02:18.290> are<00:02:18.440> dance<00:02:18.739> but

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
because my characters are dance but

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.880 
because my characters are dance but
again<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.610> recommend<00:02:19.819> this<00:02:20.560> just<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.680> make<00:02:21.860> it

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
again I recommend this just to make it

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.420 
again I recommend this just to make it
easier<00:02:22.690> it's<00:02:23.690> really<00:02:24.319> more<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:24.769> a<00:02:24.890> convenience

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
easier it's really more of a convenience

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.330 
easier it's really more of a convenience
thing<00:02:26.140> I've<00:02:27.140> completed<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.860> game<00:02:28.099> and

everything completely upgraded all their
weapons<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:30.170> can<00:02:30.349> except<00:02:30.709> for<00:02:30.890> hopes<00:02:31.099> is<00:02:31.790> almost

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
weapons I can except for hopes is almost

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:38.740 
weapons I can except for hopes is almost
there<00:02:35.620> do<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:36.709> see<00:02:36.890> like<00:02:37.459> needs<00:02:38.239> act<00:02:38.480> pretty

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
there do you see like needs act pretty

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.970 
there do you see like needs act pretty
quickly<00:02:41.080> it's<00:02:42.080> not<00:02:42.200> very<00:02:42.260> much<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.769> could<00:02:42.950> say

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
quickly it's not very much I could say

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.840 
quickly it's not very much I could say
about<00:02:43.400> this

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.080 

so<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.570> mean<00:02:48.960> like<00:02:49.130> how<00:02:50.130> quickly<00:02:50.580> i<00:02:50.760> took<00:02:50.970> him

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
so I mean like how quickly i took him

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.840 
so I mean like how quickly i took him
down<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:51.540> we<00:02:51.600> took<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:51.960> 15<00:02:52.560> seconds<00:02:53.220> take<00:02:53.700> him

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
down and we took in 15 seconds take him

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.400 
down and we took in 15 seconds take him
down<00:02:53.880> that's<00:02:54.390> high<00:02:54.870> level<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:57.180> like<00:02:58.110> i<00:02:58.200> said<00:02:58.230> i

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
down that's high level so like i said i

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.430 
down that's high level so like i said i
recommend<00:02:59.040> doing<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.870> just<00:03:00.870> because<00:03:01.260> it's

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
recommend doing that just because it's

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.250 
recommend doing that just because it's
much<00:03:01.740> much<00:03:02.130> much<00:03:02.730> easier<00:03:02.790> in<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.450> long<00:03:03.570> run<00:03:04.010> um

with<00:05:17.490> a<00:05:19.430> synergist<00:05:20.430> to<00:05:20.850> give<00:05:20.970> yourself<00:05:21.090> some

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
with a synergist to give yourself some

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.029 
with a synergist to give yourself some
pups<00:05:21.660> or<00:05:21.900> you<00:05:22.080> could<00:05:22.199> just<00:05:22.229> cheat<00:05:22.650> like

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
pups or you could just cheat like

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.620 
pups or you could just cheat like
everyone<00:05:23.340> else<00:05:23.490> and<00:05:23.699> use<00:05:25.820> the<00:05:26.820> egg<00:05:27.000> is<00:05:27.150> on<00:05:27.330> for

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
everyone else and use the egg is on for

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.320 
everyone else and use the egg is on for
so<00:05:27.900> I<00:05:28.110> mean<00:05:28.860> that's<00:05:28.889> what<00:05:29.160> I<00:05:29.190> do<00:05:29.310> but<00:05:29.850> it<00:05:30.180> gets

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
so I mean that's what I do but it gets

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.000 
so I mean that's what I do but it gets
expensive<00:05:30.630> unless<00:05:31.139> you<00:05:31.380> farming<00:05:31.830> in<00:05:31.919> the

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
expensive unless you farming in the

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.460 
expensive unless you farming in the
right<00:05:32.160> areas<00:05:32.520> so<00:05:33.479> you<00:05:33.570> just<00:05:33.720> come<00:05:33.900> along<00:05:34.139> all

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
right areas so you just come along all

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.879 
right areas so you just come along all
the<00:05:34.650> way<00:05:34.770> over<00:05:34.979> here<00:05:35.010> I<00:05:36.710> don't<00:05:37.710> know<00:05:37.770> if<00:05:37.830> you

plowing through these enemies so it's
going<00:07:10.550> to<00:07:10.610> seem<00:07:11.030> like<00:07:11.060> it's<00:07:11.540> not<00:07:11.720> a<00:07:11.780> challenge

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490 
going to seem like it's not a challenge

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.260 
going to seem like it's not a challenge
but<00:07:13.490> it<00:07:13.790> really<00:07:14.060> is<00:07:14.300> at<00:07:14.600> the<00:07:14.780> start<00:07:16.270> against

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.270 
but it really is at the start against

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.390 
but it really is at the start against
why<00:07:17.780> I<00:07:17.810> recommend<00:07:18.560> upgrading<00:07:18.830> your

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 
why I recommend upgrading your

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.379 
why I recommend upgrading your
characters<00:07:19.910> first<00:07:20.620> so<00:07:21.699> yeah<00:07:22.699> I<00:07:22.729> guess<00:07:22.940> that's

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:23.389 
characters first so yeah I guess that's

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:26.080 
characters first so yeah I guess that's
it<00:07:23.540> for<00:07:23.600> these<00:07:24.290> two<00:07:24.500> missions<00:07:24.919> um<00:07:25.220> I'm<00:07:25.880> going
