00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.650
 in the interview of the week 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.299
 today it is the general of the allier 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.310
 it was delivered in person comes to me 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.080
 at the marcel michelin stadium to talk about 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.640
 Saturday shift and these 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.590
 semi-finals in Bordeaux that are expected 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.240
 all hello thierry thank you for having us 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.670
 joined at the marcel michelin stadium 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.140
 we will pay more matches on this end 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.460
 of season bah no there is a little in 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.619
 works you hear it for it to be 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.480
 did not get scared we're going to make a 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.210
 little point today on about the match 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.770
 who arrives on the moving that happens 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.910
 it's we play Saturday it's a 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.920
 relief for the fans 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.879
 Well, yes, it's a little bit 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.870
 pity it was that we waited a 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.129
 week before we announce it 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.539
 that's a bit of a pity 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.920
 weeks of waiting very long weeks 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.789
 because we at the organization level 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.800
 it's true we could have been 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.610
 popular we advance immediately there 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.870
 it is true that we are 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.250
 it goes quickly days pass quickly 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.449
 so it's a shame but otherwise 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.980
 makes it turn Saturday is good because 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.480
 that good for the fans there is no 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.559
 days off so the rest while 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.079
 world can be faithful to the post 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.520
 that's it's a plus already the sale is 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.979
 being done at the moment when we 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.960
 speaks the mainstream sale there has been 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.370
 a few 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.380
 a few more packages compared to 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.060
 last year so that's so it's 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.920
 true that right away the sale made to 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.570
 interclub level at the level of 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.369
 subscribers already it's done we saw that there 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.690
 had seats sold but hey it's 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.550
 true we sold more package than 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.080
 last year so we sold 2300 tac 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.340
 So we already knew at the beginning that we 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.240
 would be at least 1300 euros ferren 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.220
 already not bad 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.840
 so that's all that's going to happen 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.680
 sell now so I think there 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.119
 will have blue stage red days 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.340
 again I think here 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.690
 this new stadium also attracts maybe 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.100
 we want to discover this new stage of 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.960
 bordeaux a beautiful trailer 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.130
 well yes it will be the first weekend of 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.330
 where there will be rugby matches on 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.410
 could have signed play on Friday on 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.630
 could have been the first team that 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.550
 play good this will be the third we will say 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.630
 it's already good so it's real name 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.640
 but it is well supported even for 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.140
 supporters is still a new 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.890
 stage it's still more 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.810
 comfortable 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.429
 it is a small cauldron apparently it 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.530
 sees that people are going to be close to 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.700
 ground so to do more and it's a 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.369
 more but I think we can sing 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.170
 the rooms at first we were scared because 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.429
 that after the first football match there 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.840
 had had vibrations and everything then 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.069
 yes we will not be done but well 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.270
 they say they can not be no 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:05.960
 come but the commission what makes 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.310
 reassure everyone 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.810
 it's good to see what you want 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.850
 be careful though if you do not feel 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.470
 dangerous on his piano found good no 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.880
 I think it's good I think the 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.810
 players but when we vibrate 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.850
 so it'll do it 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.500
 it will do so we will meet the 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.180
 stadium Toulouse I believe you are 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.040
 close to some fan clubs 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.209
 Toulouse stadium is very much 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.590
 more toulouse good it's been a long time 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.670
 finally some time now that we 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.310
 did not meet them in the final phase 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.660
 so it's true that it was a lack 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.310
 because Toulouse remains toulouse when 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.690
 even so it's true we're in is 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.430
 close to a lot of fan clubs 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.300
 whose in the myth is everything so 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.560
 here 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.720
 we will be in contact with them 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.400
 week and to give each other the points of 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.170
 go here as it is part of 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.880
 values ​​of rugby we will say and there 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.530
 hold a real our friend as long as you 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.820
 presented very well in this image of 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.980
 a little bit like the third half 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.270
 with elvis 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.980
 it's also a chance to wink 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.560
 to the club of fans of 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.700
 bordeaux the edges of auvergnats the same 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.620
 they will be part of the party 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.480
 we have the responsibility to first play 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.500
 bordeaux and to have an anchor 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.550
 we will say because we have a club of 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.500
 supporters called and bordeaux 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.970
 verdia and so he's just taking care of 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.410
 we make small points of 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.240
 go to bordeaux for all 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.530
 supporters so we will communicate in 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.540
 that week on all of these programs 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.040
 the meeting point match days 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.110
 that's also what we do not care about 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.220
 done since we did it in saint-etienne 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.120
 we did it at twickhenham we find that 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.380
 it's nice before there was no way 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.820
 to scroll because the stage is 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.280
 far from the center of bordeaux 1 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.650
 so we will make a meeting point 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.720
 at the stadium around 14 o'clock on the 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.800
 front of the stadium and it worked well in 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.170
 Saint-Etienne it worked well rigged 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.370
 lady so we do not have that well 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.670
 will sell well what he will do 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.500
 beautiful 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.200
 the ads gathers 30 degrees so 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.210
 on the bus how was 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.340
 organized to whom we must address if we 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.930
 wants to put the buses it's really big 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.430
 Bordeaux is not so far as 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.450
 man three hours ago for the highway 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.560
 so there are a lot of people who 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.790
 favors the car but there will be 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.709
 still buses that are made by 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.880
 the supporters clubs so even the buses 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.050
 in contact and interclube 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.090
 there are still some places in the 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.560
 bus and then that's it but I think that 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.790
 the biggest means will carry will remain 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.950
 the car still on this move 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.690
 so we can imagine long parade of 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.160
 cars as in the good old days of 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.750
 final stages what the series of nice 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.550
 a short break in the era of Corrèze in 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.200
 the era of Corrèze but because there is 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.780
 a small reception point is organized 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.890
 by our friends of the mountain sport auto 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.120
 do it that can be nice in 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.610
 more here and so we talk about 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.709
 moving but clearly has people 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.109
 will end up in bars and jose 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.400
 planned particular or not not for 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.430
 a semifinal we'll say billion is 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.930
 scheduled for the usual places where 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.100
 people will see the matches and then I 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.940
 think that in just a few moments 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.470
 we may have a tool 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.150
 extra I think this match is 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.050
 quite possibly it's possible in a few 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.639
 time we go a little bit talked 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.800
 the mobile application dedicated to 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.960
 supporters will go out in the next 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.280
 days actually it's going to be a plus 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.919
 for supporters who are a 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.270
 clearly where one is clearly from 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.379
 find a nice place where we can see 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.400
 the match together that can be some 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:48.129
 be there is the goal 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.720
 you will discover that soon the goal 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.210
 being to gather a maximum of supporters 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.340
 whether it's clearly 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.379
 bordeaux in paris here in all 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.639
 cities of France see even further 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.830
 again so here I am well 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.870
 and of course thierry there are three colors 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.930
 in life and yes always 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.889
 john ol blue and yellow and blue so you 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.110
 will put some yellow and blue for 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.129
 Saturday inevitably when I arrived a 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.389
 little bit sure but that's what I see 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:12.069
 I saw that you started I'm here 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.449
 think about the optics in half that 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.129
 always make up very very well and that 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.199
 I meet during the final stages and 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.300
 on a few games I count on you 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.860
 oh well yes it's obligatory anyway 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.120
 pity finally a little call to the flag 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.300
 a little call to the balls to the west 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.280
 it's important that this status 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.080
 that's for sure that's thank you you count that 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.919

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.050
