00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
so once again there's a couple of

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.619 
so once again there's a couple of
different<00:00:13.549> ways<00:00:13.730> that<00:00:13.760> you<00:00:14.000> can<00:00:14.180> play<00:00:14.330> an<00:00:14.510> F

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:14.629 
different ways that you can play an F

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.670 
different ways that you can play an F
minor<00:00:15.219> the<00:00:16.219> easiest<00:00:16.550> way<00:00:16.880> is<00:00:17.349> to<00:00:18.349> place<00:00:18.650> your

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
minor the easiest way is to place your

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.830 
minor the easiest way is to place your
first<00:00:19.010> finger<00:00:19.189> across<00:00:19.970> the<00:00:20.119> first<00:00:20.330> second<00:00:20.810> and

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
first finger across the first second and

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.490 
first finger across the first second and
third<00:00:21.140> strings<00:00:21.439> on<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:21.890> first<00:00:22.189> fret<00:00:23.020> hold<00:00:24.020> all

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
third strings on the first fret hold all

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.740 
third strings on the first fret hold all
of<00:00:24.740> those<00:00:24.919> down<00:00:25.250> as<00:00:25.490> firmly<00:00:25.759> as<00:00:25.820> you<00:00:26.000> can<00:00:26.300> and

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
of those down as firmly as you can and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.440 
of those down as firmly as you can and
then<00:00:27.590> use<00:00:27.800> your<00:00:27.950> third<00:00:28.189> finger<00:00:28.460> on<00:00:29.029> the<00:00:29.180> fourth

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
then use your third finger on the fourth

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.440 
then use your third finger on the fourth
string<00:00:29.509> third<00:00:30.050> fret<00:00:30.910> fifth<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.180> sixth

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
string third fret fifth and sixth

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.560 
string third fret fifth and sixth
strings<00:00:32.630> aren't<00:00:33.050> played<00:00:33.350> and<00:00:34.420> usually<00:00:35.420> what

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
strings aren't played and usually what

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.620 
strings aren't played and usually what
I'd<00:00:35.719> suggest<00:00:36.290> is<00:00:36.590> using<00:00:37.100> your<00:00:37.219> thumb<00:00:37.579> to<00:00:38.420> wrap

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
I'd suggest is using your thumb to wrap

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.420 
I'd suggest is using your thumb to wrap
around<00:00:38.660> so<00:00:39.170> you<00:00:39.230> could<00:00:39.410> slightly<00:00:39.890> mute<00:00:40.190> those

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
around so you could slightly mute those

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.480 
around so you could slightly mute those
strings<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:40.940> they<00:00:40.969> don't<00:00:41.270> play<00:00:41.629> but<00:00:42.620> for<00:00:43.040> new

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:43.490 
strings so they don't play but for new

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.130 
strings so they don't play but for new
players<00:00:43.820> you<00:00:44.180> may<00:00:44.330> find<00:00:44.630> that<00:00:44.810> difficult

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
players you may find that difficult

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.690 
players you may find that difficult
because<00:00:45.620> you<00:00:45.890> won't<00:00:46.040> have<00:00:46.190> enough<00:00:46.670> strength

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
because you won't have enough strength

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.050 
because you won't have enough strength
to<00:00:47.120> hold<00:00:47.390> down<00:00:47.600> all<00:00:48.440> three<00:00:48.920> of<00:00:49.040> those<00:00:49.220> first

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
to hold down all three of those first

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.150 
to hold down all three of those first
three<00:00:50.390> strings<00:00:50.630> there<00:00:51.079> so<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.410> may<00:00:51.740> have<00:00:51.980> to

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
three strings there so you may have to

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.490 
three strings there so you may have to
just<00:00:52.370> avoid<00:00:52.700> playing<00:00:53.120> them<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.960> use<00:00:54.320> your

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
just avoid playing them and use your

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.260 
just avoid playing them and use your
thumb<00:00:54.770> around<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.190> back<00:00:55.400> of<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:55.700> net<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:56.120> give

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
thumb around the back of the net to give

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.880 
thumb around the back of the net to give
you<00:00:56.360> some<00:00:56.570> extra<00:00:56.989> leverage<00:00:57.350> while<00:00:57.739> you're

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
you some extra leverage while you're

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.330 
you some extra leverage while you're
playing<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:59.560> that's<00:01:00.560> how<00:01:00.770> the<00:01:00.829> cord<00:01:01.160> should

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
playing and that's how the cord should

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.560 
playing and that's how the cord should
sound<00:01:02.079> one<00:01:03.079> thing<00:01:03.290> that<00:01:03.440> I<00:01:03.470> do<00:01:03.590> sometimes<00:01:04.570> is

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
sound one thing that I do sometimes is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.569 
sound one thing that I do sometimes is
used<00:01:05.990> this<00:01:06.200> second<00:01:06.649> finger<00:01:06.860> here<00:01:07.220> to<00:01:07.340> just

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
used this second finger here to just

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.969 
used this second finger here to just
touch<00:01:07.820> that<00:01:07.850> fifth<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:08.540> sixth<00:01:08.869> string<00:01:09.170> so

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
touch that fifth and sixth string so

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.950 
touch that fifth and sixth string so
that<00:01:10.130> if<00:01:10.189> I'm<00:01:10.310> playing<00:01:10.520> chords

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.070 

it'll<00:01:14.440> need<00:01:14.830> those<00:01:15.070> two<00:01:15.310> strings<00:01:16.020> now<00:01:17.020> the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
it'll need those two strings now the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.020 
it'll need those two strings now the
better<00:01:17.770> way<00:01:17.979> of<00:01:18.100> playing<00:01:18.310> this<00:01:18.490> core<00:01:18.760> is<00:01:18.790> to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
better way of playing this core is to

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.000 
better way of playing this core is to
use<00:01:19.150> a<00:01:19.180> bar<00:01:19.510> chord<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.140> again<00:01:20.470> it's<00:01:20.710> gonna<00:01:20.830> be

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
use a bar chord and again it's gonna be

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.050 
use a bar chord and again it's gonna be
a<00:01:21.040> little<00:01:21.159> bit<00:01:21.340> difficult<00:01:21.549> for<00:01:21.940> beginners

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
a little bit difficult for beginners

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.969 
a little bit difficult for beginners
because<00:01:22.570> you're<00:01:22.900> having<00:01:23.110> to<00:01:23.260> hold<00:01:23.500> down<00:01:23.680> all

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
because you're having to hold down all

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.640 
because you're having to hold down all
six<00:01:24.400> strings<00:01:24.820> right<00:01:25.780> at<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.020> first<00:01:26.320> fret

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
six strings right at the first fret

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.890 
six strings right at the first fret
which<00:01:27.100> is<00:01:27.130> probably<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.150> hardest<00:01:28.509> place<00:01:28.750> to

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
which is probably the hardest place to

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.499 
which is probably the hardest place to
hold<00:01:29.110> down<00:01:29.290> all<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.680> six<00:01:29.920> strings<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:31.420> you

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
hold down all the six strings so you

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.510 
hold down all the six strings so you
hold<00:01:31.659> all<00:01:31.840> those<00:01:31.990> down<00:01:32.259> like<00:01:32.530> that<00:01:32.800> use<00:01:33.340> your

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
hold all those down like that use your

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.880 
hold all those down like that use your
second<00:01:33.940> finger<00:01:34.090> on<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:35.020> fifth<00:01:35.350> string<00:01:35.409> third

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890

I've<00:01:49.090> done<00:01:49.119> here<00:01:49.450> is<00:01:49.509> I've<00:01:49.720> written<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.350> song

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
I've done here is I've written a song

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.240 
I've done here is I've written a song
that<00:01:51.820> basically<00:01:52.270> uses<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:53.289> F<00:01:53.440> minor<00:01:53.800> and<00:01:54.130> all

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
that basically uses the F minor and all

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.840 
that basically uses the F minor and all
the<00:01:54.429> way<00:01:54.550> through<00:01:54.850> it<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:56.140> I've<00:01:56.289> also<00:01:56.850> changed

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
the way through it but I've also changed

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.090 
the way through it but I've also changed
it<00:01:58.090> up<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.360> little<00:01:58.450> bit<00:01:58.720> so<00:01:59.229> that<00:01:59.259> it<00:01:59.740> just<00:01:59.950> makes

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
it up a little bit so that it just makes

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.260 
it up a little bit so that it just makes
a<00:02:00.220> song<00:02:00.460> sound<00:02:00.729> a<00:02:00.820> little<00:02:00.970> bit<00:02:01.060> more

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
a song sound a little bit more

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.270 
a song sound a little bit more
interesting<00:02:01.899> I<00:02:02.050> tried<00:02:02.649> it<00:02:02.740> with<00:02:02.860> just<00:02:03.070> an<00:02:03.160> F

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
interesting I tried it with just an F

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.100 
interesting I tried it with just an F
minor<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:04.149> it<00:02:04.509> was<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.630> little<00:02:04.810> boring

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
minor and it was a little boring

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.889 
minor and it was a little boring
sounding<00:02:05.740> so<00:02:06.009> I've<00:02:06.190> added<00:02:08.970> these<00:02:09.970> notes<00:02:10.660> as

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
sounding so I've added these notes as

00:02:10.899 --> 00:06:57.370 
sounding so I've added these notes as
well

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.380 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.690 

so<00:06:58.380> you<00:06:58.470> probably<00:06:58.830> noticed<00:06:59.190> quite<00:06:59.430> a<00:06:59.460> few

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700 
so you probably noticed quite a few

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.700 
so you probably noticed quite a few
times<00:06:59.940> while<00:07:00.300> I<00:07:00.330> was<00:07:00.450> playing<00:07:00.720> that<00:07:01.110> I<00:07:01.320> had<00:07:01.560> to

times while I was playing that I had to

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:09.470 
times while I was playing that I had to
switch<00:07:02.040> from<00:07:04.250> from<00:07:05.250> that<00:07:05.280> to<00:07:05.970> that<00:07:08.270> because<00:07:09.270> my

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.480 
switch from from that to that because my

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.490 
switch from from that to that because my
fingers<00:07:09.960> were<00:07:10.110> getting<00:07:10.440> really<00:07:10.950> sore<00:07:12.050> so<00:07:13.050> feel
