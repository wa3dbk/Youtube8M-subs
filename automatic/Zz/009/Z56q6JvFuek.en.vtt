00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.940
 I will show you all Armada today 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.160
 my very good fight to st dessert in 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.690
 the level on the batchata in advance will not 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.640
 telling you the results will not 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.100
 you can say what was in it like me here 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.730
 played from on which i will tell me here very 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.560
 very lucky I will not tell you 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.500
 point to those moments I have no luck 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.899
 although they will even be without a microscope 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.090
 visible since there will be quite 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.489
 so much what's so lucky here 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.710
 it was what am i about this article 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.960
 show off you can say hi well 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.300
 First of all, my luck was that 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.640
 I was not killed until the end was belle not 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.640
 only at the end of the first place what could 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.920
 for the period say almost here kill but 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.050
 the result will be very good even 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.770
 several home not so much for frags 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.250
 odio opposition medal general themselves all 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.760
 will see 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.799
 and therefore weakened while the card with us 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.720
 called quiet beach 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.600
 she likes me very much and I 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.070
 just never would have won back here remember 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.570
 old katy perry when there was not yet 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.320
 of this wonderful island 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.869
 the card was very sad everyone stood on the go 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.939
 on the hill all did not go anywhere here 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.189
 even the only possibility of terrible 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.549
 but there is through it to put on the island 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.009
 who does not go there, I just sympathize 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.840
 then take me to someone 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.109
 most likely was the joints apparently he 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.770
 u lit on u glowed in square e8 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:39.149
 but this is in principle and problems because 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.880
 there will be many other interesting 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.969
 moments of Odessa decided to shift 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.319
 give this place rewind no 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.509
 dumping because it is not very 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.369
 it seems interesting to me 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.299
 I went pretty quickly she is in it 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.219
 plan bolshakov or 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.950
 rewind quietly and see already 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.359
 will start now here is such a stone 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.490
 action because here I was become 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:04.200
 near a pebble and do what i do 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.020
 I love the most on the batchata and this 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.599
 getting here and not just lucky me and 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.730
 look takin luckily come across and 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.819
 passed news and just be next 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.890
 petelechku beads miracle just her 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.410
 taking away means further what's on us 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.360
 I'm not going to be forged by the object myself 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.230
 I was imprisoned in no way to help my friend 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.680
 I can not because well, not reach the subway 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.680
 7 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.750
 I would like of course to fix these 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.850
 developers here this tank with a sight 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.730
 in the replays because here he is 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.769
 I don't look so good 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.829
 then look beyond the night movement 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:47.340
 quite understand that you need to get it 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:50.069
 punch doing him drinking beer and in 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.459
 In general, there will be a moment when by the week 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.310
 getting in general so far just watching 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.709
 and enjoy 1900 for now two 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.799
 fraga this guys just the beginning of the battles for sure 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.799
 say more will be mourning for individuals 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.630
 and to the enemy and to me their allies 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:10.079
 it would be very rich here 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.349
 By the way, if you don't play water 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.079
 no one talk with anyone playing for that is 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.840
 some reasons for your account 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.810
 that 55 seemed to be defeating tomas and your 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.790
 there 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.800
 We keep the idea pretty good and not here 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.770
 there were guys even though we have more nines and 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.819
 we would have a dozen from already more by one 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.620
 unit 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.060
 and yet now the team will start 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:37.840
 very sadly suck in squares there 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.819
 abcd is such a very unlucky team. 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.170
 caught even he and who knows 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.290
 here it was possible to principle well 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.750
 play for example if here we are 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.430
 rush novelties I can verses 2 and 7 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.180
 would it make sense there would be all 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.430
 much cooler 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.860
 such neighbors can I filled it 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.470
 position now this position is money 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.170
 the microphone is adjusted now this position 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.840
 I will know and to be honest there on e100 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.580
 so go very well so rather 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.160
 all i am next time where i will go though 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.319
 if anyone any t30 becomes 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.450
 the girl in k0 seems to me all he will 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.569
 once lumbago as you know him very much 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.690
 look don't look already 57 account I'm here 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:23.210
 nakida little by little I understand 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:27.550
 what to throw here for a long time can't mean 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:32.259
 I wait seven 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:35.240
 here there is a punch again on the compartments lucky 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:38.840
 means to breathe and understanding what is needed 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.150
 from here it is necessary to throw it from here because 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.590
 that standing here is essentially nothing to graze 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.090
 seven there through her for armor 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.759
 pike nose tanking sense opinion from 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.180
 so I decide to go here and where am I 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:55.400
 food guys I'm food in square b 6 b5 why 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.919
 First there are many of our allies 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.440
 English cover me and in principle 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.210
 my apparent luck is about to begin 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.430
 because until that moment were enough 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.500
 some such lucky moments they were 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.190
 not so interesting to say so 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:13.430
 possible to those who are just leaving for a long time 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.289
 and knows how to recognize let's say a miracle 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.090
 right that is who is not much years here 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.580
 understand that I have been here many times 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.970
 lucky basically getting here in general 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.699
 Yes, and I have to d 30 38 seconds please 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.690
 forgiveness now another leopard to capture 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.590
 base 100 doesn't take my sovzvodnogo and 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.340
 our carousel starts 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.340
 such 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.860
 take it I see isa third call what 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:55.630
 I'm 30 fps baptized by this I now 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.450
 a lot of trouble and I can mess things up 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.920
 relation to the Prague team means me 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:02.890
 four shells already on isa third 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.080
 take a shell apparently cretu &amp; bk second 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:09.040
 I blow his tobacco his food and that 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.740
 will be noticing quick got off and he is not 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.960
 punches more precisely get not in the harp I 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.870
 him from the service of the upper armor plates I told them 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.600
 we shoot off the port propensity for points and 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.760
 I understand that it is not neatly hooked 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.500
 to dump him neatly 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:28.900
 means already to capture our base by 40 on 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.880
 almost 50 seconds left until the end i 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.240
 I understand that you need to quickly run to the base 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.370
 below 5 frags 6100 damage is very 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.610
 much even for just ordinary reasonable 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:43.960
 the battle is pretty pretty on although it is the most 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:45.190
 normal random start until rewind 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.410
 my sad ride 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.150
 I don’t leave a big one 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.100
 dull but turning speed with him 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.880
 Of course tugovat here who competently here with 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.550
 I agree 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.919
 Here I am on the second luck and guys 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.750
 something happened with a regular tiger up 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:02.080
 I do not get here I understand that now is not 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:04.240
 will take but he gets into the harp and I 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.580
 the guys here take the top armor 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.200
 here forever for your saw I could 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.960
 quick pit turn around for some reason 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.780
 forward arrived possible and I therefore 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.760
 blunted means what will happen I adore 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:19.600
 here to the least that I understand that on the right and 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.550
 where something worth shooting at him to punch 

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.740
 him to rush damage to capture and not knocking 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.600
 in the last one literally seconds i mean i 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.300
 Here at home means seven thousand 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:31.350
 Damage is a warrior medal and by the way 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:34.030
 very cool now you can see the medal of the warrior 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:36.310
 a lot of luck three times me this 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:39.280
 just lucky with his third with 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.860
 its 7 m with a tiger second and that what 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.960
 i had three shp just a succession of luck 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.760
 I was just struck by the sample armada 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.470
