00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
historical battles are like you take a

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.629 
historical battles are like you take a
little<00:03:10.409> bit<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.590> critical<00:03:11.010> damage<00:03:11.219> on<00:03:11.549> the

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
little bit of critical damage on the

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.059 
little bit of critical damage on the
wings<00:03:11.879> sometimes<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:12.629> loses<00:03:13.530> complete

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
wings sometimes that loses complete

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.199 
wings sometimes that loses complete
control<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.810> just<00:03:16.019> fold<00:03:16.889> two<00:03:17.549> out<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.150> the

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
control and you just fold two out of the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.439 
control and you just fold two out of the
sky<00:03:18.449> to<00:03:18.719> your<00:03:18.870> death<00:03:19.699> so<00:03:20.699> it<00:03:21.060> seems<00:03:21.209> like
