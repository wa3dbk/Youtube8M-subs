00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.560
 hi friends from youtube I am 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.689
 today I leave here a new video of 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.610
 curiosities this time I'll talk about a 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.530
 superhero children movie that a 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.750
 I personally liked it a lot when 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.120
 I went to see them as a child I'm 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.480
 talking about the incredible without more than 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.280
 say let's start with the curiosities in 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.199
 the original script of the film is 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.480
 they had written two villains but at 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.900
 final they decided to leave a single 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.750
 villain that would be syndrome were used 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.940
 1800 computers for the realization of 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.059
 this animation movie generated by 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.460
 computer is the first time that pixar 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.740
 animation studios works with characters 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.990
 totally human and one of the biggest 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.300
 difficulties was the production of the 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.520
 skin , hair and clothes in such a way that 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.670
 will be credible in the distribution of 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.410
 human characters many people 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.110
 they assure that in the scene in which 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.670
 incredible mister stops the train is 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.250
 similar to the scene of the movie 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.990
 Spider-Man 2 you what they think is 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.869
 seem these scenes leave their 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.970
 comment the character of frost or not 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.490
 is based on the speed skater 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.230
 on ice shani davis who won a 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.100
 gold medal at the Olympic Games 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.110
 Winter mirage is a character from the 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.230
 movie but it's also a factory 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.540
 French aircraft initially the 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.550
 Animation movie would be developed 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.050
 in the warner bros company but it 's 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.180
 closed its animation division 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.250
 then brad bird director of the 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.670
 movie was then hired by 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.650
 pixar to develop the project there 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.990
 the hardest scene to shoot was the 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.850
 family fight during the meal in the 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.450
 that everyone ends up using their 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.000
 superpowers the incredible is the sixth 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.459
