carburizing<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.799> think<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.040> what<00:01:26.189> they<00:01:26.280> call<00:01:26.460> it

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640

carburizing I think is what they call it
in<00:01:26.759> layman's<00:01:27.330> terms<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.990> thing's<00:01:28.170> not<00:01:28.320> going

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
in layman's terms that thing's not going

right the front is going to have a very
aerodynamic<00:03:40.160> vehicle<00:03:41.000> they've<00:03:41.300> really

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
aerodynamic vehicle they've really

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.280 
aerodynamic vehicle they've really
concentrated<00:03:43.010> on<00:03:43.160> only<00:03:44.120> getting<00:03:44.720> as<00:03:44.870> much<00:03:45.080> air

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
concentrated on only getting as much air

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.070

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
you can get a manual transmission at a

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.120 
you can get a manual transmission at a
two<00:05:02.940> wheel<00:05:03.090> drive<00:05:03.120> so<00:05:04.080> if<00:05:04.410> you<00:05:04.530> do<00:05:04.650> a<00:05:04.680> two<00:05:04.980> wheel

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
two wheel drive so if you do a two wheel

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.880 
two wheel drive so if you do a two wheel
drive<00:05:05.660> manual<00:05:06.660> transmission<00:05:07.320> you<00:05:07.380> get<00:05:07.500> 19

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
drive manual transmission you get 19

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.670 
drive manual transmission you get 19
city<00:05:08.190> 26<00:05:08.970> highway<00:05:09.270> and<00:05:09.480> if<00:05:10.230> you<00:05:10.320> do<00:05:10.470> the

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
city 26 highway and if you do the

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.380 
city 26 highway and if you do the
automatic<00:05:11.130> and<00:05:11.280> two<00:05:11.400> wheel<00:05:11.550> drive<00:05:11.580> you<00:05:11.940> get<00:05:12.060> 20

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
automatic and two wheel drive you get 20

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.330 
automatic and two wheel drive you get 20
27<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.170> then<00:05:13.650> if<00:05:13.770> you<00:05:13.830> go<00:05:13.920> to<00:05:13.980> four-wheel

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
27 and then if you go to four-wheel
