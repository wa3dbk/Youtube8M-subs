00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:10.400
 I usually those before the background is there 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:15.280
 from a total flat pattern to the 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.280
 background always putting this design 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.010
 in the highest possible level of way 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:26.930
 that you can always see this 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:32.050
 level and let's start coloring we help each other 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:36.290
 our light areas this first phase 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:39.050
 but you can also use a nice brush 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.390
 big simply to have an idea so much 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.720
 then you can delete that part in 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.000
 excess without problems then it is 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:53.660
 the subjective thing is everyone 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.920
 its so don't be afraid to make mistakes 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.990
 and go ahead you cannot cancel 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.640
 correcting computer also allows it 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.220
 the program 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.900
 ok then if you noticed that you have 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.979
 given the brush in areas where not 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:15.860
 had to go pretty easy take 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:18.470
 the bomb and usually wipe me in 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.960
 great record a lot to delete 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.200
 right near the edge and all with a 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.590
 precise small brush I have 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.579
 added another level to give light 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.579
 to further 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.300
 there are those for example 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.300
 if starting from a silhouette 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:50.140
 as I know 1 a little sketch is prepared 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.140
 maybe he thinks something he wants to do 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.970
 even if it is not precise it does not matter much 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.970
 then it will be corrected later 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.000
 there is some imperfection on the 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:40.890
 dimensions that just take ours 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.629
 dear levels and change a little like there 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.860
 apparently 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:49.190
 see let's say we have ours 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:52.560
 silhouette corrective imperfections 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.910
 then we have our silhouettes e 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.849
 what to do now you go to act on it 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.409
 let's make a new level 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:07.010
 we must give him represses of 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.010
 light well 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.880
 let's see 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.280
 then continue until you get 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.690
 something more or less defined 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.690
 in short it is this starting from one 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.690
 silhouette
