00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
game is truly amazing your altimeter

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.080 
game is truly amazing your altimeter
over<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:28.950> acceleration<00:01:29.759> speed<00:01:30.030> I

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
over here you have acceleration speed I

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.429 
over here you have acceleration speed I
mean<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.659> see<00:01:31.040> all<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.430> different<00:01:33.439> types

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
mean you can see all the different types

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.620 
mean you can see all the different types
of<00:01:34.560> controls<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.820> have<00:01:35.970> available<00:01:36.119> on

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
this game now if you play rise of glory

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.160 
this game now if you play rise of glory
you'd<00:01:38.939> be<00:01:39.060> familiar<00:01:39.509> with<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.869> right<00:01:40.140> here

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
you'd be familiar with this right here

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.740 
you'd be familiar with this right here
this<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.560> your<00:01:40.710> acceleration<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.479> right

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
this is your acceleration on the right

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.870 
this is your acceleration on the right
and<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.439> have<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:44.030> tracking<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.200> bottom

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
and you have a tracking on on the bottom

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.340 
and you have a tracking on on the bottom
right<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.409> we're<00:01:49.530> playing<00:01:49.710> here<00:01:51.350> my-my-my

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
right so so we're playing here my-my-my

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.109 
right so so we're playing here my-my-my
everybody's<00:01:53.009> taking<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.460> speeds<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.000> I'm

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
everybody's taking on speeds and I'm

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.999 
everybody's taking on speeds and I'm
starting<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.570> tilt<00:01:54.810> they're<00:01:55.619> gonna<00:01:55.740> store

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
starting to tilt they're gonna store

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.350 
starting to tilt they're gonna store
water<00:01:56.130> back<00:01:56.369> here<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.479> little<00:01:57.750> bit<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:59.360> we

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
water back here just a little bit and we

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.170 
water back here just a little bit and we
are<00:02:00.390> off<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.079> ground<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.219> what<00:02:02.310> you're<00:02:03.000> seeing

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
are off the ground so what you're seeing

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.660 
are off the ground so what you're seeing
these

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.090 

you<00:02:08.670> see<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.060> calibration<00:02:09.720> all<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.800> device

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
you see the calibration all the device

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.180 
you see the calibration all the device
still<00:02:11.490> has<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.880> be<00:02:11.970> calibrated<00:02:12.200> rat<00:02:13.200> can<00:02:13.920> test

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
still has to be calibrated rat can test

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.950 
still has to be calibrated rat can test
and<00:02:14.460> see<00:02:15.150> how<00:02:16.550> my<00:02:17.550> calibration<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.480> affected

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
and see how my calibration is affected

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.560 
and see how my calibration is affected
at<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.670> controls<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.820> games<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.450> make

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
at the controls of the games to make

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:32.660 
at the controls of the games to make
sure<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:29.660> real<00:02:30.660> myogenic<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.950> taken<00:02:32.490> off

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
sure that so real myogenic is taken off

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.270 
sure that so real myogenic is taken off
and<00:02:32.940> applying<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.300> these<00:02:33.890> through<00:02:34.890> these<00:02:35.100> red

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
and applying to these through these red

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.910 
and applying to these through these red
squares<00:02:35.810> place<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.050> wrong<00:02:37.200> flip<00:02:38.040> around<00:02:38.220> and

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
squares place the wrong flip around and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:51.800 
squares place the wrong flip around and
like<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.100> said<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.400> can<00:02:41.580> see<00:02:41.760> here<00:02:50.240> if<00:02:51.240> I<00:02:51.450> pulled

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
like I said you can see here if I pulled

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.480 
like I said you can see here if I pulled
up<00:02:51.930> right<00:02:52.200> here<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.500> can<00:02:52.650> see<00:02:52.860> it's<00:02:53.010> going<00:02:53.220> up

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
up right here you can see it's going up

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.160 
up right here you can see it's going up
and<00:02:53.580> then<00:02:53.700> this<00:02:53.820> tells<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.300> how<00:02:54.510> quickly

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
and then this tells you how quickly

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.010 
and then this tells you how quickly
you're<00:02:56.100> pulling<00:02:56.490> up<00:02:56.640> how<00:02:57.390> many<00:02:57.660> feet<00:02:57.840> you're

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
you're pulling up how many feet you're

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:05.540 
you're pulling up how many feet you're
pulling<00:02:58.350> up<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.080> said<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.290> mean<00:03:04.590> though

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
pulling up so like I said I mean though

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.600 
pulling up so like I said I mean though
is<00:03:07.730> can<00:03:08.730> take<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.360> screen<00:03:10.080> shot<00:03:10.130> down<00:03:11.130> here<00:03:11.400> the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
is can take a screen shot down here the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:19.270 
is can take a screen shot down here the
bottom

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:29.120 

angles<00:03:21.200> right<00:03:22.200> here<00:03:27.470> was<00:03:28.470> amazing<00:03:28.920> I'm<00:03:29.100> a

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
angles right here was amazing I'm a

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.289 
angles right here was amazing I'm a
pilot<00:03:29.549> but<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.150> mean<00:03:30.360> it<00:03:30.630> looks<00:03:30.989> really<00:03:32.299> really
