 Who is surprised that the carnegie hall before 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.670
 a few days freaked out is who the

 pianist daniel trifonov in concert 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.240
 He can easily experience his power 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.460
 do not escape 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.560
 with just 21 and brand new ones 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.930
 record contract shines in the truest 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.660
 think global player an exciting one 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.119
 facing the future with probably more yoga 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.269
 stretching and swimming than before 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.269
 compensation for the ecstasy on the stage 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.489
 mariinsky the fire bird a few last 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.489
 two hands 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.370
 the music acts like an electric one 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.370
 shock she leaves me 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:19.310
 When I play I totally forget myself 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:21.560
 no longer deliver to music on 21 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.020
 Russian that he is already the biggest 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.260
 pianist hauses b youth really does not matter 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.940
 when hits after plays it is as 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.720
 you would be a completely new instrument 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.140
 hear 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.140
 he is sensitive and appropriately playful 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.200
 this little performance is here 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.869
 By the way, an idea what they do not see 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.869
 his entourage just twists 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.390
 but again the eye is played so 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.680
 also defeats the childlike work with the 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.680
 doors of the career 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:19.430
 The stool should be as long as possible 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:22.240
 for the head and then I do not care 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.240
 that was not missing 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.790
 u

 a genial special me 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.950
 started to compose 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.950
 on a center trip the home 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.610
 We also had a piano 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.610
 that did not interest me 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.760
 but this keyboard is my father 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.630
 One day brought that was very 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.060
 inspiring 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.830
 I loved being out of the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:19.640
 same buttons completely different 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:25.670
 Sounds out I did 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:27.260
 He sits for hours at five and a half 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.060
 then to the piano and 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.060
 everything soon gets out of your head 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.450
 I am eight then for the first time 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.300
 orchestra occurred 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.920
 in my hometown she played this 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.620
 Mozart Concert Number 17 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.770
 and suddenly a milk tooth fell out 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.560
 what should I not then of the yes 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.200
 just spit on the floor at the 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.090
 lyrical music so hit you 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.390
 tooth just down I had none 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.390

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.690
 piano concert number two 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:34.980
 Break is the most important thing is that 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:38.870
 Employer in the second sentence you can 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.870
 Listen to clearly known vocals 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.600
 sushi 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.400
 my name still manages that 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.020
 not like an imitation of known ones 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.020
 sounds very honest 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.800
 Of course, a long one helps here as well 

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:15.800
 breathing while playing 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.580
 sometimes it is more, of course 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.560
 to give power but control over 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.150
 the fading of a sound is the 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.150
 challenging part of the game 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.730
 catterfeld

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:13.909
 triumphantly in the crm gadget and one 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.469
 the big plates signed and 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:16.939
 otherwise 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:19.699
 He urgently needs his snowball 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:22.309
 Technology works in all Rakhmaninov 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:28.309

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:31.479
