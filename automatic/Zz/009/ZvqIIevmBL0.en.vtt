but how do we optimize the use of a
scene<00:00:09.210> this<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.929> writing<00:00:10.290> with<00:00:10.410> Jane<00:00:18.920> think<00:00:19.920> of

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
scene this is writing with Jane think of

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.800 
scene this is writing with Jane think of
a<00:00:20.100> scene<00:00:20.310> like<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.580> condensed<00:00:21.060> story<00:00:21.420> with<00:00:21.779> a

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
a scene like a condensed story with a

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.349 
a scene like a condensed story with a
beginning<00:00:22.020> middle<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.920> an<00:00:23.070> end<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.550> don't

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
beginning middle and an end and don't

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.939 
beginning middle and an end and don't
forget<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.840> has<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.199> have<00:00:25.350> some<00:00:25.680> sort<00:00:25.890> of

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
forget it has to have some sort of

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.560 
forget it has to have some sort of
conflict<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.550> order<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:26.970> kept<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
conflict in order to be kept in the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.019 
conflict in order to be kept in the
story<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.050> how<00:00:28.619> does<00:00:28.680> an<00:00:28.890> arc<00:00:29.039> apply<00:00:29.250> well<00:00:29.760> for

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
story so how does an arc apply well for

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.700 
story so how does an arc apply well for
one<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.869> think<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.230> scene<00:00:31.500> as

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
one I like to think of a scene as

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.220 
one I like to think of a scene as
starting<00:00:32.099> out<00:00:32.219> positively<00:00:32.940> or<00:00:33.120> negatively

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
starting out positively or negatively

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.020 
starting out positively or negatively
then<00:00:34.230> as<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> scene<00:00:34.770> progresses<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.489> ends<00:00:35.880> in

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
then as the scene progresses it ends in

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.520 
then as the scene progresses it ends in
the<00:00:36.120> opposite<00:00:36.570> here's<00:00:36.870> another<00:00:37.140> one<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.380> my

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
the opposite here's another one of my

character most likely worse but in the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.749 
character most likely worse but in the
end<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:51.930> all<00:01:52.170> worth<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.979> hero<00:01:53.220> comes<00:01:53.520> out

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759
