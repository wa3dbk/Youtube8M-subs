he's about what I expected now we're

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.620 
he's about what I expected now we're
gonna<00:01:24.679> look<00:01:24.800> at<00:01:24.920> his<00:01:25.069> base<00:01:25.310> now<00:01:26.209> this<00:01:26.390> is<00:01:26.509> the

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
gonna look at his base now this is the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.460 
gonna look at his base now this is the
same<00:01:26.840> size<00:01:27.200> base<00:01:27.500> as<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.890> Corvette<00:01:28.959> had<00:01:29.959> so<00:01:30.289> he

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
same size base as the Corvette had so he

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.820 
same size base as the Corvette had so he
looks<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.890> be<00:01:31.009> a<00:01:31.039> small<00:01:31.690> ship<00:01:32.690> and<00:01:33.110> I'm<00:01:33.619> pretty

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
looks to be a small ship and I'm pretty

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.020 
looks to be a small ship and I'm pretty
sure<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.160> they<00:01:34.280> said<00:01:34.520> in<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.729> rules<00:01:34.940> that

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
sure that they said in the rules that

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.850 
sure that they said in the rules that
he's<00:01:35.209> a<00:01:35.240> small<00:01:35.569> ship<00:01:35.840> in<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.080> base<00:01:36.259> seems<00:01:36.619> to

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
he's a small ship in the base seems to

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.279 
he's a small ship in the base seems to
corroborate<00:01:37.429> that<00:01:37.840> so<00:01:38.840> he<00:01:38.899> looks<00:01:39.080> to<00:01:39.170> be<00:01:39.259> a

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
corroborate that so he looks to be a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.440 
corroborate that so he looks to be a
small<00:01:39.590> ship<00:01:39.890> even<00:01:40.819> though<00:01:40.940> he<00:01:41.090> came<00:01:41.240> in<00:01:41.390> a

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
small ship even though he came in a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.020 
small ship even though he came in a
bigger<00:01:41.630> box<00:01:41.869> that's<00:01:42.319> because<00:01:42.530> his<00:01:43.030> physical

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
bigger box that's because his physical

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.339 
bigger box that's because his physical
ship<00:01:44.240> is<00:01:44.390> bigger<00:01:44.630> than<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.840> much<00:01:44.990> bigger<00:01:45.259> than

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:45.349 
ship is bigger than a much bigger than

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.940 
ship is bigger than a much bigger than
her<00:01:45.470> Corvette<00:01:46.190> but<00:01:46.970> he's<00:01:47.270> kind<00:01:47.780> of<00:01:47.869> small<00:01:48.200> but

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
her Corvette but he's kind of small but

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.469 
her Corvette but he's kind of small but
yeah<00:01:49.099> he<00:01:49.190> comes<00:01:49.399> with<00:01:49.580> all<00:01:49.849> the<00:01:49.970> same<00:01:50.179> stuff

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
yeah he comes with all the same stuff

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.400 
yeah he comes with all the same stuff
that<00:01:50.509> you<00:01:50.690> would<00:01:50.959> expect<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:52.220> he's<00:01:52.550> got

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.419 
that you would expect and he's got
although<00:01:56.259> instead<00:01:57.259> of<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.470> little<00:01:57.679> skinny

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
although instead of the little skinny

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.960 
although instead of the little skinny
pole<00:01:58.759> that<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.090> Corvette<00:01:59.450> has<00:01:59.660> he<00:02:00.130> has<00:02:01.130> one<00:02:01.849> of

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
pole that the Corvette has he has one of

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.330 
pole that the Corvette has he has one of
these<00:02:02.119> for<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:05.270> know<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.450> go<00:02:05.720> on<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:07.130> that's

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
these for you know to go on and that's

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.249 
these for you know to go on and that's
probably<00:02:07.670> due<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.479> size<00:02:08.750> of<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.020> ship

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
probably due to the size of the ship

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.640 
probably due to the size of the ship
itself<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:09.979> when<00:02:10.130> we<00:02:10.989> set<00:02:11.989> him<00:02:12.140> in<00:02:12.230> there<00:02:12.440> he's

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
itself so when we set him in there he's

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.390 
itself so when we set him in there he's
got<00:02:12.800> a<00:02:12.860> little<00:02:13.190> phallic<00:02:13.489> symbol

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
got a little phallic symbol

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.559 
got a little phallic symbol
stick<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.939> in<00:02:15.030> there<00:02:16.879> so<00:02:17.879> that's<00:02:18.000> not<00:02:18.209> gonna<00:02:18.390> no

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
stick it in there so that's not gonna no

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.949 
stick it in there so that's not gonna no
he'll<00:02:18.780> sit<00:02:19.049> on<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.879> alright<00:02:20.879> so<00:02:21.269> let<00:02:21.689> me<00:02:21.780> set

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
he'll sit on that alright so let me set

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.740 
he'll sit on that alright so let me set
him<00:02:22.110> down<00:02:22.140> right<00:02:22.470> there<00:02:22.680> for<00:02:22.950> now<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:24.540> let's

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
him down right there for now and let's

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.170 
him down right there for now and let's
start<00:02:24.959> looking<00:02:25.260> at<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.879> cardboard<00:02:26.879> and<00:02:27.060> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
start looking at the cardboard and the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.350 
start looking at the cardboard and the
plastics<00:02:28.189> and<00:02:29.189> all<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.670> good<00:02:29.849> stuff<00:02:29.909> all

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
plastics and all that good stuff all

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.080 
plastics and all that good stuff all
right<00:02:30.980> let's<00:02:31.980> see<00:02:32.400> what<00:02:32.579> new<00:02:32.909> goodies<00:02:33.480> we<00:02:34.290> have

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.599 

alright<00:02:39.090> first<00:02:39.629> let's<00:02:39.810> look<00:02:40.079> at<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.609> the

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
alright first let's look at the the

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.580 
alright first let's look at the the
point<00:02:41.879> costs<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:42.900> everything<00:02:43.049> else<00:02:43.379> for

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
point costs and everything else for

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.020 
point costs and everything else for
these<00:02:43.709> guys<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:43.980> they<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.430> whole<00:02:44.579> value<00:02:44.819> of

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
these guys so they have a whole value of

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.729 
these guys so they have a whole value of
five<00:02:45.269> we've<00:02:45.450> got<00:02:45.540> our<00:02:45.780> gladiator<00:02:46.260> won<00:02:46.560> and

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
five we've got our gladiator won and

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.720 
five we've got our gladiator won and
gladiator<00:02:47.129> -<00:02:48.709> now<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.829> difference<00:02:50.340> basically

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
gladiator - now the difference basically

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.030 
gladiator - now the difference basically
is<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.359> the<00:02:51.840> two<00:02:52.079> gets<00:02:52.379> a<00:02:52.470> red<00:02:52.680> dye<00:02:52.859> on<00:02:52.889> the

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
is that the two gets a red dye on the

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.979 
is that the two gets a red dye on the
sides<00:02:53.400> where<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> one<00:02:53.940> only<00:02:54.150> gets<00:02:54.389> black<00:02:54.750> dice

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
sides where the one only gets black dice

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.580 
sides where the one only gets black dice
on<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.319> sides<00:02:56.569> but<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.720> front<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.170> back<00:02:58.290> are

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
on the sides but the front and back are

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.550 
on the sides but the front and back are
the<00:02:58.769> same<00:02:59.099> they're<00:03:00.090> both<00:03:00.120> two<00:03:00.599> two<00:03:00.840> three<00:03:01.139> two

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
the same they're both two two three two

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.319 
the same they're both two two three two
two<00:03:01.590> three<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:02.159> two<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.639> better<00:03:02.790> for<00:03:03.030> anti

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
two three the two is better for anti

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.179 
two three the two is better for anti
squadron<00:03:03.900> he's<00:03:04.019> got<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.230> two<00:03:04.560> for<00:03:04.799> his<00:03:04.920> anti

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
squadron he's got a two for his anti

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.449 
squadron he's got a two for his anti
squadron<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.420> that's<00:03:06.659> their<00:03:07.349> movement<00:03:07.799> there

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
squadron so that's their movement there

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.660 
squadron so that's their movement there
are<00:03:08.579> two<00:03:08.879> one<00:03:09.359> one<00:03:09.599> and<00:03:09.870> nothing<00:03:10.620> one<00:03:10.799> one<00:03:11.040> so

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
are two one one and nothing one one so

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.729 
are two one one and nothing one one so
they<00:03:11.760> can<00:03:11.849> go<00:03:11.939> up<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.150> three<00:03:12.560> they<00:03:13.560> have<00:03:13.650> the

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
they can go up to three they have the

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.699 
they can go up to three they have the
same<00:03:13.980> upgrade<00:03:14.489> slot<00:03:15.060> capabilities<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.349> the

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
same upgrade slot capabilities and the

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.830 
same upgrade slot capabilities and the
point<00:03:16.950> costs<00:03:17.370> are<00:03:17.489> fifty<00:03:17.819> six<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.389> sixty<00:03:18.750> two

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
point costs are fifty six and sixty two

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.400 
point costs are fifty six and sixty two
respectively<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.569> two<00:03:21.750> is<00:03:21.930> much<00:03:22.199> better

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
respectively so the two is much better

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.339 
respectively so the two is much better
but<00:03:22.739> mostly<00:03:23.430> he's<00:03:24.030> much<00:03:24.239> better<00:03:24.480> for<00:03:24.840> his<00:03:25.019> anti

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
but mostly he's much better for his anti

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.199 
but mostly he's much better for his anti
squadron<00:03:25.859> value<00:03:26.160> one<00:03:26.340> thing<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:26.609> note<00:03:26.819> here<00:03:26.849> is

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
squadron value one thing to note here is

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.349 
squadron value one thing to note here is
that<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.629> first<00:03:27.840> ship<00:03:28.230> I've<00:03:28.440> seen<00:03:29.239> that<00:03:30.239> has

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
that the first ship I've seen that has

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.770 
that the first ship I've seen that has
all<00:03:30.569> three<00:03:30.989> different<00:03:31.319> actions<00:03:32.389> so<00:03:33.389> they

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
all three different actions so they

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.170 
all three different actions so they
could<00:03:34.230> potentially<00:03:34.919> brace<00:03:35.250> redirect<00:03:35.940> and

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
could potentially brace redirect and

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.069 
could potentially brace redirect and
evade<00:03:36.569> if<00:03:36.900> they<00:03:37.139> were<00:03:37.199> attacked<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:39.870> makes

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
evade if they were attacked and it makes

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.409 
evade if they were attacked and it makes
somebody<00:03:40.590> using<00:03:40.859> accuracy<00:03:41.489> against<00:03:41.970> them<00:03:42.150> a

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
somebody using accuracy against them a

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.210 
somebody using accuracy against them a
lot<00:03:42.780> more<00:03:42.810> significant<00:03:43.739> because<00:03:43.949> they<00:03:44.099> can

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
lot more significant because they can

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.879 
lot more significant because they can
really<00:03:44.430> choose<00:03:44.879> which<00:03:45.870> one<00:03:46.139> they<00:03:46.169> want<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.650> to

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
really choose which one they want you to

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.979 
really choose which one they want you to
not<00:03:47.729> be<00:03:47.849> able<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.090> use<00:03:48.299> so<00:03:48.599> that's<00:03:48.780> pretty

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
not be able to use so that's pretty

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.449 
not be able to use so that's pretty
interesting<00:03:49.609> alright<00:03:50.609> so<00:03:50.940> there's<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:52.459> now

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
interesting alright so there's that now

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.399 
interesting alright so there's that now
let's<00:03:54.329> look<00:03:54.449> at<00:03:54.540> our<00:03:54.659> cards<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.109> we've<00:03:55.229> got

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
let's look at our cards that we've got

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.059 
let's look at our cards that we've got
here<00:03:55.680> we've<00:03:56.549> got<00:03:56.790> Admiral<00:03:57.780> screed<00:03:58.409> he<00:03:58.680> costs

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
here we've got Admiral screed he costs

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.000 
here we've got Admiral screed he costs
twenty<00:03:59.579> six<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.239> once<00:04:00.449> per<00:04:00.690> activation<00:04:01.379> when

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
twenty six and once per activation when

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.250 
twenty six and once per activation when
a<00:04:02.040> friendly<00:04:02.400> ship<00:04:02.699> is<00:04:02.879> attacking<00:04:03.269> it<00:04:04.049> may

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
a friendly ship is attacking it may

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.339 
a friendly ship is attacking it may
spend<00:04:04.560> one<00:04:04.979> die<00:04:05.190> change<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.299> die<00:04:06.599> to<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:07.049> face

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
spend one die change a die to a face

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.399 
spend one die change a die to a face
with<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.620> crit<00:04:08.069> icon<00:04:08.549> so<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:09.569> can<00:04:09.629> spend<00:04:10.079> a<00:04:10.199> die

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
with a crit icon so you can spend a die

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.189 
with a crit icon so you can spend a die
to<00:04:10.709> make<00:04:10.859> sure<00:04:11.040> that<00:04:11.159> you<00:04:11.280> get<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.519> crit<00:04:12.199> which

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
to make sure that you get a crit which

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:14.990 
to make sure that you get a crit which
is<00:04:13.379> great<00:04:13.739> if<00:04:13.889> you<00:04:13.979> have<00:04:14.129> blank<00:04:14.489> dice<00:04:14.729> because

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
is great if you have blank dice because

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.390 
is great if you have blank dice because
you<00:04:15.150> can<00:04:15.269> spend<00:04:15.479> two<00:04:15.659> blank<00:04:15.900> dice<00:04:16.109> right<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:17.190> he

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
you can spend two blank dice right so he

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.149 
you can spend two blank dice right so he
seems<00:04:17.699> pretty<00:04:18.269> cool<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.810> good<00:04:19.079> way<00:04:19.199> to<00:04:19.260> you<00:04:20.039> know

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.159 
seems pretty cool a good way to you know

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.430 
seems pretty cool a good way to you know
confirm<00:04:20.609> it<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.209> is<00:04:21.329> a<00:04:21.359> face<00:04:21.659> with<00:04:22.079> a

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
confirm it and this is a face with a

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.219 
confirm it and this is a face with a
crit<00:04:23.219> icon<00:04:23.669> I<00:04:23.940> believe<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.510> black<00:04:24.719> dice<00:04:24.960> have

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
crit icon I believe the black dice have

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.330 
crit icon I believe the black dice have
one<00:04:25.440> that<00:04:25.560> has<00:04:25.590> a

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
one that has a

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.250 
one that has a
hit<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.639> a<00:04:26.760> crit<00:04:27.000> so<00:04:27.449> he<00:04:27.570> could<00:04:27.690> turn<00:04:27.810> a<00:04:27.870> blank

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
hit and a crit so he could turn a blank

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.680 
hit and a crit so he could turn a blank
he<00:04:29.220> can<00:04:29.370> spend<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.669> blank<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:30.150> change<00:04:30.389> like<00:04:30.600> if

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
he can spend a blank to change like if

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.939 
he can spend a blank to change like if
you<00:04:30.780> have<00:04:30.900> two<00:04:31.050> blanks<00:04:31.380> he<00:04:31.440> could<00:04:31.560> spend<00:04:31.740> one

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
you have two blanks he could spend one

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.950 
you have two blanks he could spend one
blank<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.430> turn<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.790> other<00:04:32.910> one<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.210> hit<00:04:33.780> and

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
blank to turn the other one to a hit and

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.420 
blank to turn the other one to a hit and
a<00:04:34.020> crit<00:04:34.260> you<00:04:34.530> know<00:04:34.620> that's<00:04:34.770> that's<00:04:35.220> pretty

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
a crit you know that's that's pretty

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.400 
a crit you know that's that's pretty
nice<00:04:35.699> and<00:04:35.910> it<00:04:36.060> costs<00:04:36.270> 26<00:04:36.750> points<00:04:37.080> though<00:04:37.229> so

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
nice and it costs 26 points though so

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.219 
nice and it costs 26 points though so
but<00:04:38.370> that's<00:04:38.550> very<00:04:38.639> cool

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
but that's very cool

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.010

in<00:04:56.340> this<00:04:56.580> way<00:04:56.760> treat<00:04:57.570> him<00:04:57.810> as<00:04:58.050> having<00:04:58.290> the

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
in this way treat him as having the

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.580 
in this way treat him as having the
printed<00:04:59.070> speed<00:04:59.490> of<00:04:59.729> 2<00:05:00.180> now<00:05:01.110> this<00:05:01.229> has<00:05:01.440> some

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
printed speed of 2 now this has some

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.810 
printed speed of 2 now this has some
synergy<00:05:02.040> with<00:05:02.250> some<00:05:02.400> of<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.580> stuff<00:05:02.790> that

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
synergy with some of the stuff that

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.469 
synergy with some of the stuff that
we've<00:05:03.090> seen<00:05:03.500> before<00:05:04.550> if<00:05:05.550> you<00:05:05.790> used<00:05:06.030> one<00:05:06.180> of<00:05:06.389> the

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
we've seen before if you used one of the

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.570 
we've seen before if you used one of the
titles<00:05:06.870> for<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.139> victory<00:05:07.919> class<00:05:08.160> you<00:05:08.400> can

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
titles for the victory class you can

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.550 
titles for the victory class you can
bump<00:05:08.940> that<00:05:09.030> up<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:09.479> a<00:05:09.510> three<00:05:09.930> because<00:05:10.440> it

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
bump that up to a three because it

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.460 
bump that up to a three because it
increases<00:05:10.950> the<00:05:11.220> printed<00:05:11.580> value<00:05:11.910> so<00:05:12.290> there<00:05:13.290> is

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
increases the printed value so there is

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.440 
increases the printed value so there is
there<00:05:13.919> are<00:05:13.950> ways<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.460> you<00:05:14.880> know<00:05:14.940> have<00:05:15.210> synergy

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
there are ways to you know have synergy

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.570 
there are ways to you know have synergy
with<00:05:15.780> this<00:05:15.960> but<00:05:16.260> that's<00:05:16.380> a<00:05:16.710> nice<00:05:16.950> way<00:05:17.250> to<00:05:17.310> like

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
with this but that's a nice way to like

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.520 
with this but that's a nice way to like
maybe<00:05:17.700> force<00:05:18.030> bombers<00:05:18.510> through<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:19.080> that's

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
maybe force bombers through and that's

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.409 
maybe force bombers through and that's
pretty<00:05:19.770> cool<00:05:19.979> this<00:05:20.100> was<00:05:20.340> this<00:05:20.970> was<00:05:21.150> one<00:05:21.300> that

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
pretty cool this was this was one that

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.360 
pretty cool this was this was one that
was<00:05:21.510> kind<00:05:21.870> of<00:05:22.020> spoiled<00:05:22.620> but<00:05:22.800> not<00:05:22.950> officially

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
was kind of spoiled but not officially

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.540 
was kind of spoiled but not officially
spoiled<00:05:23.850> so<00:05:24.030> it's<00:05:24.150> nice<00:05:24.300> to<00:05:24.479> actually<00:05:24.600> see<00:05:24.810> it

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
spoiled so it's nice to actually see it

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.180 
spoiled so it's nice to actually see it
in<00:05:26.550> print<00:05:27.199> weapons<00:05:28.199> liaison<00:05:28.680> we've<00:05:28.860> seen<00:05:29.070> that

dice to a face with in accuracy icon so

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.260 
dice to a face with in accuracy icon so
he's<00:05:42.570> kind<00:05:42.810> of<00:05:42.870> like<00:05:42.930> Creed<00:05:44.000> screed<00:05:45.000> rather

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
he's kind of like Creed screed rather

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.879 
he's kind of like Creed screed rather
but<00:05:45.419> you<00:05:45.479> have<00:05:45.570> to<00:05:45.660> exhaust<00:05:45.930> him<00:05:46.260> and<00:05:46.560> you're

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
but you have to exhaust him and you're

but you have to exhaust him and you're
spending<00:05:47.310> it<00:05:47.400> died<00:05:47.550> you<00:05:47.940> know<00:05:48.060> that's<00:05:48.210> good<00:05:48.330> if

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
spending it died you know that's good if
