date alright so i'm laying these powered
out<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.920> their<00:01:53.189> belly<00:01:53.340> we're<00:01:54.119> going<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.329> start

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
out on their belly we're going to start

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.700 
out on their belly we're going to start
in<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.689> back<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.259> make<00:01:55.320> an<00:01:55.530> initial

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
in the back here just make an initial

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.069 
in the back here just make an initial
cut<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.360> pretty<00:01:57.570> simple<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.990> just

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
cut and it's pretty simple you just

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.999 
cut and it's pretty simple you just
follow<00:01:58.500> along<00:01:59.090> the<00:02:00.090> spine<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.920> you're<00:02:01.920> going

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
follow along the spine and you're going

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.610 
follow along the spine and you're going
to<00:02:02.070> repeat<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:03.060> for<00:02:03.329> both<00:02:03.540> sides<00:02:03.780> so

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
to repeat this for both sides so

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.410 
to repeat this for both sides so
just<00:02:04.950> get<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.130> some<00:02:05.370> initial<00:02:05.970> cut<00:02:06.150> to<00:02:06.270> get

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
just get to some initial cut to get

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.120 
just get to some initial cut to get
through<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.720> skin<00:02:09.470> still<00:02:10.470> alive<00:02:10.710> seems<00:02:11.040> a

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
through the skin still alive seems a

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.770 
through the skin still alive seems a
little<00:02:11.280> bit<00:02:11.780> early<00:02:12.780> here<00:02:13.250> once<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> get<00:02:14.460> past

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
little bit early here once you get past

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.450 
little bit early here once you get past
this<00:02:15.780> chunky<00:02:16.200> portion<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.710> belly<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.310> can

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
this chunky portion of the belly you can

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.970 
this chunky portion of the belly you can
basically<00:02:17.610> stop<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.330> cut<00:02:18.770> because<00:02:19.770> we're

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
basically stop that cut because we're

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
basically stop that cut because we're
actually<00:02:20.130> going<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.460> take<00:02:20.580> out<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:20.820> whole

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
actually going to take out this whole

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.970 
actually going to take out this whole
tail<00:02:21.210> section<00:02:21.630> as<00:02:21.750> well<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.140> once<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:22.860> get

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
tail section as well so once you get

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.130 
tail section as well so once you get
that<00:02:23.070> established<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:23.820> lightly<00:02:24.570> run<00:02:25.020> the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
that established just lightly run the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.440 
that established just lightly run the
ninth<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.810> can<00:02:27.960> feel<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.650> hear<00:02:29.580> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
ninth and you can feel and hear the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.870 
ninth and you can feel and hear the
knife<00:02:30.600> tickler<00:02:31.080> line<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.470> ribs<00:02:31.680> there<00:02:31.920> and

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
knife tickler line the ribs there and

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.580 
knife tickler line the ribs there and
then<00:02:33.090> what<00:02:33.210> I<00:02:33.240> do<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:34.170> can<00:02:34.290> see<00:02:34.470> the

then what I do is you can see the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.160 
then what I do is you can see the
lateral<00:02:34.980> line<00:02:35.870> what<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.900> do<00:02:37.020> is<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.500> start<00:02:37.560> there

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
lateral line what I do is to start there

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.130 
lateral line what I do is to start there
I'll<00:02:40.170> make<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.380> puncture<00:02:40.680> at<00:02:40.950> all<00:02:41.900> try<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.960> make

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
I'll make a puncture at all try to make

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.950

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
skin on the tip there let's make sure

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.370 
skin on the tip there let's make sure
that's<00:02:49.020> nice<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.320> cut<00:02:50.390> just<00:02:51.390> keep<00:02:51.660> ticking

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380

that's nice and cut just keep ticking
along<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.800> ribcage<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:55.410> can<00:02:55.560> kind<00:02:55.770> of<00:02:55.800> peel

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
along the ribcage you can kind of peel

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.240 
along the ribcage you can kind of peel
out<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:56.640> can<00:02:56.670> see<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:56.970> ribs<00:02:57.270> in<00:02:57.420> there

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:08.680 

you're<00:03:00.760> left<00:03:00.970> with<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.120> big<00:03:01.720> chunk<00:03:02.050> of<00:03:02.170> extra

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.080

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
and once you get it down basically into

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.700 
and once you get it down basically into
that<00:03:11.240> lateral<00:03:11.570> line<00:03:11.870> before<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.350> start<00:03:12.620> to

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
that lateral line before you start to

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.740 
that lateral line before you start to
see<00:03:12.830> skin<00:03:13.160> again<00:03:13.430> on<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.670> outside<00:03:14.420> of<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.600> rib

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
see skin again on the outside of the rib

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.140 
see skin again on the outside of the rib
cage

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.390 

I<00:03:21.239> just<00:03:21.689> hold<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.049> up<00:03:22.200> as<00:03:22.470> best<00:03:22.530> i<00:03:22.920> kin<00:03:23.129> or

I just hold it up as best i kin or

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.039 
I just hold it up as best i kin or
slamming<00:03:24.120> so<00:03:24.269> it's<00:03:24.390> a<00:03:24.450> little<00:03:24.689> tough<00:03:25.019> to

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
slamming so it's a little tough to

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:33.410 
slamming so it's a little tough to
gripple
