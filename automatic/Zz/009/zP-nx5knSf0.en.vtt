 Do you see the cafeterias I did not know 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.030
 before that there is a growing figure the 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.330
 old bearer in right figure the man 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.250
 but can not ask why 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.379
 content clearly my work a mine 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.750
 away free and the all new my way 3 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.150
 The packaging still shows the aliens 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:16.230
 here after my look at the figure 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:20.800
 really very veiled 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.560
 we have to go back and also the blu rays 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.230
 according to book edition that also still 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.250
 times I've all ever 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.230

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.890
 Of course, battery also looks up here 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.460
 it unfortunately because is already actually so 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:43.350
 Unfortunately facade should be the subject 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.350
 aside from the supercup 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.570

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:58.180

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:02.330
 Drugs my way 3 and not black 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.000

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.259

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:28.150
 blu-ray 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:28.150
