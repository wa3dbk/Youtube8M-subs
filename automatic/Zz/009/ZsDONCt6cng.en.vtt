00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.650
 Right Elite Meteorological Well for a subsidiary of a_b_c_ in Louisiana and 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.469
 As I recently noticed that on their faces a book page out of one commentator would make 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.119
 A statement about her hair 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:17.470
 Now she's black and wah ... I felt the need to answer this commentator 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.050
 First we even read to you what the man wrote to her from here 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.330
 Uh ... a black lady that does news is a very nice lady and the only thing is she 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.550
 Needs to wear some waiver grows hair more I'm not sure if the cancer 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.350
 Patient but still it is not something myself think that looks good on t_v_ 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.070
 Well thank good for an informed opinion 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.490
 So wish your hair a bit of will 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.800
 Suppose lestat 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.100
 Well Anne is so careless about what to forget about her to make a part of him 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.640
 Ghetto of human life 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.040
 the war 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.070
 So why why why what do you try to get and the events for it's frustrating nights 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.590
 One for everyone who is on TV or does not show it they get it there is always like 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.170
 that 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.520
 The benefit of comments about your parents and things from this will know 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.679
 That we should focus on something else 

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:09.780
 But did not decide I want to answer politely 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.850
 Uh ... and got separated from him 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.580
 Mathematics however 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.829
 I want to read you guys in response because I thought it was thoughtful 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.990
 It was very nice and the patient was so much more patient then 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.549
 Uh ... What did you write in response to him 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:25.920
 I admit social 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.619
 And a black lady that is pointing 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.289
 I'm sorry I do not like my ethnic air and now I do not have cancer 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.179
 No smoking at 5 points three 121 pounds from twenty five miles 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.340
 The week run 37-point women for five years of age and I completely mean 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.450
 The material is a good health condition and I am very proud of my African American ancestors 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.719
 Which includes my hair 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.080
 We traditionally have your enlightenment here not growing down 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.100
 It goes upward 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.990
 Many black women use strong agents straightening in order to achieve 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.220
 Great more than European hair that 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.840
 Is their choice 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.119
 But in my case I do not find it necessary here how if you happen to her 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.110
 Son 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.250
 I find this outrageous and I hope they got rid of this 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.380
 A woman also caused obvious transfer problems with rationality with ideals 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.900
 Explanations 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.989
 So 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.779
 But there is no right and then the guy said again and then you really get it 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:17.259
 Feeling where he comes across 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.309
 He writes in this world has a certain level 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:25.510
 If you have come from a world that is poor you are going to dress in mice 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.989
 The Star Center for White is what the hair setting is now possible exactly that it is trying 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.719
 To say if you're on TV is not just that you have to look like European 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:35.730
 Maybe 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.070
 I will also be a very attractive look if you are unattractive 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.340
 TV or else I do not consider it attractive enough for you TV 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.780
 Not worth the job 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.310
 Right no goals for men and women but of course it's much tougher when it comes to it 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.220
 For females 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.870
 Uh ... shows up on tv on day so i suffer from sperm being analyzed every one you know 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.100
 Strand of hair 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.129
 On this separate meteorological interested 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.239
 Why 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.579
 As if that is not crazy enough because this is some random dude 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.749
 Obviously those who are ignorant are very right 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:12.549
 But what makes this worth the story is the fact that I decided to affiliate a_b_c_ 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:13.430
 Her shoot 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.760
 The reason they fired her is because they have a kind of pretense 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.359
 Work now they had a policy 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:20.809
 He said that to them basically 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:22.710
 How to respond to these types of comments 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.170
 In the past she replied to the comment on the face page of the book and they said ur 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.660
 Do not do it ... oh ok and send it to a company-wide email address saying if you see 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.560
 Please refer to the private person that we have chosen 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.719
 To respond to these comments for you 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.549
 She wanted to know she wanted to respond herself 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.290
 Now look like it's famous services at any moment and you did not get that note 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.160
 And doing so would be another phase of heaven instead of man 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.610
 Doing so well miles per hour, a great program helped himself 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.219
 But while the kids are black 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.729
 Of the decade comes by that you get the feeling that it is not just that 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:02.899
 In the meantime with us attractive is not limited to upset that the issue of racial insurance 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:06.249
 The program practices are open to everyone I hope not to look recently 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:07.220
 That they were 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.489
 Happens to be black at that particular Simon right 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.199
 That is part of it 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:16.349
 accommoda it's body it violated the provision of something face book 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:20.860
 Clinton everyone who listens to us, though causing trouble here today 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.770
 They do not like blacks how you sucked it 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.009
 That's what they do Yeah, I think you know maybe it's not 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.229
 The most humble of our staff that they have and I do not say it's bad 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.069
 Say something 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.330
 You probably know that it is not just an employee like everything that missus tells you 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.150
 She will bring 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.090
 The media may be on ways to make the show that maybe there is a second for you 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.509
 I know one and they just try to find reasons to get rid of her 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.379
 Because of this is why you get to get rid of her there 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:49.510
 Another thing that happens in the newsroom is that this sauce is incredibly weak 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.099
 Clicking the mouse is probably because they do not like it for other reasons there 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:57.270
 Use this excuse and have nothing to do with racism completely possible 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.360
 But if they did this very stupid because it seems you have to do 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.410
 With the right or the race 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.479
 It's a minus lab we do not want to eight hours after in understanding if it is 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.580
 He runs a few moments of racing 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.110
 We do not know why it is so you can give you all the options out there 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.320
 One of the ways they may be 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.489
 Acting that way is all he uses 

00:05:18.489 --> 00:05:21.240
 Reply to do not insist on it well 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.410
 We have to meet our audience 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.849
 If so they make those comments 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:26.620
 Yeah play I've been
