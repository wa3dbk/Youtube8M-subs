00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
over and over for about 20 years now and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.820 
over and over for about 20 years now and
the<00:02:53.010> economy<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:53.820> actually<00:02:54.420> failing<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.590> real

the economy is actually failing the real
growth<00:02:56.190> rate<00:02:56.520> of<00:02:56.550> our<00:02:56.910> economy<00:02:57.510> for<00:02:57.720> 13<00:02:58.140> years

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
growth rate of our economy for 13 years

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.050 
growth rate of our economy for 13 years
has<00:02:58.620> been<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.800> lowest<00:02:59.160> since<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.700> Civil<00:03:00.030> War

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
has been the lowest since the Civil War

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.870 
has been the lowest since the Civil War
the<00:03:00.900> median<00:03:01.530> income<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.190> average<00:03:02.280> family

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
the median income of the average family

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.630 
the median income of the average family
today<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:03.630> down<00:03:03.840> eight<00:03:04.170> percent<00:03:04.590> since<00:03:04.830> 2000

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
today is down eight percent since 2000

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.610 
today is down eight percent since 2000
so<00:03:06.030> what<00:03:06.270> we<00:03:06.390> have<00:03:06.630> is<00:03:06.660> massive<00:03:07.410> fiscal

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
so what we have is massive fiscal

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.250 
so what we have is massive fiscal
stimulus<00:03:08.010> what<00:03:08.790> we<00:03:08.940> have<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.480> Fed<00:03:09.990> that

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
stimulus what we have is a Fed that

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.680 
stimulus what we have is a Fed that
creates<00:03:10.650> serial<00:03:11.190> bubbles<00:03:11.640> all<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.540> this

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
creates serial bubbles all of this

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.720 
creates serial bubbles all of this
creates<00:03:13.230> kind<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.010> appearance<00:03:14.580> of

creates kind of the appearance of

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.780 
creates kind of the appearance of
prosperity<00:03:15.300> temporarily<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.440> then<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:17.610> day

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
prosperity temporarily and then the day

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.790 
prosperity temporarily and then the day
of<00:03:17.940> reckoning<00:03:18.330> comes<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.080> bubbles<00:03:19.440> break

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
of reckoning comes the bubbles break

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.370 
of reckoning comes the bubbles break
then<00:03:20.400> we<00:03:20.580> have<00:03:20.790> disaster<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.690> its<00:03:21.810> wake<00:03:22.080> and

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
then we have disaster and its wake and

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.140 
then we have disaster and its wake and
then<00:03:22.560> they<00:03:22.890> come<00:03:22.920> back<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.580> say<00:03:23.730> let's<00:03:23.970> do

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150
