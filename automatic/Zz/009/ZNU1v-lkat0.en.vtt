now if you have access around the inside

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.980 
now if you have access around the inside
of<00:05:13.669> the<00:05:13.970> toe<00:05:14.800> all<00:05:15.800> you<00:05:16.040> would<00:05:16.160> have<00:05:16.310> to<00:05:16.370> do<00:05:16.730> is

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
of the toe all you would have to do is

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.980 
of the toe all you would have to do is
after<00:05:17.990> having<00:05:18.169> a<00:05:18.590> really<00:05:19.010> firm<00:05:19.850> grip<00:05:20.180> on<00:05:20.450> your

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
after having a really firm grip on your

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.020 
after having a really firm grip on your
your<00:05:21.470> foot<00:05:21.710> you<00:05:21.950> would<00:05:22.100> take<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.430> sharp<00:05:22.700> end

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
your foot you would take the sharp end

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.060 
your foot you would take the sharp end
and<00:05:23.360> go<00:05:23.480> around<00:05:23.600> the<00:05:24.080> nail<00:05:24.260> and<00:05:24.560> just<00:05:24.830> cut<00:05:25.040> it

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
and go around the nail and just cut it

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.430 
and go around the nail and just cut it
off<00:05:25.280> it<00:05:25.970> actually<00:05:26.390> comes<00:05:26.630> right<00:05:26.840> off<00:05:26.870> you<00:05:27.260> just

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
off it actually comes right off you just

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.540 
off it actually comes right off you just
go<00:05:27.650> around<00:05:27.770> it<00:05:28.220> like<00:05:29.150> this<00:05:29.419> and<00:05:30.220> it<00:05:31.220> would<00:05:31.370> come

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
go around it like this and it would come

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:42.590 
go around it like this and it would come
off<00:05:31.730> so<00:05:32.360> now<00:05:32.600> I'm<00:05:32.930> going<00:05:33.200> to<00:05:33.260> do<00:05:33.380> the<00:05:33.500> next<00:05:33.740> one

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:06:30.839 

you

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:30.849 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.820 

what<00:06:31.389> you<00:06:31.479> can<00:06:31.629> also<00:06:31.779> do<00:06:32.050> is<00:06:32.229> just<00:06:32.409> use<00:06:32.619> these

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
what you can also do is just use these

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.609 
what you can also do is just use these
for<00:06:33.159> the<00:06:33.219> big<00:06:33.399> toes<00:06:33.639> but<00:06:33.959> this<00:06:34.959> is<00:06:35.259> the

00:06:35.609 --> 00:06:35.619 
for the big toes but this is the

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:42.139 
for the big toes but this is the
butterflies<00:06:36.899> and<00:06:37.949> this<00:06:38.949> is<00:06:39.309> the<00:06:39.729> kaleidoscope

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:42.149 
butterflies and this is the kaleidoscope

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:46.469 
butterflies and this is the kaleidoscope
