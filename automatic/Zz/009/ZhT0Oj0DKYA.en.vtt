00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.210
 hello everyone knows the pin up is 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.600
 plays mostly on scania trucks driving 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.890
 simulator so low for those who have 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.720
 not seen the other videos I did 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.930
 on this game I advise you to go 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.680
 see so well there today we 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.939
 let's see the free mode but not 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.470
 anywhere we will be in the center 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.350
 finally the bonus as we will say it 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:42.770
 is called the center finally this is the 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:44.210
 center of scania so down we go 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.590
 go to the green dot you see 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.460
 maybe on the little map at the bottom 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.870
 in an angle so low in this center 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.160
 that's fine we can do some 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.430
 brake test speed etc 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.430
 so here we go 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.210
 so I'm going to go to the green dot 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.239
 I have already done so I know this 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.170
 they were going to do it's simple 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.170
 you have to look for a trailer 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.280
 so in this test center there is no 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.070
 rolling vehicle than me and that we 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.270
 truck so there you can ride to 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.270
 any speed is allowed 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.540
 like that it also allows you to see the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.540
 truck speed 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.110
 so I'm very happy there are a lot 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.640
 of people watching my videos 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:39.330
 scania trucks is who and who looks 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.130
 to appreciate what I'm doing so I'm 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.260
 quite happy I have a lot of 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.510
 people who know right now 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.230
 so I 'm going to thank them 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.090
 thank you in any case I hope you 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.780
 even who watch the video you go 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.850
 subscribe 1 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:00.240
 it would be very nice so 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.120
 So here is a big thank you new 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.700
 subscribers who have arrived and if he looks 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.140
 this video there I advise them not to 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.090
 do not forget to go see the news 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.630
 videos that six that are put pretty much 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.180
 every weekend because you 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.440
 excuse me 1 but I was on vacation 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.270
 and while I was on vacation I 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.160
 do not have internet and what makes it 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.910
 are a lot of people who have 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.560
 unsubscribed so I find it silly 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.610
 just because I was on vacation and 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.090
 I could not put any more videos during 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.430
 two weeks finally short so down there 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.250
 in the test center I'm going to you 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.050
 show several different views 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.370
 so when we have the cockpit view 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.500
 finally if you want or if you prefer 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.500
 the view is that inside 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.540
 so here I am 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.950
 so here it is the view on the roof 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.220
 she is nice also as a goal 1 it's 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.220
 not often 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.960
 so even if there are no limitations of 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.300
 speed we will still brake before 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.380
 every turn me it's weird I 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.380
 I'm not used to playing like that 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.220
 but it allows you to see the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.220
 different views 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.519
 so I tell you again even if Thursday 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.379
 in all the videos of scania trucks 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.959
 I really think this game is excellent 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.340
 and very well done very well detailed 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.340
 graphically very well too 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:41.099
 excuse me I'm really sick I 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:43.019
 cough so low except that's it I have 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.670
 nothing to tell you about the game at 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.829
 part repeated all the time what I'm saying 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.299
 in the other videos 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.870
 so apart from saab there is also going to 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:54.659
 also talk about my channel so thought about 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.159
 go see my bitch went to see the 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:04:02.699
 videos that I like that I put on this 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:04.709
 chain so ben here is where I am 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.180
 past or knew but by designing the 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.739
 truck you can put the regulator 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.049
 for those who do not know the 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.769
 regulator it's for example I'm at 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.699
 89 km time and ben block me at 89 km 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.829
 hour without having to press 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:18.790
 the accelerator what might not be 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.600
 wrong 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.600
 here 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.300
 so here I purposely take the 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.300
 longest paths 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.350
 so while we're there we think about 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.330
 put green thumbs for this video 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.490
 and for other videos as I have 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.070
 on my scania trek channel there are some 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.600
 a lot that has slowed down a bit 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.310
 we have a lot that does not put thumbs 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.740
 green but that make that simply 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.740
 watch so here is 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.900
 so if you want more videos from 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.570
 scania trucks simulator asked for them 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.560
 month I'll do more than that 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.210
 you want to ask if you want 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.210
 ask page not where I can not guess 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.069
 so here we go back to the center 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.530
 in fact it was a test track in 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.530
 do where we are 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.289
 so I say it all the time I know I 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:19.539
 maybe I 'm repeated in 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.999
 all my videos the mirrors in 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.009
 this game are very important so the 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:28.559
 bomba I do not have a game not bother me 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:28.559
 it's a center finally two mules turn there 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.220
 we will try to lose the trailer 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.220
 turning back 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:59.290
 so I made videos of all 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:01.540
 modes of this game there so if you like 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.200
 not this mode there to watch them videos 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.530
 other modes 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.230
 I did free mode in town I 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.910
 made 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.230
 I did I did I did the 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.660
 driver competitions finally brief 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:18.580
 I did a lot of stuff it's up to you 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.610
 to go watch it's all think about 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:25.240

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:40.700
 oula julia a little luck i was close 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:44.750
 and to this day I'm 20 subscribers and and 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:47.750
 if I remember correctly it's no 3700 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:50.780
 view so if you want to bring up these 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.500
 numbers it is you who choose you 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.500
 know what's left to do 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.730
 here we end up guaranteeing the trailer 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.090
 but of course there I am not at all 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.090
 properly 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.729
 so if you know minecraft and that 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.710
 do you like minecraft videos? 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:24.540

 this interests you 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.800
 so here I can let go of the trailer 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.910
 so here we go 

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.480
