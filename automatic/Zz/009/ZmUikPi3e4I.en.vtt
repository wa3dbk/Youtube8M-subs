00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.810 

when<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.619> bought<00:01:13.799> into<00:01:13.950> CrossFit<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.520> bought

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
when I bought into CrossFit I bought

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.660 
when I bought into CrossFit I bought
into<00:01:14.969> the<00:01:15.149> paleo<00:01:15.450> scene<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:17.070> tried<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.579> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
into the paleo scene and I tried it and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.359 
into the paleo scene and I tried it and
I<00:01:17.729> fell<00:01:17.939> healthy<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.899> little<00:01:19.020> while<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:20.070> I

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
I fell healthy for a little while but I

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.760 
I fell healthy for a little while but I
noticed<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.390> lot<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.810> times<00:01:22.110> when<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.560> was

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
noticed that a lot of times when I was

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.469 
noticed that a lot of times when I was
training<00:01:22.950> extra<00:01:23.520> hard<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.149> didn't<00:01:24.390> have

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
training extra hard I just didn't have

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.020 
training extra hard I just didn't have
the<00:01:24.509> energy<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.929> continue<00:01:25.679> to<00:01:26.009> workouts<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.670> I

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the energy to continue to workouts and I

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.460 
the energy to continue to workouts and I
was<00:01:27.179> actually<00:01:27.299> regressing<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.049> weights<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.350> I

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
was actually regressing on weights and I

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.160 
was actually regressing on weights and I
was<00:01:28.560> getting<00:01:28.710> overtrained<00:01:29.960> something<00:01:30.960> didn't

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
was getting overtrained something didn't

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.300 
was getting overtrained something didn't
feel<00:01:31.200> right<00:01:31.319> and<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.890> didn't<00:01:32.100> feel<00:01:32.189> right

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
feel right and it didn't feel right

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.429 
feel right and it didn't feel right
because<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.759> I've<00:01:33.090> been<00:01:33.299> taught<00:01:33.539> to<00:01:33.810> fuel

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
because I I've been taught to fuel

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.260 
because I I've been taught to fuel
