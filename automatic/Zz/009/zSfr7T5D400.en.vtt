00:00:01.499 --> 00:00:03.690
 hello to carestream health 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.389
 I hope it runs on what we can motivate in another study 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:09.919
 from our language 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.939
 here in this topic was announced and dissertation 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.789
 Let's understand how this works. 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.189
 first we have a question that does not want to shut up 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.279
 what is right 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.339
 deserting is discussing about it 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.179
 latakia clear answer to you 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.489
 the keyword that the cases 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.390
 students to discuss 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.770
 I go between using such kuti on something 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.780
 it is evident that in this discussion 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.110
 we always put an opinion 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.620
 but wait a bit is not any civil opinion 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.290
 be careful about it 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.370
 this discussion has the opinion of an observation 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.520
 of termination 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.670
 if I discuss 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.710
 we put our opinion based on no observation and reflection on a 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.930
 subject matter 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.210
 so we created a 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.440
 point of view on the subject 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.770
 and complained 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.410
 this kind of discussion 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.520
 he denied half of arguments 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.720
 everything is greater on income and consumption or better as the name says numbers 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.310
 with five 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.930
 sedation is therefore the discussion on a 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.080
 by numbers 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.680
 you never die 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.680
 how are we now with a practical example? 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.460
 let's see above 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.630
 here we have a text 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.930
 enke 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.370
 late excessive risks 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.210
 what are you going to say as he says he will not play why this transport 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.020
 has characteristics of a mysterious 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.690
 ok let's get started 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.120
 to interpret is an art that is built with a train of patience 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.370
 the ultimate goal of this performance and achieve what interests us 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.090
 the sensitivity of cultivation 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.499
 This can happen on the basis of good reading, careful reading 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:15.390
 with the knowledge of the context of a world in which the user 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.449
 to corrupt our understanding with Congress one day 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.869
 the monthly ossada 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:26.359
 you can imagine why this three or here 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:30.359
 he has characteristics of these assets 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.919
 flight tests 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.129
 if this occurs 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.719
 he discusses the subject 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.310
 We'll have to find 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.200
 the subject tÃ©vez can not leave me gave pity as sakineh ashtiani below 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:50.429
 I will avoid action 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.089
 we have found the characteristics of these assets 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.919
 good first 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.919
 he talks about it 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:59.489
 what I am 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.789
 interpretation 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:01.709
 he 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.989
 I trained with the fact of interpreting active as the context 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:08.699
 property for sale 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:13.709
 then he says that practice interpreting can interpret us by reaching 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.449
 accessibility of the patativa 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:19.449
 that varies is 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.349
 they are very stimulating 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.459
 given that the intention of the person passing the message 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:34.759
 then these three factors here would be the possible arguments to reinforce 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.489
 the subject 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.219
 the point of view that is 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.649
 which was much less a month 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:46.369
 the ultimate goal of performance achieved is what most interests the 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:48.279
 tentative accessibility 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:53.179
 with three shots and other interpretative possibilities achieved 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:56.179
 by means of three phases being a literature 

00:03:56.679 --> 00:04:01.299
 and this is justified by the ticket recognition context that the intention 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.669
 therefore expensive the student we have here 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.109
 the general subject 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.709
 we have a point of view in the initial industries we have the 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.519
 arguments that support 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.189
 this point of view is based in the south 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:20.840
 this here so it's a dissertation he discusses about it 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.840
 Whoever is not the author interprets 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.479
 any text that I can discuss about it 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:30.479
 this text 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:31.800
 it's a dissertation text
