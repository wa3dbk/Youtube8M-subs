00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.960 
you can just source to get it into
between<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> plate<00:01:51.799> this<00:01:52.799> always<00:01:53.430> faces

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
between the plate this always faces

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.530 
between the plate this always faces
towards<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.930> face<00:01:55.170> which<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.680> cold<00:01:56.340> plate

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
towards the face which is a cold plate

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.360 
towards the face which is a cold plate
but<00:01:57.690> you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.900> see<00:01:58.110> how<00:01:58.320> quick<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.190> it

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
but you can see how quick it is to do it

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.850 
but you can see how quick it is to do it
yeah<00:01:59.520> it's<00:01:59.820> really<00:02:00.000> quick<00:02:00.300> and<00:02:01.290> if<00:02:01.470> you<00:02:01.560> start

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
yeah it's really quick and if you start

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.970 
yeah it's really quick and if you start
a<00:02:01.950> little<00:02:02.040> bit<00:02:02.250> lower<00:02:02.460> about<00:02:03.240> there<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:04.830> can

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
a little bit lower about there you can

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.180 
a little bit lower about there you can
release<00:02:05.960> know<00:02:06.960> what<00:02:07.080> you<00:02:07.170> want<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.380> do<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.830> find

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
release know what you want to do is find

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.120 
release know what you want to do is find
that<00:02:08.310> last<00:02:08.670> one<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.780> go<00:02:10.260> down<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.530> top<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.920> it

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
that last one and go down on top of it

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.300 
that last one and go down on top of it
again<00:02:11.370> that's<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.790> exactly

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
again that's it exactly

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.490 
again that's it exactly
well<00:02:14.310> it's<00:02:14.460> fantastic<00:02:15.080> really<00:02:16.080> different

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
well it's fantastic really different

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
do is we're gonna work at the back

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.820 
do is we're gonna work at the back
section<00:02:20.490> now<00:02:22.130> keep<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:23.460> without<00:02:24.060> tension

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
section now keep this without tension

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.040 
section now keep this without tension
don't<00:02:25.830> pull<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.430> as<00:02:27.270> you're<00:02:27.540> working<00:02:27.900> your<00:02:28.020> way

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
don't pull it as you're working your way

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.140 
don't pull it as you're working your way
down<00:02:28.380> because<00:02:29.160> what<00:02:29.520> happens<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.000> you're

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
down because what happens is you're

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:39.290 
down because what happens is you're
going<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.360> lose<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:31.140> definition<00:02:38.180> we're<00:02:39.180> gonna

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
going to lose the definition we're gonna

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.750 
going to lose the definition we're gonna
do<00:02:39.510> gonna<00:02:39.810> do<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.110> other<00:02:40.140> side<00:02:40.500> now<00:02:40.670> so<00:02:41.670> again

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
do gonna do the other side now so again

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.630 
do gonna do the other side now so again
we're<00:02:42.060> gonna<00:02:42.150> go<00:02:42.360> for<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.720> three<00:02:43.050> sections<00:02:43.650> up

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
we're gonna go for the three sections up

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.700 
we're gonna go for the three sections up
towards<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.240> top<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.810> probably<00:02:46.440> four

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
towards the top and probably four

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.130 
towards the top and probably four
sections<00:02:47.280> at<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.520> back<00:02:47.760> it's<00:02:48.660> really<00:02:48.930> easy<00:02:49.050> I

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
sections at the back it's really easy I

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.050 
sections at the back it's really easy I
thought<00:02:49.440> it'd<00:02:49.560> be<00:02:49.680> hard<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.040> find<00:02:50.160> where<00:02:50.940> you

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
thought it'd be hard to find where you

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.720 
thought it'd be hard to find where you
need<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.420> put<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:51.690> next<00:02:51.870> but<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.620> just<00:02:53.220> find<00:02:53.520> it

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
need to put it next but you just find it

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.840 
need to put it next but you just find it
naturally<00:02:54.270> yeah<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:56.160> know<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:56.370> can<00:02:56.520> see<00:02:56.700> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
naturally yeah you know you can see the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.420 
naturally yeah you know you can see the
last<00:02:57.120> wave<00:02:57.510> that's<00:02:57.840> there<00:02:58.050> I<00:02:58.350> want<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.100> try<00:02:59.310> and

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
last wave that's there I want to try and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.670 
last wave that's there I want to try and
do<00:02:59.490> is<00:02:59.610> get<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.820> similar<00:03:00.420> level<00:03:00.690> but<00:03:01.110> just<00:03:01.350> come

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
do is get a similar level but just come

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.830 
do is get a similar level but just come
up<00:03:01.800> slightly<00:03:02.160> instead<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.270> holding<00:03:03.720> it

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
up slightly instead of you holding it

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.570 
up slightly instead of you holding it
for<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.110> long<00:03:04.290> period<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.800> time<00:03:04.860> there<00:03:05.370> just

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
for a long period of time there just

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.670 
for a long period of time there just
want<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.150> hold<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.780> little<00:03:07.050> less<00:03:07.350> time

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
want you to hold it a little less time

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.300 
want you to hold it a little less time
so<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.820> gently<00:03:09.600> goes<00:03:09.959> into<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:11.130> wave

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
so it gently goes into the wave

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.479 
so it gently goes into the wave
formation<00:03:11.730> greatly<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.660> can<00:03:12.840> see<00:03:13.050> it's<00:03:13.260> just

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
formation greatly you can see it's just

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.970 
formation greatly you can see it's just
slowly<00:03:14.630> going<00:03:15.630> into<00:03:15.989> there<00:03:16.200> yeah<00:03:16.650> it's<00:03:16.860> not

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
slowly going into there yeah it's not

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.759 
slowly going into there yeah it's not
too<00:03:17.190> over-the-top<00:03:17.489> that's<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.360> that's<00:03:18.540> fine

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
too over-the-top that's it that's fine

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.470 
too over-the-top that's it that's fine
now<00:03:19.769> obviously<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.310> can<00:03:20.340> leave<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.300> like<00:03:21.450> that

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
now obviously you can leave it like that

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.140 
now obviously you can leave it like that
if<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.560> want<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:23.070> don't<00:03:23.190> have<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.820> you've

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
if you want you don't have to and you've

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.960 
if you want you don't have to and you've
got<00:03:24.300> really<00:03:24.870> very<00:03:25.650> basic<00:03:26.190> care<00:03:26.459> so<00:03:26.760> what<00:03:26.850> I'm

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
got really very basic care so what I'm

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.060 
got really very basic care so what I'm
gonna<00:03:27.090> do<00:03:27.390> is<00:03:28.080> I'm<00:03:28.230> gonna<00:03:28.350> brush<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.709> through<00:03:28.890> a

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
gonna do is I'm gonna brush it through a

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.910 
gonna do is I'm gonna brush it through a
little<00:03:29.220> bit<00:03:29.550> and<00:03:30.330> I'm<00:03:30.450> gonna<00:03:30.570> start<00:03:30.959> at<00:03:31.380> a

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
little bit and I'm gonna start at a

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.190 
little bit and I'm gonna start at a
little<00:03:32.519> bit<00:03:32.640> of<00:03:32.730> serum<00:03:33.239> into<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.840> hair<00:03:33.989> as

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
little bit of serum into the hair as

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.670 
little bit of serum into the hair as
well<00:03:34.440> then<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.340> best<00:03:35.459> way<00:03:35.670> of<00:03:35.700> doing<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.150> is

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
well then the best way of doing it is

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.430 
well then the best way of doing it is
release<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:38.580> hair<00:03:38.820> by<00:03:39.420> putting<00:03:40.050> your<00:03:40.140> hair<00:03:40.290> to

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
release the hair by putting your hair to

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.400 
release the hair by putting your hair to
the<00:03:40.530> side<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:41.790> start<00:03:42.090> shaking<00:03:43.050> it<00:03:43.140> a<00:03:43.200> little

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
the side and start shaking it a little

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.580 
the side and start shaking it a little
bit<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:45.090> serum<00:03:45.630> what<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.019> does<00:03:46.200> is<00:03:46.440> it

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
bit and the serum what it does is it

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.500 
bit and the serum what it does is it
just<00:03:46.800> breaks<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.519> up<00:03:47.640> it's<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.120> little<00:03:48.360> bit<00:03:48.450> of

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
just breaks it up it's a little bit of

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.790 
just breaks it up it's a little bit of
oil<00:03:48.630> through<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.170> hair

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
oil through the hair

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
the tension so much and this is what

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.890 
the tension so much and this is what
