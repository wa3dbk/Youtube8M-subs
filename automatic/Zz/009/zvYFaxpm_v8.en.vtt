multiple contexts but no matter what I
thought<00:00:27.990> of

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
thought of

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.200 
thought of
I<00:00:28.380> couldn't<00:00:29.220> justify<00:00:29.550> why<00:00:29.850> this<00:00:29.910> was

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
first episode in season four that I did

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.730 
first episode in season four that I did
not<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.570> ton<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.870> great<00:00:37.110> ideas<00:00:37.170> had<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:37.740 
not like and a ton of great ideas had a

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.830 
not like and a ton of great ideas had a
ton<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.100> great<00:00:38.400> setups<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.090> even<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
ton of great setups and even the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.780 
ton of great setups and even the
potential<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.739> my<00:00:40.890> favorite<00:00:41.250> episode<00:00:41.610> ever

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
potential to be my favorite episode ever

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.069 
potential to be my favorite episode ever
but<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.420> feel<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.840> blew<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:44.239> let<00:00:45.239> me<00:00:45.329> explain

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
but I feel it blew it let me explain

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.900 
but I feel it blew it let me explain

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
so this starts out with Apple Bloom

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.430 
so this starts out with Apple Bloom
being<00:00:48.149> given<00:00:48.390> responsibility<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.290> looking
