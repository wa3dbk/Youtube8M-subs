00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
headband for this look let's begin first

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.630 
headband for this look let's begin first

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
knots grab a chunk of hair at the front

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.599 
knots grab a chunk of hair at the front
and<00:00:21.570> divide<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.869> into<00:00:22.080> three<00:00:22.500> strands<00:00:23.100> but<00:00:23.340> for

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
and divide it into three strands but for

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.710 
and divide it into three strands but for
this<00:00:23.760> blood<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.180> want<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.420> make<00:00:24.510> sure<00:00:24.570> that

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
this blood you want to make sure that

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.630 
this blood you want to make sure that
the<00:00:24.960> strands<00:00:25.320> are<00:00:25.410> uneven<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.160> make<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> two

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
the strands are uneven so make the two

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.730 
the strands are uneven so make the two
bottom<00:00:26.849> strand<00:00:27.269> smaller<00:00:27.840> than<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> top<00:00:28.410> as

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
bottom strand smaller than the top as

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.769 
bottom strand smaller than the top as
you<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.609> see<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.000> top<00:00:30.179> strand<00:00:30.570> is

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
you can see the top strand is

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.420 
you can see the top strand is
significantly<00:00:31.470> bigger<00:00:31.710> than<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> other<00:00:32.160> two

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
significantly bigger than the other two

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.700 
significantly bigger than the other two
and<00:00:32.969> from<00:00:33.660> here<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.870> basically<00:00:34.320> want<00:00:34.590> to

braid even though it's a regular three
strand<00:00:42.210> braid<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.899> too<00:00:43.079> uneven<00:00:43.350> strands<00:00:43.920> make

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
strand braid the too uneven strands make

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.639

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
a higher heat setting i highly recommend

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.219 
a higher heat setting i highly recommend
