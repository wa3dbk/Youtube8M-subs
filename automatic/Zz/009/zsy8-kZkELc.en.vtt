00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.069
 ah 

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:06.069
 how 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.930
 ah 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.560
 ah 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.120
 or the people I believe but also 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.550
 known as the one who arrived late to the 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.380
 last dinner and I'm here in this kind 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.630
 of chunga thing that is happening the same 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.300
 what is this because it changes the biomes like this 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.039
 suddenly because it 's so basic 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.110
 but surely that maybe 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.910
 many of you do not know so I 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.100
 I stop in this biome that is the initial 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.500
 guys to show you what everything is 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.879
 this is good in principle what happens here 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.520
 it's aesthetic that as I go 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.280
 walking because change of biome is worth and 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.290
 you will say ok and what does science have that 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.399
 Well, it has a little science 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.860
 interesting that has to do with the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.649
 basically with the coordinates and 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.410
 with the let's call it basically 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.149
 much more specific coordinates and 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.130
 more effective we're going to talk about 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.989
 decimals can be put up three 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.820
 decimals but good here we're just going to 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.020
 see a decimal is worth it because it is the most 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.090
 simple then what I have done here 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.950
 is to place several biomes a few in 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.110
 nothing else in the stall there a stain 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.440
 for now, what I have done is a 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.960
 text for vale and then a pp to another place 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.210
 I think here if I 'm not wrong 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.330
 this is the block that detects and when 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.670
 crossed you see this happens to me and here then 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.920
 also just when I'm on ipad 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.200
 good happens to me these and I say it happens to me 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.150
 next I keep going to the next one and 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.009
 so on 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.240
 good achilles good since nothing now I'm going 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.520
 to teach how these work 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.280
 specific coordinates is valid and it's very 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.619
 useful for any little thing even for 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.009
 servers is also very good 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.170
 let's stop this once and for all 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.850
 there is good because the coordinates 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.890
 specific only it is simply 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.160
 a decimal is worth so let's take this 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.560
 and we copy this and we're going to paste it here 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.660
 there's a good thing we're in these 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.980
 coordinates now you're standing is like 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.060
 see me 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.680
 what's happening, you see here the 0 and the 0 this 77.0 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.600
 yes right now I leave it as normal 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.480
 put the coordinates and as you see the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.770
 little jump that he is doing is so 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.320
 small saltillo, well, that's 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.580
 due to the coordinates to the forgiveness to 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.010
 the decimals then we put here a 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.750
 own one as it still continues to be 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.840
 a saltillo I do not know if you notice it you see 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.080
 the saltillo that if I put here a 2 we go 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.050
 put there higher you see if I put a 3 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.150
 there are more jumps with a 4 there will be higher or 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.550
 the first 8 directly you see there's a lot 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.320
 higher until you get to 9 that fliers 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.660
 it's like it's a block directly 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.730
 so then what happens with the zero 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.100
 it is directly the coordinate as is 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.650
 you see there are hardly any changes true there is no 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.990
 hardly any change then this is cool 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.130
 because if you are walking, as I have 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.470
 done before the video that looks like a 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.780
 video clip and me walking in typical plan 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.350
 video clip of the 80 plan have free or 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.840
 something like that and nothing then I have done it 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.970
 Well, as this example is worth 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.319
 well I have done here this believe it of 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.300
 test because already explained in a video 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.819
 how this theme is done and such but good 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.709
 you can not do this way it's worth 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.019
 can do nothing this way of 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.540
 done let's put it again to see is 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.670
 very complicated because it covers three 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.739
 decimals is crazy because you can 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.530
 do very good english stuff with that for 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.519
 that is very real, then you will not see it 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.890
 later I am working a 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.569
 little thing out there and well then I hope that 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.250
 this has served you to those who did not know 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.950
 of these specific coordinates is worth 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.239
 but as you can see if I go to the top 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.049
 forward then you can not tell the difference 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.160
 See, I think I'm super happy 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.870
 I'm happy that there are hardly any changes 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.299
 the fists you see it looks like it's real and everything 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.430
 there you are and mind if I go like that maybe maybe 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.349
 note a little you see but good does not happen 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.730
 nothing does not happen because this is all 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.980
 guys, I hope you liked this one 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.629
 small tutorial and see you in the 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.489
 next video of whatever is not 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.599
 forget to go to the movies because it 's very 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.989
 important to do these little things 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.989
 ok and a greeting that you gripper 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.490
 since I'm going to make a killer song 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.890
 he was walking through a wood he was told 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.890
 he left and I walk his whole life 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.480
 hit like because nothing
