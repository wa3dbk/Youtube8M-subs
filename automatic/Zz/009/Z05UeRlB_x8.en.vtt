00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.180
 but I am the boss of swarovski 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.910
 optics in austria we are here 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.980
 the photokina around our new telescopes 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.430
 and to introduce atx and stx telescopes 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.350
 first models fall telescope where to find the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.140
 can exchange objective 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.720
 Of course we also have the scoping 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.309
 Adapter is the world's first camera 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.250
 objective specifically for this coaching 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.530
 has been developed that one puts 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.420
 just get on through it 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.059
 taking photos 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.089
 it's actually very much for aps and micro 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.210
 four thirds sensor have been developed and 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:53.280
 has been developed from a system and 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.659
 that means high-quality the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:03.019
 scoping focal length is approximately 9 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:07.710
 finds to 2100 mm with this 95er 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:10.470
 objectively and that would be 900 x 10.5 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:16.410
 for this aps-c-sensor when you go to 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:20.390
 example that substitutes for 85 then 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:23.810
 one would refuse further from 750 to 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:28.130
 about 1800 millimeters 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.860
 Of course it is a system where you can 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.070
 manual focus must speak if 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.320
 previously caring horny or eagle 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.390
 or prefer something then you have to 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.580
 also look and imagine 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.259
 taking photos 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.149
 if you like a stable motive 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.679
 example of the puffin then could 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:57.950
 you turn on live purely look like the 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:01.610
 humming guitars and then exactly sharp 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:07.759
 have height of our eye catching 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:10.940
 want what we have done is one 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:15.110
 system designed specifically for flexibility 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.760
 be careful is watch through and watch 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.760
 take a picture
