00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.450 
cheap basic phone
but<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> touchscreen<00:02:16.320> smartphone<00:02:17.040> so

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
but it is a touchscreen smartphone so

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.380 
but it is a touchscreen smartphone so
it's<00:02:17.610> not<00:02:17.790> bad<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.640> kind<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.090> smaller

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
it's not bad it is kind of a smaller

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.410 
it's not bad it is kind of a smaller
phone<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:21.990> it's<00:02:22.140> kind<00:02:22.740> of<00:02:22.860> like<00:02:23.130> it's<00:02:24.030> kind<00:02:24.180> of

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
phone so it's kind of like it's kind of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.090 
phone so it's kind of like it's kind of
hard<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.720> hold<00:02:24.960> it<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.230> guess<00:02:25.440> because<00:02:25.680> we're<00:02:25.920> so

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
hard to hold it I guess because we're so

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.800 
hard to hold it I guess because we're so
used<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.520> holding<00:02:26.820> kind<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.150> bigger<00:02:27.330> phone<00:02:27.600> so

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
used to holding kind of bigger phone so

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.300 
used to holding kind of bigger phone so
that's<00:02:27.990> why<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.170> keep<00:02:28.380> kind<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.770> dropping<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.190> as

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
that's why I keep kind of dropping it as

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.670 
that's why I keep kind of dropping it as
you<00:02:29.460> can<00:02:29.610> see<00:02:29.790> throughout<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.300> video<00:02:30.680> alright

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
you can see throughout the video alright

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.340 
you can see throughout the video alright
so<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.850> finally<00:02:33.120> says<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.630> there<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:33.900> no<00:02:34.080> sim

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
so it finally says that there is no sim

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.020 
so it finally says that there is no sim
inside<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.890> phone<00:02:35.070> so<00:02:35.460> let's<00:02:35.760> go<00:02:35.880> ahead<00:02:35.910> and
