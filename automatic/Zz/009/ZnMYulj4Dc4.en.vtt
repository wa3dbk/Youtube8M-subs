you<00:01:27.869> know<00:01:28.020> drinking<00:01:28.710> water<00:01:29.100> was<00:01:29.280> not<00:01:29.549> going<00:01:29.729> to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
you know drinking water was not going to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.920 
you know drinking water was not going to
be<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> problem<00:01:30.180> for<00:01:30.270> me<00:01:30.420> because<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.689> drink

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
be a problem for me because I drink

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.630 
be a problem for me because I drink
about<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.320> leader<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.680> two<00:01:31.979> liters<00:01:32.130> every<00:01:32.430> day

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
about a leader to two liters every day

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.969 
about a leader to two liters every day
anyway<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.420> was<00:01:33.780> drinking<00:01:34.140> enough<00:01:34.350> water<00:01:34.409> I

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
anyway so I was drinking enough water I

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.340 
anyway so I was drinking enough water I
think<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.970> Hairfinity<00:01:36.479> formula<00:01:37.200> is

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
think that the Hairfinity formula is

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.880 
think that the Hairfinity formula is
just<00:01:37.590> way<00:01:37.860> too<00:01:37.970> potent<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.570> me<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.470> some

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
just way too potent for me so some

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.080 
just way too potent for me so some
people<00:01:41.159> said<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.400> they<00:01:41.460> didn't<00:01:41.729> break<00:01:41.909> out

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
people said that they didn't break out

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.460 
people said that they didn't break out
but<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> lot<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.540> people<00:01:42.659> said<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.079> they<00:01:43.140> did

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
but a lot of people said that they did

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.100 
but a lot of people said that they did
so<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.710> want<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.100> try<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.340> myself<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.329> did<00:01:45.899> it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
so I want to try it myself and it did it

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.420 
so I want to try it myself and it did it
definitely<00:01:46.439> did<00:01:46.560> break<00:01:46.799> me<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.340> it

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
definitely did break me out but it

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.090 
definitely did break me out but it
