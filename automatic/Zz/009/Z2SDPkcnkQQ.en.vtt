00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
population the same thing has to do with

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.859 
population the same thing has to do with
plants<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.640> plant<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.969> tree<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.570> end<00:02:00.719> up

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
plants you plant a tree you end up

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.240 
plants you plant a tree you end up
pruning<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.710> figure<00:02:01.920> out<00:02:02.070> are

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
pruning it you have to figure out are

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.770 
pruning it you have to figure out are
you<00:02:02.310> gonna<00:02:02.430> cut<00:02:02.700> off<00:02:02.850> those<00:02:03.060> limbs<00:02:03.360> are<00:02:03.630> you

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
you gonna cut off those limbs are you

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.440 
you gonna cut off those limbs are you
gonna<00:02:03.899> let<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.200> flower<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.640> are<00:02:05.969> involved

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
gonna let it flower that we are involved

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.199 
gonna let it flower that we are involved
in<00:02:06.840> how<00:02:07.110> we<00:02:07.170> interact<00:02:08.039> with<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.819> biosphere

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
in how we interact with the biosphere

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.260 
in how we interact with the biosphere

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
and that is in itself a profound issue

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.270 
and that is in itself a profound issue
that<00:02:12.599> you

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
that you

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.880

seen that in the field you've been

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.010 
seen that in the field you've been
working<00:02:31.370> for<00:02:31.400> 15<00:02:31.940> years<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.300> find<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:32.690> couple

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
working for 15 years you find a couple

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.270 
working for 15 years you find a couple
of<00:02:33.080> pollinators<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.650> were<00:02:33.860> never<00:02:34.070> there

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
of pollinators that were never there

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.970 
of pollinators that were never there
before<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:35.330> find<00:02:35.600> new<00:02:35.810> crosses<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:36.560> lettuces

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
before you find new crosses and lettuces

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.650 
before you find new crosses and lettuces
that<00:02:37.040> never<00:02:37.370> happen<00:02:37.850> you<00:02:38.000> find<00:02:38.300> that<00:02:38.450> there's

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
that never happen you find that there's

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.630 
that never happen you find that there's
things<00:02:38.870> happening<00:02:39.140> in<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.620> garden<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.370> if

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
things happening in the garden that if

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.610 
things happening in the garden that if
you're<00:02:40.910> lucky<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:41.540> can<00:02:41.750> get<00:02:41.900> an<00:02:42.050> insight<00:02:42.440> and

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
you're lucky you can get an insight and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.410 
you're lucky you can get an insight and
look<00:02:42.860> into<00:02:43.070> but<00:02:43.340> otherwise<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:44.060> don't<00:02:44.120> even

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
look into but otherwise you don't even

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.690 
look into but otherwise you don't even
know<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:45.140> garden<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.650> not<00:02:45.800> just<00:02:46.100> a<00:02:46.190> garden<00:02:46.580> the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
know the garden is not just a garden the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.270 
know the garden is not just a garden the
garden<00:02:47.060> is<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.180> metaphor<00:02:47.810> for<00:02:48.020> having<00:02:48.650> a<00:02:48.800> place

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
garden is a metaphor for having a place

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.540 
garden is a metaphor for having a place
to<00:02:49.520> develop<00:02:49.930> an<00:02:50.930> ethical<00:02:51.620> way<00:02:51.800> to<00:02:51.860> understand

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
to develop an ethical way to understand

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.760 
to develop an ethical way to understand
life<00:02:52.820> and<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.209> make<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.420> life<00:02:53.690> that<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.140> ethical

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
life and to make a life that is ethical

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.460 
life and to make a life that is ethical
so<00:02:55.760> that<00:02:55.940> garden<00:02:56.360> is<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.510> much<00:02:56.810> more<00:02:57.020> profound

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
so that garden is a much more profound

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.650 
so that garden is a much more profound
thing<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.459> see<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:59.090> one<00:02:59.360> would<00:02:59.480> like<00:02:59.600> to

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
thing and I see that one would like to

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.540 
thing and I see that one would like to
encourage<00:03:00.020> everybody<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.830> garden<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.430> it's

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
encourage everybody to garden and it's

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.979 
encourage everybody to garden and it's
always<00:03:01.760> astonishing<00:03:02.300> when<00:03:02.540> you<00:03:02.660> look<00:03:02.870> at

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
always astonishing when you look at

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.960 
always astonishing when you look at
local<00:03:03.350> regions<00:03:03.739> where<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.040> wild<00:03:04.370> species<00:03:04.640> of

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
disappearing that the towns don't have

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.130 
disappearing that the towns don't have
endangered<00:03:07.370> species<00:03:07.850> garden<00:03:08.510> or<00:03:08.630> encourage

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
endangered species garden or encourage

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.930 
endangered species garden or encourage
gardening<00:03:09.680> because<00:03:09.770> gardening<00:03:10.400> has<00:03:10.520> not<00:03:10.700> been

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
gardening because gardening has not been

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.590 
gardening because gardening has not been
considered<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:11.570> really<00:03:12.290> high<00:03:12.709> value<00:03:13.420> well<00:03:14.420> of

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
course if you live in a city and you

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.380 
course if you live in a city and you

have an access to land what do you bin a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.820 
have an access to land what do you bin a
garden<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.840> can<00:03:17.989> garden<00:03:18.290> in<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.530> small

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
garden you can garden in a small

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.770 
garden you can garden in a small
container<00:03:19.310> but<00:03:19.880> if<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.180> really<00:03:20.510> want<00:03:20.720> a

container but if you really want a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.170 
container but if you really want a
garden<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.320> need<00:03:21.560> some<00:03:22.100> land<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.670> lands<00:03:23.000> hard

garden you need some land and lands hard
to<00:03:23.330> get<00:03:23.510> it's<00:03:23.690> expensive<00:03:24.080> so<00:03:24.320> garden<00:03:24.799> becomes

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
to get it's expensive so garden becomes
