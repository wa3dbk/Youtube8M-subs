00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
fun to draw with I find it's like a

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.550 
fun to draw with I find it's like a
paintbrush<00:02:49.590> that's<00:02:49.920> always<00:02:50.989> full<00:02:51.989> of<00:02:52.260> course

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
until it runs out and it's best to

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:06.610 
until it runs out and it's best to
actually<00:03:01.159> pull<00:03:02.159> it<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.489> rather<00:03:02.639> than<00:03:02.819> push<00:03:03.150> it

I just basically fill in them in a space
here<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:35.520> just<00:04:35.729> makes<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.000> ribbon<00:04:36.389> pop

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599

I<00:04:42.539> suggest<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.080> do<00:04:43.229> is<00:04:43.349> it<00:04:44.150> take<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.180> digital

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
I suggest you do is it take a digital

I suggest you do is it take a digital
photo<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.229> it<00:04:46.410> or<00:04:46.650> scan<00:04:47.490> it<00:04:47.789> and<00:04:49.070> then<00:04:50.070> shrink

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
photo of it or scan it and then shrink

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.100 
photo of it or scan it and then shrink
it<00:04:50.780> and<00:04:52.909> make<00:04:53.909> a<00:04:53.940> little<00:04:54.060> JPEG<00:04:54.570> of<00:04:54.690> it<00:04:54.810> of<00:04:54.930> your

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
it and make a little JPEG of it of your

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.800 
it and make a little JPEG of it of your
own<00:04:55.139> and<00:04:55.759> because<00:04:56.759> if<00:04:56.880> you<00:04:57.000> shrink<00:04:57.270> it<00:04:57.539> one<00:04:57.720> of

own and because if you shrink it one of

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.089 
own and because if you shrink it one of
the<00:04:58.310> basic<00:04:59.310> secrets<00:04:59.729> to<00:05:00.770> illustration<00:05:01.770> and

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
the basic secrets to illustration and

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.700 
the basic secrets to illustration and
modern<00:05:02.490> design<00:05:03.449> is<00:05:03.840> if<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.050> shrink<00:05:04.199> something

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
modern design is if you shrink something

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.740 
modern design is if you shrink something
by<00:05:04.830> about<00:05:05.070> 15%

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
by about 15%

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.140 
by about 15%
it<00:05:07.440> just<00:05:07.830> looks<00:05:08.130> impossible<00:05:08.490> it<00:05:08.909> really

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
it just looks impossible it really

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.110 
it just looks impossible it really
tightens<00:05:09.509> it<00:05:09.630> up<00:05:09.720> and<00:05:10.080> it<00:05:10.169> looks<00:05:10.320> impossible

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
tightens it up and it looks impossible

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.430 
tightens it up and it looks impossible
to<00:05:12.120> do<00:05:12.240> by<00:05:12.389> hand<00:05:13.340> but<00:05:14.340> it<00:05:14.460> also<00:05:15.080> takes<00:05:16.080> care<00:05:16.229> of

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
to do by hand but it also takes care of

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.800 
to do by hand but it also takes care of
a<00:05:16.590> lot<00:05:16.620> of<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:16.979> little<00:05:17.210> hand<00:05:18.210> marks<00:05:18.509> that<00:05:18.659> you

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
a lot of the little hand marks that you

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.100 
a lot of the little hand marks that you
can<00:05:18.990> see<00:05:20.180> it's<00:05:21.180> interesting<00:05:21.449> when<00:05:21.720> you'll<00:05:21.840> go

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
can see it's interesting when you'll go

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.480 
can see it's interesting when you'll go
to<00:05:22.169> like<00:05:22.590> a<00:05:22.909> gallery<00:05:23.909> or<00:05:24.449> a<00:05:24.539> museum<00:05:25.340> and<00:05:26.340> look

however in modern times reality is the

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.360 
however in modern times reality is the
picture<00:06:03.310> because<00:06:03.699> then<00:06:03.849> you<00:06:03.940> can<00:06:05.220> make<00:06:06.220> it

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
picture because then you can make it

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.670 
picture because then you can make it
bigger<00:06:06.550> or<00:06:06.669> smaller

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680
