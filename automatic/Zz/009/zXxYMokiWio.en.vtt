00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.029
 hi to all friends it's irato that I 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.719
 make this first video on youtube in 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.920
 urgently because I find it disproportionate 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:15.960
 you must have heard 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:20.660
 of the maj 2 points 14 with valÃ©o lives 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.660
 and where there is also something is that for 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.449
 invoke the collectors it will be over there 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.220
 paying kamas it will be really 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.859
 potions and potions I was on the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.989
 on the beta and the potions are already 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.620
 must be level 100 yeah level without 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:44.430
 age chemistry and look at the resources 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.620
 so what I did for the match of 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.879
 tip is what I do every time 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.420
 that there are new stuff coming out 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.690
 is that I will try to buy on 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.600
 my version the real version everything for in 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.449
 do a dozen twenty like that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.199
 at first I will have I could 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.390
 directly to hell 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.150
 even though I do not have the alchemist level 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.939
 100 I will ask and like that I 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.500
 could well but frankly I find 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.659
 it's a shame because here you go 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.060
 look it must be at least level 50 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.009
 and here's the right it's normal but for 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.520
 to be number 50 that I find it a little 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.319
 little damage 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.450
 and besides being level without my job 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.159
 to be able to do that while all the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.950
 world is trying to hunger everyone wants 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.130
 in pause and I find it a little bit a little 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.170
 little silly he should have put four cases 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.349
 I do not know what you think 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.289
 tell me how to shut up because I 

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:43.729
 find that a little stupid so you 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.619
 what do you think 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.569
 if you want it's even a debate 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.090
 in the comments but tell me 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.310
 because frankly I have the impression 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.899
 to be the only one to find that weird and 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.659
 idiot so that's it if we're going to look through 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.270
 example we loose astrub resources 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.439
 what all resources are less 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.259
 level less than level 60 so 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.420
 now we can not have been watched 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.060
 prices so maybe all that 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.940
 would be worth against a dozen but 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.220
 could hide from him without his share 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.049
 40 his part 10 10 10 10 10 but when I 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.299
 see the rent the price of his if it's the 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.670
 mayor she even price a hundred and forty thousand 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.919
 for dietrich 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.319
 well it hurts a bit when we go 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:35.989
 go look at the price but I do not know 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:40.970
 at all if he had been a man then 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:44.180
 his parents sorry one for the office 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.819
 Ambience my creak chair and TV 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.880
 he is his and and I can not go them 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.819
 tender because it is roland the moment 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.250
 so hotels selling resources 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.139
 we're going to look so the blade have 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.459
 sacred yesterday it's on the real version and 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:03.010
 that's a character I created 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:05.690
 just to look at the possible 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:13.520
 search already we're going to watch croquera 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:17.010
 or the crau of the prod cra 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.530
 if so how ah ok but you know a 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.870
 a bit 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.180
 so that I think I'll buy them 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.250
 here's 100 so that's okay it's not too much 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:32.840
 excessive 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:37.950
 then there is little ropes then 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:42.330
 there I have trouble writing body so 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.050
 this we need it in forty times 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:51.989
 so it's okay it's not overly expensive 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:54.540
 then we have the seed of discord that 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.209
 is beautiful it's going by saying that I will 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.470
 refuel because like you 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.050
 can see the complaint of 10 when 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.239
 it's without his fourteen thousand units 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.100
 so I feel that coming to an end takes 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.250
 not bad more than there they are at mile 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.380
 units in an average price 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:15.420
 so that already I'm going to buy some 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:20.880
 skirts on the spot in case s band all 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.530
 then there is flax fiber so a I 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.350
 do not know at all if his area this 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.200
 task of the green greens of the ten 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.190
 it's okay it's not huge either seen this 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.410
 they say 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.770
 average price unavailable so that I know 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:38.790
 not yet who was who yet 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:44.790
 promised him who in French is 3506 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:49.530
 had for 34000 the essence that makes 3400 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.660
 the 10 so yeah that's pretty profitable 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.050
 then naughty white dragon that by 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.510
 against it's I know it's expensive 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.330
 then we will put white no rules 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.940
 white it's okay in the name it's not excessive 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.900
 here it is it says better things 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.580
 that the q5 if I'm going to buy 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.280
 Here I buy like before I go 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.160
 surely do his part 20 so here you go 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:23.380
 then demonic rose base that I 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:25.270
 do not know at all of it so here's the 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.790
 ten it's okay it's not too expensive they say 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:32.980
 how many ten thousand 2700 units so that's 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.740
 I'll maybe even in HD by 100 and 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.740
 I would make a profit even though 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.169
 not the 5th by 100 by ten it's 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.630
 definitely more profitable than by sense 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.600
 because that's good I buy it sells 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.450
 also and then the big boobs two 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.550
 boars that I remembered it was 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.860
 quite expensive but it's a lovely beaker 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.430
 here it is more expensive at all 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:00.640
 even if you have 800 or so 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.800
 kamal 20 and there is nothing wrong so 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.860
 then what I did not buy 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.669
 I did not buy that that and that 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.800
 So here you go, but like me 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.990
 thinks makes reservations about this 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.930
 version because otherwise it will cut 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.010
 but super expensive people will see for 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.940
 do the same thing as me and the 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:24.630
 resell and I think he's not going 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:28.539
 it will take a long time for nothing 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.640
 it comes to 1000 or even three wines have 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:33.880
 two three four thousand cases and say 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.870
 so it's not huge but it's 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.860
 always better to buy them 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:41.260
 800 the winds so it was pulled early for 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.810
 an express video in speed sick of 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.960
 death and I say to you soon hi to 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.960
 all
