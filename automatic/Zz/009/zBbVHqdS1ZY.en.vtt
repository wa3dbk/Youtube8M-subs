incredible poses and shapes in space and

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.050 
incredible poses and shapes in space and
Rodin<00:01:31.359> was<00:01:31.390> clearly<00:01:32.200> inspired<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:33.460> was

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
Rodin was clearly inspired this was

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.219 
Rodin was clearly inspired this was
never<00:01:34.500> cast<00:01:35.500> in<00:01:35.890> Rodan's<00:01:36.789> lifetime<00:01:37.420> but<00:01:38.049> the

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
never cast in Rodan's lifetime but the

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.910 
never cast in Rodan's lifetime but the
musee<00:01:38.560> rodin<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:39.070> 1950s<00:01:40.030> authorized<00:01:40.929> 12

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
musee rodin the 1950s authorized 12

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.719 
musee rodin the 1950s authorized 12
casts<00:01:43.499> zero<00:01:44.499> number<00:01:44.979> zero<00:01:45.280> is<00:01:45.490> in<00:01:45.640> the

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
casts zero number zero is in the

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.580 
casts zero number zero is in the
collection<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:46.149> musee<00:01:46.479> rodin<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:47.320> this<00:01:47.469> is

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
collection the musee rodin and this is

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.550 
collection the musee rodin and this is
number<00:01:47.770> one<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:48.670> this<00:01:48.789> is<00:01:48.969> very<00:01:49.149> close<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.899> how

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
number one so this is very close to how

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.530 
number one so this is very close to how
Rodin<00:01:51.039> would<00:01:51.340> have<00:01:51.490> had<00:01:51.670> it

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
Rodin would have had it

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.990 
Rodin would have had it
would<00:01:53.170> have<00:01:53.350> cast<00:01:53.890> it<00:01:54.220> if<00:01:54.370> you<00:01:54.520> hadn't<00:01:54.820> lived

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
would have cast it if you hadn't lived

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.760 
would have cast it if you hadn't lived
to<00:01:55.240> see<00:01:55.420> it<00:01:55.510> about<00:01:55.750> as<00:01:55.900> close<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.350> Masters

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
to see it about as close to the Masters

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.380 
to see it about as close to the Masters
hand<00:01:57.010> as<00:01:57.160> he<00:01:57.280> might<00:01:57.400> actually<00:01:57.790> as<00:01:57.940> who<00:01:58.120> can<00:01:58.180> get

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
hand as he might actually as who can get

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.030 
hand as he might actually as who can get
now<00:02:01.390> this<00:02:01.570> it<00:02:01.810> was<00:02:02.050> done<00:02:02.380> in<00:02:02.590> row<00:02:02.830> downs

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
now this it was done in row downs

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.270 
now this it was done in row downs
lifetime<00:02:03.640> this<00:02:03.910> was<00:02:04.710> intended<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.740> go<00:02:05.950> into

rodin<00:03:10.630> you<00:03:11.620> could<00:03:11.800> see<00:03:11.950> this<00:03:12.100> figure<00:03:12.370> on<00:03:12.640> the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
rodin you could see this figure on the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.440 
rodin you could see this figure on the
left<00:03:13.030> side<00:03:14.430> against<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.520> wall<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.270> the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
left side against the wall so the

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.130 
left side against the wall so the
difference<00:03:16.870> here<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.320> that<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.610> back<00:03:19.330> is<00:03:19.360> sort

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
difference here is that the back is sort

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.870 
difference here is that the back is sort
of<00:03:20.230> flattened<00:03:20.650> out<00:03:20.770> because<00:03:21.160> he<00:03:21.370> was<00:03:21.520> meant<00:03:21.790> to

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
of flattened out because he was meant to

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.300 
of flattened out because he was meant to
be<00:03:22.000> against<00:03:22.540> a<00:03:22.660> wall<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.560> this<00:03:23.770> is<00:03:23.920> really

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
be against a wall so this is really

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.910 
be against a wall so this is really
meant<00:03:24.850> to<00:03:24.970> be<00:03:25.150> seen<00:03:25.420> in<00:03:25.630> not<00:03:26.410> all<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.830> way

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
meant to be seen in not all the way

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.699 
meant to be seen in not all the way
around<00:03:27.280> but<00:03:27.880> it's<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.120> beautiful<00:03:28.300> patina<00:03:28.900> again

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
around but it's a beautiful patina again
