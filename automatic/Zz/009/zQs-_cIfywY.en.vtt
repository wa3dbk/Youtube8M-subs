00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
this year I was itching to see more what

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.390 
this year I was itching to see more what
is<00:05:42.170> now<00:05:42.290> more<00:05:42.470> clear<00:05:42.680> than<00:05:42.770> ever<00:05:43.040> is<00:05:43.250> that

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
is now more clear than ever is that

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.130 
is now more clear than ever is that
Metal<00:05:43.670> Gear<00:05:43.730> has<00:05:44.030> transformed<00:05:44.840> into<00:05:44.990> an

Metal Gear has transformed into an

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.750 
Metal Gear has transformed into an
open-world<00:05:45.530> stealth<00:05:45.920> game<00:05:46.160> and<00:05:46.400> we<00:05:46.550> saw<00:05:46.730> a

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
open-world stealth game and we saw a

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.400 
open-world stealth game and we saw a
demonstration<00:05:46.970> of<00:05:47.540> how<00:05:47.630> big<00:05:47.840> boss<00:05:47.990> would<00:05:48.260> use

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
the surroundings to his advantage with a

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
complete in-game time cycle I think we

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.010 
complete in-game time cycle I think we
should<00:05:52.400> prepare<00:05:52.880> for<00:05:53.060> a<00:05:53.090> lot<00:05:53.270> more<00:05:53.390> complexity

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
should prepare for a lot more complexity

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.490 
should prepare for a lot more complexity
with<00:05:54.170> in<00:05:54.260> regards<00:05:54.560> to<00:05:54.710> stealth<00:05:56.260> mgs<00:05:57.260> force

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
this one we didn't get to see so many

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.570 

but<00:06:08.960> the<00:06:09.080> real<00:06:09.260> deal<00:06:09.560> here<00:06:09.800> boils<00:06:10.010> down<00:06:10.220> to<00:06:10.490> the

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
but the real deal here boils down to the
