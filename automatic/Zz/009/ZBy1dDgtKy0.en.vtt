there is no doubt that these are

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.410 
there is no doubt that these are
unprecedented<00:00:26.640> economic<00:00:27.640> times<00:00:27.910> this

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420

differentiator for retailers who use it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.930 
differentiator for retailers who use it
wisely<00:01:05.560> when<00:01:06.560> we<00:01:06.740> look<00:01:06.950> at<00:01:07.040> technology<00:01:07.220> and

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
wisely when we look at technology and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.870 
wisely when we look at technology and
when<00:01:08.030> we<00:01:08.150> talk<00:01:08.420> to<00:01:08.660> retailers<00:01:09.530> we<00:01:10.520> talk<00:01:10.730> to

when we talk to retailers we talk to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.270 
when we talk to retailers we talk to
them<00:01:11.000> about<00:01:11.150> how<00:01:11.300> to<00:01:11.600> use<00:01:11.900> technology<00:01:12.620> to<00:01:12.860> get

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
them about how to use technology to get

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.580 
them about how to use technology to get
closer<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:13.820> their<00:01:14.120> customers<00:01:14.630> fewer

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
closer to their customers fewer

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.020 
closer to their customers fewer
customers<00:01:15.830> are<00:01:16.220> walking<00:01:16.340> through<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.790> door

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
customers are walking through the door

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.520 
customers are walking through the door
and<00:01:17.270> when<00:01:17.870> they're<00:01:18.020> walking<00:01:18.290> through<00:01:18.320> the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
and when they're walking through the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.620 
and when they're walking through the
door<00:01:18.710> they're<00:01:18.890> not<00:01:19.010> spending<00:01:19.310> as<00:01:19.580> much<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:20.420> how

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
door they're not spending as much so how

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.960 
door they're not spending as much so how
can<00:01:20.690> a<00:01:20.840> retailer<00:01:21.440> get<00:01:21.950> that<00:01:22.160> customer<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.640> open

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
can a retailer get that customer to open

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.540 
can a retailer get that customer to open
their<00:01:23.090> wallet<00:01:23.450> by<00:01:24.140> using<00:01:24.410> technology<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:25.400> grow

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
their wallet by using technology to grow

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.440 
their wallet by using technology to grow
customer<00:01:26.120> intimacy<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.860> deliver<00:01:28.640> more

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
customer intimacy and to deliver more

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
customer intimacy and to deliver more
rich<00:01:30.440> experiences<00:01:31.370> in<00:01:32.300> that<00:01:32.630> in<00:01:32.990> that<00:01:33.229> store

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
rich experiences in that in that store

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.770 
rich experiences in that in that store
environment

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.600 

when<00:01:39.780> Cisco<00:01:40.110> talks<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.560> retailers<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
when Cisco talks to retailers one of the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.490 
when Cisco talks to retailers one of the
areas<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:41.940> we<00:01:42.240> focus<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.290> lean

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
areas that we focus on is the lean

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.040 
areas that we focus on is the lean
retail<00:01:44.010> architecture<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> way<00:01:46.020> to

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
retail architecture and this is a way to

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.640 
retail architecture and this is a way to
take<00:01:46.710> cost<00:01:47.640> out<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.510> stores<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.430> improve<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
take cost out of stores and improve the

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.530 
take cost out of stores and improve the
management<00:01:52.650> of<00:01:52.860> those<00:01:53.520> store<00:01:53.820> applications

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
management of those store applications

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.390 
management of those store applications
from<00:01:54.690> a<00:01:54.810> central<00:01:55.170> location<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.830> it's<00:01:56.220> really

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
from a central location so it's really

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.999 
from a central location so it's really
about<00:01:56.640> consolidating<00:01:57.509> technology<00:01:58.290> into<00:01:58.979> a

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
about consolidating technology into a

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.790 
about consolidating technology into a
data<00:01:59.250> center<00:01:59.540> taking<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.630> out<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.990> store<00:02:01.290> but

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
data center taking it out of a store but

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.230 
data center taking it out of a store but
then<00:02:01.950> having<00:02:02.159> greater<00:02:02.430> flexibility<00:02:03.149> to

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
then having greater flexibility to

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.859 
then having greater flexibility to
deliver<00:02:03.630> applications<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:04.770> those<00:02:04.950> stores

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.080 

so<00:02:10.739> looking<00:02:11.009> into<00:02:11.220> 2009<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.269> beyond<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.959> 2010

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
so looking into 2009 and beyond to 2010

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.369 
so looking into 2009 and beyond to 2010
retailers<00:02:15.090> really<00:02:15.390> need<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.750> use<00:02:15.989> technology

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
retailers really need to use technology

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.759 
retailers really need to use technology
as<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.099> strategic<00:02:17.760> weapon<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:19.230> differentiate

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
as a strategic weapon to differentiate

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.280 
as a strategic weapon to differentiate
themselves<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.670> really<00:02:21.269> grow<00:02:21.540> their

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
themselves and really grow their

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.110 
themselves and really grow their
relationship<00:02:23.010> with<00:02:23.250> their<00:02:23.400> customers<00:02:23.910> and

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
relationship with their customers and

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.059 
relationship with their customers and
