00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.419 

so<00:00:01.110> cause<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.500> the<00:00:01.530> kinetic<00:00:01.860> energy<00:00:02.100> recovery

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
so cause is the kinetic energy recovery

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.249 
so cause is the kinetic energy recovery
system<00:00:05.120> basically<00:00:06.120> when<00:00:06.509> you<00:00:06.600> start<00:00:06.870> breaking

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
system basically when you start breaking

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.740 
system basically when you start breaking
the<00:00:07.440> rear<00:00:07.620> wheels<00:00:07.880> will<00:00:08.880> generate<00:00:09.269> energy

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
the rear wheels will generate energy

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.600 
the rear wheels will generate energy
which<00:00:10.050> go<00:00:10.290> through<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.679> dip<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.160> drive<00:00:11.340> shaft

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
which go through the dip the drive shaft

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.700 
which go through the dip the drive shaft
and<00:00:11.790> into<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:12.090> motor<00:00:12.450> which<00:00:13.110> charges<00:00:13.469> up<00:00:13.650> the

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
and into this motor which charges up the

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.589 
and into this motor which charges up the
batteries<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.370> then<00:00:15.000> when<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.210> exit<00:00:15.540> the

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
batteries and then when you exit the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.939 
batteries and then when you exit the
corner<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:15.960> get<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.199> power<00:00:16.410> once<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.800> get<00:00:16.920> to

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
corner you get on power once you get to

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.590 
corner you get on power once you get to
full<00:00:17.220> throttle<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:18.000> can<00:00:18.150> press<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.359> button

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
full throttle you can press a button

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.290 
full throttle you can press a button
which<00:00:19.100> releases<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.310> energy<00:00:20.430> into<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
which releases that energy into the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.370 
which releases that energy into the
wheels<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.630> gives<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:21.960> extra<00:00:22.170> brake

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
wheels and gives you extra brake

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.370 
wheels and gives you extra brake
horsepower<00:00:23.300> curse<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.449> great<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.900> course<00:00:25.080> I

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
horsepower curse is great of course I

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.230 
horsepower curse is great of course I
mean<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.949> use<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.400> mostly<00:00:26.730> out<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> very

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
mean I use it mostly out of the very

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.339 
mean I use it mostly out of the very
slow<00:00:27.420> corners<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.930> when<00:00:28.080> there's<00:00:28.230> long

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
slow corners and when there's long

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.839 
slow corners and when there's long
straights<00:00:28.680> that's<00:00:29.250> where<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.550> gives<00:00:29.640> me<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
straights that's where it gives me the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.089 
straights that's where it gives me the
biggest<00:00:30.449> gain<00:00:30.810> was<00:00:31.380> it's<00:00:31.529> quite<00:00:31.679> limited

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
biggest gain was it's quite limited

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.470 
biggest gain was it's quite limited
because<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.340> can<00:00:32.489> only<00:00:32.610> push<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.000> for<00:00:33.180> six<00:00:33.360> or

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
because I can only push it for six or

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.959 
because I can only push it for six or
seven<00:00:33.719> seconds<00:00:34.110> per<00:00:34.260> lap<00:00:34.460> and<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.700> may<00:00:35.910> be

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
seven seconds per lap and if I may be

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.520 
seven seconds per lap and if I may be
fighting<00:00:36.390> with<00:00:36.480> another<00:00:36.630> guy<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:36.989> example

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
fighting with another guy for example

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.310 
fighting with another guy for example
I'll<00:00:37.680> not<00:00:38.280> boost<00:00:38.550> until<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> end<00:00:39.540> when<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.200> know

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
I'll not boost until the end when I know

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
I'll not boost until the end when I know
that<00:00:40.590> ok<00:00:40.770> there<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> biggest

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
that ok there I have the biggest

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.799 
that ok there I have the biggest
straight<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.879> then<00:00:42.360> have<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.600> best<00:00:42.750> chance

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
straight and then have the best chance

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.660 
straight and then have the best chance
to<00:00:43.079> overtake<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.920> I'll<00:00:44.040> wait<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.370> I'll<00:00:44.430> boost

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to overtake so I'll wait and I'll boost

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.459 
to overtake so I'll wait and I'll boost
just<00:00:44.969> then<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> big<00:00:45.870> run<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.260> guy<00:00:46.379> in

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
just then to get a big run on the guy in

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.799 
just then to get a big run on the guy in
front<00:00:46.670> it's<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.760> big<00:00:47.910> boost<00:00:48.090> yeah<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.690> really

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
front it's a big boost yeah you really

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.770 
front it's a big boost yeah you really
feel<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.410> get<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.680> use<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.780> several

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
feel it and you get to use that several

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.510 
feel it and you get to use that several
times<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> lab<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.739> usually<00:00:53.100> use<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.370> about

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
times to the lab so usually use it about

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.180 
times to the lab so usually use it about
three<00:00:53.760> or<00:00:53.820> four<00:00:53.879> times<00:00:57.559> typically<00:00:58.559> all<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
three or four times typically all the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.670 
three or four times typically all the
cars<00:00:59.430> are<00:00:59.699> harvesting<00:01:00.600> energy<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.079> same

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
cars are harvesting energy at the same

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.560 
cars are harvesting energy at the same
points<00:01:02.100> around<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> circuit<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.180> at<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
points around the circuit and at the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.509 
points around the circuit and at the
same<00:01:03.750> magnitude<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:05.159> terms<00:01:05.369> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
same magnitude but in terms of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.000 
same magnitude but in terms of
deployment<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.659> driver<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.290> choose<00:01:07.680> when<00:01:07.979> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
deployment the driver can choose when to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.300 
deployment the driver can choose when to
use<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.640> deploy<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.330> 400<00:01:10.290> kilojoules<00:01:10.860> it

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
use to deploy that 400 kilojoules it

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.690 
use to deploy that 400 kilojoules it
equates<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.960> 6.7<00:01:12.960> seconds<00:01:13.560> at<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> 80

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
equates to 6.7 seconds at the 80

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.539 
equates to 6.7 seconds at the 80
horsepower<00:01:15.060> power<00:01:15.810> level<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.250> driver

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
horsepower power level so the driver

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.090 
horsepower power level so the driver
could<00:01:17.820> deploy<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.420> one<00:01:18.900> entire<00:01:19.350> lap<00:01:19.650> to

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.460 
engineers will tell me exactly where I
need<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.189> push<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.700> then<00:01:45.390> ok<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.750> more<00:01:46.350> or<00:01:46.409> less

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
need to push and then ok I more or less

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.469 
need to push and then ok I more or less
I<00:01:46.680> think<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.040> get<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.579> grip<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.299> quite

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
I think I get that grip of it quite

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.690 
I think I get that grip of it quite
quickly<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.649> challenge<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.130> when<00:01:50.490> i<00:01:50.520> get

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
quickly the challenge is that when i get

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.609 
quickly the challenge is that when i get
to<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.850> X<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.180> corner<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.259> push<00:01:52.409> as

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
to the X to the corner I have to push as

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.690 
to the X to the corner I have to push as
soon<00:01:52.860> as<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.130> get<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.430> full<00:01:53.640> throttle

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
soon as I get to full throttle

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.520 
soon as I get to full throttle
straightaway<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.960> get<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.229> button

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
straightaway have to get on the button

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.740 
straightaway have to get on the button
and<00:01:55.680> then<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> certain<00:01:56.759> time<00:01:56.969> only<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.600> I

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
and then for a certain time only and I

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.630 
and then for a certain time only and I
have<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.960> follow<00:01:58.170> some<00:01:58.350> numbers<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:59.520> know

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
have to follow some numbers to know

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.859 
have to follow some numbers to know
exactly<00:02:00.030> when<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.420> release<00:02:00.659> again

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
exactly when I have to release again

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.510 
exactly when I have to release again
because<00:02:01.229> there<00:02:01.350> was<00:02:01.439> an<00:02:01.530> optimum<00:02:01.920> strategy<00:02:02.369> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
because there was an optimum strategy to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.990 
because there was an optimum strategy to
get<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> most<00:02:02.939> out<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.329> for<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.600> lap<00:02:03.750> time

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
get the most out of it for a lap time

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.169 
get the most out of it for a lap time
you<00:02:05.690> have<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:05.960> keep<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.800> cuz<00:02:07.190> you<00:02:08.000> don't

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
you have to keep the the cuz you don't

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.820 
you have to keep the the cuz you don't
need<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.390> be<00:02:08.509> empty<00:02:08.780> because<00:02:09.410> then<00:02:09.710> it

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
need to be empty because then it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.230 
need to be empty because then it
switches<00:02:10.070> off<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.580> then<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:10.850> pushes<00:02:11.000> that

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
switches off and then it pushes that

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.990 
switches off and then it pushes that
stops<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.960> engine<00:02:11.990> braking<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.800> or<00:02:13.340> you

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
stops the engine braking and or you

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.370 
stops the engine braking and or you
don't<00:02:14.180> have<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.360> be<00:02:14.450> full<00:02:14.690> because<00:02:15.170> then<00:02:15.290> it

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
don't have to be full because then it

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.870 
don't have to be full because then it
does<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.830> same<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.280> try<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.490> keep<00:02:16.700> the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
does the same so you try to keep the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.090 
does the same so you try to keep the
energy<00:02:17.000> in<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.750> same<00:02:17.960> area<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.650> do<00:02:18.950> have

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
energy in the same area so you do have

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.460 
energy in the same area so you do have
to<00:02:19.250> make<00:02:19.520> sure<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.760> use<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.260> can't

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
to make sure you use it and you can't

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.360 
to make sure you use it and you can't
use<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.680> little<00:02:22.070> bit<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.310> overfill<00:02:22.910> it

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.430
