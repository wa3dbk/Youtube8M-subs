00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.860
 and we arrived in the final stretch of the 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.930
 circuit divine shepherdess of races 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.119
 popular of valencia but here I do not know 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.520
 note the fatigue rather everything 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.500
 opposite and that's why more than 4500 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.390
 runners took advantage of the new 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.489
 lines of the thirteenth round by the 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.619
 cabanyal year of faith to return to 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.550
 demonstrate your passion and vocation for this 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.649
 circuit 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.540
 we talk about a career that falls just in 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.160
 the equator between the half marathon and the 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.989
 preparation for the next marathon 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.660
 November 17 but still having 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.280
 a great attraction and that is that 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.710
 common circuit with the dorsal 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.260
 fixed additions were added 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.120
 of 1,400 runners and they did it for 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.739
 give everything on the asphalt as well 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.409
 did the winner of the test 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.120
 adil el jan making the most of the 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.750
 longest straight circuit of a 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.739
 kilometer and a half direct towards the goal 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.269
 the truth is that it is nothing 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.050
 probably the fastest of the 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.690
 circuit very long straights perfect 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.289
 to him with no twists very well the only thing 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.289
 the air against reaching goal but 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.289
 now 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.560
 yes yes yes very fast and the truth that very 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.799
 fast 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.630
 I am very tired yes I am very tired 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.250
 If there is also a lot of heat , 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.680
 time does not accompany at least for me 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.010
 go it's hot 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.010
 and also very funny many people very 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.930
 Very cool and good dynamics especially with 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.180
 the kilometers that can allow more 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.950
 people run what is important one 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.930
 test organized by the brotherhood of 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.940

 valencia monseñor carlos osoro la 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.630
 solidarity the sacrifice the service the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.970
 delivery to participate not for being the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.700
 first but participate with all the 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.750
 team but I think we important 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.360
 what are values ​​that certainly do not 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.310
 has discovered with a special gift 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.780
 Jesus Christ our segment ahead 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.820
