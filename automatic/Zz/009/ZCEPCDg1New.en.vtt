00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
that perk but we actually just saw perk

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.229 
that perk but we actually just saw perk
right<00:00:44.960> there<00:00:45.469> and<00:00:45.649> underrated<00:00:46.519> it<00:00:46.850> you<00:00:47.059> don't

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
see it that well but so I'm gonna pull

up<00:00:48.980> a<00:00:49.070> screenshot<00:00:49.840> for<00:00:50.840> you<00:00:50.989> guys<00:00:51.260> really

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
up a screenshot for you guys really

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.799 
up a screenshot for you guys really
quickly<00:00:52.160> but<00:00:52.489> there<00:00:52.699> you<00:00:52.879> can<00:00:53.059> see<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.510> what

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
quickly but there you can see the what

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.290 
quickly but there you can see the what
the<00:00:53.929> perk<00:00:54.140> looks<00:00:54.410> like<00:00:54.620> for<00:00:54.920> speed<00:00:55.609> now<00:00:56.239> the

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
the perk looks like for speed now the

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.810 
the perk looks like for speed now the
reason<00:00:56.839> you<00:00:56.870> saw<00:00:57.260> that<00:00:57.530> little<00:00:57.800> sleight<00:00:58.789> of

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
reason you saw that little sleight of

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.020 
reason you saw that little sleight of
hand<00:00:59.199> hand<00:01:00.199> symbol<00:01:00.859> is<00:01:01.010> because<00:01:01.640> that<00:01:01.879> was

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
hand hand symbol is because that was

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.210 
hand hand symbol is because that was
from<00:01:02.269> a<00:01:02.390> person's<00:01:02.929> view<00:01:03.440> that<00:01:03.829> was<00:01:03.949> playing

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
from a person's view that was playing

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.430 
from a person's view that was playing
the<00:01:04.339> game<00:01:04.519> in<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:05.210> screenshot<00:01:05.870> this<00:01:06.050> is<00:01:06.230> just

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
the game in the screenshot this is just

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.649 
the game in the screenshot this is just
like<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.620> Dali<00:01:07.040> camera<00:01:07.580> watching<00:01:08.120> the<00:01:08.270> zombies

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
like a Dali camera watching the zombies

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.840 
like a Dali camera watching the zombies
jump<00:01:08.990> but<00:01:09.350> if<00:01:09.440> you<00:01:09.560> look<00:01:09.890> right<00:01:10.280> past<00:01:10.670> that

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
jump but if you look right past that

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.760 
jump but if you look right past that
zombie<00:01:11.480> if<00:01:11.600> you<00:01:11.720> look<00:01:11.930> right<00:01:12.290> past<00:01:12.650> that

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
zombie if you look right past that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.190 
zombie if you look right past that
zombie<00:01:13.220> you<00:01:13.340> can<00:01:13.520> see<00:01:13.700> a<00:01:13.730> little<00:01:13.940> red<00:01:14.480> perk

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
zombie you can see a little red perk

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
machine and this initially just reminds

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.280 
machine and this initially just reminds
me<00:01:21.590> of<00:01:21.680> vulture<00:01:22.280> aid<00:01:22.400> however<00:01:22.700> I'm<00:01:23.060> sure

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
me of vulture aid however I'm sure

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.990 
me of vulture aid however I'm sure
voltar<00:01:24.290> aid<00:01:24.410> is<00:01:24.590> not<00:01:24.770> coming<00:01:25.160> back<00:01:25.190> as<00:01:25.550> that

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
voltar aid is not coming back as that

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.300 
voltar aid is not coming back as that
would<00:01:26.120> be<00:01:26.150> way<00:01:26.900> to<00:01:26.960> direct<00:01:27.620> the<00:01:27.860> copy<00:01:28.100> of

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
would be way to direct the copy of

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.870 
would be way to direct the copy of
Treyarch<00:01:28.760> um<00:01:29.750> however<00:01:30.500> I<00:01:31.010> do<00:01:31.220> think<00:01:31.670> it's<00:01:31.790> a

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
Treyarch um however I do think it's a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.300 
Treyarch um however I do think it's a
realistic<00:01:32.150> possibility<00:01:32.540> that<00:01:33.410> a<00:01:33.650> perk<00:01:34.070> that

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
realistic possibility that a perk that

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.840 
realistic possibility that a perk that
can<00:01:35.120> replace<00:01:35.960> Juggernog<00:01:36.710> is<00:01:37.040> coming<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:37.730> it's

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
can replace Juggernog is coming and it's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.390 
can replace Juggernog is coming and it's
gonna<00:01:37.970> be<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:38.930> perk<00:01:39.200> you<00:01:39.350> know<00:01:39.470> red<00:01:39.770> health

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
gonna be that perk you know red health

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.540 
gonna be that perk you know red health
red<00:01:41.000> armor<00:01:41.660> some<00:01:42.200> sort<00:01:42.410> of<00:01:42.470> armor<00:01:43.010> or<00:01:43.220> some

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
red armor some sort of armor or some

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.170 
red armor some sort of armor or some
sort<00:01:43.940> of<00:01:44.860> additional<00:01:45.860> health<00:01:46.370> perk<00:01:46.730> i<00:01:46.910> think

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
sort of additional health perk i think

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.680 
sort of additional health perk i think
that<00:01:47.600> is<00:01:47.930> what<00:01:48.290> that<00:01:48.950> machine<00:01:49.760> like<00:01:50.210> think<00:01:50.480> be

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
that is what that machine like think be

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.360 
that is what that machine like think be
it<00:01:50.840> could<00:01:50.990> not<00:01:51.200> be<00:01:51.350> a<00:01:51.380> machine<00:01:51.710> no<00:01:51.830> whatsoever

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
it could not be a machine no whatsoever

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.920 
it could not be a machine no whatsoever
but<00:01:52.790> a<00:01:52.820> lot<00:01:53.030> of<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.210> guys<00:01:53.330> have<00:01:53.540> been<00:01:53.570> tweeting

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
but a lot of you guys have been tweeting

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.530 
but a lot of you guys have been tweeting
at<00:01:54.020> me<00:01:54.050> saying<00:01:54.530> yo<00:01:54.770> city<00:01:55.460> this<00:01:55.730> is<00:01:55.790> another

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
at me saying yo city this is another

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.300 
at me saying yo city this is another
perk<00:01:56.810> machine<00:01:57.110> I<00:01:57.230> think<00:01:57.260> it's<00:01:57.650> jug<00:01:57.920> I<00:01:58.100> think

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
perk machine I think it's jug I think

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.040 
perk machine I think it's jug I think
