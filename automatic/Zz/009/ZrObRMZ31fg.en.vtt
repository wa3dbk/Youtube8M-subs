00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.480 
made a great mix from being a little bit
old<00:01:25.960> school<00:01:26.079> but<00:01:26.500> still<00:01:26.649> having<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.340> new

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
old school but still having the new

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.219 
old school but still having the new
mechanics<00:01:28.000> in<00:01:28.119> it<00:01:28.210> it's<00:01:28.360> nice<00:01:28.509> good<00:01:28.780> man<00:01:29.049> I

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
mechanics in it it's nice good man I

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.959 
mechanics in it it's nice good man I
mean<00:01:29.409> it's<00:01:29.799> good<00:01:30.039> I<00:01:30.280> mean<00:01:30.520> where<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.759> fact

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
mean it's good I mean where the fact

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.190 
mean it's good I mean where the fact
that<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.180> ball<00:01:31.390> looks<00:01:31.600> like<00:01:31.719> it<00:01:31.810> comes<00:01:31.960> off

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
that the ball looks like it comes off

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.249 
that the ball looks like it comes off
for<00:01:32.380> so<00:01:32.560> much<00:01:32.710> faster<00:01:33.570> sounds<00:01:34.570> like<00:01:34.689> he's<00:01:35.229> on

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
for so much faster sounds like he's on

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.609 
for so much faster sounds like he's on
the<00:01:35.469> field<00:01:35.829> was<00:01:36.759> exploding<00:01:37.360> off<00:01:37.450> now<00:01:38.110> Lucas<00:01:38.439> is

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
the field was exploding off now Lucas is

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.020 
the field was exploding off now Lucas is
one<00:01:38.799> of<00:01:38.890> longest<00:01:39.009> hitters<00:01:39.310> on<00:01:39.460> tour<00:01:39.700> so<00:01:39.850> he<00:01:39.909> was

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
one of longest hitters on tour so he was

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.539 
one of longest hitters on tour so he was
going<00:01:40.210> from<00:01:40.360> 305<00:01:40.689> to<00:01:41.110> 315<00:01:41.710> that's<00:01:42.039> great<00:01:42.189> love

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
going from 305 to 315 that's great love

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.130 
going from 305 to 315 that's great love
