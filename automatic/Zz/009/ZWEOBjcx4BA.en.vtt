is<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> Sun<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:24.000> here<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.840> Earth<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:26.070> is

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
is the Sun this here is Earth this is

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.599 
is the Sun this here is Earth this is
mercury<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:27.449> can't<00:00:28.349> imagine<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.830> being<00:00:29.070> Venus

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
mercury I can't imagine this being Venus

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.290 
mercury I can't imagine this being Venus
it<00:00:29.820> would<00:00:29.939> be<00:00:30.090> fairly<00:00:30.480> large<00:00:31.910> for<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.090> be

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
it would be fairly large for it to be

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.180 
it would be fairly large for it to be
Venus<00:00:34.910> but<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.030> course<00:00:36.270> if<00:00:36.450> there's<00:00:36.660> any

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
Venus but of course if there's any

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.680 
Venus but of course if there's any
astronomers<00:00:38.190> out<00:00:38.370> there<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:39.120> correct

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
astronomers out there that can correct

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.840 
astronomers out there that can correct
me<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.989> I'd<00:00:40.950> love<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.489> get<00:00:41.640> some

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.910 
information on this is a fairly fairly
interesting<00:00:45.270> stuff<00:00:45.809> that's<00:00:46.200> coming<00:00:46.739> out

interesting stuff that's coming out
right<00:00:47.070> now<00:00:47.450> I<00:00:48.450> want<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> show<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.100> right<00:00:50.449> here

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
right now I want to show this right here

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.670 
right now I want to show this right here
this<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.719> from<00:00:51.989> 1129<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.809> 11:28<00:00:54.809> Thanksgiving

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
this is from 1129 on 11:28 Thanksgiving

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.220 
this is from 1129 on 11:28 Thanksgiving
Day<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.610> appears<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.629> image<00:00:57.989> is

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
Day and it appears that the image is

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.210 
Day and it appears that the image is
leaving<00:01:00.199> here<00:01:01.199> ok<00:01:01.800> which<00:01:02.489> would<00:01:02.989> definitely

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
leaving here ok which would definitely

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.950 
leaving here ok which would definitely
coincide<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:06.420> movement<00:01:07.189> right<00:01:08.189> here<00:01:08.960> as

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
coincide with the movement right here as

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.340 
coincide with the movement right here as
you<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.290> see<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.830> object<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:12.020> starts<00:01:13.020> here

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
you can see this object here starts here

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.359 
you can see this object here starts here
and<00:01:13.710> moves<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.310> over<00:01:14.700> ok<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.710> here<00:01:17.100> looks

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
and moves on over ok so this here looks

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.130 
and moves on over ok so this here looks
like<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.939> same<00:01:18.330> image<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> same<00:01:20.060> area<00:01:21.140> ok

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
like that same image in the same area ok

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.780 
like that same image in the same area ok
so<00:01:22.200> yeah<00:01:22.560> once<00:01:22.770> again<00:01:22.979> there's<00:01:23.189> earth<00:01:23.430> there's

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
so yeah once again there's earth there's

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.950 
so yeah once again there's earth there's
mercury<00:01:24.299> here's<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.439> Sun<00:01:25.740> right<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.960> then

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
mercury here's the Sun right here then

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.109 
mercury here's the Sun right here then
here's<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.530> image<00:01:28.950> that's<00:01:29.159> leaving<00:01:29.490> at

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
here's that image that's leaving at

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.100 
here's that image that's leaving at
11:00<00:01:30.210> basically<00:01:31.200> 30<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.869> Thanksgiving<00:01:33.869> Day

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
11:00 basically 30 on a Thanksgiving Day

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.899 
11:00 basically 30 on a Thanksgiving Day
and<00:01:34.400> then<00:01:35.450> look<00:01:36.450> at<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:37.220> this<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.280> earlier

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
and then look at this this is earlier

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.590 
and then look at this this is earlier
that<00:01:39.240> same<00:01:39.840> day<00:01:39.900> on<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.560> 28th<00:01:41.100> Oh<00:01:43.189> 3:30<00:01:44.189> here

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
that same day on the 28th Oh 3:30 here

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.910 
that same day on the 28th Oh 3:30 here
look<00:01:45.600> at<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:46.880> is<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.000> not<00:01:48.299> something

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
look at this is that not something

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.789 
look at this is that not something
there's<00:01:49.920> earth<00:01:50.310> there's<00:01:51.090> mercury<00:01:51.630> here's<00:01:52.500> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
there's earth there's mercury here's the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.399 
there's earth there's mercury here's the
Sun<00:01:54.950> what<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.790> mean<00:01:57.540> perhaps<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:58.290> a

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
Sun what is that I mean perhaps it's a

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.569 
Sun what is that I mean perhaps it's a
lens<00:01:58.920> flare<00:01:59.189> or<00:02:00.229> some<00:02:01.229> dust<00:02:01.680> or<00:02:02.070> something

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
lens flare or some dust or something

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.500 
lens flare or some dust or something
along<00:02:02.820> those<00:02:02.880> lines<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.020> lens

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:14.160 

why<00:02:07.510> would<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.810> move<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.570> screen<00:02:11.610> okay<00:02:13.170> and

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
why would it move of the screen okay and

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.760 
why would it move of the screen okay and
then<00:02:14.350> once<00:02:14.530> again<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:16.810> following<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.350> same

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
then once again it's following the same

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.900 
then once again it's following the same
trajectory<00:02:18.610> here<00:02:19.360> look<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.670> just

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
trajectory here look that is just

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.630 
trajectory here look that is just
absolutely<00:02:25.090> bizarre<00:02:26.020> yeah<00:02:26.980> just<00:02:27.280> figured<00:02:27.550> I

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
absolutely bizarre yeah just figured I

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.890 
absolutely bizarre yeah just figured I
throw<00:02:27.910> this<00:02:28.120> information<00:02:28.720> out<00:02:28.870> there

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
throw this information out there

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.480 
throw this information out there
hopefully<00:02:29.800> somebody<00:02:30.459> can<00:02:30.930> bring<00:02:31.930> up<00:02:32.230> some

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
hopefully somebody can bring up some

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.060 
hopefully somebody can bring up some
useful<00:02:33.490> information<00:02:33.820> on<00:02:34.300> this<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.860> we'll<00:02:35.860> get

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
useful information on this and we'll get

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.610 
useful information on this and we'll get
this<00:02:36.250> little<00:02:36.610> gem<00:02:36.850> here<00:02:36.880> solved<00:02:37.630> okay<00:02:38.200> folks

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
this little gem here solved okay folks

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.610 
this little gem here solved okay folks
