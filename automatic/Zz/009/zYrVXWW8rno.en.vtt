00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.830
 [Music] 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.410
 hello how I hope you are 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.619
 very well this time I'm going to prepare 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.500
 a jelly with yogurt but not like the 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:19.130
 that we have prepared this recipe is from me 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.710
 prima irma good we're going to need a 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.320
 liter of yogurt this is strawberry 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.080
 they can use the brand and flavor that 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.730
 more like I'm also going to use a 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.510
 can of fruit cocktail in syrup 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:38.050
 you can use if you want 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:42.460
 peach pineapple or any other kind of 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.500
 Fruit is not I have 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.850
 I have three envelopes that the tub already 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.460
 prepared I have strawberry lemon and 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.059
 sherry the same as the flavors that 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.100
 you prefer here in this pot 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.980
 I have three liters of water I put 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.980
 boil I will prepare each of the 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.680
 sachets according to the indication for each 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.720
 one of these of these sachets is a 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.840
 liter of water well hot good 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.330
 I prepare the gelatine as I mentioned the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.780
 Gelatine is already prepared with the flavor 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.910
 and the sugar needed here are a 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.759
 liter of hot water and 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.930
 simply add it and dissolve it very 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.470
 all right 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.710
 after dissolving the gelatine very well 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.110
 we are going to add in a container 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.670
 it does not matter if the containers are not 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.670
 in frozen tracings 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.500
 good to see here already dissolved the three 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.740
 envelopes and they are 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.050
 and deposited in different containers 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.790
 I'm going to let it cool down 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.580
 because they are too hot to put them 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.460
 to the refrigerator and wait and wait 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.460
 that are completely set 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.790
 the gelatin already rennet is completely 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:07.070
 lasts the same as the others 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.070
 well let's break it right here 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.800
 as we are not going to take it out of the utensil 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.880
 there was no need to 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.560
 to grease it 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.560
 let's break it into squares 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.409
 I made him some stripes and now in the sense 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.409
 contrary 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.790
 and now we are going to add it to 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.790
 put in a larger utensil 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.050
 I'm going to help with this spatula or with 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.050
 is beaten because it is not space 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.069
 and here we are again 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.140
 now the same thing we're going to do with the one 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.569
 we have here 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:25.609
 well here we can detach with the 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.609
 with clean hands like that 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.210
 throwing him 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.890
 if they want to dislodge 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.720
 to be able to the parties 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:53.800
 115 split in two 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.800
 and we put it in something and we start it 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.530
 also in cubes 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.520
 and we're going to put it together with the 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.820
 that we have color I say in the taste 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:11.070
 hess and the same with the third color 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.070
 what is the dam 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.900
 once we have the gelatine in 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.980
 cubes we are going to add in this case the 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.710
 fruit cocktail in syrup 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.470
 it's pineapple or peach 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.529
 we are not going to start less there is already peach 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.110
 other pineapple sites and the live ones 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:38.560
 the premium also claims the Greek fruit 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:43.260
 natural apart from that of syrup he puts 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.260
 mango or seasonal fruit 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.810
 the syrup only half 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.110
 since we have the fruit in syrup 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.100
 to add the light 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.380
 the new one we can start 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.260
 they also sell is not split then 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.560
 we can also add it or half of 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.660
 We can split it, that's already 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.650
 decision of you to say you want to put 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.900
 towards the middle or split it 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.710
 the amount of walnut is what you 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:25.190
 decide this bag is 100 grams 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.850
 with this and now we are going to add the 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.850
 yogurt 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.400
 is this container has a kilogram of 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.400
 yogurt 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.130
 let's add everything 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.120
 what's left I'm going to take it with the 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.120

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:58.000
 and now we are going to integrate everything 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.000
 All this 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.650
 and that's how the jelly was 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.700
 my cousin irma sandoval shared 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:19.640
