00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hey people , you say here and yes for today 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.109
 Get a team deathmatch on meltdown 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.450
 we play with the ms mmc i have the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.900
 weapon and yes that is somehow the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.460
 new ump or cafÃ©s are not because they are 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.960
 Now I'm overboard but I think 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.460
 because they are pretty pretty meanwhile 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.750
 pretty much used on youtube 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.880
 and generally you can see them now 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.800
 very often so I have but 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.510
 used with the muffler and in the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.449
 I think I also get the best setup 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.220
 for smbs in general so i had one earlier 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.900
 always keep the laser time in there because I 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.759
 thought so I can all the opponents 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.250
 destroying the hips and fighting a lot 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.510
 win better but that's the tactic 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.790
 I have now completely 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.440
 abandoned so that makes the world 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.969
 in my opinion, not so much anymore 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.500
 So it makes sense if you look from the hip 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.210
 shoots then you get the opponents too 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.250
 so dead with a smg relatively quickly 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.020
 So here comes a situation where 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.570
 I would not have needed a reader, either 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.860
 you see if the opponents continue now 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.100
 I would have been away anyway 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.719
 healthy so that's why I have to the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.559
 leather time completely out of my source 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.850
 actually already connected and the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.049
 Atoms in parks are trendy too 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.420
 what am I saying on my last one 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.640
 video a bit ignored i have 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.810
 as in the first spot two bucks in it the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.159
 means hard line and goss think I must 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.600
 I still think so 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.850
 used this whole because of salary 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.770
 july as spam on just in grand prix 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.930
 pma kids is really so overpowered 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.360
 I do not know how to look at it 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.180
 as long as you do not know which one 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.189
 still use because as I said 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.380
 I have this game on my last 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.030
 video already mentioned allows one 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.470
 really no mistakes and that's why 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.850
 you also really the best setups 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 in my opinion the best use 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.049
 Weapons are really constant 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.909
 Here to play relatively well because 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.619
 It is incredibly difficult this game 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.680
 I still think so if you are 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.930
 is holding 110 to 100 200 percent more 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.810
 there are still good scores here 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.759
 So reach hardliner is clearly around 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.719
 to get a recent one then I have 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.390
 yet what is the name of the park decks terry inside 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.500
 I believe that a third lottum stops 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.969
 after the race my weapon faster 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.880
 to be operational again and then 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.880
 still toughness in the second work slot around 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.140
 stop 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.729
 while you have a whole time and then 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.470
 Not directly hit a salto 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.220
 do 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.360
 you know that when man 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.680
 it is shot that one the weapon 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.640
 really pull that up so far 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.840
 you do not meet the enemy anymore 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.340
 sometimes you make happy ones 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.040
 hatch has but that is unfortunately in the 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.380
 The rarest of all cases 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.730
 is just to stay on target 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.620
 while I'm shot what too 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.570
 very good helps and stops the Geneva 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.960
 I now also win on him 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.690
 so my box is laid out earlier i am 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.580
 he made so that I hold the line 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.440
 vernes reinmache around all the steps 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.480
 listen better and once hold one 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.520
 small step to hear the black ops 2 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.410
 sometimes hear and then forewarned 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.300
 which of course helped sometimes 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.310
 but unfortunately not as often as I wanted 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.530
 and that's why it makes my opinion 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.030
 after really much much more sense and 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.100
 stop to interpret it 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.320
 to win the whole thing better because of that 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.970
 was the big problem from the beginning 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.220
 That's why I do not know 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.900
 but why somehow the opponents can 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.310
 so I aim much better too 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.400
 times the church in the cook then if 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.160
 I sometimes from a pistol of ten 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.690
 kilometers and therefore and 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.760
 try that way in this way and 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.320
 wise to compensate 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.350
 if now a still relatively well worked out 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.030
 my killstreaks are the gui like that 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.440
 stage opera and the roadster as well as in the 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.090
 last video just there it was just kill 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.459
 confirmed and also made more sense 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.170
 because the laptop stops there the dog tags 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.459
 you have left all of them behind 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.400
 was able to gather and be real quick 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.410
 But in the team has made deathmatch 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.050
 it does not make much sense because you stop 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.400
 only 25 points gets away with a mushroom 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.280
 which I find quite stupid im 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.170
 team deathmatch so that's why it does 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.360
 more sense to use the optis so 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.980
 the blackbird where you stop then too 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.480
 through this killstreaks only his kids 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.430
 but if you do it with the 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.920
 Weapon again gets 100 points 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.690
 I want it just as well regulated 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.430
 So I think the team deathmatch could 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.620
 At least for everyone, just kill 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.350
 100 points credited to be 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.360
 scores pixum just somehow still 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.940
 reach regularly recently 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.290
 that's why it should be in the interface 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.840
 just still be killstreak because 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.040
 kills the only thing is what you do in the team 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.519
 deathmatch can still do that 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.320
 because there is no objective and there is 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.239
 yes here's the epic church with the 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.710
 shotgun which is pretty cool, too 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.760
 pretty annoying when you look at yourself 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.590
 used 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.670
 almost as annoying as the sniper but that 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.350
 is another topic about me 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.800
 time to complain in another video 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.750
 will 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.790
 So I'm definitely mine 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.960
 for watching the finals I believe 30 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.030
 3 not really amazing but i think so 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.370
 thank you very much for watching 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.700
 please listen to the video and yes again 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.700
 see
