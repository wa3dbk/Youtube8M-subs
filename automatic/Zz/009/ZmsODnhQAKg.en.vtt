00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
hi I'm Rachel for expert village now I'm

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.030 
hi I'm Rachel for expert village now I'm
going<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.230> show<00:00:04.290> you<00:00:04.440> how<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.650> melt<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.009> sugar

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
going to show you how to melt the sugar

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.110 
going to show you how to melt the sugar
I'm<00:00:05.850> going<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.029> take<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.420> half<00:00:06.600> cup<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:06.870> sugar

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
I'm going to take the half cup of sugar

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.720 
I'm going to take the half cup of sugar
turn<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.360> fire<00:00:09.780> into<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.320> medium<00:00:11.099> sized<00:00:11.370> not<00:00:11.700> a

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
turn the fire into a medium sized not a

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.079 
turn the fire into a medium sized not a
high<00:00:11.969> side<00:00:12.980> we're<00:00:13.980> going<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.160> put<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.759> half

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
high side we're going to put the half

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:24.170 
high side we're going to put the half
cup<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.360> sugar<00:00:15.859> and<00:00:17.990> melt<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:22.519> if<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:23.730> put<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.060> on

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
cup of sugar and melt it if we put it on

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.939 
cup of sugar and melt it if we put it on
a<00:00:24.210> high<00:00:24.920> fire<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.279> might<00:00:26.609> burn<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.869> we<00:00:28.800> don't

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
a high fire it might burn and we don't

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.170 
a high fire it might burn and we don't
want<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:30.019> so<00:00:32.719> the<00:00:33.719> fire<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.380> medium<00:00:35.180> and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
want that so the fire is on medium and

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.240 
want that so the fire is on medium and
we're<00:00:36.450> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.800> wait<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.250> melt<00:00:40.250> while

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
we're going to wait for it to melt while

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.150 
we're going to wait for it to melt while
it's<00:00:41.520> melting<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.899> we're<00:00:43.079> going<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.320> take<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
it's melting so we're going to take the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.000 
it's melting so we're going to take the
Nats<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:45.360> we<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.079> peeled<00:00:46.500> up<00:00:46.649> already

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
Nats that we that I peeled up already

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.420 
Nats that we that I peeled up already
and<00:00:47.250> cut<00:00:48.090> them<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:49.110> half<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.890> need<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> sharp

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and cut them in half you need a sharp

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.340 
and cut them in half you need a sharp
knife<00:00:50.600> otherwise<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:51.780> going<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.140> very

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
knife otherwise it's going to be very

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.770 
knife otherwise it's going to be very
difficult

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.910 

very<00:01:01.590> small<00:01:02.149> and<00:01:03.149> hard<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:05.060> doesn't<00:01:06.920> take

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
very small and hard but it doesn't take

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.359 
very small and hard but it doesn't take
too<00:01:08.190> much<00:01:08.310> effort<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:09.330> cut<00:01:09.690> it<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.960> half<00:01:10.369> you

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
too much effort to cut it in half you

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.130 
too much effort to cut it in half you
can<00:01:11.580> see<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:15.060> takes<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.420> little<00:01:15.600> bit<00:01:15.720> longer<00:01:15.960> for

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
can see it takes a little bit longer for

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.770 
can see it takes a little bit longer for
the<00:01:16.409> sugar<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:17.300> melt<00:01:18.440> because<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.950> they

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
the sugar to melt because the they

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.539 
the sugar to melt because the they
mention<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.869> again<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.290> fire<00:01:22.530> has<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.890> be<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.490> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
mention it again the fire has to be on a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.999 
mention it again the fire has to be on a
medium<00:01:24.060> heat<00:01:26.570> because<00:01:27.570> otherwise<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.710> going

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
medium heat because otherwise it's going

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.700 
medium heat because otherwise it's going
to<00:01:29.100> burn<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:29.970> sugar<00:01:30.470> too<00:01:31.470> quickly<00:01:31.830> as<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:34.560> can

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
to burn the sugar too quickly as you can

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.870 
to burn the sugar too quickly as you can
see<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.340> sugar<00:01:35.700> started<00:01:36.179> to<00:01:36.330> melt<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:40.880> once

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
see the sugar started to melt and once

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.740 
see the sugar started to melt and once
it's<00:01:42.479> all<00:01:42.990> melted<00:01:43.880> we<00:01:44.880> need<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.179> bring<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.569> to<00:01:45.720> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
it's all melted we need to bring it to a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:56.740 
it's all melted we need to bring it to a
boil<00:01:50.569> to<00:01:51.569> get<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:53.250> final<00:01:53.850> results<00:01:54.619> which<00:01:55.619> is

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
boil to get the final results which is

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:06.060 
boil to get the final results which is
getting<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.869> into<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.259> caramel<00:01:59.960> color

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.270 

until<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.369> sugar<00:02:07.610> melts<00:02:08.740> we're<00:02:09.740> going<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:09.979> mix

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
until the sugar melts we're going to mix

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.050 
until the sugar melts we're going to mix
it<00:02:10.520> up<00:02:10.640> but<00:02:11.360> once<00:02:11.720> it's<00:02:12.080> all<00:02:12.470> melted<00:02:13.220> we're

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
it up but once it's all melted we're

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.850 
it up but once it's all melted we're
going<00:02:14.240> to<00:02:14.300> stop<00:02:14.569> mixing<00:02:15.020> it<00:02:15.170> up<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.530> let<00:02:15.830> it

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
going to stop mixing it up and let it

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.150 
going to stop mixing it up and let it
boil<00:02:16.600> let<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:17.720> get<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.959> get<00:02:18.290> into<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.680> boiling

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
boil let it get it get into a boiling

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.229 
boil let it get it get into a boiling
point<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:23.239> can<00:02:23.450> see<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.780> all<00:02:24.020> melted<00:02:24.560> now<00:02:25.239> and

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
point you can see it all melted now and

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.250 
point you can see it all melted now and
I'm<00:02:26.360> going<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:26.600> stop<00:02:26.989> mixing<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:28.390> just<00:02:29.390> gonna

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
I'm going to stop mixing it just gonna

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:40.830 
I'm going to stop mixing it just gonna
let<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.530> boil

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:03:21.600 

you

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.130 

we<00:03:22.610> turn<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.420> flame<00:03:23.810> now<00:03:24.080> into<00:03:24.830> a<00:03:24.860> high

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
we turn it the flame now into a high

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:35.680 
we turn it the flame now into a high
into<00:03:27.140> high<00:03:27.350> and<00:03:28.300> wait<00:03:29.300> for<00:03:29.570> it<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.720> boil<00:03:33.190> as<00:03:34.690> you

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
into high and wait for it to boil as you

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.590 
into high and wait for it to boil as you
can<00:03:35.900> see<00:03:36.200> it's<00:03:36.500> boiling<00:03:36.860> now<00:03:37.360> we're<00:03:38.360> going<00:03:38.540> to

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
can see it's boiling now we're going to

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.980 
can see it's boiling now we're going to
add<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:39.140> we're<00:03:39.590> going<00:03:39.710> to<00:03:39.770> put<00:03:39.950> inside<00:03:40.340> the

add the we're going to put inside the
the<00:03:41.990> nuts<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:45.520> let<00:03:46.520> it<00:03:46.550> boil<00:03:47.020> together<00:03:49.600> just<00:03:50.600> a

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
the nuts and let it boil together just a

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.230 
the nuts and let it boil together just a
little<00:03:50.900> bit<00:03:52.870> too<00:03:53.870> close<00:03:54.050> the<00:03:54.260> fire<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:55.240> we're

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
little bit too close the fire and we're

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.240 
little bit too close the fire and we're
going<00:03:56.390> to<00:03:56.450> take<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:58.180> nuts<00:03:59.180> out<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.980> put<00:04:00.980> it<00:04:01.070> on

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
going to take the nuts out and put it on

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.840 
going to take the nuts out and put it on
a<00:04:01.310> baking<00:04:01.520> sheet<00:04:03.010> separate<00:04:04.010> it<00:04:04.190> if<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.640> nuts

a baking sheet separate it if the nuts

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.650 
a baking sheet separate it if the nuts
are<00:04:05.180> going<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.530> be<00:04:06.530> together<00:04:07.490> then<00:04:08.450> they're

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
are going to be together then they're

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.630 
are going to be together then they're
