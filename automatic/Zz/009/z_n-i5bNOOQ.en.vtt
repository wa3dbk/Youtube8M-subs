so<00:02:57.180> yeah<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:58.650> reason<00:02:58.920> why<00:02:59.040> we're<00:02:59.190> actually

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
so yeah the reason why we're actually

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.720

opening up to 360 is where the ps4
doesn't<00:03:03.510> seem<00:03:03.660> like<00:03:03.780> there's<00:03:03.930> anything<00:03:04.110> else

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
doesn't seem like there's anything else

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.940 
doesn't seem like there's anything else
in<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.760> no<00:03:05.760> for<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.000> Wii<00:03:06.120> U<00:03:06.329> I<00:03:06.709> would<00:03:07.709> assume

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
in it no for the Wii U I would assume

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.319 
in it no for the Wii U I would assume
for<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.280> 2d<00:03:08.519> as<00:03:08.610> it's<00:03:08.820> just<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:09.060> manual<00:03:11.239> for<00:03:12.239> the

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
for the 2d as it's just a manual for the

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.020 
for the 2d as it's just a manual for the
ps3<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:13.130> xbox360<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.489> can<00:03:14.640> actually<00:03:14.730> gear

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
ps3 and xbox360 you can actually gear

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.870 
ps3 and xbox360 you can actually gear
stuff<00:03:15.209> in<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:16.310> we're<00:03:17.310> assuming<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.670> it

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
stuff in it so we're assuming that it
