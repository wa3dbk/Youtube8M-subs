we said you can do up to five coats if
you<00:01:52.799> want<00:01:53.030> here's<00:01:54.030> what<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.329> Venetian

it it's got lots of texture lots of
depth<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.340> still<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.880> flat<00:02:00.600> non<00:02:01.020> glossy

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
depth but it's still a flat non glossy

depth but it's still a flat non glossy
finish<00:02:02.430> no<00:02:02.850> over<00:02:03.149> here<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.350> what<00:02:04.500> it

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
finish no over here this is what it

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.410 
finish no over here this is what it
looks<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.799> after<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:05.640> been<00:02:05.820> burnished

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
looks like after it's been burnished

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.669 
looks like after it's been burnished
it's<00:02:06.719> nice<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.140> shiny<00:02:07.409> oh<00:02:08.959> it<00:02:09.959> does<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.379> feels

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
it's nice and shiny oh it does it feels

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.710 
it's nice and shiny oh it does it feels
really<00:02:10.950> nice<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:11.580> love<00:02:11.970> it

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720

really nice I just love it
the<00:02:13.710> first<00:02:13.950> step<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.430> burnishing

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
the first step in this burnishing

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.510 
the first step in this burnishing
process<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.720> take<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:16.170> real<00:02:16.680> high<00:02:17.250> grit

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
process is to take a real high grit

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.780 
process is to take a real high grit
sandpaper<00:02:17.760> 400<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.630> 600<00:02:19.290> grit<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:20.580> what

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
sandpaper 400 to 600 grit and what

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.610 
sandpaper 400 to 600 grit and what
you're<00:02:20.910> gonna<00:02:21.030> do<00:02:21.240> is<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:21.540> rush<00:02:21.990> rock<00:02:22.470> off

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
you're gonna do is just rush rock off

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.010 
you're gonna do is just rush rock off
the<00:02:22.740> surface<00:02:23.070> just<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.340> little<00:02:23.640> bit<00:02:23.840> just<00:02:24.840> to

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
the surface just a little bit just to

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.170 
the surface just a little bit just to
raise<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.230> little<00:02:25.680> bit<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:25.920> dust<00:02:26.130> wipe<00:02:26.970> off<00:02:27.150> a

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
raise a little bit of dust wipe off a

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.000 
raise a little bit of dust wipe off a
dust<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.750> then<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.290> just<00:02:28.440> take<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.620> taking

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
dust and then you just take a taking

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.050 
dust and then you just take a taking
knife<00:02:29.160> for<00:02:29.400> our<00:02:29.490> trowel

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
knife for our trowel

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.550 
knife for our trowel
we're<00:02:30.360> gonna<00:02:30.450> hold<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.780> real<00:02:30.960> flat<00:02:31.260> against

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
we're gonna hold it real flat against

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.920 
we're gonna hold it real flat against
the<00:02:31.620> surface<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.310> rubbing<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.300> in<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.630> circular

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
the surface and rubbing it in a circular

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.960 
the surface and rubbing it in a circular
motion<00:02:34.350> not<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.950> swiping<00:02:35.400> motion<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.850> we

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
motion not the swiping motion that we

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.500 
motion not the swiping motion that we
did<00:02:36.180> before<00:02:36.630> what<00:02:37.440> you're<00:02:37.590> looking<00:02:37.950> for<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.610> to

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
did before what you're looking for is to

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.750 
did before what you're looking for is to
create<00:02:39.810> some<00:02:39.990> friction<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.770> make<00:02:41.280> some<00:02:41.490> heat

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
create some friction that make some heat

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.880 
create some friction that make some heat
that<00:02:42.000> pulls<00:02:42.300> out<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.870> shiny<00:02:43.230> marble<00:02:43.560> like

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
that pulls out the shiny marble like

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.800 
that pulls out the shiny marble like
surface<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.550> you're<00:02:44.640> looking<00:02:44.940> for<00:02:45.150> words<00:02:45.540> of

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
surface that you're looking for words of

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.440 
surface that you're looking for words of
advice<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.560> would<00:02:46.590> say<00:02:46.790> get<00:02:47.790> all<00:02:47.910> your<00:02:48.030> friends

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
advice I would say get all your friends

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.140 
advice I would say get all your friends
over<00:02:48.660> here<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.680> goes<00:02:49.860> faster<00:02:50.430> cuz<00:02:50.910> it's<00:02:51.060> a

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
over here so it goes faster cuz it's a

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.580 
over here so it goes faster cuz it's a
lot<00:02:51.300> of<00:02:51.420> work<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.690> got<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.840> press<00:02:52.110> hard<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.470> get

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
lot of work you got a press hard to get

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.620 
lot of work you got a press hard to get
some<00:02:52.770> good<00:02:52.920> friction<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.490> get<00:02:54.240> enough<00:02:54.420> heat

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
some good friction and get enough heat

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.670 
some good friction and get enough heat
there<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.110> really<00:02:55.730> pull<00:02:56.730> out<00:02:56.880> that<00:02:57.180> glass<00:02:57.680> but

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
there to really pull out that glass but

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.800 
there to really pull out that glass but
that<00:02:58.890> gives<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.130> an<00:02:59.220> idea<00:02:59.280> how<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.810> Venetian

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
that gives you an idea how to Venetian

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.790 
that gives you an idea how to Venetian
plaster<00:03:00.990> a<00:03:01.380> wall<00:03:01.680> right<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.160> your<00:03:02.280> own<00:03:02.430> home
