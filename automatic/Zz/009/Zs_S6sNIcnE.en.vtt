00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:04.869
 Now as a gaming situation casino luck has luck playing 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.489
 the second sentence but if we have one here 

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:09.389
 in the 1 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.709
 Now the player has to say strong to stop it 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.499
 sometimes it is sunny too 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.409
 Franken and yet say so 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:18.839
 he overlooked something once happened 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.399
 in the other variant a break after each round and the player has to say 

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:24.189
 continue 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.569
 begins with the next round 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.229
 in Wengern Allof 's arrangement 1 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.269
 indecent 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.510
 »Continue game I won stop says or 2 and keep telling it 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.700
 in which one loses more money if one is addicted to gambling addiction 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.220
 and continue playing despite losing 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.220
 which in my arms more than a third of the people 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.250
 who thinks at 1 recycle more money 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.450
 who means more money with two Taliban 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.840
 OK 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.650
 and now start again at 1 in front 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.100
 So we have the reflex reflex and that pulls reflex 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.620
 Jahn yesterday, the one word already explains something 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.110
 and that two derives from the English 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.770
 Chi price cheap 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.539
 and so I could bring in the little variant 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:13.700
 where I am this 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.540
 The pun has created travel many years ago and there is one deep 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.000
 and the other was deep that was still in America 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.060
 now I have time 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.830
 on both laws 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.770
 the CBF Lex is derived from him 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.070
 one does 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.650
 Hann in nature know 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.650
 and she has her pitfalls 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.070
 so 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.300
 we have 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.970
 and she has her little chicks and they're screaming Ette Cheep Cheep Cheep 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.660
 Cheep 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.030
 and then if you do not give it as we see it then we mean it 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.030
 the chicks perceive him during this term, and so on 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.450
 She knows that she is her dear little and then just the mother 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.600
 Reflex Lovers in house 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.360
 if but when the dear little 1er and a mistake can not be in 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.910
 Beijing Maren then will be her now at least 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.830
 Failure may even kill you 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.030
 back for a long time 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.250
 would not be a helix or a chick what i can do what it needs to do 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.700
 to make herself felt because she might be at 10 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.399
 but not a dumb one 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.909
 because she is only ancient recognizes 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:23.629
 and this has been found out by taking the mortal enemy name 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.149
 a kind of skunk 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.319
 Zulehner has been translated into skunk in the new translation 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.509
 Today's main job is like never before 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:34.939
 Today's main rehearsal is the number I hope we have enough ahead 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.899
 t-mobile is convincing is completely new revised I have minorities 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:42.239
 since years poisoned the Sony works completely revised beautifully 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.189
 made 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.629
 and datasets the most savvy 4 in the old version of this picture is looking for 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:48.969
 from what they want 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:50.619
 Wear Emanuela 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:53.179
 this animal is united death 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:55.090
 death unites these hangings 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.469
 and now stuffed on a small one 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.180
 I dare to find small wheels and put a tape recorder in it 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.939
 and bytes makes this ETSC Tietje 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.409
 and then you do not pull him by the odds 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.870
 and that makes her she has fear of death united No she goes her way in 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.139
 the mother 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.449
 and that's the deeper flex 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:19.939
 We talked about other data migration from yesterday 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.929
 Nature has not been invented by humans, we are first 40 years old 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:25.769
 Years have come on how that works 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.249
 that is, nature takes Thuringia a small trigger Reflexes BFD then 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:31.269
 for the whole 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.679
 in the weather do not expect that one 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:37.739
 Psychologist comes on power to manage such a shit in ziethen end of webciety 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.179
 Of course she is a judge 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:43.640
 There are many many examples of this in the animal world 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.640
 the best known is probably the plaster on itself 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.409
 Who does not say cleaner fish? 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:51.419
 OK 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.929
 So now a big fish one, according to Phillies with big beautiful teeth 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:59.689
 and now usually smaller fish scavenger cells 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.859
 this is his supper 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.739
 if the little raven is a cleaner fish it is called certain characteristics 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.080
 whom the great recognizes 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.469
 that a process is not 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.430
 at the same time perform and remain unable in a death cell 

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:18.259
 and "The Confederation" said Judge Marquess can because there are all sorts of possible 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:21.350
 Things out of which the other parasites are experiencing 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.669
 and that disturb the big fish 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.669
 and if he is withdrawn then he is always closed 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:31.169
 The Confederation then got me inside of the campaign throughout the campaign 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.999
 abklappern so that was only when one more time comes »says 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:35.029
 that on 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:37.150
 until the owner of five said so 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.599
 So a rope of duty would not be economically feasible 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.680
 Now there's Mimikri 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.809
 There are very sophisticated animals 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:47.559
 who with their now the covenant to fish 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:50.899
 they send the signal that the process i think there were not any 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.390
 long journeys destroying the rest may result in the selection of sweet ones 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:56.870
 Stader surrounded 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.039
 and use this effect but it happens too rarely 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.039
 it is called image evolution has not done anything about it 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.260
 As a rule, cleaner fish are cleaner fish and rarely are they 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.989
 pretend and if that works and then unloads in deep 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.409
 that is, on a single signal Zack then comes a behavioral repertoire 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:17.120
 mother 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.800
 with on unwound 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.750
 and now scientists are also asking questions 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.469
 so there are buttons we can push 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.569
 and then something goes off 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.569
 Well, the one hammer of the green, he is cheap reflex 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.480
 Many people buy special offers or special offers 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.710
 That's why a good supermarket has some special offers every week 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.509
 the ISTAF was taken to the defense from normal shelf 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.009
 during a kita and shaken 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:46.110
 reburied 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.449
 Stening now with that in the way 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.430
 then comes a box in the special offer of the week 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.559
 and then people are attacking 

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:58.119
 Darth ZAM rapid studies given the end of RTL or Sat 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:00.040
 but as 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.819
 Barrel sends right 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.369
 because you can see right 

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:04.719
 is confessed 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:07.830
 like people the same product the day before 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.949
 Klose foul commit 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:12.889
 sometimes you even said 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.169
 have you seen it aggravate 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:17.949
 and the day after 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:19.319
 tender offer 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:23.740
 or next week and in part, the same people are grabbing Empirix themes 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:25.800
 there are all very deep 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.539
 until 6 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:29.210
 cheap cheap is good 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.770
 So that's why we go at the push of a button 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.050
 That's why we go at the push of a button 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.180
 This is the title of the lecture that we did 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.330
 drive now comes the very exciting you would like to know 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.189
 how the Chinese brainwashing works 

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:47.189
 not that she's here with her title 

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:51.559
 or should I dismiss 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:56.879
 So it has been explored is incredibly exciting 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:59.269
 in the Korean War are American soldiers
