that helped me maintain

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.220 
that helped me maintain
I<00:01:32.310> think<00:01:32.760> that<00:01:32.970> people<00:01:33.210> don't<00:01:33.480> always<00:01:33.720> expect

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
I think that people don't always expect

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.170 
I think that people don't always expect
to<00:01:34.290> see<00:01:34.560> different<00:01:35.100> types<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.520> crops<00:01:35.820> and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
to see different types of crops and

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.080 
to see different types of crops and
seems<00:01:36.680> most<00:01:37.680> conservatories<00:01:38.490> certainly<00:01:38.880> have

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
seems most conservatories certainly have

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.720 
seems most conservatories certainly have
a<00:01:39.120> display<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.600> flowers<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.500> selection<00:01:41.160> we

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
a display of flowers and selection we

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.450 
a display of flowers and selection we
incorporate<00:01:42.420> seeds<00:01:42.720> into<00:01:43.110> our<00:01:43.470> plant<00:01:43.830> so<00:01:44.160> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
incorporate seeds into our plant so the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.640 
incorporate seeds into our plant so the
show<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.910> ever-changing<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:46.320> that's

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.990
