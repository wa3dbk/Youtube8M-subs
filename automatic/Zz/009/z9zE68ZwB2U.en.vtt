 uncensored there is so much 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.790
 garbage in there and I'll just pick it up 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.920
 get everything out of there and ok 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.170
 here is a semesterticket and mine 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.290
 organ donor card is very important in it 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.909
 a used single ticket for the city 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.259
 Chemnitz an empty eyeglasses cleaning cloth 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.880
 my next appointment with the benefit 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:42.930
 braubach very important to my library 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.990
 map and rating papers from the body 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.119
 shop and then have a large part here 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.649
 Let's have a nice one by Rossmann 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.600
 This is currently the weather 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:57.000
 very important then my headphones 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.290
 are in ear headphones from the devil that is 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.520
 the areal fidelity model and that have 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.409
 me because that's a bit better 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.110
 I have the headphones here in the 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.330
 protection of the pack in it so I do not 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.340
 so break and that's just how it works 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.870
 small in-ear headphones because I find 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.400
 for the subway 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.870
 the iphone headphones are not that good 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.099
 because there you have it this way extremely loud 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.680
 and that's just not good for 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.080
 the ears then a hand cream and indeed 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:31.650
 is that the fans saw winter hand cancer 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:33.810
 21 winter hand cream 21 antibacterial 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.640
 and caring and I have the handbag 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.489
 thinks because I thought that is 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.680
 practically there I have the quasi that 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.610
 its vice saved so I'm I 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.620
 actually quite happy 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.290
 then here is my diary in it 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.310
 for 2015 so my planner is fontaine 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.709
 new and the design is by maria carlo 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.450
 zotti kalu uche 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.299
 yes definitely a flower design 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.920
 a pair of gloves green gloves the 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.319
 are from hotel two years ago or 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.970
 such a shipment is there a package note 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.010
 pick up the parcel at the same time 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.269
 after a hand cream 2 I would have 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.640
 not really needed that is the 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.629
 old with strict hensler of kiels the 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.829
 is extremely good but was a handbag 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.590
 I still found my wallet 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:19.560
 and that is that this goal of putin 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.030

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.310
 that has a golden outside 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.389
 that was very important to me because if 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.940
 my wallets are not that way 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.919
 close, then I lose everything 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.750
 and I like to do that because gatti 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.040

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.010

 It does not work and I want 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.959
