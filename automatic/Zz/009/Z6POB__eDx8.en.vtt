what<00:00:25.590> makes<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:25.980> very<00:00:26.400> very<00:00:26.609> unique<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.630> once

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
what makes this very very unique is once

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.859 
what makes this very very unique is once
the<00:00:28.800> shallow<00:00:29.099> large<00:00:29.460> arbor<00:00:29.849> school<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.810> is

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the shallow large arbor school this is

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.139 
the shallow large arbor school this is
going<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.170> help<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.529> what<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.279> does<00:00:32.579> which<00:00:33.000> is

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
going to help on what this does which is

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.580 
going to help on what this does which is
cast<00:00:33.510> bar<00:00:34.910> super<00:00:35.910> slow<00:00:36.180> oscillation<00:00:36.989> this

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
cast bar super slow oscillation this

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.940 
cast bar super slow oscillation this
really<00:00:37.980> has<00:00:38.129> super<00:00:38.579> slow<00:00:38.790> 5<00:00:39.120> oscillation

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
really has super slow 5 oscillation

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.369 
really has super slow 5 oscillation
which<00:00:41.000> means<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.180> takes<00:00:42.329> 50<00:00:42.870> turns<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.260> that

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
which means it takes 50 turns of that

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.410 
which means it takes 50 turns of that
rotor<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.489> spool<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.820> go<00:00:45.030> up<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.329> down

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
rotor for that spool to go up and down

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.650 
rotor for that spool to go up and down
once<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.710> aides<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.520> keeping<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.390> line

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
once so that aides and keeping that line

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.840 
once so that aides and keeping that line
nice<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:48.930> tight<00:00:49.289> together<00:00:49.469> lay<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.550> line<00:00:50.820> by

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
nice and tight together lay it line by

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.740 
nice and tight together lay it line by
line<00:00:51.120> comes<00:00:51.989> off<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.350> reel<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.530> way<00:00:52.890> so

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
line comes off the reel that way so

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.420 
line comes off the reel that way so
really<00:00:54.750> really<00:00:55.020> nice<00:00:55.199> feature<00:00:58.070> from<00:00:59.070> there<00:00:59.280> we

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
really really nice feature from there we

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.439 
really really nice feature from there we
got<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> autograph<00:01:00.120> CI<00:01:00.539> four<00:01:00.989> which<00:01:01.859> is

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
got the autograph CI four which is

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.910 
got the autograph CI four which is
basically<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.570> carbon<00:01:03.899> CI<00:01:04.229> for<00:01:04.530> carbon

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
basically a carbon CI for carbon

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.170 
basically a carbon CI for carbon

steel one-piece wire but the super slow
oscillation<00:01:40.280> on<00:01:40.399> this<00:01:40.610> is<00:01:40.759> they're<00:01:40.880> super

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
oscillation on this is they're super

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.230 
oscillation on this is they're super
slow<00:01:41.450> 10<00:01:41.689> so<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.530> hundred<00:01:42.950> turns<00:01:43.460> of<00:01:43.729> that<00:01:43.909> rotor

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
slow 10 so a hundred turns of that rotor

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.480 
slow 10 so a hundred turns of that rotor
but<00:01:45.020> that's<00:01:45.170> cool<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.560> go<00:01:45.679> up<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:45.979> down<00:01:46.130> so<00:01:46.340> as

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
but that's cool to go up and down so as

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.969 
but that's cool to go up and down so as
you<00:01:46.640> can<00:01:46.759> see<00:01:46.899> it<00:01:47.899> looks<00:01:48.170> almost<00:01:48.469> like<00:01:48.709> it's

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
you can see it looks almost like it's

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.669 
you can see it looks almost like it's
barely<00:01:49.340> moving<00:01:49.579> and<00:01:50.509> that's<00:01:50.929> just<00:01:51.229> impeccable

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
barely moving and that's just impeccable

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.800 
barely moving and that's just impeccable
line<00:01:52.159> leg<00:01:52.429> so<00:01:52.939> it's<00:01:53.090> coming<00:01:53.360> off<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.630> real

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
line leg so it's coming off the real

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.539 
line leg so it's coming off the real
that<00:01:54.049> way<00:01:54.280> easy

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549
