essentially a kid bash of the astray red
frame<00:01:00.640> Kai<00:01:00.910> and<00:01:01.149> the<00:01:01.270> striped<00:01:01.600> Anwar<00:01:01.930> with<00:01:02.440> the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
change of colors and personally I think

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:05.910

the<00:01:04.659> result<00:01:04.989> is<00:01:05.079> greater<00:01:05.290> than<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.710> sum<00:01:05.860> of

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
the result is greater than the sum of

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.480
