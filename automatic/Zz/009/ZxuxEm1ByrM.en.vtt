so I just thought I'd cannot go through
that<00:00:18.240> quite<00:00:18.600> separately<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.770> I'm<00:00:20.670> using<00:00:21.000> this

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
that quite separately so I'm using this

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.560 
that quite separately so I'm using this
Pathan<00:00:22.080> here<00:00:22.490> so<00:00:23.490> it's<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:25.939> ec1000<00:00:26.939> lltv

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
these head hold signal transceiver so

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.770 
these head hold signal transceiver so
I've<00:01:10.030> seen<00:01:10.270> those<00:01:10.420> gate<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:13.210> we've<00:01:13.360> got<00:01:13.570> the

posted recently so what I've done here

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.550 
posted recently so what I've done here
is<00:01:57.229> this<00:01:58.250> guitar<00:01:59.250> strip<00:01:59.670> here<00:01:59.970> I<00:02:00.869> played<00:02:01.410> an

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
is this guitar strip here I played an

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.320 
is this guitar strip here I played an
order<00:02:01.800> EQ<00:02:02.220> often<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:02.970> what<00:02:03.119> with<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
order EQ often so this is what with the

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.999 
order EQ often so this is what with the
past<00:02:03.539> on<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> black<00:02:04.430> as<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.729> was<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:07.560> know<00:02:07.649> as<00:02:07.830> it

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
past on a black as it was you know as it

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:21.610 
past on a black as it was you know as it
was<00:02:08.130> recorded<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.880> is<00:02:08.940> how<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.149> sounded

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.820 

I<00:02:21.670> mean<00:02:22.670> well<00:02:23.599> that's<00:02:23.750> not<00:02:23.900> overly<00:02:24.230> gamey<00:02:24.440> it's

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
I mean well that's not overly gamey it's

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.410 
I mean well that's not overly gamey it's
um<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.520> doesn't<00:02:25.760> sound<00:02:25.849> like<00:02:26.030> great<00:02:26.209> to<00:02:26.239> be

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
um it doesn't sound like great to be

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.410 
um it doesn't sound like great to be
fair<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:27.680> then<00:02:29.349> what<00:02:30.349> I've<00:02:30.500> done<00:02:30.680> here<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:32.120> you

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
fair and then what I've done here is you

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.020 
fair and then what I've done here is you
know<00:02:32.510> specifically<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.140> same<00:02:33.410> attraction

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
know specifically the same attraction

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.220 
know specifically the same attraction
transacting<00:02:35.030> right<00:02:36.069> it's<00:02:37.069> just<00:02:37.130> a<00:02:37.340> matter<00:02:37.550> of

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
transacting right it's just a matter of

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.449 
transacting right it's just a matter of
syncopation<00:02:41.890> beat<00:02:42.890> you

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
syncopation beat you

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.790 
syncopation beat you

see that you're head of the sort it

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.720 
see that you're head of the sort it
looked<00:02:51.110> quite<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.380> lot<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.650> lower<00:02:51.860> end<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.700> just

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
looked quite a lot the lower end so just

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.190
