00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.490
 good morning people giving continuity then 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.529
 our training technique 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.900
 we already did the part we showed how 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.090
 is built as a smoker in the refrigerator 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.990
 we show how the effect 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.160
 prepared can to saw and now 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.220
 we will show how we 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.410
 Ignite this to do training 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.230
 You can see here we already have 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.310
 some prepared songs 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.599
 we have a canopy and a rib there and 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.090
 a pork belly 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.399
 In this case it would be bacon but it is 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.320
 without skin 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.250
 so now I'm going to show you how it is 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:51.840
 what are we going to do? 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:58.289
 the firing of the fire took a piece of 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.690
 small paper mounts ellis format 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.100
 shell like this 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.100
 we put it here in the hole of the can 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:14.100
 from the bottom up here we can 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.409
 observe any other there but we try 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.670
 a little oil can be time to eat 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.979
 even cooking oil 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.110
 simply so it does not catch combustion 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.170
 quickly the oil will keep the fire 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.990
 on and will burn the paper slowly 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:37.040
 until he had fire in the hand can be 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.840
 little alcohol and we do not want 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.409
 simply to give a small 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.409
 combustion 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.230
 we give him time to catch 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.720
 well the fire 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.820
 He can see that he's calling her. 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.280
 here and already coming out 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:16.290
 then it will burn all this part of the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.270
 middle of the can be with this burning 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.300
 He leaves a little more fire at the beginning. 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.330
 after it can be set on fire there 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.410
 so it slowly burns the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.410
 people give this time 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.050
 for him to catch fire while he 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.120
 It's burning here we can 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.170
 add it within justice 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.170
 our smoking 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:58.610
 This way it's already heating up the environment there. 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.810
 You can observe the flame is 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.500
 going up 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.700
 This is normal, she happens to stay. 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.160
 so for a period until the apple 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.230
 can be the one who after it will download 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.230
 this flame and keep your smoke 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.420
 is a very simple and easy process of 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.510
 do 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.310
 You can do in your home who does not have 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.020
 the smoker can do this within 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.630
 a barbecue provided that it is a 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.330
 shallow and the secret of hysteria 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.060
 cover the mouth of the barbecue leave 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.709
 only the entrance of the air beneath it and 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.600
 then close the part that you 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.709
 put the barbecue there you cover with 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:53.600
 some or a siding for simply 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.600
 catch is in the heat and smoke 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.060
 Then you can already see that you're already doing 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.790
 Smoke Flame Already Downloaded Now We Go 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.220
 close the smoker and then 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.840
 eight-hour process 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.650
 We are going to show you how it is that 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.650
 got this meat 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.419
 so this is it for the next video 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.650
 We'll see how this house got. 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.070
 Will you be able to try it? 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.070
 thank you
