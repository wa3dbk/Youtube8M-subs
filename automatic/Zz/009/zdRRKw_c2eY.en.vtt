00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.939
 I'll find you right away 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.280
 revoilÃ  ve for the second step therefore 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.100
 on the forum you have download the 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.729
 patch en which is included in the format 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.670
 arm and you bet at the monster 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.290

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.180
 if you want to download on our 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.580
 site it will not be necessary especially the 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.979
 decompress because when you see 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.470
 here I posted the extensions of 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.030
 files to show you 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.299
 it is a bevel so first 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.299
 step 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.350
 it will take the renowned exactly how 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.210
 iso point iso so if you do not have 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.940
 file extension will keep you 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.880
 only iso if you have an extension 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.860
 of file this will be iso focus 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.040
 then the patch fr he will have to go 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.040
 decompress 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:05.700
 what gives you that next 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.250
 so we open the file 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.289
 so I'll put it in full 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.289
 so you can find your bearings 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:21.330
 so here's all the content of the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.870
 file all or entirely so do not 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.610
 especially do not move or erase anything 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.980
 all complement each other 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.170
 so if you have the misfortune for example 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.860
 to delete this file the patch fr does 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.269
 will not walk so the iso renamed it 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.269
 will have to slide it in 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:46.769
 press double-click badge ex 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.930
 allow you have this icon that 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.470
 appears so you press everything 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:59.489
 simply on patch this is in the process 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:03.150
 to pat him right click that 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.810
 that's all, then it will be enough for you 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.549
 to transfer everything in your psp 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.239
 so once you have patch is 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.850
 your program you will need the cut 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:18.510
 then install in your psp then or 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:23.100
 in your psp simply to the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.600
 root ceulaer look well here root 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.000
 of the psp that simply means 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.290
 the first page by entering the 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.600
 memory of your psp 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.750
 so this must come from this 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.220
 way 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.319
 here's difference display it depends 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:43.350
 how will your pc of course display so 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.630
 if this iso file does not exist it will be necessary 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.739
 create it create a folder nothing 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.780
 difficult again a right click and 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.440
 record good that I teach you nothing if 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.350
 you have already used a computer 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:02.000
 so in the folder iso it will be enough for you 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.019
 simply copy the iso in 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.950
 so now I'm going to show you 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.330
 how to start your game so I cut a 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.070
 right now so now that we 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.130
 are on the menu of our psp 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:19.669
 you just have to go 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.669
 in the memory stick here 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:31.740
 and you have the iso that appears there so 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.740
 you simply click on it 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.690
 and that launches the game 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.180
 we can return that it is well 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:59.650
 functional you have to view the patch by 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:04.060
 itself see button near start and 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:07.650
 that's all so I tell you to the 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.650
 next for another
