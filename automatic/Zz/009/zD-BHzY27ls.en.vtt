newton<00:03:52.370> isn't<00:03:52.790> that<00:03:52.850> like<00:03:53.060> dual<00:03:53.360> though<00:03:53.720> it's

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
newton isn't that like dual though it's

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.660 
newton isn't that like dual though it's
like<00:03:54.640> yeah<00:03:55.640> yeah<00:03:56.500> dole<00:03:57.500> it<00:03:57.680> up<00:03:57.860> so<00:03:58.340> that's<00:03:58.519> like
