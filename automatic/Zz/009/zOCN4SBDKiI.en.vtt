00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.120
 sheet 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.940
 to me 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.660
 ah 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.660
 Y 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.590
 in its commitment to safety 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.770
 labor polpatic stony presents health 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.920
 and everyone's homework 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.460
 chapter 3 the risks of smoke 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.460
 metal 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.490
 ah 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.370
 all right 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.070
 metallic smoke is a pollutant 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.340
 chemical present in different processes 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.530
 industrial in this video we will learn 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.390
 about this polluting agent its 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.940
 features the effects on 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.010
 our body and the way to prevent 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.010
 its impacts on our health 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.299
 low 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.030
 the smoke corresponds to the suspension of 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.310
 solid particles from the 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.940
 condensation of reaction vapors 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.130
 chemical or combustion is for example in 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.930
 the welding and oxyfuel processes 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.329
 metallic smoke is composed of 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.579
 microscopic particles that 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.250
 condense and may be suspended by 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.530
 a lot of time in the air we breathe 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.539
 Its tiny size gives it the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.179
 ability to reach our system 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:03.579
 respiratory level and alveoli 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.579
 even enter the bloodstream 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.599
 It is important to emphasize that these fumes 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.790
 metallic not certain can have 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.459
 different effects on health since 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.530
 in welding fumes there are particles 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.720
 and these fumes is not true that they can 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.980
 influence the health of the worker if not 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.030
 preventive measures are observed 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.220
 adequate 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.129
 effect mainly on the roads 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.340
 respiratory diseases as effects that can 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.230
 be acute or chronic and effects 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.709
 sensitizers is worth saying that they produce 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.180
 a reaction in which the organism can 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.069
 express some kind of allergy 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.950
 another side there are also some 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.560
 effects on other organs depending 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.290
 it is not true of metallic smoke that 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.370
 use a certain value say kidneys 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.650
 liver and also has it postulated that 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.049
 there may be some carcinogenic effects 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.579
 and some pneumonitis some alveolitis 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.450
 that have to do with some of these 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.450
 as welds 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.120
 ah 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.360
 Chilean security association giving 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.240
 compliance with the law 16 thousand 744 in its 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.160
 medical surveillance program also 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.790
 protects workers who are 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.330
 exposed to metal fumes for this the 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.470
 program submits them to a urine test 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.350
 and blood according to the risk agent that 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.120
 must end of work shift 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.320
 because end of work shift because it 's 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.080
 where we get the biggest 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:45.489
 concentrations of the risk agent in 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.760
 this case chromium manganese copper and so on 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.920
 the worker exposed to a metal 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.020
 must always be with all 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.770
 protection elements and making the 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.950
 exam 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.959
 the nurse again trains and educates 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.850
 sensitizes the worker in the use of 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.970
 its production elements therefore 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.040
 the fundamental thing in this is prevention 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.130
 and prevention is making a 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.320
 control of the risk agent first in 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.250
 the work environment and the environment 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.989
 work means if I can substitute 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.600
 the element that I will occupy for the 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.530
 welding for 1 - less harmful or less 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.270
 toxic 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.470
 I try to do it if I can not do it 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.840
 I have to take some measures 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.180
 environmental controls at the source that 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.100
 they have to do fundamentally with the 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.920
 general ventilation and ventilation 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.650
 Local in the workplace where it is 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.510
 The welder also measures 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.000
 protection is not true towards one's own 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.200
 worker and in that sense the 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.390
 worker has to have a lot 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.760
 awareness that by being in contact 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.680
 with this diversity of products that 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.140
 can affect your health can not 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.770
 neglecting their protection and protection 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:56.410
 is insisting on his facial mask on 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.880
 their masks with filters and that many 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.770
 Sometimes the worker says no this is 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.710
 uncomfortable using the mask and using the 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.550
 mask but that is not causal that one 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.550
 stop worrying 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.550
 Y 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.240
 the metallic one implies great risks 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.310
 for health however the measures 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.900
 preventive measures are very effective for 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.880
 minimize the impacts of this 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.490
 pollutant in the welfare of the 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.130
 workers work in places 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.610
 ventilated implement systems 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.850
 adequate ventilation and also the use 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.850
 strict respiratory protection 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.850
 efficient
