00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
sticks which will definitely rattle and

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.630 
sticks which will definitely rattle and
it's<00:00:22.320> effective<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:22.949> it's<00:00:23.310> not<00:00:23.430> going<00:00:23.550> to

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
it's effective but it's not going to

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.429 
it's effective but it's not going to
ultimately<00:00:23.880> destroy<00:00:24.600> your<00:00:24.810> competition

take out another band the singer is the

take out another band the singer is the

band<00:00:41.640> will<00:00:42.000> fall<00:00:42.329> nothing<00:00:43.200> I've<00:00:43.290> ever<00:00:43.440> taught

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
band will fall nothing I've ever taught

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.060 
band will fall nothing I've ever taught
matter<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.280> course<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:46.320> technique<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.039> I

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
matter of course the technique that I

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.770 
matter of course the technique that I
find<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.489> most<00:00:47.550> effective<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.450> good<00:00:48.660> old

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
find the most effective is the good old

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.330 
find the most effective is the good old
dumb<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.260> dumber<00:00:49.500> trip<00:00:49.829> which<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
dumb and dumber trip which is the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.880 
dumb and dumber trip which is the
laxative<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.390> glass<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.899> water<00:00:52.170> it's

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
laxative in the glass of water it's

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.389 
laxative in the glass of water it's
undetectable<00:00:54.289> cheap<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:56.160> hundred

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
undetectable cheap and one hundred

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.000 
undetectable cheap and one hundred
percent<00:00:56.430> effect<00:00:57.500> you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.620> also<00:00:58.739> try

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
percent effect you can also try

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.220 
percent effect you can also try
distraction<00:00:59.579> techniques<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.359> getting<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
distraction techniques like getting the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.009 
distraction techniques like getting the
grandmothers<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.100> your<00:01:02.219> opposing<00:01:02.629> bands<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
grandmothers of your opposing bands to

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.800 
grandmothers of your opposing bands to
come<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.409> sit<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.010> front<00:01:05.549> row<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.090> just
