that<00:00:23.810> first<00:00:24.810> we'll<00:00:24.990> do<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.199> head<00:00:25.230> pins<00:00:25.650> I've

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
that first we'll do the head pins I've

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.370 
that first we'll do the head pins I've
got<00:00:26.279> five<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:26.670> here<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.810> I've<00:00:27.869> got<00:00:28.020> one<00:00:28.199> already

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
got five on here so I've got one already

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.939 
got five on here so I've got one already
done<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.820> shall<00:00:30.180> just<00:00:30.330> do<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:31.650> other<00:00:31.800> ones

done so I shall just do the other ones

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.340 
done so I shall just do the other ones
of<00:00:32.099> these<00:00:32.540> so<00:00:33.540> I've<00:00:33.840> got<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> four<00:00:34.200> millimeter

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
of these so I've got a four millimeter

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
of these so I've got a four millimeter

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
bead and a couple of rock eyes bend it

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.770 
bead and a couple of rock eyes bend it
over<00:00:38.700> like<00:00:38.790> we<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.090> with<00:00:39.180> all<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.480> others

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
over like we have with all the others

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.049 
over like we have with all the others
cut<00:00:40.590> off<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.890> excess<00:00:42.440> round<00:00:43.440> nose<00:00:43.649> pliers

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
cut off the excess round nose pliers

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.389 
cut off the excess round nose pliers
grip<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.239> very<00:00:45.420> end<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.960> wire<00:00:46.399> partway

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
grip the very end of the wire partway

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.040 
grip the very end of the wire partway
down<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.670> pliers<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.540> then<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:48.960> just

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
down the pliers and then it's just

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.020 
down the pliers and then it's just
bending<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.530> back<00:00:49.680> over<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.160> top<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.910> get

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
bending it back over the top you get

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.910 
bending it back over the top you get
about<00:00:51.239> half<00:00:51.480> way<00:00:51.690> round<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.530> wrist<00:00:52.739> won't

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
about half way round and the wrist won't

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.740 
about half way round and the wrist won't
go<00:00:53.070> any<00:00:53.250> further<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.789> reposition<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> pliers

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
go any further so reposition the pliers

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.560 
go any further so reposition the pliers
and<00:00:55.140> finish<00:00:55.950> off<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.789> make<00:00:56.969> sure<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.329> loops

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
and finish off and make sure that loops

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.779 
and finish off and make sure that loops
going<00:00:57.780> back<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.110> itself<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.949> touch<00:00:59.129> up<00:00:59.430> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
going back to itself to touch up to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.860 
going back to itself to touch up to
touch<00:00:59.940> back<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.270> itself<00:01:01.760> I'll<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:03.030> another<00:01:03.420> one

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
touch back to itself I'll do another one

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.709 
touch back to itself I'll do another one
like<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:06.259> again<00:01:07.259> bend<00:01:08.219> over<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> top<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:09.719 
like that again bend over the top and

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:11.389 
like that again bend over the top and
the<00:01:09.840> reason<00:01:10.139> we<00:01:10.229> do<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.649> if<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.039> didn't

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
the reason we do this is if you didn't

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.099 
the reason we do this is if you didn't
bend<00:01:11.609> over<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.029> top<00:01:12.240> before<00:01:12.389> you<00:01:12.719> cut<00:01:12.959> the

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:13.109 
bend over the top before you cut the

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:15.830 
bend over the top before you cut the
wire<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.909> made<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.240> loop<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.479> loop

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
wire and you made you loop the loop

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.539 
wire and you made you loop the loop
would<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.109> to<00:01:16.289> one<00:01:16.469> side<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.829> bit<00:01:17.099> like<00:01:17.249> a<00:01:17.279> letter

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
would be to one side a bit like a letter

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.349 
would be to one side a bit like a letter
P<00:01:18.170> whereas<00:01:19.170> by<00:01:19.590> bending<00:01:19.829> the<00:01:20.520> wire<00:01:20.729> over<00:01:21.060> first

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
P whereas by bending the wire over first

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.029 
P whereas by bending the wire over first
you<00:01:21.569> end<00:01:21.719> up<00:01:21.840> with<00:01:21.929> a<00:01:21.990> loop<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.529> middle<00:01:22.829> at

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
you end up with a loop in the middle at

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.899 
you end up with a loop in the middle at
the<00:01:23.099> top<00:01:23.219> of<00:01:23.399> the<00:01:23.609> beads<00:01:25.369> so<00:01:26.369> now<00:01:26.459> I<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.639> do

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the top of the beads so now I just do

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.629 
the top of the beads so now I just do
some<00:01:27.119> more<00:01:27.329> on<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.529> one<00:01:28.770> I've<00:01:28.920> got<00:01:29.099> three

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:29.639 
some more on this one I've got three

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:32.469 
some more on this one I've got three
rock<00:01:30.060> eyes<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.719> a<00:01:30.990> four<00:01:31.200> millimeter<00:01:31.349> bead

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
rock eyes and a four millimeter bead

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.109 
rock eyes and a four millimeter bead
again<00:01:33.479> bend<00:01:33.929> it<00:01:34.049> over<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:38.310> make<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.609> loop<00:01:38.880> on

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
again bend it over and make the loop on

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.699 
again bend it over and make the loop on
the<00:01:39.329> top<00:01:40.099> so<00:01:41.099> it's<00:01:41.219> touching<00:01:41.429> back<00:01:41.789> to<00:01:41.909> itself

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
the top so it's touching back to itself

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:48.199 
the top so it's touching back to itself
alright<00:01:43.709> last<00:01:43.979> one<00:01:46.369> these<00:01:47.369> are<00:01:47.489> Japanese<00:01:47.639> rock

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
alright last one these are Japanese rock

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:49.580 
alright last one these are Japanese rock
eyes<00:01:48.419> that<00:01:48.630> i'm<00:01:48.719> using<00:01:49.020> here<00:01:49.049> they<00:01:49.319> are<00:01:49.469> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
eyes that i'm using here they are the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.039 
eyes that i'm using here they are the
best<00:01:49.770> quality<00:01:50.509> particularly<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.689> terms<00:01:51.840> of

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
best quality particularly in terms of

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.019 
best quality particularly in terms of
consistency<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.859> the<00:01:52.889> size<00:01:56.450> trim<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.599> off

00:01:59.019 --> 00:01:59.029 
consistency of the size trim that off

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:02.929 
consistency of the size trim that off
and<00:02:00.289> make<00:02:01.289> the<00:02:01.439> loop<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.520> i've<00:02:02.579> got<00:02:02.609> five

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
and make the loop so i've got five

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.929 
and make the loop so i've got five
little<00:02:03.270> pins<00:02:03.569> there<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.799> put<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.099> there<00:02:05.340> now

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
little pins there to put on there now

these hanging hoops they come like this
all<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.679> need<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.919> do<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.039> open<00:02:08.280> them<00:02:08.459> up<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.670> it

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
all you need to do to open them up is it

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.399 
all you need to do to open them up is it
you<00:02:08.879> just<00:02:09.000> pull<00:02:09.239> them<00:02:09.360> apart<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.899> one<00:02:10.140> side

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:10.409 
you just pull them apart on one side

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.190 
you just pull them apart on one side
comes<00:02:10.769> out<00:02:11.569> so<00:02:12.569> I'm<00:02:12.629> going<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.840> start<00:02:12.930> off

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
comes out so I'm going to start off

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.480 
comes out so I'm going to start off
putting<00:02:13.469> rocailles<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.129> there

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
putting rocailles on there

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.890 
putting rocailles on there
now<00:02:15.150> I've<00:02:15.300> got<00:02:15.510> 12<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:16.230> here<00:02:16.940> if<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.180> size<00:02:18.420> 8<00:02:18.720> it

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
now I've got 12 on here if the size 8 it

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.660 
now I've got 12 on here if the size 8 it
obviously<00:02:19.020> depends<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:20.070> size<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.610> your

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
obviously depends on the size of your

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.100 
obviously depends on the size of your
hoop<00:02:22.220> as<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.430> how<00:02:23.580> many<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.880> need<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.960> get

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
hoop as to how many you need to get

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.290 
hoop as to how many you need to get
round<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.500> middle<00:02:25.800> section<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:27.090> put<00:02:27.240> the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
round to the middle section to put the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:38.840 
round to the middle section to put the
head<00:02:27.420> pins<00:02:27.690> on

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.920 

and<00:02:39.660> we<00:02:39.780> doing<00:02:40.020> then<00:02:40.170> at<00:02:40.320> six

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.589 

again<00:02:46.859> just<00:02:47.129> random<00:02:47.700> with<00:02:47.879> these<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.090> haven't

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
again just random with these I haven't

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.289 
again just random with these I haven't
got<00:02:48.689> any<00:02:48.870> particular<00:02:49.140> pattern<00:02:50.120> going<00:02:51.120> on

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
got any particular pattern going on

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.000 
got any particular pattern going on
there<00:02:51.510> I've<00:02:51.689> got<00:02:51.840> three<00:02:52.170> colors<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.620> rock<00:02:52.799> eyes

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
there I've got three colors of rock eyes

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.039 
there I've got three colors of rock eyes
that<00:02:53.280> i'm<00:02:53.400> using<00:02:55.909> 369<00:02:56.909> that's<00:02:57.180> 12<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:57.840> i'll<00:02:57.900> put

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
that i'm using 369 that's 12 so i'll put

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.830 
that i'm using 369 that's 12 so i'll put
12<00:02:58.379> on<00:02:58.560> first<00:02:59.180> then<00:03:00.180> i'm<00:03:00.329> going<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.510> put<00:03:00.629> on<00:03:00.750> the

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
12 on first then i'm going to put on the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.940 
12 on first then i'm going to put on the
shortest<00:03:01.319> one<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:02.519> my<00:03:02.700> little<00:03:02.939> head<00:03:03.060> pins<00:03:03.769> in<00:03:04.769> a

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
shortest one of my little head pins in a

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.429 
shortest one of my little head pins in a
rock<00:03:05.129> I<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:06.120> space<00:03:06.389> them<00:03:06.599> out<00:03:08.870> then<00:03:09.870> I've<00:03:10.139> got

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
rock I to space them out then I've got

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:17.420 
rock I to space them out then I've got
my<00:03:10.950> next<00:03:11.250> size<00:03:11.430> one<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:15.450> rock<00:03:15.629> I<00:03:16.219> that's<00:03:17.219> my

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
my next size one and a rock I that's my

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.000 
my next size one and a rock I that's my
third<00:03:17.639> one<00:03:17.970> which<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.359> longest<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.959> the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
third one which is the longest of the

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.539 
third one which is the longest of the
dangly<00:03:20.010> bits<00:03:20.159> that<00:03:20.400> I've<00:03:20.519> done<00:03:22.189> and<00:03:23.189> I<00:03:23.280> go<00:03:23.400> back

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
dangly bits that I've done and I go back

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.539 
dangly bits that I've done and I go back
to<00:03:23.609> a<00:03:23.790> middle<00:03:24.000> length<00:03:24.269> one<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:26.040> then<00:03:26.129> back<00:03:26.340> to

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
to a middle length one and then back to

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.000 
to a middle length one and then back to
the<00:03:26.579> short<00:03:26.879> one<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.560> then<00:03:28.560> I'll<00:03:28.680> just<00:03:28.709> going

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
the short one and then I'll just going

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.640 
the short one and then I'll just going
to<00:03:29.069> fill<00:03:29.280> up<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.549> rest<00:03:29.579> of<00:03:29.909> this<00:03:30.469> should<00:03:31.469> be

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
to fill up the rest of this should be

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:45.850 
to fill up the rest of this should be
another<00:03:31.889> 12<00:03:32.689> to<00:03:33.689> finish<00:03:34.019> off<00:03:34.169> on<00:03:34.379> this<00:03:34.530> side

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.220 

and<00:03:46.860> then<00:03:46.980> close<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.090> up<00:03:48.330> is<00:03:48.540> very<00:03:48.780> simple<00:03:49.020> it

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
and then close this up is very simple it

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.460 
and then close this up is very simple it
literally<00:03:49.560> just<00:03:49.709> pushes<00:03:50.069> back<00:03:50.280> in<00:03:51.290> from<00:03:52.290> where

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
literally just pushes back in from where

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.770 
literally just pushes back in from where
it<00:03:52.590> came<00:03:52.800> out<00:03:53.010> from<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:53.970> can<00:03:54.209> put<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.480> dab<00:03:54.750> of

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
it came out from you can put a dab of

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.199 
it came out from you can put a dab of
glue<00:03:54.930> on<00:03:55.140> it<00:03:55.290> if<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.770> prefer<00:03:55.920> but<00:03:56.819> I<00:03:56.850> tend<00:03:57.120> to

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
glue on it if you prefer but I tend to

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.170 
glue on it if you prefer but I tend to
just<00:03:57.300> crimp<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:57.870> with<00:03:57.990> the<00:03:58.080> pliers<00:03:58.970> which<00:03:59.970> I'll

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
just crimp it with the pliers which I'll

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:08.180 
just crimp it with the pliers which I'll
show<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:00.450> a<00:04:01.250> couple<00:04:02.250> more<00:04:02.610> of<00:04:02.670> these<00:04:07.190> so

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
show you a couple more of these so

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.500 
show you a couple more of these so
that's<00:04:08.340> getting<00:04:08.520> a<00:04:08.550> bit<00:04:08.610> fiddly<00:04:08.940> towards<00:04:09.420> the

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
that's getting a bit fiddly towards the

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.030 
that's getting a bit fiddly towards the
end<00:04:09.660> because<00:04:09.900> there<00:04:10.260> are<00:04:10.440> getting<00:04:10.739> close<00:04:11.010> to

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
end because there are getting close to

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.000 
end because there are getting close to
falling<00:04:11.430> off<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:12.630> one<00:04:12.870> more<00:04:13.080> I<00:04:13.290> think<00:04:13.590> we'll<00:04:13.800> do

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
falling off so one more I think we'll do

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.050 
falling off so one more I think we'll do
it<00:04:14.989> okay<00:04:15.989> so<00:04:16.950> they're<00:04:17.250> all<00:04:17.400> on<00:04:17.579> there<00:04:18.590> oops<00:04:20.060> you

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
it okay so they're all on there oops you

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.850 
it okay so they're all on there oops you
just<00:04:21.299> come<00:04:21.510> off<00:04:22.940> okay<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.240> then<00:04:24.480> I<00:04:24.750> say<00:04:25.620> all

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
just come off okay and then I say all

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.120 
just come off okay and then I say all
I'm<00:04:26.010> going<00:04:26.160> to<00:04:26.220> do<00:04:26.630> is<00:04:27.630> push<00:04:27.960> that<00:04:28.200> back<00:04:28.830> in

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
I'm going to do is push that back in

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.420 
I'm going to do is push that back in
there<00:04:29.570> from<00:04:30.570> where<00:04:30.810> it<00:04:30.930> came<00:04:31.169> as<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.710> say<00:04:31.890> can

there from where it came as to say can

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.150 
there from where it came as to say can
put<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.640> dab<00:04:32.850> of<00:04:32.880> glue<00:04:33.030> on<00:04:33.210> it<00:04:33.650> well<00:04:34.650> I<00:04:34.680> do<00:04:34.830> with

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
put a dab of glue on it well I do with

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.430 
put a dab of glue on it well I do with
the<00:04:35.280> round<00:04:35.460> nose<00:04:35.669> pliers<00:04:36.060> as<00:04:36.750> I<00:04:36.870> just<00:04:37.080> squeeze

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
the round nose pliers as I just squeeze

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.860 
the round nose pliers as I just squeeze
the<00:04:37.950> outside<00:04:38.490> of<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.030> section<00:04:39.450> that<00:04:39.479> the<00:04:39.690> why

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
the outside of the section that the why

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.380 
the outside of the section that the why
I<00:04:39.900> went<00:04:40.110> back<00:04:40.320> into<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:41.160> that<00:04:41.460> kind<00:04:41.700> of<00:04:41.760> crimps

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
I went back into and that kind of crimps

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.840 
I went back into and that kind of crimps
it<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:42.780> holds<00:04:43.500> in<00:04:43.620> place<00:04:43.650> be<00:04:44.070> quite<00:04:44.310> firm<00:04:44.610> with

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.880 
ball wire here so put the pliers inside
the<00:04:54.210> loop<00:04:54.360> twist<00:04:55.320> it<00:04:55.560> to<00:04:55.680> open<00:04:57.650> hang<00:04:58.650> that<00:04:58.830> on
