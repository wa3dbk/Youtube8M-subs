00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:09.653
 We want peace to be so that the government changes its attitude not only to the people of Donbas, but to the whole of Ukraine. 

00:00:09.653 --> 00:00:12.586
 Because it is the genocide of the whole Ukrainian people, you understand? 

00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:16.006
 Not just Donbas. We are against war! Because war ... who needs it? 

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:19.083
 What did she bring us? Make a deal! Sit at the negotiating table! 

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:25.138
 21st century! It's time to make a deal! Why can't we solve everything peacefully? 

00:00:25.138 --> 00:00:32.601
 Why do we have martial law? Why do our kids have to go to the army? Under what law? Where is? 

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:37.099
 If they want to fight, let them go alone. 

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:40.588
 We don't want our children to fight. We're all Kramatorians! 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.184
 They're coming here and we're local. 

00:00:43.184 --> 00:00:45.738
 They brought the buses here! 

00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:50.617
 I have no citizen, but here's the confirmation! I have a permanent residence here in Kramatorsk. 

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:57.857
 We're all Kramatorians, here's the confirmation. 

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:00.823
 Look, I signed up in the village of Belenkaja. 

00:01:00.823 --> 00:01:08.275
 Where is the truth? Wife with baby stays here and husband has to go to war and shoot me? Or how? 

00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:12.918
 Thousands would cost us if we weren't local! 

00:01:12.918 --> 00:01:19.201
 Our people work here. We are working the whole war! They are on Majdan and we are working! 

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:25.963
 - No one needed war! - They did not introduce martial law and began to mobilize. 

00:01:25.963 --> 00:01:28.889
 They have not introduced any martial law because no one will give them money! 

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:54.833
 Shame! ... 

00:02:17.355 --> 00:02:24.007
 Settle for peace negotiations. And really stop this fratricidal war! 

00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:31.819
 I don't want my children ... My son lives in the Donetsk region, in Makejevec. 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:41.114
 Father, mother, brother with family live in Lugano region. 

00:02:41.114 --> 00:02:44.795
 I do not want this fratricidal war to continue! 

00:02:44.795 --> 00:02:50.331
 I don't want my son going to war and then shooting his relatives! 

00:02:50.331 --> 00:03:03.344
 PEACE! PEACE! PEACE! ... We are for peace! 

00:03:03.887 --> 00:03:05.403
 Who printed it for you? 

00:03:05.403 --> 00:03:07.384
 I printed it and brought it home! 

00:03:07.384 --> 00:03:09.129
 Same to everyone? 

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:12.645
 Who's organizing your event? 

00:03:12.645 --> 00:03:14.314
 Each of us is the organizer. 

00:03:14.314 --> 00:03:16.246
 And where do you "organize" yourself? 

00:03:16.246 --> 00:03:17.812
 I printed it and brought it! 

00:03:17.812 --> 00:03:21.692
 My brother lost his leg in the war in Afghanistan! And no one needs it today! 

00:03:21.692 --> 00:03:23.310
 Please shoot as you want! 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:41.080
 "Patriots" - the war! ... 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.040
 Please tell me ... How did it all start? 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.049
 Majdan! ... 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:57.775
 DNR-sheep came and automatama and you came to us with cannons, tanks, airplanes, helicopters, you bombed Kramatorsk last year! 

00:03:57.775 --> 00:03:59.279
 And now you need us? 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:12.587
 Glory to Donbas! ...
