00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.710 
on them and I did I fill it in a couple
of<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:19.010> black<00:00:20.010> lines<00:00:20.340> with<00:00:20.640> panel<00:00:21.060> lines<00:00:21.300> I

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
of the black lines with panel lines I

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.700 
of the black lines with panel lines I
made<00:00:22.560> beef<00:00:22.830> not<00:00:23.160> translucent<00:00:24.150> anymore<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:24.840> you

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
made beef not translucent anymore so you

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.220 
made beef not translucent anymore so you
don't<00:00:25.890> see<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.310> awful<00:00:26.869> detailing<00:00:27.869> behind

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
don't see this awful detailing behind

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.470 
don't see this awful detailing behind
there<00:00:28.470> or<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> matrix<00:00:29.160> which<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.210> my<00:00:30.330> opinion

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
there or the matrix which in my opinion

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.860 
there or the matrix which in my opinion
helps<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.170> bot<00:00:31.349> mode<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:32.750> couple<00:00:33.750> little

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
helps the bot mode a couple little

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.500 
helps the bot mode a couple little
things<00:00:33.989> with<00:00:34.350> like<00:00:34.530> turn<00:00:34.800> signals<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.760> you

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
things with like turn signals and you

in<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.460> robot<00:00:48.059> mode<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:49.500> really<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:50.039> him

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
in the robot mode and I really like him

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.400 
in the robot mode and I really like him
I'm<00:00:50.550> still<00:00:50.969> thinking<00:00:51.239> about<00:00:51.539> doing<00:00:51.899> his<00:00:52.230> eyes

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
I'm still thinking about doing his eyes

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.920 
I'm still thinking about doing his eyes
though<00:00:52.800> just<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.399> they<00:00:53.910> don't<00:00:53.940> look<00:00:54.300> dead<00:00:54.570> so

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
though just so they don't look dead so

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.529 
though just so they don't look dead so
much<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:56.010> uh<00:00:56.039> yeah<00:00:56.430> there's<00:00:56.760> no<00:00:56.910> rhyme<00:00:57.120> just

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
much so uh yeah there's no rhyme just

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.670 
much so uh yeah there's no rhyme just
wanted<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.840> kind<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.079> give<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.320> guys<00:00:58.500> an

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
wanted to kind of give you guys an

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.400 
wanted to kind of give you guys an
update<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:59.010> him<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.550> another<00:01:00.359> thing<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.899> got<00:01:01.230> in

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
update on him and another thing I got in

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.770 
update on him and another thing I got in
the<00:01:01.530> middle<00:01:01.680> today<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:03.090> think<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.600> worth

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
the middle today and I think it's worth

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.190 
the middle today and I think it's worth
kind<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.790> looking<00:01:05.790> at<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.420> not<00:01:06.659> really<00:01:07.020> worth

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
kind of looking at but not really worth

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.770 
kind of looking at but not really worth
the<00:01:07.409> review<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.150> Transformers<00:01:09.150> ultimate

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the review is the Transformers ultimate

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.710 
the review is the Transformers ultimate
pop-up<00:01:10.350> universe<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:12.450> thing<00:01:12.659> is

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
pop-up universe and this thing is

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.840 
pop-up universe and this thing is
freakin<00:01:13.500> cool<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.950> thick<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.549> doesn't

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
freakin cool it's thick it doesn't

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.580 
freakin cool it's thick it doesn't
really<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> whole<00:01:15.570> bunch<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.900> content<00:01:16.409> in

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
really have a whole bunch of content in

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.490 
really have a whole bunch of content in
here<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.580> uh<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:18.150> don't<00:01:18.420> know<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.869> think<00:01:19.170> it's

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
here but uh I don't know I think it's

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.690 
here but uh I don't know I think it's
really<00:01:19.680> worth<00:01:19.799> taking<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.490> look<00:01:20.520> at<00:01:20.850> personally

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
really worth taking a look at personally

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.999 
really worth taking a look at personally
it's<00:01:23.700> really<00:01:24.150> quite<00:01:25.110> interesting<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:25.799> it

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
it's really quite interesting because it

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.969 
it's really quite interesting because it
is<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> pop-up<00:01:26.700> book<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.810> what<00:01:28.590> kind<00:01:28.829> of

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
is a pop-up book but what kind of

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.490 
is a pop-up book but what kind of
differentiates<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.180> not<00:01:30.930> every<00:01:31.290> single

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
differentiates it and not every single

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.200 
differentiates it and not every single
one<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.829> these<00:01:31.979> things<00:01:32.310> works<00:01:32.610> completely

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
one of these things works completely

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.660 
one of these things works completely
perfect<00:01:33.600> but<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.159> pull<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.549> then<00:01:36.530> yeah

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
perfect but if you pull this then yeah

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.370 
perfect but if you pull this then yeah

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
bumblebee let's see if I can get it on

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.170 
bumblebee let's see if I can get it on
camera<00:01:40.409> here<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.250> guys<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:41.729> it

hey you pull these things and you know
like<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.670> got<00:01:50.850> Bumblebee<00:01:51.390> he<00:01:51.840> just

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
like you got Bumblebee he just

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.210 
like you got Bumblebee he just
transformed<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.840> robot<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.140> then<00:01:55.830> back<00:01:56.010> to

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
transformed to a robot and then back to

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.649 
transformed to a robot and then back to
a<00:01:56.250> car<00:01:56.630> or<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:58.500> know<00:01:58.850> sideswipe<00:01:59.850> RC<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
a car or you know sideswipe RC and

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.300 
a car or you know sideswipe RC and
bulkhead<00:02:02.690> all<00:02:03.690> transforming<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.920> that's

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
bulkhead all transforming and that's
