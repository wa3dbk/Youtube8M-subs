00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.830
 One year after the death of a person 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.930
 who committed suicide that if at some point 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.540
 he made a mistake he was giving it with his 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.149
 life he paid with his life that is earned not 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.920

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.840

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.240
 You, what there is in the world does not have 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.700
 what to think or act like me 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.630
 but you put yourself on the other side if you 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.630

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.920

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.590

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.479

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.030

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.580
