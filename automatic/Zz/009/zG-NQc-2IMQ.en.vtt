sometimes<00:01:09.860> good<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.130> just<00:01:10.460> step<00:01:10.729> back<00:01:13.869> we<00:01:14.869> make

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
sometimes good to just step back we make

syringe<00:01:23.869> blunder<00:01:25.180> Sturridge<00:01:26.180> blender<00:01:26.690> brush

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
syringe blunder Sturridge blender brush

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.230 
syringe blunder Sturridge blender brush
and<00:01:27.110> then<00:01:27.140> just<00:01:28.040> under<00:01:28.399> here<00:01:28.640> when<00:01:28.880> it<00:01:28.970> touches

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
and then just under here when it touches

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.840 
and then just under here when it touches
liquid<00:01:29.840> wide<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:31.070> then<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.399> shoes<00:01:31.580> little

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
liquid wide and then the shoes little

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.580 
liquid wide and then the shoes little
crisscross<00:01:32.119> drops<00:01:32.630> again<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.080> blend<00:01:33.350> it

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
crisscross drops again and blend it

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.180 
crisscross drops again and blend it
blend<00:01:35.619> out

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.400 

so<00:01:40.790> you<00:01:40.850> can't<00:01:41.180> see<00:01:41.420> well<00:01:41.630> one<00:01:41.840> color<00:01:42.080> starts

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
so you can't see well one color starts

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:52.240 
so you can't see well one color starts
and<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.860> next<00:01:43.070> color<00:01:43.370> stops<00:01:44.410> blending<00:01:45.410> here

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.600 

so

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
so

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.030 
so
very<00:01:55.300> gently<00:01:56.200> which<00:01:56.920> go<00:01:57.190> up<00:01:57.250> in<00:01:57.430> here<00:01:59.040> blend

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
very gently which go up in here blend

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.250 
very gently which go up in here blend
these<00:02:00.280> clouds<00:02:00.730> out<00:02:01.000> slightly

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.440 

doc<00:02:06.920> killer<00:02:07.250> though<00:02:07.490> don't<00:02:07.760> blend<00:02:07.970> it<00:02:08.180> away

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
doc killer though don't blend it away

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.320 
doc killer though don't blend it away
completely<00:02:09.310> leave<00:02:10.310> some<00:02:10.580> little<00:02:10.850> bits<00:02:11.090> and

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
completely leave some little bits and

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:19.690 
completely leave some little bits and
bobs<00:02:11.600> in<00:02:11.870> there<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:13.370> then<00:02:15.220> maybe<00:02:16.780> just<00:02:18.700> got

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
bobs in there and then maybe just got

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.960 
bobs in there and then maybe just got
something<00:02:20.090> around<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.600> horizon<00:02:20.890> area<00:02:21.890> just<00:02:22.820> a

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
something around the horizon area just a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.010 
something around the horizon area just a
warm-up<00:02:23.300> horizon<00:02:23.990> in<00:02:24.170> there<00:02:25.210> such<00:02:26.210> tiny<00:02:26.690> bit

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
warm-up horizon in there such tiny bit

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.550 
warm-up horizon in there such tiny bit
more<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.470> color<00:02:28.810> just<00:02:29.810> put<00:02:30.140> something<00:02:30.440> there

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
more of a color just put something there

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.380 
more of a color just put something there
along<00:02:31.040> my<00:02:31.250> horizon<00:02:32.000> line<00:02:32.260> out<00:02:33.260> about<00:02:33.770> their

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
along my horizon line out about their

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.420 
along my horizon line out about their
and<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.480> might<00:02:35.660> blend<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.410> back<00:02:36.680> over<00:02:37.100> there

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
and I might blend it back over there

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.640 
and I might blend it back over there

freaking on now is the sticks of it on

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.680 
freaking on now is the sticks of it on
the<00:03:36.420> horizon<00:03:37.130> so<00:03:38.130> them<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.459> little<00:03:38.640> fun<00:03:39.060> brush

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.270 

I'm<00:03:42.690> gonna<00:03:42.930> get<00:03:43.140> some<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.560> same<00:03:43.950> power

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
I'm gonna get some of that same power

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.010 
I'm gonna get some of that same power
I've<00:03:45.239> just<00:03:45.570> used

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.640 

and<00:03:50.530> then<00:03:50.800> stronger<00:03:51.580> horizon<00:03:52.360> I<00:03:52.570> want<00:03:53.440> this<00:03:53.590> to

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
and then stronger horizon I want this to

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.490 
and then stronger horizon I want this to
be<00:03:53.800> quite<00:03:54.160> soft<00:03:54.990> just<00:03:55.990> in<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.260> background

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
be quite soft just in the background

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.920 
be quite soft just in the background
here<00:03:57.510> there's<00:03:58.510> a<00:03:58.630> little<00:03:58.840> hill<00:04:00.510> from<00:04:01.530> there

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
here there's a little hill from there

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.970 
here there's a little hill from there
just<00:04:04.930> goes<00:04:05.140> towards<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.710> top<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.070> this<00:04:08.790> around

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
just goes towards the top of this around

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.860 
just goes towards the top of this around
there<00:04:11.980> many<00:04:12.250> goes<00:04:12.550> down<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:13.180> almost<00:04:13.450> vanishes

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
there many goes down and almost vanishes

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.510 
there many goes down and almost vanishes
almost<00:04:16.870> vanishes<00:04:17.610> and<00:04:18.610> then<00:04:18.760> just<00:04:19.030> over<00:04:19.480> here

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
almost vanishes and then just over here

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.230 
almost vanishes and then just over here
it<00:04:21.520> starts<00:04:21.970> to<00:04:22.090> go<00:04:22.240> up<00:04:22.270> again<00:04:23.760> then<00:04:24.760> he<00:04:24.910> gets<00:04:25.090> a

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
it starts to go up again then he gets a

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.990 
it starts to go up again then he gets a
little<00:04:25.360> bit<00:04:25.600> data<00:04:28.170> around<00:04:29.170> there<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.820> then

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
little bit data around there and then

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.880 
little bit data around there and then
over<00:04:31.270> this<00:04:31.450> side<00:04:31.810> cuz<00:04:32.020> I'm<00:04:32.140> going<00:04:32.380> out<00:04:32.500> paint

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
over this side cuz I'm going out paint

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.250 
over this side cuz I'm going out paint
on<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.130> brush<00:04:33.310> now<00:04:33.870> you'll<00:04:34.870> be<00:04:34.900> so<00:04:35.320> very<00:04:35.920> soft

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
on the brush now you'll be so very soft

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.700 
on the brush now you'll be so very soft
go<00:04:38.260> out<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.830> dish<00:04:39.570> come<00:04:40.570> along<00:04:40.810> so<00:04:41.140> almost

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
go out the dish come along so almost

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.750 
go out the dish come along so almost
user<00:04:42.010> vanishes<00:04:44.250> when<00:04:45.250> it's<00:04:45.430> they<00:04:45.550> almost

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
user vanishes when it's they almost

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.600 
user vanishes when it's they almost
disappear<00:04:46.770> so<00:04:47.770> I'm<00:04:47.830> just<00:04:47.950> going<00:04:48.100> to<00:04:48.190> clean<00:04:48.430> the

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
disappear so I'm just going to clean the

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.130 
disappear so I'm just going to clean the
brush<00:04:48.820> off<00:04:49.030> now<00:04:51.180> by<00:04:52.180> doing<00:04:52.570> that<00:04:52.600> it<00:04:52.780> allows<00:04:53.110> me

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
brush off now by doing that it allows me

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:59.730 
brush off now by doing that it allows me
to<00:04:54.630> go<00:04:55.630> back<00:04:55.900> in<00:04:56.110> again<00:04:57.570> you<00:04:58.570> brush<00:04:59.200> the<00:04:59.440> bottom

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
to go back in again you brush the bottom

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.960 
to go back in again you brush the bottom
of<00:04:59.860> this<00:04:59.950> out<00:05:00.390> slightly<00:05:01.390> blend<00:05:02.110> out<00:05:02.410> slightly

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
of this out slightly blend out slightly

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.430 
of this out slightly blend out slightly
same<00:05:03.970> as<00:05:04.150> you<00:05:04.240> would<00:05:04.390> with<00:05:04.540> a<00:05:04.630> mountain<00:05:05.140> but<00:05:05.290> in

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
same as you would with a mountain but in

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:15.120 
same as you would with a mountain but in
a<00:05:05.560> very<00:05:05.590> very<00:05:06.280> small<00:05:06.580> way

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.890 

even<00:05:16.130> sometimes<00:05:16.340> just<00:05:16.790> come<00:05:17.030> just<00:05:17.419> above<00:05:17.690> it

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
even sometimes just come just above it

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.040 
even sometimes just come just above it
and<00:05:18.139> now<00:05:18.350> I<00:05:18.410> really<00:05:18.979> make<00:05:19.130> it<00:05:19.310> so<00:05:19.840> that's<00:05:20.840> why<00:05:21.020> I

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:54.670 
bringing beer that's all in there you
almost<00:05:38.999> not<00:05:39.629> see<00:05:39.930> that

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:01.820 

went<00:05:55.310> out<00:05:55.550> this<00:05:56.120> again

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.490

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
so again over here this wants to be

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.410 
so again over here this wants to be
really<00:06:08.080> soft<00:06:08.380> i'll<00:06:08.680> do<00:06:08.890> the<00:06:09.010> same<00:06:09.040> thing<00:06:09.610> which

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
really soft i'll do the same thing which

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:16.110 
really soft i'll do the same thing which
less<00:06:10.870> pressure<00:06:11.850> much<00:06:12.850> less<00:06:13.210> pressure<00:06:14.940> no<00:06:15.940> one

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
less pressure much less pressure no one

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:23.750 
less pressure much less pressure no one
wants<00:06:16.240> to<00:06:16.540> vanish

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760
