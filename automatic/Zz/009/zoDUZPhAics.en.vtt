00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
you will need is a round white polymer

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.310 
you will need is a round white polymer
clay<00:00:17.609> ball<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.210> don't<00:00:18.600> worry<00:00:18.840> about<00:00:18.900> any

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
clay ball and don't worry about any

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.320 
clay ball and don't worry about any
light<00:00:19.500> or<00:00:19.650> pink<00:00:19.890> prints<00:00:20.250> we're<00:00:20.820> gonna<00:00:20.970> get<00:00:21.180> rid

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
light or pink prints we're gonna get rid

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.029 
light or pink prints we're gonna get rid
of<00:00:21.420> them<00:00:21.539> after<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:22.140> bake<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.560> polymer<00:00:22.710> clay

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
of them after we bake the polymer clay

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.140 
of them after we bake the polymer clay
and<00:00:23.390> then<00:00:24.390> make<00:00:24.630> four<00:00:25.289> little<00:00:26.090> pastel<00:00:27.090> colored

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
and then make four little pastel colored

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.230 
and then make four little pastel colored
balls<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.500> flatten<00:00:29.250> them<00:00:29.580> down<00:00:29.640> with<00:00:30.210> your

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
balls and flatten them down with your

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.970 
balls and flatten them down with your
fingers<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.109> they<00:00:31.320> don't<00:00:31.590> have<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.859> be

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
fingers and they don't have to be

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.069 
fingers and they don't have to be
perfectly<00:00:32.399> rounded<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.719> make<00:00:33.870> sure<00:00:34.020> that

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
perfectly rounded just make sure that

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.860 
perfectly rounded just make sure that
it's<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> little<00:00:35.070> sheet<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.670> place<00:00:36.510> it

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
it's like a little sheet and place it

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.319 
it's like a little sheet and place it
down<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:38.460> side<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:39.059> your<00:00:39.329> white<00:00:39.899> ball<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
down on one side of your white ball and

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.700 
down on one side of your white ball and
keep<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.480> mind<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.840> we're<00:00:43.020> gonna<00:00:43.140> put<00:00:43.379> four

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
keep in mind that we're gonna put four

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.580 
keep in mind that we're gonna put four
around<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.820> just<00:00:44.879> don't<00:00:45.629> make<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.809> too<00:00:45.930> big<00:00:46.320> and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
around so just don't make it too big and

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.040 
around so just don't make it too big and
the<00:00:47.489> bottom<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.180> bead<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.570> gonna<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
the bottom of the bead is gonna be the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.889 
the bottom of the bead is gonna be the
base<00:00:49.730> then<00:00:50.730> go<00:00:50.910> ahead<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.300> fly<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.690> another

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
base then go ahead and fly in another

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.689 
base then go ahead and fly in another
little<00:00:52.500> ball<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.070> gonna<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.340> another

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
little ball and this is gonna be another

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.450 
little ball and this is gonna be another
petal<00:00:56.329> slightly<00:00:57.329> overlap<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.280> can

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
petal slightly overlap it so that we can

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.310 
petal slightly overlap it so that we can
fit<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.789> rest<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.149> puddle<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.660> because

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
fit the rest of the puddle and because

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.240 
fit the rest of the puddle and because
real<00:01:01.980> roses<00:01:02.309> or<00:01:02.789> overlapped<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.070> kind

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
real roses or overlapped and just kind

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.370 
real roses or overlapped and just kind
of<00:01:05.309> fix<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.729> there<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.180> press<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.689> then

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
of fix it on there and press it on then

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.830 
of fix it on there and press it on then
add<00:01:07.619> your<00:01:07.830> third<00:01:08.159> puddle<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.180> then<00:01:09.630> just

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
add your third puddle and then just

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.550 
add your third puddle and then just
press<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:11.840> make<00:01:12.840> sure<00:01:12.869> some<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
press it on there make sure some of the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.039 
press it on there make sure some of the
puddle<00:01:13.710> sticks<00:01:14.100> out<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.580> then<00:01:15.540> I'm<00:01:15.630> finally

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
puddle sticks out and then I'm finally

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.359 
puddle sticks out and then I'm finally
finish<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.439> off<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> last<00:01:16.890> one<00:01:17.130> that's

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
finish it off with the last one that's

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.120 
finish it off with the last one that's
gonna<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.729> overlapping<00:01:18.530> both<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> petals

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
gonna be overlapping both of the petals

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.980 
gonna be overlapping both of the petals
or<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.939> really<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.420> really<00:01:21.780> how<00:01:21.930> you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
or one it really it's really how you

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.679 
or one it really it's really how you
made<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:23.640> add<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> little<00:01:24.030> bit<00:01:24.119> more<00:01:24.240> detail

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
made it to add a little bit more detail

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.539 
made it to add a little bit more detail
you<00:01:24.869> can<00:01:25.020> bend<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.530> little<00:01:25.799> petals<00:01:26.009> backward

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
you can bend the little petals backward

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.719 
you can bend the little petals backward
so<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.180> looks<00:01:27.360> more<00:01:27.570> realistic<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:29.369> now<00:01:29.490> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
so it looks more realistic and now that

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.330 
so it looks more realistic and now that
we<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.150> first<00:01:30.450> layer<00:01:31.110> let's<00:01:32.070> go<00:01:32.250> ahead

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
we have the first layer let's go ahead

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.030 
we have the first layer let's go ahead
and<00:01:32.790> add<00:01:33.090> our<00:01:33.750> second<00:01:34.290> layer<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
and add our second layer and for the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.249 
and add our second layer and for the
second<00:01:35.369> layer<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.820> will<00:01:36.000> need<00:01:36.259> slightly

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
second layer you will need slightly

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.800 
second layer you will need slightly
bigger<00:01:37.909> polymer<00:01:38.909> clay<00:01:39.030> balls<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.600> will

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
bigger polymer clay balls but you will

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.760 
bigger polymer clay balls but you will
need<00:01:39.990> four<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:40.470> well<00:01:40.970> flatten<00:01:41.970> them<00:01:42.240> down<00:01:42.770> kind

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
need four as well flatten them down kind

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.950 
need four as well flatten them down kind
of<00:01:43.860> overlap<00:01:44.430> them<00:01:44.640> where<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.240> first<00:01:45.659> two

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
of overlap them where the first two

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.069 
of overlap them where the first two
petals<00:01:46.200> meet<00:01:46.649> together<00:01:47.070> if<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.490> makes<00:01:47.880> sense

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
petals meet together if that makes sense

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.050 
petals meet together if that makes sense
do<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.229> all<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.560> way<00:01:49.649> around<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.399> then<00:01:51.030> go

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
do it all the way around and then go

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.130 
do it all the way around and then go
ahead<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.509> make<00:01:51.780> four<00:01:52.110> other<00:01:52.409> petals<00:01:54.140> again

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
ahead and make four other petals again

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.530 
ahead and make four other petals again
just<00:01:55.439> kind<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.770> overlap<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.430> where<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.820> second

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
just kind of overlap it where the second

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.250 
just kind of overlap it where the second
row<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.560> petals<00:01:58.860> met
