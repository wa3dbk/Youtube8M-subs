hotel I did not build that but what I

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.290 
hotel I did not build that but what I
did<00:00:19.050> build<00:00:19.460> was<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.609> right<00:00:20.789> here<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.119> it's<00:00:21.210> a

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300

restaurant and compared to the hotel

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.650 
restaurant and compared to the hotel
it's<00:00:23.189> kind<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.789> not<00:00:23.970> very<00:00:24.180> impressive<00:00:24.449> anymore

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
it's kind of not very impressive anymore

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.640 
it's kind of not very impressive anymore
but<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.320> really<00:00:26.160> like<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:28.019> yeah<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.230> can<00:00:28.529> see

I<00:00:28.680> we've<00:00:29.250> switched<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.670> creative<00:00:30.090> just

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
I we've switched to creative just

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.609 
I we've switched to creative just
because<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.570> mean<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:30.960> easier<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.320> build<00:00:31.439> and

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
because I mean it's easier to build and

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.479 
because I mean it's easier to build and
creative<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.480> whatever<00:00:34.010> it's<00:00:35.010> what<00:00:35.219> I'm<00:00:35.309> more

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
creative and whatever it's what I'm more

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.680 
creative and whatever it's what I'm more
comfortable<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.180> can<00:00:36.450> see<00:00:36.570> we've

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
comfortable with so you can see we've

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.850 
comfortable with so you can see we've
got<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.960> roads<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.320> everything<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.710> come

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
got the roads and everything so you come

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.530 
got the roads and everything so you come
into<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> restaurant<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:41.120> yeah<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> mean<00:00:42.390> it

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
into the restaurant and yeah I mean it

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.389 
into the restaurant and yeah I mean it
looks<00:00:42.840> as<00:00:43.050> you'd<00:00:43.290> expect<00:00:43.410> their<00:00:43.860> tables<00:00:44.250> for

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
looks as you'd expect their tables for

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.970 
looks as you'd expect their tables for
eating<00:00:44.730> there's<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.030> jukebox<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:46.590> again<00:00:46.829> this

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
eating there's a jukebox and again this

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.560 
eating there's a jukebox and again this
is<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.489> dokucraft<00:00:49.219> texture<00:00:50.219> pack<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:51.420> then

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
is on the dokucraft texture pack so then

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.779 
is on the dokucraft texture pack so then
there's<00:00:51.809> two<00:00:52.079> entrances<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.370> bar<00:00:53.579> area

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
there's two entrances to the bar area

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.760 
there's two entrances to the bar area
and<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.180> put<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.539> stone<00:00:54.930> pressure<00:00:55.320> plates<00:00:55.620> right

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
and I put up stone pressure plates right

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.840 
and I put up stone pressure plates right
here<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.100> kind<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.340> make<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.489> look<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
here to kind of make it look like a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
here to kind of make it look like a
granite<00:00:57.390> countertop<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.170> don't<00:00:58.920> know<00:00:58.980> I

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
granite countertop I don't know I

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.040 
granite countertop I don't know I
thought<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.309> was<00:00:59.430> clever<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.020> then<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
thought that was clever and then a

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.330 
thought that was clever and then a
dispenser<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.890> doesn't<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.190> anything

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
dispenser but that doesn't have anything

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.440 
dispenser but that doesn't have anything
in<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.589> furnaces<00:01:04.589> stocked<00:01:04.979> with<00:01:05.220> coal<00:01:06.180> but

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
in it and furnaces stocked with coal but

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.810 
in it and furnaces stocked with coal but
not<00:01:06.799> not<00:01:07.799> actually<00:01:08.220> anything<00:01:08.490> cooking

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
not not actually anything cooking

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.039 
not not actually anything cooking
because<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.090> don't<00:01:09.240> need<00:01:09.360> anything<00:01:09.630> cooking

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
because we don't need anything cooking

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.910 
because we don't need anything cooking
but<00:01:10.740> what<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.890> did<00:01:11.159> do<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.520> thought<00:01:11.850> well<00:01:12.920> you

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
but what I did do is I thought well you

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.780 
but what I did do is I thought well you
know<00:01:13.979> if<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.189> want<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.400> make<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.520> look

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
know if I want to make this look

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.010 
know if I want to make this look
believable<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.450> need<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> stockpile

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
believable they need to have a stockpile

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.679

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
just so happened to be the plot that I

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.460 
just so happened to be the plot that I
chose<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.600> didn't<00:01:36.810> think<00:01:36.960> about<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.320> at

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
chose like I didn't think about this at

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.819 
chose like I didn't think about this at
the<00:01:37.560> time<00:01:38.450> but<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.689> backed<00:01:40.020> up<00:01:40.200> onto<00:01:40.350> water<00:01:40.590> as

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the time but it backed up onto water as

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.219 
the time but it backed up onto water as
you<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.520> did<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.659> go<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.020> get<00:01:43.079> rid

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
you can see I did have to go and get rid

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.319 
you can see I did have to go and get rid
of<00:01:43.259> some<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.799> there<00:01:44.340> was<00:01:44.490> sand<00:01:44.880> all<00:01:45.149> in

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
through here but I wanted it to look as

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.870 
through here but I wanted it to look as
though<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> were<00:01:46.860> completely<00:01:47.310> built<00:01:47.579> over<00:01:47.759> the

though it were completely built over the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.260 
though it were completely built over the
water<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.530> we've<00:01:49.530> got<00:01:49.710> an<00:01:49.829> outdoor<00:01:50.270> outdoor

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
water so we've got an outdoor outdoor

seating area that you can see here which
I<00:01:53.460> actually<00:01:53.579> really<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.329> bothers<00:01:54.840> me

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
I actually really like it bothers me

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.560 
I actually really like it bothers me
though<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.500> had<00:01:55.590> never<00:01:55.710> done<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.100> before

though and I had never done this before

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.969 
though and I had never done this before
why<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.630> water<00:01:58.159> doesn't<00:01:59.930> like<00:02:00.930> surround<00:02:01.740> the

why the water doesn't like surround the
fence<00:02:02.159> posts<00:02:02.579> it's<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.180> sort<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.390> an

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
fence posts it's just sort of an

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.480 
fence posts it's just sort of an
invisible<00:02:03.689> wall<00:02:03.899> that's<00:02:04.229> kind<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.189> don't

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
know it bothers me but not enough to

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.609

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
upstairs and once I decided that this

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.650 
upstairs and once I decided that this
down<00:02:26.190> here<00:02:26.220> wasn't<00:02:26.760> enough<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.360> needed<00:02:27.540> to

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660

down here wasn't enough and I needed to
go<00:02:27.750> up<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.140> decided<00:02:28.440> well<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.709> don't<00:02:28.920> want<00:02:29.160> to

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
go up I decided well I don't want to

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.890 
go up I decided well I don't want to
have<00:02:29.340> like<00:02:29.819> if<00:02:30.060> we're<00:02:30.360> playing<00:02:30.540> make-believe

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
have like if we're playing make-believe

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.809 
have like if we're playing make-believe
I<00:02:31.230> don't<00:02:31.380> want<00:02:31.530> wage<00:02:31.739> waiters<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.459> waitresses

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.890 
I don't want wage waiters and waitresses
to<00:02:32.940> have<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.090> come<00:02:33.209> upstairs<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.630> deliver

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
to have to come upstairs and deliver

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.350 
to have to come upstairs and deliver
food<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:34.410> thought<00:02:34.760> well<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:35.910> can<00:02:36.090> be<00:02:36.180> more

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
food so I thought well this can be more

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.479 
food so I thought well this can be more
of<00:02:36.480> like<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.660> sort<00:02:37.380> of<00:02:37.410> relaxation<00:02:37.769> areas<00:02:38.340> we've

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
of like a sort of relaxation areas we've

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.280 
of like a sort of relaxation areas we've
got<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.760> big<00:02:38.910> wall<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.150> books<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:39.840> some

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
got the big wall of books and some

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.210 
got the big wall of books and some
snacks<00:02:40.440> up<00:02:40.890> here<00:02:41.069> people<00:02:41.340> want<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.519> eat<00:02:41.700> I

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
snacks up here people want to eat I

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.979 
snacks up here people want to eat I
thought<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:44.430> could<00:02:44.700> maybe<00:02:44.879> sort<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.840> look

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
thought this could maybe sort of look

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.570 
thought this could maybe sort of look
like<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.140> card<00:02:46.410> table<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.769> chairs<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.310> sort

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
like a card table and chairs that sort

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.850 
like a card table and chairs that sort

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
loved this building I wanted to make it

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.860 
loved this building I wanted to make it
back<00:03:20.400> in<00:03:20.549> my<00:03:20.670> own<00:03:20.819> server<00:03:21.209> that<00:03:21.329> you<00:03:21.420> guys<00:03:21.540> have

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
back in my own server that you guys have

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.319 
back in my own server that you guys have
probably<00:03:22.019> seen<00:03:22.410> me<00:03:22.560> building<00:03:22.859> on<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:24.000> I

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
probably seen me building on and so I

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.319 
probably seen me building on and so I
created<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.410> much<00:03:25.769> smaller<00:03:26.130> version<00:03:26.730> but<00:03:26.940> still

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
created a much smaller version but still

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.720 
created a much smaller version but still
with<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.930> same<00:03:28.139> you<00:03:28.859> know<00:03:28.980> look<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.370> feel<00:03:29.579> in

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
with the same you know look and feel in

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.120 
with the same you know look and feel in
mind<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.299> my<00:03:30.840> own<00:03:31.019> server<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.680> I'll<00:03:31.829> show<00:03:32.100> you

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
mind in my own server and I'll show you

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.559 
mind in my own server and I'll show you
that<00:03:32.370> now<00:03:34.459> all<00:03:35.459> right<00:03:35.670> so<00:03:35.940> now<00:03:36.180> we're<00:03:36.359> back<00:03:36.510> in

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
that now all right so now we're back in

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.050 
that now all right so now we're back in
my<00:03:37.079> own<00:03:37.260> server<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.130> can<00:03:38.310> see<00:03:38.549> this<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:39.030> a

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
my own server and you can see this is a

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.180 
my own server and you can see this is a
much<00:03:39.540> much<00:03:39.930> smaller<00:03:40.380> version<00:03:40.950> of<00:03:41.069> the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
much much smaller version of the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.280 
much much smaller version of the
restaurant<00:03:41.670> over<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.120> last<00:03:42.329> version<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:43.019> I

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
restaurant over the last version and I

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.020 
restaurant over the last version and I
named<00:03:43.859> it<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.010> Snapdragon<00:03:44.639> I<00:03:44.730> thought<00:03:44.880> that

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
named it the Snapdragon I thought that

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.309 
named it the Snapdragon I thought that
was<00:03:45.120> kind<00:03:45.329> of<00:03:45.359> clever<00:03:45.569> but<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:45.959> can<00:03:46.079> see<00:03:46.200> the

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
was kind of clever but you can see the

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.160 
was kind of clever but you can see the
materials<00:03:46.769> are<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.880> same<00:03:48.180> for<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.569> most<00:03:48.600> part

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
materials are the same for the most part

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.319 
materials are the same for the most part
aside<00:03:49.799> from<00:03:50.160> things<00:03:50.459> like<00:03:50.579> this<00:03:50.850> flooring

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
aside from things like this flooring

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.640 
aside from things like this flooring
here<00:03:51.569> which<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:51.870> now<00:03:51.989> made<00:03:52.170> out<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.350> wood

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
here which is now made out of wood

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.309 
here which is now made out of wood
whereas<00:03:53.100> in<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.549> other<00:03:54.200> restaurant<00:03:55.200> it<00:03:55.290> was

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
whereas in the other restaurant it was

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.870 
whereas in the other restaurant it was
made<00:03:55.530> out<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.650> bed<00:03:55.829> rock<00:03:56.069> because<00:03:56.430> obviously

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
made out of bed rock because obviously

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.759 
made out of bed rock because obviously
if<00:03:57.630> you're<00:03:57.720> playing<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.109> creative<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:58.620> have

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
if you're playing and creative you have

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.530 
if you're playing and creative you have
the<00:03:58.980> entire<00:03:59.220> spectrum<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.910> items<00:04:00.239> to<00:04:00.299> choose

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
the entire spectrum of items to choose

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.479 
the entire spectrum of items to choose
from<00:04:00.599> and<00:04:01.079> I<00:04:01.500> went<00:04:01.769> with<00:04:01.859> bedrock<00:04:02.160> because<00:04:02.400> it

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
from and I went with bedrock because it

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.910 
from and I went with bedrock because it
looked<00:04:02.609> nice<00:04:03.019> here<00:04:04.019> obviously<00:04:04.260> would<00:04:04.739> was<00:04:04.889> a

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
looked nice here obviously would was a

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.979 
looked nice here obviously would was a
lot<00:04:05.099> easier<00:04:05.220> since<00:04:05.670> I'm<00:04:05.849> surrounded<00:04:06.420> by<00:04:06.450> trees

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
lot easier since I'm surrounded by trees

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.309 
lot easier since I'm surrounded by trees
but<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.590> same<00:04:07.799> basic<00:04:08.190> principles<00:04:09.030> apply<00:04:09.510> as

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
but the same basic principles apply as

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.409 
but the same basic principles apply as
you<00:04:11.069> can<00:04:11.130> see<00:04:11.310> obviously<00:04:11.669> the<00:04:11.819> doors<00:04:12.030> on<00:04:12.239> this

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
you can see obviously the doors on this

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.990 
you can see obviously the doors on this
side<00:04:12.690> rather<00:04:13.049> than<00:04:13.169> down<00:04:13.470> there<00:04:14.099> as<00:04:14.370> in<00:04:14.910> the

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
side rather than down there as in the

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.940 
side rather than down there as in the
other<00:04:15.120> restaurant<00:04:15.690> but<00:04:15.959> you've<00:04:16.169> got<00:04:16.380> tables

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
other restaurant but you've got tables

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.960 
other restaurant but you've got tables
and<00:04:17.250> chairs<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:18.739> juke<00:04:19.739> box<00:04:19.919> over<00:04:20.160> here<00:04:20.190> lots

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
and chairs and juke box over here lots

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.670 
and chairs and juke box over here lots

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
of windows and torches to let in natural

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.950 
of windows and torches to let in natural
light<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:23.190> artificial<00:04:23.940> light<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.450> of<00:04:24.750> course

light and artificial light and of course

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.940 
light and artificial light and of course
the<00:04:25.080> bar<00:04:25.260> and

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
the bar and

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.640 
the bar and
let's<00:04:26.550> see<00:04:26.820> this<00:04:27.120> here<00:04:27.780> is<00:04:27.930> just<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.290> vertical

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
let's see this here is just a vertical

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.740 
let's see this here is just a vertical
painting<00:04:29.190> that<00:04:29.820> just<00:04:30.150> happens<00:04:30.480> to<00:04:30.600> look<00:04:30.690> like

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
painting that just happens to look like

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.210 
painting that just happens to look like
a<00:04:30.900> banner<00:04:31.140> whenever<00:04:31.530> you're<00:04:31.680> using<00:04:31.800> this

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
a banner whenever you're using this

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.880 
a banner whenever you're using this
texture<00:04:32.640> pack<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.180> I<00:04:33.540> guess<00:04:34.350> one<00:04:34.620> of<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.770> only

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
texture pack and I guess one of the only

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.350 
texture pack and I guess one of the only
things<00:04:35.100> I'm<00:04:35.250> missing<00:04:35.610> is<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:35.820> granite

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
things I'm missing is the granite

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.200 
things I'm missing is the granite
countertop<00:04:36.530> which<00:04:37.530> I<00:04:37.830> just<00:04:38.070> honestly<00:04:38.610> forgot

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
countertop which I just honestly forgot

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.440 
countertop which I just honestly forgot
to<00:04:39.570> create<00:04:40.460> yeah<00:04:41.460> so<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.700> same<00:04:41.880> basic<00:04:42.240> thing

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
to create yeah so the same basic thing

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.990 
to create yeah so the same basic thing
we've<00:04:42.960> got<00:04:43.110> some<00:04:43.320> furnaces<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:44.610> crafting

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
we've got some furnaces and a crafting

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.030 
we've got some furnaces and a crafting
table<00:04:45.030> no<00:04:45.720> dispenser<00:04:46.200> this<00:04:46.350> time<00:04:46.560> but<00:04:46.800> I<00:04:46.830> don't

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
table no dispenser this time but I don't

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.650 
table no dispenser this time but I don't
think<00:04:47.220> I'd<00:04:47.310> ever<00:04:47.340> really<00:04:47.820> use<00:04:48.150> one<00:04:48.180> so<00:04:48.630> I

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
think I'd ever really use one so I

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.620 
think I'd ever really use one so I
didn't<00:04:48.960> bother<00:04:49.080> wasting<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.860> materials<00:04:50.310> and

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
didn't bother wasting the materials and

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.520 
didn't bother wasting the materials and
obviously<00:04:51.630> the<00:04:51.780> biggest<00:04:51.930> difference<00:04:52.170> is<00:04:52.500> that

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
obviously the biggest difference is that

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.730 
obviously the biggest difference is that
there's<00:04:52.950> no<00:04:53.040> second<00:04:53.670> floor<00:04:53.700> here<00:04:54.150> so<00:04:54.590> if<00:04:55.590> I

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
there's no second floor here so if I

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.650 
there's no second floor here so if I
ever<00:04:55.860> wanted<00:04:56.160> to<00:04:56.220> build<00:04:56.460> like<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:56.910> library<00:04:57.360> or

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
ever wanted to build like the library or

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.620 
ever wanted to build like the library or
a<00:04:57.690> I<00:04:58.140> guess<00:04:58.830> sort<00:04:59.010> of<00:04:59.070> Club<00:04:59.400> it<00:05:00.240> would<00:05:00.360> have<00:05:00.510> to

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
a I guess sort of Club it would have to

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.050 
a I guess sort of Club it would have to
go<00:05:00.780> I<00:05:00.810> guess<00:05:01.110> over<00:05:01.560> in<00:05:01.680> that<00:05:01.800> direction<00:05:02.010> or<00:05:02.640> out

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
go I guess over in that direction or out

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.940 
go I guess over in that direction or out
there<00:05:03.330> since<00:05:03.750> I<00:05:03.870> have<00:05:04.080> barely<00:05:04.380> scratched<00:05:04.560> the

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
there since I have barely scratched the

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.510 
there since I have barely scratched the
surface<00:05:05.040> of<00:05:05.610> this<00:05:05.850> of<00:05:06.180> this<00:05:06.570> entire<00:05:06.960> server

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
surface of this of this entire server

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.120 
surface of this of this entire server
that<00:05:08.520> being<00:05:08.700> said<00:05:09.440> here<00:05:10.440> again<00:05:10.800> you<00:05:10.950> can<00:05:11.100> see

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130

texture<00:05:21.450> pack<00:05:21.630> I<00:05:21.660> really<00:05:22.230> really<00:05:22.500> like<00:05:22.680> the

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
texture pack I really really like the

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.220 
texture pack I really really like the
texture<00:05:23.070> pack<00:05:23.310> so<00:05:23.520> that's<00:05:23.700> why<00:05:23.850> I've<00:05:24.000> been

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
texture pack so that's why I've been

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.630 
texture pack so that's why I've been
using<00:05:25.230> it<00:05:25.470> whenever<00:05:25.650> I'm<00:05:25.860> not<00:05:26.040> recording<00:05:26.160> in

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
using it whenever I'm not recording in

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.400 
using it whenever I'm not recording in
this<00:05:26.790> server<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.630> only<00:05:27.780> reason<00:05:27.990> I'm<00:05:28.080> using<00:05:28.110> it

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
this server the only reason I'm using it

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.810 
this server the only reason I'm using it
now<00:05:28.440> is<00:05:28.740> obviously<00:05:29.070> so<00:05:29.280> you<00:05:29.340> can<00:05:29.490> see<00:05:29.670> the

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
now is obviously so you can see the

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.820 
now is obviously so you can see the
differences<00:05:30.270> and<00:05:30.480> the<00:05:30.540> similarities<00:05:30.830> between

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
differences and the similarities between

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.000 
differences and the similarities between
these<00:05:32.250> two<00:05:32.460> restaurants<00:05:33.050> that<00:05:34.050> being<00:05:34.260> said<00:05:34.620> if

this in the future or if you'd like the

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.880 
this in the future or if you'd like the
regular<00:05:46.980> default<00:05:47.640> look<00:05:47.790> of<00:05:47.880> Minecraft<00:05:48.830> as<00:05:49.830> a

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
regular default look of Minecraft as a

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.500 
regular default look of Minecraft as a
bit<00:05:50.340> of<00:05:50.370> an<00:05:50.520> explanation<00:05:50.730> the<00:05:51.120> reason<00:05:51.420> I<00:05:51.480> use

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
bit of an explanation the reason I use

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.080 
bit of an explanation the reason I use
default<00:05:51.870> is<00:05:52.320> that<00:05:52.560> if<00:05:52.710> anybody<00:05:52.980> ever<00:05:53.760> gets

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
default is that if anybody ever gets

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.000 
default is that if anybody ever gets
like<00:05:54.390> inspired<00:05:54.840> by<00:05:55.080> anything<00:05:55.380> that<00:05:55.500> I<00:05:55.530> do<00:05:55.620> I

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
want them to be able to see the exact

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.690 
want them to be able to see the exact
materials<00:05:58.560> i'm<00:05:58.710> using<00:05:59.070> without<00:05:59.430> getting

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
materials i'm using without getting

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.490 
materials i'm using without getting
confused<00:06:00.090> as<00:06:00.180> to<00:06:00.210> what<00:06:00.600> what's<00:06:00.900> that<00:06:00.990> it<00:06:01.350> you

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
confused as to what what's that it you

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.770 
confused as to what what's that it you
know<00:06:01.590> it<00:06:01.710> looks<00:06:01.860> completely<00:06:02.190> different

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
know it looks completely different

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.120 
know it looks completely different
things<00:06:03.780> like<00:06:03.870> that<00:06:04.080> so<00:06:04.410> if<00:06:04.620> you<00:06:04.740> like<00:06:04.920> this
