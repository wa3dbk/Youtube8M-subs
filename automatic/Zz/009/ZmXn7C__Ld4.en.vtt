here there's two ways i see of doing
this<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:43.020> go<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.320> smart<00:00:43.680> where<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.399> go<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.760> loud

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
this we go in smart where we go in loud

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.080 
this we go in smart where we go in loud

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
and dumb remember the vents if we're

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.150 
and dumb remember the vents if we're
gonna<00:00:48.210> be<00:00:48.420> smart<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:49.170> pump<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.500> little<00:00:49.590> knockout

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160

gas<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.670> air<00:00:50.850> system<00:00:51.149> then<00:00:51.660> hit<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
gas to the air system then hit the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.540 
gas to the air system then hit the
cabinets<00:00:52.469> while<00:00:52.620> everyone's<00:00:52.980> out<00:00:53.160> you'll

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
cabinets while everyone's out you'll

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.069 
cabinets while everyone's out you'll
have<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.820> source<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> gas<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.660> course<00:00:54.690> but

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
have to source the gas of course but

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.900 
have to source the gas of course but
crowd<00:00:55.530> control<00:00:55.680> won't<00:00:56.100> slow<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.340> down<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
crowd control won't slow you down and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.880 
crowd control won't slow you down and
that<00:00:56.969> might<00:00:57.210> improve<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.719> take<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.379> cover<00:00:58.649> is

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
that might improve the take the cover is

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.619 
that might improve the take the cover is
pest<00:00:59.190> control<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.030> no<00:01:00.149> one<00:01:00.270> will<00:01:00.329> look<00:01:00.449> twice

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
pest control so no one will look twice
