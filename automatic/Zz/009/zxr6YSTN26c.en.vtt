00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.150
 samsung you will see one of the big 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.100
 classic Alsatian pastry 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.140
 who's called human students would bring 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.760
 it means little man ccdh and python 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.010
 in brioche we will decorate so it's 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.570
 very nice and the basic recipe is 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.109
 still the brioche is gone then 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:38.250
 we start with the flour ok in fact we 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:39.989
 could the ego sugar the waters there 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.489
 now we will put the milk when the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.780
 exit from the fridge it puts oneself 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.399
 ambient temperature 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.960
 it is certain that the ram goes more 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.829
 quickly demarcate an agreement but if he 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.789
 is cold it works too 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.640
 we will put the yeast one side that is 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.610
 and put back a nice pinch of salt from 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.920
 the other one in fact one is quickly if possible 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.359
 the contact between yeast and salt 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.370
 but as you stir your life 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.059
 frankly there's really no concern we 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.059
 kneads gently 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.080
 now the dough and benefactor 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:19.280
 a little ch'ti convard add the 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:22.490
 butter see the paw stationery about 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.110
 three minutes with the butter when they 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.420
 have a little lastic paw and 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.940
 now that they're saying brioche dough 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:33.200
 rickshaw we will put it in a 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.070
 guti container your well corner that 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.420
 can leave me in the tank 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.170
 possibly a body and then after 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.420
 we will leave the dough doubled in volume 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.520
 well elastic and the impeccable a little 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.140
 film on it we'll let it grow 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.600
 about an hour to two hours there 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.140
 is a question of volume 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.190
 here is the dough pushed then we check 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.330
 that she was well able to make huge and 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.670
 besides small alveoli hard and 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:04.479
 you see here so much the sound we really 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.600
 alveoli So we'll go die 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.830
 hunt the air and there I put it on the 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:17.660
 board and there you're doing at home 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:18.950
 louder is not to the agreement not 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.769
 do too much or because we do not forget 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.370
 it's going to swell it's cooking 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:29.690
 after ruud twists the neck in time all the 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.120
 time the cost and sorgue enough then 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.900
 with a round shot a pair of scissors 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:40.310
 a knife with the knife we ​​are going to him 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.250
 to make legs went through there and 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:49.820
 small arms it's simple I 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:52.250

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.799
 m's voice delicately on a sheet 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.600
 of parchment paper and it is eaten all 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.430

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.530

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.500
 shoots as being half an hour a 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.270
 half an hour she manages to cover them 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.460
 a small towel we will leave in a 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.900
 corner of the kitchen so that it grows 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.050
 it does not cost anything at all 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.030
 time 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.130
