the<00:01:23.280> sport<00:01:24.030> royal<00:01:24.450> blue<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.500> gray<00:01:25.970> really

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the sport royal blue and the gray really

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.179 
the sport royal blue and the gray really
like<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.299> colorway<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.869> reminds<00:01:28.320> me<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
like this colorway it reminds me of the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.200 
like this colorway it reminds me of the
Royals<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.650> you<00:01:31.650> know<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> original<00:01:32.210> og

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
Royals that you know the original og

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.510 
Royals that you know the original og
Royals<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.960> then<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.409> think<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.040> were<00:01:35.159> retro

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
Royals and then I think they were retro

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.490 
Royals and then I think they were retro
to<00:01:35.579> all<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> time<00:01:36.240> or<00:01:36.780> maybe<00:01:37.020> three<00:01:37.290> other

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
to all the time or maybe three other

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.580 
to all the time or maybe three other
times<00:01:37.880> most<00:01:38.880> recently<00:01:39.030> i<00:01:39.540> think<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.930> was<00:01:40.020> 2010

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
times most recently i think it was 2010

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.340 
times most recently i think it was 2010
i<00:01:40.829> want<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.310> say<00:01:41.720> have<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.899> pair<00:01:43.110> somewhere

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
i want to say have that pair somewhere

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.039 
i want to say have that pair somewhere
where<00:01:44.159> i<00:01:44.399> don't<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:45.030> i<00:01:45.270> gotta<00:01:45.540> look<00:01:45.689> for<00:01:45.750> it

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
where i don't know i gotta look for it

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.630 
where i don't know i gotta look for it
but<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.399> colorway<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.970> nice<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.710> like<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
but this colorway is nice I like it the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.370 
but this colorway is nice I like it the
gray<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.329> definitely<00:01:51.930> something<00:01:52.140> different

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
gray it's definitely something different

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.550 
gray it's definitely something different
with<00:01:53.280> CNN<00:01:53.700> foams<00:01:54.000> there's<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:55.049> whole<00:01:55.229> bunch<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
with CNN foams there's a whole bunch of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.170 
with CNN foams there's a whole bunch of
new<00:01:55.680> phones<00:01:55.920> coming<00:01:56.070> out<00:01:56.430> with<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.700> graphic

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
new phones coming out with the graphic

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.499 
new phones coming out with the graphic
prints<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:59.070> got<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> asteroids<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
prints you got the asteroids the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.980 
prints you got the asteroids the
weatherman<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.909> thermal<00:02:03.360> which<00:02:03.630> people

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
weatherman the thermal which people

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.880 
weatherman the thermal which people
pulling<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.409> bloody<00:02:04.619> tampon<00:02:06.469> the<00:02:07.469> Safari

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
pulling the bloody tampon the Safari

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.630 
pulling the bloody tampon the Safari
print<00:02:08.280> which<00:02:08.489> i<00:02:08.640> think<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.940> gross

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
print which i think is gross

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.970 
print which i think is gross
so<00:02:11.240> they<00:02:11.750> definitely<00:02:11.930> go<00:02:12.410> in<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.590> different<00:02:12.740> way

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
so they definitely go in a different way

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.740 
so they definitely go in a different way
with<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.220> foam<00:02:13.460> some<00:02:13.940> people<00:02:14.240> like<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.420> some

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
with the foam some people like it some

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.990 
with the foam some people like it some
people<00:02:14.810> hate<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.620> have<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.580> see<00:02:16.790> all<00:02:16.970> of

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
people hate it I have to see all of
