 in his own way and I have to keep coming back

 If I plant the plants 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.840
 spray and sprayed the frogs 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.659

 and then they start balancing too 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.720
 I felt as if I'm in the jungle 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.550
 then they also have yellow 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.290
 poison dart frogs 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.630

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.910
 Wildlife is capable of antivenin 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.700
 That's right, killing up to ten people 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:24.650
 yes, that many pathos of the noble and 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.080

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.390
 as ten people 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:36.020
 can occur and is not advisable 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.630
 in the wilderness without gloves too 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.730
 must touch this fresh too 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.460
 be nourished what the researchers eat 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.090

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.990
 they do not fly fruitful anymore 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.320
 can fly 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.770
 you can get that in the zoo and 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.120
 Then they came to breed and know 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.710
 only things that move around the frogs 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.690
 turn guests to the restaurant 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.910
 come and they stand before the 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.530
 planetarium and see that they are a lot of poison 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.710
 breed fish there not some 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.700
 who might be afraid too 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.500
 No, because I have a glass in front of it 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.230
 and as long as the glass is in front of it and it 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.480
 is to have no fear in 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.790
 On the contrary, they are very happy 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.920
 they look in there and look what 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.170
 is there in there and then they see 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.850
 all at once a post move and 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.350

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.340
 seen or and then they see again 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.400
 a research he says that is the 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.940
 bad or the therapy in there 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.300
