we can use in another show it's very

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.760 
we can use in another show it's very
potent<00:05:06.850> and<00:05:07.090> that's<00:05:07.750> really<00:05:07.930> not<00:05:08.139> the<00:05:08.199> absent

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
potent and that's really not the absent

potent and that's really not the absent
the<00:05:09.070> potency<00:05:09.520> of<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.639> absinthe<00:05:10.030> is<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:10.570> anis

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
the potency of the absinthe is the anis

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.469 
the potency of the absinthe is the anis
the<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.350> black<00:05:11.560> licorice<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.490> fennel<00:05:12.820> that

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
is in tongue numbing right but typically

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.659 
is in tongue numbing right but typically
with<00:05:17.349> the<00:05:17.440> absinthe<00:05:17.860> you<00:05:18.010> don't<00:05:18.220> get<00:05:18.370> a<00:05:18.430> lot<00:05:18.550> of

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
with the absinthe you don't get a lot of

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.310 
with the absinthe you don't get a lot of
underlying<00:05:19.060> alcohol<00:05:19.660> although<00:05:20.020> this<00:05:20.169> is

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
underlying alcohol although this is

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.710 
underlying alcohol although this is
probably<00:05:20.560> pretty<00:05:20.770> potent<00:05:21.720> fifty-three

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
probably pretty potent fifty-three

probably pretty potent fifty-three
percent<00:05:22.870> alcohol<00:05:23.200> so<00:05:23.650> aboveboard<00:05:24.310> like<00:05:25.000> fiery

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
percent alcohol so aboveboard like fiery

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.779

light<00:05:26.169> it<00:05:26.289> on<00:05:26.349> fire<00:05:26.410> type<00:05:26.860> stuff<00:05:28.020> let's<00:05:29.020> set

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
light it on fire type stuff let's set

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.659 
light it on fire type stuff let's set
106<00:05:30.789> proof<00:05:31.110> so<00:05:32.110> you<00:05:32.950> would<00:05:33.099> think<00:05:33.400> with<00:05:33.610> that

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
106 proof so you would think with that

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.210 
106 proof so you would think with that
you<00:05:34.180> get<00:05:34.419> a<00:05:34.450> lot<00:05:34.810> of<00:05:34.840> intense<00:05:35.650> alcohols<00:05:36.039> but

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
you get a lot of intense alcohols but

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.790 
you get a lot of intense alcohols but
you<00:05:36.310> don't<00:05:36.639> typically<00:05:37.210> except<00:05:38.050> you<00:05:38.440> reduce

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
you don't typically except you reduce

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.430 
you don't typically except you reduce
the<00:05:38.979> quantity<00:05:39.250> x<00:05:39.639> naught<00:05:40.360> liquefying<00:05:41.169> it<00:05:41.320> with

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
the quantity x naught liquefying it with

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.089 
the quantity x naught liquefying it with
three<00:05:41.680> ounces<00:05:41.949> of<00:05:42.099> water<00:05:42.250> and<00:05:42.550> you<00:05:43.510> bring<00:05:43.810> in

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
three ounces of water and you bring in

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.490 
three ounces of water and you bring in
sapphire<00:05:45.099> gin<00:05:45.340> which<00:05:45.699> by<00:05:45.940> itself<00:05:46.270> is<00:05:46.510> forty

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
sapphire gin which by itself is forty

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.870 
sapphire gin which by itself is forty
seven<00:05:47.710> percent<00:05:47.740> alcohol<00:05:48.070> so<00:05:48.610> you're<00:05:48.729> getting

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
seven percent alcohol so you're getting

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.070 
seven percent alcohol so you're getting
some<00:05:49.180> of<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:49.330> alcohol<00:05:49.630> you're<00:05:49.780> not<00:05:49.930> really

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
some of the alcohol you're not really

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.550 
some of the alcohol you're not really
getting<00:05:50.260> any<00:05:50.680> um<00:05:51.630> the<00:05:52.630> chin<00:05:52.870> thing<00:05:52.900> what<00:05:53.289> the

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
getting any um the chin thing what the

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.860 
getting any um the chin thing what the
juniper<00:05:53.949> yeah<00:05:54.669> that's<00:05:55.180> right<00:05:55.360> again<00:05:55.599> but

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.480 

there's<00:05:58.870> not<00:05:59.020> a<00:05:59.080> lot<00:05:59.320> of<00:05:59.349> juniper<00:05:59.800> if<00:05:59.949> anything

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
there's not a lot of juniper if anything

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.370 
there's not a lot of juniper if anything
maybe<00:06:00.970> using<00:06:01.270> tangere<00:06:01.900> but<00:06:02.110> that<00:06:02.260> would

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
maybe using tangere but that would

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.000 
maybe using tangere but that would
defeat<00:06:02.590> the<00:06:02.650> purpose<00:06:02.740> used<00:06:03.310> that's<00:06:03.970> better

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
defeat the purpose used that's better

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.680 
defeat the purpose used that's better
you're<00:06:06.010> really<00:06:06.310> getting<00:06:06.580> over<00:06:07.360> the<00:06:07.479> top

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
you're really getting over the top

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.600 
you're really getting over the top
amount<00:06:07.990> of<00:06:08.050> alcohol<00:06:08.199> with<00:06:09.210> mostly<00:06:10.260> the

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
amount of alcohol with mostly the

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.540 
amount of alcohol with mostly the
absinthe<00:06:12.610> and<00:06:12.760> a<00:06:13.270> little<00:06:13.570> bit<00:06:13.690> of<00:06:13.720> strong

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
absinthe and a little bit of strong

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.370 
absinthe and a little bit of strong
potency<00:06:15.550> taste<00:06:15.760> but<00:06:15.910> no<00:06:16.060> real<00:06:16.270> gin<00:06:16.599> you<00:06:17.229> could

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
potency taste but no real gin you could

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.690 
potency taste but no real gin you could
probably<00:06:17.590> put<00:06:17.860> anything<00:06:18.159> I<00:06:18.430> don't<00:06:18.580> really

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
probably put anything I don't really

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.980 
probably put anything I don't really
know<00:06:18.849> it<00:06:18.969> for<00:06:19.180> a<00:06:19.210> fact<00:06:19.300> maybe<00:06:19.630> this<00:06:19.780> is<00:06:19.900> the

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
know it for a fact maybe this is the

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.690 
know it for a fact maybe this is the
perfect<00:06:20.169> combination<00:06:20.500> but<00:06:21.159> I<00:06:21.219> think<00:06:21.490> there's

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
perfect combination but I think there's

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.200 
perfect combination but I think there's
other<00:06:21.820> thing

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
other thing

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.150 
other thing
to<00:06:22.300> mix<00:06:22.569> in<00:06:22.690> here<00:06:22.870> that<00:06:23.229> the<00:06:23.440> absinthe<00:06:23.889> is<00:06:24.009> just

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
to mix in here that the absinthe is just

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.830 
to mix in here that the absinthe is just
so<00:06:24.370> overwhelming<00:06:25.030> in<00:06:25.180> your<00:06:25.300> face<00:06:25.509> that<00:06:25.690> you're

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
so overwhelming in your face that you're

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.420 
so overwhelming in your face that you're
not<00:06:25.930> even<00:06:26.050> going<00:06:26.199> to<00:06:26.259> know<00:06:26.530> what<00:06:27.039> else<00:06:27.130> is<00:06:27.310> in

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
not even going to know what else is in

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.710 
not even going to know what else is in
there<00:06:28.169> so<00:06:29.169> if<00:06:29.710> you're<00:06:30.130> big<00:06:30.430> into<00:06:30.720> absinthe

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
there so if you're big into absinthe

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.930 
there so if you're big into absinthe
give<00:06:32.050> it<00:06:32.169> a<00:06:32.229> try<00:06:32.440> if<00:06:32.680> you<00:06:32.830> just<00:06:33.069> just<00:06:33.250> like

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
give it a try if you just just like

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.879 
give it a try if you just just like
