your blood I think what they're moreso
talking<00:02:29.099> about<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.580> enzymes<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.599> venom<00:02:30.989> or

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
talking about is enzymes in the venom or

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.729 
talking about is enzymes in the venom or
pieces<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.579> the<00:02:33.120> venom<00:02:33.510> going<00:02:34.440> towards

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
pieces of the venom going towards

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.229 
pieces of the venom going towards
medication<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.519> help<00:02:35.549> for<00:02:35.909> some<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.150> these

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
medication to help for some of these

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.390 
medication to help for some of these
diseases<00:02:36.569> now<00:02:37.349> this<00:02:37.500> also<00:02:37.680> reminds<00:02:38.129> us<00:02:38.310> of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
diseases now this also reminds us of

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.300 
diseases now this also reminds us of
Bill<00:02:38.670> Haas<00:02:38.879> that<00:02:39.239> died<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.890> 2011<00:02:40.890> at<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> hundred

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
Bill Haas that died in 2011 at a hundred

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.069 
Bill Haas that died in 2011 at a hundred
years<00:02:41.670> old<00:02:41.940> who<00:02:42.150> injected<00:02:42.690> himself<00:02:42.840> with

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
years old who injected himself with

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.470 
years old who injected himself with
snake<00:02:43.470> venom<00:02:43.500> for<00:02:44.250> god<00:02:44.730> knows<00:02:45.000> how<00:02:45.209> many<00:02:45.239> years

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
snake venom for god knows how many years

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.319 
snake venom for god knows how many years
so<00:02:45.930> it's<00:02:46.530> really<00:02:46.829> hard<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.489> have<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.970> have<00:02:48.209> an

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
so it's really hard to have to have an

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.170 
so it's really hard to have to have an
unbiased<00:02:49.040> point<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.220> view<00:02:50.430> because<00:02:50.609> I<00:02:51.000> mean

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
unbiased point of view because I mean

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.289 
unbiased point of view because I mean
obviously<00:02:51.299> for<00:02:51.810> Bill<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:53.340> man<00:02:53.519> lived<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.970> long

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
obviously for Bill the man lived a long

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.050 
obviously for Bill the man lived a long
long<00:02:54.750> time<00:02:55.489> considering<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.640> amount<00:02:56.879> of

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
long time considering the amount of

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.330 
long time considering the amount of
venom<00:02:57.209> that<00:02:57.390> he<00:02:57.510> had<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:57.900> them<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.620> for<00:02:59.040> Steve

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
venom that he had in them and for Steve

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.220 
venom that he had in them and for Steve
I<00:02:59.760> don't<00:03:00.420> know<00:03:00.870> buddy

I<00:03:02.450> could<00:03:03.450> say<00:03:03.629> I<00:03:03.659> don't<00:03:03.780> recommend<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.650> but<00:03:04.950> I

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
I could say I don't recommend it but I

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.130 
I could say I don't recommend it but I

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
guess we'll just have to wait and see

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.979
