00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.730
 Hi everybody, I would like to make a 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.639
 tutorial explaining how to rename the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.250
 your photos inside the light on 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.270
 So here we start with this one. 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.090
 photo ne 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.730
 get out of the full screen for those who do not 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.059
 know how to do this only f1 key in that 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.059
 key f1 there you see the big picture on 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:31.110
 black screen but it's always a good tip 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.210
 Here and there 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.399
 Let's start with these pictures I made 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.879
 for a man named Breeze 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.219
 Let's switch to the technology grid and 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.559
 here I even just want to see the photos that 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.769
 it's usually we need to rename 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.660
 because we have clients who 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.129
 this is even part of our 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.019
 workflow 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.120
 so I 'll filter my photos by 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.489
 five stars by clicking the five 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.589
 stars down here in the bar 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.230
 filtering to see only the photos 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.929
 finalized and that I will deliver to the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.150
 customer as in this case my friends I 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.640
 I'll select all the photos by typing. 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.260
 against or 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.220
 and then to rename I will be well 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.570
 sincere I do not know how to do it through 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:22.560
 menu I think it's here in the picture 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.480
 I do not know how to edit either I do not know 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.510
 library 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.720
 I do not know, I only know how to do this with a key. 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.000
 fast then if you use more menu 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.440
 Unfortunately I will not be able to help you. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.350
 but it's very simple we type f2 and it's 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.780
 Good to know that this only works within the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.850
 library if I try to do it in the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.800
 nothing will happen 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.560
 so here we come in this rename 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.460
 photos and here we have an appointment 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.760
 files 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.530
 here we have even some forms already 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.880
 but we will want to see 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.120
 down here to edit now in edit 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.400
 I'm going to delete everything that works here. 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.020
 the way we have this face 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.310
 this dialog box 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.650
 so I'll put the scraper breeze on it 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.930
 Scraper Breeze will be a text that will 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.359
 appear in all photos 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.140
 better say the names of all the 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.150
 Photos 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.109
 I'll put the underline because I 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.420
 taste 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:28.689
 there from that moment we have 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.969
 these options down here where you can 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:33.219
 insert several things 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:36.489
 if you want to insert something that already 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:39.730
 exists in the image as the numeric suffix 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.730
 We can insert here this 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.870
 photo will come to breeze scraper aquino 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:51.400
 example underline 0009 which is the number 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.919
 that already exists in the original photo is a 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.870
 option that many people like if you 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:58.180
 want to start from scratch 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.000
 you can see here in a later date and 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:07.719
 place a sequential number that has a 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 two three four or up to 50 at the front with 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:12.669
 five appointments for you 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.169
 if you're only going to export 10 photos 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:16.540
 maybe just that's so 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.450
 if you are going to export a thousand have to do 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.340
 thus 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.310
 I 'm just deleting this one then. 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.319
 basically this is how you can 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.959
 write a text that will be a value 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.930
 fixed and then you can enter it here 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.479
 various variable values ​​that 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.579
 separate into something that already does 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:38.439
 part of the name and image 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.680
 something that can make a 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:45.180
 numerical sequence or something of 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.389
 date or you can even insert some 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.579
 metadata than this huge list of 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:54.099
 country of creator site of creator 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.870
 which will be based on the metadata you 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.629
 insert into your file 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.109
 in this case I will prefer to use the suffix 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:04.870
 numeric file name 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:08.049
 Once you've done that I'll click 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.849
 in completed from here he will show me the 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:13.569
 example and this setting 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:15.849
 customized by clicking ok 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.180
 now we pruned we can notice that it turned 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.810
 name for scraper breeze 0 0 09 point 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.909
 source 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.870
 a second tip that I'm going to give you 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:28.870
 You just click on f2 again here. 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.080
 edit again and we can do 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.659
 is that if the 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.629
 I notice that several times and use this 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:39.110
 same appointment every time I came 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:41.180
 Here you have to write in the text 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.969
 Can I come here and do what I have? 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.280
 I can click this definition pre 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:48.979
 setting down to the option to save 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.430
 current settings such as new 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.240
 definition I click on this I give a name 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.879
 any 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.900
 I will not do that and then click 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:59.419
 here to create 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.330
 if you look here I'll just cancel 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:06.349
 in this file naming I already have 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.150
 an appointment list then has bruno 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.229
 Henrique is a photographer with whom I 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.150
 job 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.190
 when I work for him or together with 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.009
 he likes the photos to be 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.919
 named and a specific shape 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:22.250
 so click here now we can see 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:30.139
 that bruno ao bruno rio.com walks there in 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:33.050
 bb and 0800 979 action he likes with 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:35.900
 numerical suffix of the file or in case 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.520
 wedding has a client josé godinho the 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.979
 I work with her in marriage 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.319
 he likes she likes the photos to be 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:47.389
 renamed as follows with one year 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:51.589
 noon my bride groom the bride groom 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.789

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:55.129
 numeric 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:58.819
