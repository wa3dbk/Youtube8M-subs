today we're going to be learning the
Tunisian<00:00:09.330> simple<00:00:09.809> stitch<00:00:10.130> on<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.639> Tunisian

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
Tunisian simple stitch on a Tunisian

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.570 
Tunisian simple stitch on a Tunisian
crochet<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.290> method<00:00:13.740> where<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.009> loops<00:00:14.280> are

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
crochet is a method where the loops are

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.359 
crochet is a method where the loops are
left<00:00:14.849> on<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:16.320> hook<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.740> then<00:00:16.830> worked<00:00:17.100> off

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
left on the hook and then worked off

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.340 
left on the hook and then worked off
kind<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.910> like<00:00:18.029> when<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.210> knit<00:00:18.480> has<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> lot<00:00:19.320> of

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
kind of like when you knit has a lot of

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.560 
kind of like when you knit has a lot of
really<00:00:19.980> cool<00:00:20.160> applications<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.090> love<00:00:21.449> this

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
really cool applications I love this

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.460 
really cool applications I love this
technique<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.980> let's<00:00:23.160> get<00:00:23.279> started<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:25.289> for

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
technique so let's get started so for

technique so let's get started so for
the<00:00:25.560> Tunisian<00:00:25.920> simple<00:00:26.189> stitch<00:00:26.369> here<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.300> have

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the Tunisian simple stitch here we have

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.500 
the Tunisian simple stitch here we have
a<00:00:27.449> chain<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.779> 11<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.800> here's<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.519> size<00:00:29.820> H<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
a chain of 11 and here's a size H a

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.420 
a chain of 11 and here's a size H a
Tunisian<00:00:33.510> hook<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:34.380> also<00:00:34.559> called<00:00:34.860> an<00:00:35.010> Afghan

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
Tunisian hook it's also called an Afghan

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.119 
Tunisian hook it's also called an Afghan
hook<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.840> long<00:00:37.020> hook<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:40.010> what<00:00:41.010> we

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
hook it's just a long hook and what we

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.580 
hook it's just a long hook and what we
do<00:00:42.530> in<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:45.030> second<00:00:45.600> chain<00:00:45.989> from<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.410> hook

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
do in the second chain from the hook

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.650 
do in the second chain from the hook
we're<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.100> draw<00:00:47.550> up<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.030> loop<00:00:50.539> there<00:00:51.539> we

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
we're going to draw up a loop there we

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.510 
we're going to draw up a loop there we
go<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.829> time<00:00:53.039> we're<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.370> going<00:00:53.489> to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
go but this time we're just going to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.090 
go but this time we're just going to
leave<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.260> right<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.649> hook<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
leave that right there on the hook and

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.099 
leave that right there on the hook and
we're<00:00:56.250> going<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.399> go<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> next<00:00:57.360> chain<00:00:57.780> and

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
we're going to go to the next chain and

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.420 
we're going to go to the next chain and
draw<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.680> loop<00:01:00.199> and<00:01:01.199> we're<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.280> going<00:01:02.399> to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
draw up a loop and we're just going to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.990 
draw up a loop and we're just going to
keep<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.699> all<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.449> way<00:01:03.539> down<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> line

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.140 

leaving<00:01:09.000> all<00:01:09.270> our<00:01:09.869> chains<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.549> hook<00:01:11.880> on

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
leaving all our chains on the hook on

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:21.070 
leaving all our chains on the hook on
loops<00:01:12.810> rather

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.230 

and<00:01:21.170> this<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:21.920> called<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.280> forward<00:01:22.610> pass<00:01:22.880> then

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
and this is called the forward pass then

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.380 
and this is called the forward pass then
the<00:01:23.900> Tunisian<00:01:24.320> stitch<00:01:24.670> has<00:01:25.670> two<00:01:25.970> parts<00:01:26.210> the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
the Tunisian stitch has two parts the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.800 
the Tunisian stitch has two parts the
forward<00:01:26.810> pass<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.380> return<00:01:27.740> pass<00:01:31.810> so

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
forward pass and the return pass so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.110 
forward pass and the return pass so
we're<00:01:32.900> about<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.140> finish<00:01:33.260> our<00:01:33.500> forward<00:01:33.860> pass

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
we're about to finish our forward pass

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.710 
we're about to finish our forward pass
pull<00:01:35.120> up<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.360> loop<00:01:35.480> in<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.750> last<00:01:36.020> chain<00:01:36.380> here<00:01:37.720> so

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
pull up a loop in the last chain here so

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.210 
pull up a loop in the last chain here so
now<00:01:38.780> we<00:01:38.840> have<00:01:38.930> ten<00:01:39.350> loops<00:01:39.800> on<00:01:40.100> our<00:01:40.250> hook<00:01:42.220> now

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
now we have ten loops on our hook now

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.090 
now we have ten loops on our hook now
for<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.520> return<00:01:43.790> pass<00:01:44.740> we're<00:01:45.740> going<00:01:45.860> to<00:01:45.920> yarn

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
for the return pass we're going to yarn

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.430 
for the return pass we're going to yarn
over<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.460> pull<00:01:46.970> through<00:01:47.930> one<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.860> begin<00:01:50.440> yarn

return pass and now is where the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.750 
return pass and now is where the
Tunisian<00:02:25.060> simple<00:02:26.060> stitch<00:02:26.300> comes<00:02:26.840> into<00:02:27.080> play

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
Tunisian simple stitch comes into play

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.430 
Tunisian simple stitch comes into play
the<00:02:28.760> Tunisian<00:02:29.180> stitches<00:02:29.600> they<00:02:29.810> differ<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.260> lot

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
the Tunisian stitches they differ a lot

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.150 
the Tunisian stitches they differ a lot
based<00:02:31.070> on<00:02:31.340> where<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:31.670> pull<00:02:31.910> up<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.120> loop<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.890> for

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
based on where you pull up a loop so for

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.490 
based on where you pull up a loop so for
the<00:02:34.250> simple<00:02:34.519> stitch<00:02:35.200> we're<00:02:36.200> just<00:02:36.260> going<00:02:36.440> to

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
the simple stitch we're just going to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.050 
the simple stitch we're just going to
insert<00:02:37.400> our<00:02:37.580> hook<00:02:38.950> underneath<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.430> vertical

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
insert our hook underneath this vertical

insert our hook underneath this vertical
bar<00:02:42.340> draw<00:02:43.340> up<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.880> loop<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:45.130> leave<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.250> on<00:02:46.310> the

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
bar draw up a loop and leave it on the

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.750 
bar draw up a loop and leave it on the
hook<00:02:47.980> go<00:02:50.019> behind<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.140> vertical<00:02:51.560> bar<00:02:51.640> pull<00:02:52.640> up

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
hook go behind the vertical bar pull up

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.750 
hook go behind the vertical bar pull up
a<00:02:52.880> loop<00:02:54.250> high<00:02:55.250> in<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.519> vertical<00:02:55.790> bar<00:02:57.700> all<00:02:58.700> the

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
a loop high in the vertical bar all the

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:20.270 
a loop high in the vertical bar all the
way<00:02:59.060> down<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.630> line

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.380 

now<00:03:20.880> when<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.090> get<00:03:21.240> to<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.450> edge<00:03:21.600> here<00:03:23.390> the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
now when you get to the edge here the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.330 
now when you get to the edge here the
way<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.569> make<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.810> really<00:03:25.170> beautiful<00:03:25.319> edge<00:03:25.860> is

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
way to make a really beautiful edge is

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.850 
way to make a really beautiful edge is
to<00:03:27.120> put<00:03:27.300> it<00:03:27.420> through<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:27.930> last<00:03:28.170> vertical<00:03:28.680> bar

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
to put it through the last vertical bar

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.280 
to put it through the last vertical bar
but<00:03:29.550> also<00:03:29.790> through<00:03:31.760> this<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:33.569> loop<00:03:33.870> here<00:03:34.140> on

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
but also through this this loop here on

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.160 
but also through this this loop here on
the<00:03:34.440> side<00:03:36.110> so<00:03:37.110> put<00:03:37.380> it<00:03:37.500> through<00:03:38.130> those<00:03:38.400> two<00:03:39.170> and

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
the side so put it through those two and

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.960 
the side so put it through those two and
draw<00:03:40.770> up<00:03:40.800> a<00:03:40.950> loop<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.610> will<00:03:41.700> create<00:03:41.910> a

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
draw up a loop and that will create a

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.400 
draw up a loop and that will create a
nice<00:03:42.150> braids<00:03:42.600> on<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.020> side<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.530> work<00:03:45.410> so

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
nice braids on the side of the work so

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.559 
nice braids on the side of the work so
now<00:03:46.530> I'm<00:03:46.590> for<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.800> return<00:03:47.069> pass<00:03:47.340> we<00:03:47.670> yarn<00:03:48.420> over

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
now I'm for the return pass we yarn over

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.940 
now I'm for the return pass we yarn over
through<00:03:49.260> one<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:50.690> yarn<00:03:51.690> over<00:03:51.989> through<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.560> for

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
through one and yarn over through to for

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:06.020 
through one and yarn over through to for
the<00:03:53.040> rest<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.400> it

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.500 

this<00:04:06.660> makes<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:07.020> really<00:04:07.319> dense<00:04:08.120> really<00:04:09.120> thick

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
this makes a really dense really thick

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:17.770 
this makes a really dense really thick
fabric<00:04:10.140> it's<00:04:10.950> great<00:04:11.160> for<00:04:11.370> bags<00:04:14.450> rugs<00:04:16.340> jackets

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
fabric it's great for bags rugs jackets

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.629 
fabric it's great for bags rugs jackets
things<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:18.989> need<00:04:19.139> a<00:04:19.169> low<00:04:19.380> bulk<00:04:20.930> okay<00:04:22.490> so<00:04:23.490> now

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
things that need a low bulk okay so now

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.550 
things that need a low bulk okay so now
again<00:04:23.850> I<00:04:24.330> would<00:04:25.080> just<00:04:25.230> do<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:25.380> same<00:04:25.620> thing

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
again I would just do the same thing

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.909 
again I would just do the same thing
underneath<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.800> vertical<00:04:29.190> bar<00:04:30.590> draw<00:04:31.590> up<00:04:31.620> a

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
underneath the vertical bar draw up a

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:44.580 
underneath the vertical bar draw up a
loop<00:04:35.270> keep<00:04:36.270> going

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.550 

there's<00:04:45.190> so<00:04:45.610> many<00:04:45.790> different<00:04:45.940> ways<00:04:46.450> to<00:04:47.380> make

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
there's so many different ways to make

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.640 
there's so many different ways to make
Tunisian<00:04:48.070> work<00:04:48.220> for<00:04:48.460> you<00:04:49.140> color<00:04:50.140> work<00:04:50.410> is
