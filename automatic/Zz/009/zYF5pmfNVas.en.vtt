00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.900
 hello to all she has everything here on yon 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.400
 for decerto france always live 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.350
 from call of duty championship to los 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.599
 angeles in the company of maxi it's a 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.920
 tradition we have at each event maxi 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.939
 unfortunately for you the story 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.710
 stopped yesterday 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.330
 what happened but 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.619
 unfortunately in our plan did not 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.329
 simply failed to win 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.470
 against against one of the two teams 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.300
 American to be able to pass it was 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.320
 it was the stand he is 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.660
 Unfortunately, he lost 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.700
 first match against prophecy so 3 0 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.960
 we made a lot of mistakes 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.280
 the match was pretty tight in 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.899
 the set may not have smd but 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.570
 it's done by steiner a lot of 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.420
 faith and so that's so people do not have 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.560
 we did not know how to play at our level I 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.000
 think between prophecy after that was 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.860
 very strong of course we did not 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.960
 really played on two levels then we 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.550
 played team clariteam so we won 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.840
 the game quite simply 3 0 it was 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.120
 a team that we do not 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.829
 especially and it let go 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.050
 then we arrived condé niall so 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.820
 it was the key match we will say as we 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.860
 had lost against prophecy for for 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.049
 qualifying and unfortunately beats 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.399
 we saw very well it was a 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.680
 humiliation because I'm going to be daddy 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.600
 not to hide it and we saw precisely 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.970
 that the walk was was everything 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.290
 just too much for us and and that's it 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.390
 it's a shame but we will come back more 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.400
 loudly I was talking about walking too high is 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.630
 what do you think your ten days to 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.220
 angeles finally served you to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.320
 something or final it was not 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.060
 necessarily a successful bet to emigrate 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.630
 a few days before I think it 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.520
 did us good 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.500
 really just the fact of 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.000
 to live together all the better 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.170
 to know oneself we already know each other 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.150
 we have been able to work a lot of things 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.950
 at the level of strategies etc it 's not going well 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.689
 necessarily pay but at least we know we 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.580
 know more or less we took 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.100
 knowledge of the American style of play 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.390
 a little more and then and then 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.500
 unfortunately when we train on 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.540
 on the West Coast 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.710
 we can not train against all 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.350
 the American teams the majority 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.210
 being from the east coast so we have to 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.740
 to go through tournaments that we did not 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.789
 not necessarily the right not to 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.039
 necessarily right to participate in fact 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.789
 knowing that we are European so in 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.920
 all it was a good workout 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.939
 we have no regrets about that 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.399
 it was a good experience 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.319
 after I think if we are brought to 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.019
 do this kind of thing again 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.330
 on the coast is okay so on the 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.030
 all the American teams she 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.290
 goes all alongside European side we have 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.519
 only two teams that pass that 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.170
 are in addition two surprise teams of 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.280
 where not necessarily but I think 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.489
 gamers two people were expecting 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.380
 see them pass tcm and epsilon big 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.000
 disappointment vitality also to their 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.620
 disappointment we'll say half with 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.390
 the arrival of jonas is what you think 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.170
 it's a logical sanction or is it 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.230
 it's a real surprise today 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.660
 to have such a dominance of 7.2 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.820
 this American scene so I was 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.200
 quite surprised at the lack of qualification of 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.120
 little dtn to be honest with you 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.200
 after I think for all the rest of 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.549
 Europe is logic 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.900
 these voices there we see that the scene 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.820
 American is evolving at a 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.590
 speed that no one can follow on to 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.880
 the mlg that has now made the pro 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.560
 league where what makes teams 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.549
 the American pro team is played between 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.500
 they more or less every night or 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.090
 three evenings a week I think 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.320
 is what makes this Nile at 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.269
 level is only increasing and we 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.880
 has not that this structure 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.310
 europe that allows us to face 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.109
 epsilon and tcm more or less in 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.519
 regular frequency we will say we have 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.799
 tournaments that can afford it but 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.910
 you have to go all the way and therefore 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.530
 here I think it's not a big 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.870
 surprise that European performance 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.519
 be so weak at this event 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.829
 cautious about congratulations to the gamers of 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.579
 guémar rocked the web who realized 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.190
 as a good performance 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.660
 I am here I think that now is going 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.760
 must quickly find a solution for 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.010
 power to be able to try I say well 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.450
 try to make up for the delay we have 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.920
 vis-à-vis the Americans a delay that 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.810
 does it make that what to dig up 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.010
 therefore we must find a solution and 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.840
 very quickly because otherwise I think 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.190
 we will see everything 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.790
 gently European teams stopped 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.829
 the competition 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.490
 because the main objective what 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.900
 coach years is not attainable 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.520
 we see that American players 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.380
 really train all together 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.200
 sees that players do not necessarily have 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.430
 rule in any case about the fact of 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.630
 always play the four a moment 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.100
 always seems the same t4 what is 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.460
 fairly recurrent kind of players in 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.690
 Europe 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.980
 do you think it may be 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.150
 possible keys to make up for that 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.190
 delay or failing to catch up 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.050
 maybe already have some 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.580
 homogeneity homogeneity forgiveness on the 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.760
 european scene 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.440
 I think that mlg has done a very good 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.730
 very good system I think pretty complete 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.160
 with a draft 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.170
 so every pro team that is part of 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.250
 the season so right now I believe that 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.770
 it's season 2 if I say no 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.880
 nonsense has the right to two peaks of 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.380
 thus replacing in news 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.420
 top amateur teams or players who 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.430
 are free agent for for all of 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.410
 the season the league season so we see 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.630
 especially new talents who have 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.400
 their chances that they can make themselves a 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.350
 name I think especially of a player who 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.280
 is called li yu than in the united states which 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.700
 is climbing at a speed 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.780
 mind blowing and that thanks to facebook 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.160
 so I think the system is good 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.870
 after the fact that American players 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.520
 also know almost the pros 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.680
 know each other they do a lot 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.510
 damon so there are matches to 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.490
 bets between them without necessarily playing 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.050
 with their complete team so I think 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.790
 that all this provides a workout 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.170
 extra training at high 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.610
 level even when you're not in a team 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.470
 it helps to keep some 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.670
 constancy in his individuality and 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.650
 when we arrive with his power team 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.790
 say there today I learned this 6th 6th 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.500
 so if we will try to apply it from 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.420
 such and such and such way and I 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.850
 think that's what's also missing from the 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.470
 European scene right now okay 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.390
 thank you last question maxi we're going 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.980
 talk now about the future aged azox 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.900
 which replaced 0 for almost two 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.040
 month 0 which unfortunately could not 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.000
 to train all the time there is 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.170
 what today it's going to be a handicap 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.400
 to what you thought 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.720
 how is it going to happen 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.580
 today aged in the weeks to 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.710
 come for now we have not yet 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.330
 do the debrief post event so we know 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.520
 we do not know yet what are going 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.590
 to be the details for the future 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.630
 after that I'm here to go back to 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.940
 non-Kazakh main subject I think 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.900
 that he has rendered us a huge service I 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.700
 will always be grateful vis-à-vis 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.490
 of that he allowed us to qualify 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.540
 for the European finals and 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.100
 world finals so that remains a 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.070
 great experience so thanks thanks to 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:50.010
 thomas and that's it's I think the 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.140
 future elderly and will be good it will just suffice 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.460
 that we bump even more and more 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.090
 smart and smarter about 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.040
 pressure domains 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.930
 thank you very much thank you thank you for having 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.610
 followed this interview as usual 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.680
 I leave you the word of the end I want to 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.400
 thank hyper games but maïté all 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.930
 the people who support us 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.930
 thank you chao everyone
