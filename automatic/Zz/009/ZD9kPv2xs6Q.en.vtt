however there were no shield points are

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.130 
however there were no shield points are
taken<00:00:47.770> if<00:00:47.980> you<00:00:48.130> do<00:00:48.340> get<00:00:48.550> a<00:00:48.610> perfect<00:00:48.970> block<00:00:49.540> so

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
taken if you do get a perfect block so

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.870 
taken if you do get a perfect block so
you<00:00:50.200> need<00:00:50.530> to<00:00:50.680> block<00:00:50.950> at<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.220> last<00:00:51.490> moment

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
you need to block at the last moment

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.140 
you need to block at the last moment
here's<00:00:52.720> some<00:00:52.960> tips<00:00:53.230> on<00:00:53.490> direction<00:00:54.490> so<00:00:54.820> when<00:00:55.000> he

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
here's some tips on direction so when he

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.750 
here's some tips on direction so when he
stamps<00:00:55.630> his<00:00:55.690> foot<00:00:56.110> first<00:00:56.530> it's<00:00:56.950> a<00:00:57.220> center

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
stamps his foot first it's a center

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.600 
stamps his foot first it's a center
block<00:00:58.000> regardless<00:00:58.840> of<00:00:58.990> which<00:00:59.410> lake<00:00:59.830> he<00:01:00.160> uses

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
block regardless of which lake he uses

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.970 
block regardless of which lake he uses
and<00:01:00.880> if<00:01:01.330> he<00:01:01.450> comes<00:01:01.660> at<00:01:01.930> you<00:01:02.079> straight<00:01:02.470> with<00:01:02.829> his

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
and if he comes at you straight with his

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.100 
and if he comes at you straight with his
head<00:01:03.280> then<00:01:03.550> you<00:01:03.820> need<00:01:03.970> to<00:01:04.119> parry<00:01:04.479> that<00:01:04.809> to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
head then you need to parry that to

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.710 
head then you need to parry that to
avoid<00:01:05.259> the<00:01:05.680> tap<00:01:05.950> battle<00:01:06.250> and<00:01:06.670> time<00:01:07.119> to<00:01:07.420> break

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
avoid the tap battle and time to break

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.920 
avoid the tap battle and time to break
and<00:01:08.140> if<00:01:09.040> it<00:01:09.190> comes<00:01:09.370> at<00:01:09.610> you<00:01:09.880> with<00:01:10.180> his<00:01:10.330> head<00:01:10.720> to

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
and if it comes at you with his head to

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.410 
and if it comes at you with his head to
the<00:01:10.990> side<00:01:11.110> then<00:01:11.860> it's<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.310> center<00:01:12.820> block<00:01:13.060> and

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
the side then it's the center block and

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.020 
the side then it's the center block and
that's<00:01:13.810> fine<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.500> block<00:01:14.740> his<00:01:15.100> head<00:01:15.370> if<00:01:15.700> his

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
that's fine to block his head if his

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.510 
that's fine to block his head if his
foot<00:01:16.330> is<00:01:16.750> coming<00:01:17.230> toward<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:17.800> straight<00:01:18.280> down

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
foot is coming toward you straight down

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.450 
foot is coming toward you straight down
the<00:01:18.730> line<00:01:18.940> then<00:01:19.600> it's<00:01:19.840> a<00:01:19.990> center<00:01:20.500> block<00:01:20.770> he

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
the line then it's a center block he

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.520 
the line then it's a center block he
does<00:01:21.670> perform<00:01:21.940> some<00:01:22.450> step<00:01:22.780> backs<00:01:23.050> and<00:01:23.350> this

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
does perform some step backs and this

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.950 
does perform some step backs and this
one<00:01:23.800> was<00:01:24.040> a<00:01:24.310> left<00:01:24.610> and<00:01:24.909> then<00:01:24.970> a<00:01:25.120> right<00:01:25.450> block

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
one was a left and then a right block

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.680 
one was a left and then a right block
and<00:01:26.290> when<00:01:26.920> he<00:01:27.070> lives<00:01:27.310> his<00:01:27.580> arm<00:01:27.850> right<00:01:28.210> up<00:01:28.479> in

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
and when he lives his arm right up in

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.230 
and when he lives his arm right up in
the<00:01:28.810> air<00:01:28.990> that's<00:01:29.470> also<00:01:30.040> a<00:01:30.070> center<00:01:30.700> block<00:01:30.940> and

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
the air that's also a center block and

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.010 
the air that's also a center block and
again<00:01:31.900> regardless<00:01:32.560> of<00:01:32.799> which<00:01:32.979> leg<00:01:33.370> who<00:01:33.610> use

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
again regardless of which leg who use

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.310 
again regardless of which leg who use
and<00:01:34.350> his<00:01:35.039> other<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.490> step<00:01:35.850> back<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:36.479> he<00:01:36.719> has<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
and his other to step back one he has a

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.440 
and his other to step back one he has a
similar<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.399> you<00:01:38.549> saw<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.210> there's

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
similar to the one you saw but there's

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.990 
similar to the one you saw but there's
an<00:01:39.600> extra<00:01:40.020> left<00:01:40.259> block<00:01:40.649> and<00:01:40.979> when<00:01:41.520> he<00:01:41.670> claps

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
an extra left block and when he claps

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.260 
an extra left block and when he claps
his<00:01:42.270> hands<00:01:42.600> together<00:01:42.990> that's<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:44.070> sin<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.759> block

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
his hands together that's a sin to block

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.039 
his hands together that's a sin to block
so<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.590> also<00:01:46.770> check<00:01:47.219> out<00:01:47.429> my<00:01:48.049> monstrosity

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
so you can also check out my monstrosity

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.499 
so you can also check out my monstrosity
video<00:01:49.439> I've<00:01:49.770> put<00:01:50.069> a<00:01:50.100> link<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.789> description

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
video I've put a link in the description

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.889 
video I've put a link in the description
under<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.960> video<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.710> goes<00:01:53.399> through

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
under this video it goes through

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.169 
under this video it goes through
monstrosity<00:01:54.899> moves<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.219> did<00:01:56.640> fairly<00:01:56.969> well

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
monstrosity moves so I did fairly well

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.959 
monstrosity moves so I did fairly well
in<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.719> round<00:01:58.110> although<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.189> only<00:01:59.429> tried<00:01:59.789> it<00:01:59.819> a

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
in this round although I only tried it a

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.080 
in this round although I only tried it a
couple<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.360> times<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.079> I'm<00:02:01.979> not<00:02:02.039> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.729> do

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
couple of times and I'm not going to do

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.359 
couple of times and I'm not going to do
more<00:02:03.329> at<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.630> point<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.619> got<00:02:04.829> over<00:02:04.979> eighty

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
more at this point so I got over eighty

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.080 
more at this point so I got over eighty
percent<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:06.420> 46<00:02:07.200> perfect<00:02:08.160> block<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.849> good

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
percent with 46 perfect block so good

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.390 
percent with 46 perfect block so good
