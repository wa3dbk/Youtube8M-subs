00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
Direction controls so no matter what way

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.560 
Direction controls so no matter what way
I<00:00:25.019> turn<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.769> my<00:00:26.369> direction<00:00:26.760> stick<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.330> always

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
I turn it my direction stick is always

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.939 
I turn it my direction stick is always
gonna<00:00:27.720> be<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.930> same<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.260> don't<00:00:28.289> have<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.710> try<00:00:28.890> to

gonna be the same I don't have to try to

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.420 
gonna be the same I don't have to try to
fly<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.640> backwards<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.420> any<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.720> that

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
fly it backwards and any of that

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.970 
fly it backwards and any of that
says<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:32.640> got<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> tags<00:00:33.210> FX<00:00:34.140> sensor<00:00:34.559> fusion

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
things gonna kick some ass this is it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.420 
things gonna kick some ass this is it
back<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.379> anyways<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.800> get<00:00:50.070> let's

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
back to you but anyways this get let's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.250 
back to you but anyways this get let's
crack<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.789> open<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> look<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.140> is

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
crack this open have a look so this is

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.420 
crack this open have a look so this is
what<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.530> get<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.920> box

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
what you get in the box

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.430 
what you get in the box
it's<00:00:56.879> pretty<00:00:57.180> small<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:57.989> what<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.199> had

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
it's pretty small just like what I had

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.660 
it's pretty small just like what I had
expected<00:01:03.680> of<00:01:04.680> course<00:01:04.830> your<00:01:05.070> instruction

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
expected of course your instruction

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:23.270 
expected of course your instruction
manual<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:21.990> really<00:01:22.320> isn't<00:01:22.770> all<00:01:23.159> that

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
manual so this one really isn't all that

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.910 
manual so this one really isn't all that
much<00:01:23.820> bigger<00:01:24.180> than<00:01:24.810> my<00:01:24.990> other<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.860> I

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
much bigger than my other one that I

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.080 
much bigger than my other one that I
have<00:01:26.450> my<00:01:28.100> wltoys<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.369> figured<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.790> gonna<00:01:29.970> be

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
have my wltoys I figured it's gonna be

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.260 
have my wltoys I figured it's gonna be
at<00:01:30.180> least<00:01:30.210> twice<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.720> size<00:01:31.520> but<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:33.060> good

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
at least twice the size but it's good

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.120 
at least twice the size but it's good
little<00:01:33.450> video<00:01:33.750> camera<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:37.439> bottom<00:01:37.860> we

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
little video camera on the bottom we

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.109 
little video camera on the bottom we
have<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.369> take<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.640> out<00:01:38.729> for<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.939> test<00:01:39.180> spin<00:01:41.119> but

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
have to take it out for a test spin but

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.670 
have to take it out for a test spin but
those<00:01:42.240> two<00:01:42.450> get<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.750> get<00:01:42.869> batteries<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
those two get you get batteries for the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.660 
those two get you get batteries for the
remote<00:01:45.590> quadcopter<00:01:46.590> guards<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.399> screw

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
remote quadcopter guards you can screw

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:59.990 
remote quadcopter guards you can screw
on<00:01:54.920> extra<00:01:55.920> blades<00:01:56.219> case<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.729> break<00:01:57.030> some<00:01:59.000> must

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
on extra blades case you break some must

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.510 
on extra blades case you break some must
be<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.329> memory<00:02:01.290> card<00:02:01.710> supposed<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.219> be<00:02:02.310> in

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
be the memory card supposed to be in

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.340 
be the memory card supposed to be in
here<00:02:02.790> somewhere

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
here somewhere

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.040 
here somewhere
that's<00:02:04.350> authority<00:02:04.890> inserted

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.960 

okay<00:02:10.050> never<00:02:10.320> mind<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.770> found<00:02:11.040> a<00:02:11.190> memory<00:02:11.400> card<00:02:11.730> to

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
okay never mind I found a memory card to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.340 
okay never mind I found a memory card to
hid<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.240> underneath<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.750> battery<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
hid it underneath the battery the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.170 
hid it underneath the battery the
 sneaky<00:02:14.220> bastards<00:02:14.790> that's<00:02:14.940> getting

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
 sneaky bastards that's getting

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.790 
 sneaky bastards that's getting
all<00:02:15.240> worried<00:02:15.600> there<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:15.960> is<00:02:16.170> your<00:02:16.320> charger

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
all worried there this is your charger

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.450 
all worried there this is your charger
you<00:02:16.920> got<00:02:17.070> USB<00:02:17.550> charger<00:02:18.770> this<00:02:19.770> is<00:02:19.830> actually<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
you got USB charger this is actually the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.280 
you got USB charger this is actually the
same<00:02:20.700> type<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:20.970> batteries<00:02:21.570> of<00:02:21.720> my<00:02:21.810> other<00:02:22.020> ones

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
same type of batteries of my other ones

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.890 
same type of batteries of my other ones
use<00:02:22.590> but<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.160> don't<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.610> see<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.210> voltages

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
use but I don't have to see the voltages

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.600 
use but I don't have to see the voltages
on<00:02:25.110> them<00:02:25.290> see<00:02:25.440> if<00:02:25.560> they're<00:02:25.680> pretty<00:02:25.860> closed

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.960 

here's<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.850> remote<00:02:30.090> control<00:02:31.490> pretty<00:02:32.490> simple

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
here's the remote control pretty simple

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.180 
here's the remote control pretty simple
the<00:02:33.240> WL<00:02:33.630> toy<00:02:33.900> ones<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.380> quite<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.650> bit<00:02:34.830> nicer

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
the WL toy ones is quite a bit nicer

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.850 
the WL toy ones is quite a bit nicer
with<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.370> digital<00:02:35.790> screen<00:02:36.150> on<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.480> bottom

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
with the digital screen on the bottom

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.490 
with the digital screen on the bottom
