00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 yo guests welcome to this new one 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.819
 commentary and it is today a 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.740
 you glow rosy because yes it is not real 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.450
 I also get bored but ff variety 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.130
 Occasionally it is also nice and then I go 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.990
 just start a new series in this one 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.150
 series yes actually it just seems 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.130
 pack perfection of a he skills and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.270
 fake and so actually is just the same 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.770
 but yes what is an original 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.660
 nowadays in the in one in the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.949
 community everything is already done I go 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.680
 do that against that other size of 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.760
 a channel and your heels of anime I do 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.990
 pretty fun to do 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.490
 but it comes down to that 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.040
 we do five golden packages of those 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.840
 premium packages that now see a picture 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.710
 three silver premium package you may 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.120
 to open 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.550
 and for that you have to build from the team 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.809
 And yes then you have to buy the gold from me 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.430
 tried to win and offers you that first 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.290
 does that yes who has the competition 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.820
 won and if we found so too fast 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.260
 ladies and go within 2 episode all those 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.820
 cup won from the we make the two 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.129
 can do a lot from 3 weeks 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.420
 until the dagon to battle epic 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.590
 it is becoming 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.510
 it actually becomes you too 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.860
 paralympics packages because those players 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.420
 getting out with such chemistry 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.070
 sometimes there you can really do it completely 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.559
 nothing with it 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.329
 also the first package with the Williams 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.549
 yes it just pleases the moisture he fought off 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.140
 I want to say it wrong Williams is the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.580
 only good player who get it and right 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.130
 is just blood those movies now 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.479
 the farmer jasper is coming premier 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.460
 So I build something there all around 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.450
 so I definitely wanted to try that because 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.470
 the second package I get 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.330
 of course nothing at all 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.770
 jesus said nice period will occur 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.869
 package that I also besonders are something 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.310
 so better in that the may worry me 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.470
 or because I want to do a trick winner 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.600
 him but luckily one of the package 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.369
 I have some luck 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.320
 so if you are going to see the image now beast 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.729
 you got a nice right back in it 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.439
 just a year just great 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.030
 also play with kuranyi 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.710
 and five gold spear is just 5 players 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.360
 it's always young with the spark plug 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.829
 you still stick even then 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.270
 nice and another keeper 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.729
 so they both throw everything together 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.140
 nice package but I gave yes I saw 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.810
 opening myself is the last one 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.250
 open foster parent, by the way , I do this now 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.020
 not live those packages do I found one 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.790
 times quite fun to do 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.799
 for when I write something really good 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.240
 I probably get home 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.909
 when becky likes to play a game 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.250
 it is a bronze with 50p again like that 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.409
 nice and logical but Jan. 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.939
 was not completely with it and I have 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.590
 not really enough spacer this moment 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.429
 to build a decent team from it 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.690
 who got really all 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.750
 different with chanel chi and 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.210
 competitions 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.750
 and you like me again you don't play 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.610
 gets 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.440
 sometimes knowledge about game is pretty nice 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.840
 its high pace or so so I hope 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.010
 I do with silver packages 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.170
 but it didn't work because I get here 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.360
 a tendon discharge grose's umm from 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.650
 competition he thinks no and also one 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.390
 country where you don't want to keep a k ' 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.980
 so that is a shame okay 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.900
 but not as bad as he out to 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.420
 Arrives with them the only oh man 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.410
 player or emotion or I can feel that 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.610
 to do 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.470
 but in this package I actually get 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.560
 the best will in my team the measles 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.780
 upgraded version is now 84 and shiny ones 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.530
 really is still worth something is 8k or so 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.170
 I think 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.000
 so it's unreasonable and if I'm so happy 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.810
 also because I smoke green grass and 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.540
 key 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.860
 kiko got from swansea and the rody is something 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.940
 would know and or would they were nice 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.500
 play as I am happy with it 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.060
 and place a cap again 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.440
 nothing at all 3 times so that was already one 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.850
 a bit of a shame but I still have enough 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.100
 players to build the next ten 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.050
 you are going to see it now i have 532 i have 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.209
 you made me experience that I most 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.250
 players of it is still quite a few good ones 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.410
 60 gamers that is it must be doable 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.390
 should not dig on the wallprim 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.040
 results can be achieved 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.330
 and by the way in every match or 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.830
 Every episode we have two games 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.870
 and we don't do this this one does 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.670
 this distraction at a competition but 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.350
 start of each a new episode 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.390
 you have to open an extra wood package 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.209
 there are a few updates or yes good ones 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.980
 improve you get ten but mine 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.209
 opponent is sitting on his team 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.730
 nice to know how that to them 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.170
 agriculture and that is yes that always says 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.090
 well what none now on your site to 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.560
 go with dd just early or being out 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.090
 the corner and dd is just not too 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.519
 stop in the air especially with cone 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.060
 not the idea is so dirty muller but 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.650
 happy 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.150
 la thÃ©orie us not you that they legs 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.190
 and walk it all the way to the 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.350
 on the left becomes who you are afraid apply 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.120
 I don't know the American accent 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.980
 what just nice and the short corner and 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.940
 Rodrigues from the only player who 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.440
 is unreasonable 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.730
 is on 8 chemistry between them all 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.360
 they play english so that is nice 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.220
 taken along 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.870
 if i'm happy and i'm all of that 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.730
 once preference for many gesture can 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.620
 worry but your own from the keeper sun 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.989
 that very well i walked out here 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.549
 expresses himself and doesn't have a team either 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.110
 and here comes that at three o'clock you too 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.640
 one that the yes I actually don't have anymore 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.739
 so young and confident that I will return 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.630
 would come but i still ff we especially 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.220
 score surfed in the 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.200
 first half he will still succeed with 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.440
 taylor i don't know what that guy is about 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.580
 doing is where he defends so badly 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.140
 really makes no sense at all 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.030
 I will give that I also need one 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.980
 danger second time scoring the 45th minute 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.480
 so taken along as beautiful 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.130
 b with religion at his second of the 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.290
 competition again have adriatic best 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.520
 well yes ok yes those are for my team 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.930
 as quite happy with it but my 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.050
 opponent goes early in the second 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.640
 half or voice that came later 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.780
 really a blast youthfulness is on three 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.310
 damacy 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.600
 so that was not that special and went 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.000
 also not that special but loved it 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.080
 no pancake against this match and 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.910
 you already get it right now 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.710
 difficult and I am happy for this 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.780
 me really with a lot of luck the along and 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.190
 then negro creek and she again and me 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.720
 don't even know which legs are shooting 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.160
 so shoot with both legs in it 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.720
 that in itself was all mine 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.190
 and brings the score to four four and from 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.570
 this moment yes combi I could actually do that 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.800
 fall on both sides and where easing 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.730
 attack that was probably the 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.590
 become winning 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.030
 but luckily for me it falls for me 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.220
 yes he actually falls into his goal 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.750
 I fall by 3 is what she fourth of 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.260
 the competition and with that this way 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.880
 played 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.690
 I was a first win in six 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.910
 gary's i10 moderate 10 still with a 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.650
 4 nice competition so I continue 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.360
 this episode has now ended 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.730
 the next time got long say my 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.680
 opponents team to see his players 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.090
 the packages and she is the competition 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.200
 those are the first ones here now 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.120
 this channel is going to see and I hope so 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.950

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.810
 that you liked this as 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.340
 you liked it leave a like 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.810
 that doesn't really motivate me 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.610
 just to continue this series but 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.080
 also just to get road to glory ' fast 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.140
 upload everything to do 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.670
 and besides that also helps me a lot 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.990
 I say yes this suffering is from 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.620
 over so I would say until later 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.620
 guests yoo
