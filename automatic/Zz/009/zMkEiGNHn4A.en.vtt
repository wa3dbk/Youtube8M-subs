00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.550
 Past ever participated in the club at the me 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.429
 I've played 87 and 88 88 twice 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.470
 we won and 87 true voicemail 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.200
 in the first round we had the de 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.980
 final rounds not why early temporarily 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.160
 switched off 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.350
 I can reel off down the same tune 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.170
 whatever for me god has the club too 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.680
 a past that has to do with me 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.620
 keep looking in the 8085 period as well 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.930
 have been active for for pc and that 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.579
 I also participated in the otten 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.160
 cup 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.030
 beautiful international tournament with 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.250
 many good opponents and yes also 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.400
 won the final that period 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.750
 in stadium and that is very special 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.799
 assists you further from that of that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.659
 tournaments 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.030
 well the opponent of course and the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.570
 names that 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.650
 and then played it in 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.510
 but at the start of their career 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.950
 we have seen the book we 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.869
 have read history a bit 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.400
 and some names have passed 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.340
 of course child on the on the cup we 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.680
 have played and yes including say 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.360
 also players from their own youth or 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.130
 youth education but also simply other 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.490
 other players to barcelona 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.190
 feyenoord portuguese clubs for example 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.810
 Wijnaldum has here of course already 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.970
 I played several times 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.369
 display yes with that being concerned are here 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.770
 what what passed yes when I say otten 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.679
 cup what will be the first that comes to mind 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.380
 yes real nice pc think high expectations 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.679
 I think a lot of people come because 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.000
 see how much knowledge very many friends 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.550
 Hero expectations are always in the week 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.810
 just have to have very big eye 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.420
 achieve 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.210
 I think so product and educational never 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.819
 I think for every player with us in it 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.050
 team nice tournament what the usually whole 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.880
 busy and yes just gain experience 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.370
 this edition was the names that 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.320
 do not participate afellay or wine balance but 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.989
 so for example van den hurk or cook 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.790
 these two youth players of psv 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.650
 fancy their bone cup 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.870
 we think good team name but do well 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.549
 so with new trainer got one 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.239
 bit we tackles him then good against him 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:35.000
 on so he keeps the ego in us and pull 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.079
 I think they have a chance 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.540
 to get far 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.920
 for me this is the day the second 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.900
 training session we just finished 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.640
 so for me completely in the 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.410
 initial phase 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.450
 it is true that we 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.580
 a different teams of boys 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.770
 spread throughout the world 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.780
 this is how i try my boys this week 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:58.040
 ready to steam for the otten cup 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.380
 and some even said before a real team 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.450
 go through the development phase to 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.170
 start later for the cup and 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.970
 League 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.820
 it is a preparation you are you are 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.620
 the four weeks so that through the week we 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.360
 have had Estonia with the A1 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.440
 have three competitions there 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.150
 played 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.590
 week after week and a half later stand 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.500
 of course at the club with beautiful 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.090
 posters for the front door 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.910
 yes of course you want as good as possible 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.310
 get results and and and so good 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.200
 possibly say in in in the 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.880
 team development and ongoing 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.380
 go to work 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.570
 yes so it is actually already in advance 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.910
 make a prediction as well as possible 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.200
 continue to build up with it 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.910
 are for the first cup and 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.130
 League match 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.020
 yes then then then we will actually 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.910
 do see where the ship is stranded 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.420
 you play a short period of three 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.020
 days 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.790
 say 5 5 matches so ideal 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.790
 option to meet the boys all 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.370
 to see it at work and so on 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.930
 press on of results 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.140
 ben je v is divided into a group with 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.190
 Sparta Anderlecht and FC Barcelona one 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.810
 heavy group 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.650
 but van den squat and bought it 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.209
 full confidence in a great result 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.880
 is a great team of barcelona 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.010
 of course a very large team 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.270
 yes I often think Dutch 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.860
 League 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.200
 your youth is often very strong 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.150
 We should stand a chance, I think 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.230
 just have to wait to watch them 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.300
 play 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.770
 hay loft against a chisel 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.800
 fear in the players always something else 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.300
 as against Dutch team but yes, just 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.430
 do our best 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.810
 and then it'll be fine, I think what 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.980
 expectations in the game 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.720
 naturally nice against barcelona too 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.910
 For example, play soccer first 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.890
 we just want to win are not afraid 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.419
 before they had us they were not overrated 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.710
 either but we just want one there 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.570
 I do want to win tournament 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.940
 you say there is enough qualities 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.560
 enough in this psv a1 team 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.440
 quality because I win it 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.240
 yes i think so do you want to know if psv too 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.850
 will actually win the otten cup 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.300
 Friday evening it starts at 7 a.m. 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.389
 a match against others 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.389
 really
