00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.930
 just grab my name is massa and 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.809
 Today we are the mother of all 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.969
 vanilla cream tournament the sweden pie 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.650
 or princesses pie to sweden 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.920
 we need bisquit floors 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.439
 I made myself an 18er bisquit 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.990
 then the second part a bit smaller 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.220
 gouged out and the third part still 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.410
 smaller is the vanilla cream 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.710
 all videos I link to you in the team 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.129
 infobox I already have separate 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.290
 videos made as I previously put 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.329
 and igling so when we have the cream 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.070
 I have really applied with that 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.500
 spatula usually tasted very nice 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.690
 Apply therefore we have two 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.610
 biggest out there with me 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.140
 really a nice robes dark in 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.079
 get a very easy gate for the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.019
 production because this technology is 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.299
 much easier than a straight one 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.810
 pie with the spatula 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.950
 most certainly needs much less 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.159
 experience with the spatula and feel 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.700
 The pie really tastes very much 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.100
 delicious 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:26.580
 It is the mother of all creamy dead 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:31.020
 Then I will have tried the draw 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.150
 I'm sticking the lower one off and on 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.829
 then cut me a plastic strip 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.619
 rightly so with the pie 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.930
 Nice to tow that they really can 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.680
 is nice and smooth that when we are in 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.700
 connection with the marzipan cover 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.590
 really a smooth structure you have 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.689
 can also be a baking paper 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.479
 trim and so easy with the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.290
 Then pull over the pie 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.290
 nice and smooth 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.989
 in connection the cake will meet with 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.330
 marzipan set there is classic 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.310
 very green grass green marzipan 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.380
 Of course you can use what 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.500
 you would like to be natural 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.900
 taste thing but that's just it 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.940
 Original actually there is a small one 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.160
 tip it is certainly easier if you 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.739
 the vehicle few pieces a little bit 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.750
 makes me bigger here 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:35.870
 because then you just have it 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.870
 fold well out to the company 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.750
 i had a little bit too much for your video 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.569
 a lot of cream I will then go to the infobox 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.560
 still adapt the recipe so it's the same 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:53.440
 for those pie easy that there is 18 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.440
 centimeters in diameter and about ten 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.459
 centimeters high and is safe for 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.140
 eight people so for info then cut 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.550
 I'm off the marzipan and in connection 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.120
 we dust the gates with us 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.120
 powdered sugar 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.480
 nice the over steer evenly 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.520
 always hit it with one hand 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.849
 then i can look really nice 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.400
 evenly control or you can too 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.069
 A knife next to and knocking in 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.760
 small tip on the land in connection 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.950
 let's put the rose on it 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.239
 like so often I already have a video 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.489
 because I work so called 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:46.580
 modular system with many videos to one 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:49.760
 recipe to say no fun aside 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.250
 yes that's it with this video me 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.519
