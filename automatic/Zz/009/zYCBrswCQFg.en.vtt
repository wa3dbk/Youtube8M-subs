and<00:01:48.710> thinner<00:01:48.890> newer<00:01:49.280> polishes<00:01:49.819> will<00:01:50.000> work

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
and thinner newer polishes will work

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.120 
and thinner newer polishes will work
better<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:50.719> spread<00:01:50.960> out<00:01:51.049> faster<00:01:51.530> just<00:01:51.859> test

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
better and spread out faster just test

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.059 
better and spread out faster just test

innermost<00:02:26.950> circle<00:02:27.249> stick<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.299> too<00:02:28.480> thick

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:28.719 
innermost circle stick that too thick

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.420 
innermost circle stick that too thick
and<00:02:28.870> gently<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.409> drag<00:02:29.799> it<00:02:29.889> out<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.159> the<00:02:30.249> outer

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
and gently and drag it out to the outer

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.690 
and gently and drag it out to the outer
ring<00:02:32.280> do<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.430> same<00:02:33.670> thing<00:02:33.939> on<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.239> other<00:02:34.269> side

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
ring do the same thing on the other side

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.399 
ring do the same thing on the other side
now<00:02:36.700> make<00:02:36.969> perpendicular<00:02:37.689> strokes<00:02:38.049> across

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
now make perpendicular strokes across

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:59.789 
now make perpendicular strokes across
like<00:02:38.769> so<00:02:39.010> in<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.430> zigzag<00:02:39.700> motion<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:59.620> end
