keep<00:01:06.000> your<00:01:06.150> hands<00:01:06.420> up<00:01:06.510> because<00:01:07.140> even<00:01:07.409> if<00:01:07.500> you

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
keep your hands up because even if you

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.200 
keep your hands up because even if you
don't<00:01:07.799> catch<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.220> first<00:01:08.520> way<00:01:08.760> you're

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
don't catch it on the first way you're

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.520 
don't catch it on the first way you're
probably<00:01:09.420> going<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.689> tap<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.170> instead<00:01:10.409> of

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
probably going to tap it up instead of

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.170 
probably going to tap it up instead of
knocking<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.950> down<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> lot<00:01:11.820> harder<00:01:11.970> to

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
knocking it down it's a lot harder to

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.120 
knocking it down it's a lot harder to
catch<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.479> low<00:01:12.630> ball<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.799> almost

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
catch a low ball like this it's almost

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.440 
catch a low ball like this it's almost

across<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.740> field<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.520> balls<00:01:23.729> coming<00:01:23.880> low<00:01:24.119> I

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
across the field the balls coming low I

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.450 
across the field the balls coming low I
like<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.229> catch<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.560> ball<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.920> low

like to catch the ball like that low

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.670 
like to catch the ball like that low
most<00:01:27.119> chance<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.229> give<00:01:28.380> yourself<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
most chance I think you give yourself a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
most chance I think you give yourself a
better<00:01:28.799> chance<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.159> catching<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.549> ball

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
better chance to catching the ball

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.760 
better chance to catching the ball
anywhere<00:01:30.570> else<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> ball<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.259> up<00:01:31.350> high<00:01:31.470> yeah

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
anywhere else the ball is up high yeah
