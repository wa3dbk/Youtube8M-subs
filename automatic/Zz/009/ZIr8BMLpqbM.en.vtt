00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:08.849
 hello usually 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.620
 weeks for two days for ten seedlings 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.499
 tomatoes 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.100
 necessary of course harden best 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:21.570
 do it in the greenhouse if you have it 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:25.080
 if not then on the loggias or balconies but 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.690
 cleaner stand quite cold so on 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.680
 night I'm in the greenhouse for our 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.390
 heater and extra and 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.089
 heat up in the afternoon in the greenhouse 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.789
 temperature is and not open 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:41.039
 sometimes it comes to 40 degrees therefore 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:43.670
 During the day, greenhouses have the opposite 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:47.030
 open and in fact we already 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.019
 this is almost the summer 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.280
 microclimate in the greenhouse 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:56.819
 but the sun is naturally much larger 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.569
 than on the windowsill so the seedlings in 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:00.510
 height 

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:03.239
 as if freezes and instead we 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.960
 there are such powerful ones like us 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.049
 see green 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.149
 Top of the head is very good just from 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.860
 they will go all the main growth then 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.829
 grow seedlings in large quantities 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.259
 on the windowsill already would have been just 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:25.200
 impossible that is she would be all right now 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.920
 so stretched the height was on 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.920
 thin legs 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:36.119
 here as we see it thickens and 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.840
 naturally formed very good 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.509
 green crown is part when we will 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.750
 planted peer prikopalis here all these 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:50.670
 bad little leaves and here it is 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.729
 it is already green already acclimatized 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.689
 that here we have a greenhouse and 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.999
 naturally jerks in growth therefore 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.950
 seedlings always need to kill 

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:04.530
 what is needed as things when quenching 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.580
 seedlings land in a cup dry 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.670
 much, much faster this way 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.980
 therefore, watering is sometimes necessary if 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.319
 sunny for the year is 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.689
 have to 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.810
 you every day if it becomes on the street 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.680
 cloudy weather then of course much less 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.129
 must watch 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.459
 constantly follow and watch the seedlings 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:31.030
 greenhouses so if you live somewhere 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.010
 far from further and so on who's that 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.469
 It will be problematic and if 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.329
 of course you live near 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:39.329
 the best option is hardening 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:44.639
 seedlings in the greenhouse as I say again 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:48.599
 but in any case, it must be necessary 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:51.250
 temper here and here with me 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.310
 tall seedlings that I will 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:59.019
 plant in the greenhouse and how can 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:02.949
 look here here I have already taken out 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:05.340
 seedlings that will land in 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:07.840
 open ground she too now 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.049
 ordered she will stand still home 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.669
 longer a couple more weeks and this is literally 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.019
 in a few days I'll be there 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:17.620
 land already in a permanent place 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.220
 as you 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.759
 if you grow seedlings necessarily 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.530
 kill it and before you land it 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:30.909
 always give extra effect 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.340
 which affects further on 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:36.419
 the harvest is probably all in principle 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.609
 no difficulty for kalsa world seedling 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:43.680
 either on the balcony or in the greenhouse but 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.680
 be sure to do it bye
