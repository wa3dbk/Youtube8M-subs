00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.250
 explain it to you too so I'm going to give 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.850
 step to how to install this topic not what 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.050
 we have to do is select 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.420

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.100
 blue eyes and blue eyes that have us 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.130
 the same name so we selected it 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.460
 we both give in copy and we're going to 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.679
 go to operating system is worth our 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.219
 local disk c we go to windows 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.549
