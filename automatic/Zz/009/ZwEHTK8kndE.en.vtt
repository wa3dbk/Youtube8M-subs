see<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.550> lost<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.969> couple<00:00:51.120> seconds<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.719> should

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
see I lost a couple seconds I should

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.770 
see I lost a couple seconds I should
have<00:00:52.020> been<00:00:52.140> faster<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:53.250> after<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> good

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
have been faster so after you get a good

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.860 
have been faster so after you get a good
number<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.140> villagers<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.420> bushes

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
number of villagers going on the bushes

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.720 
number of villagers going on the bushes
then<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.379> want<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.680> start<00:00:58.920> adding<00:00:59.160> some<00:00:59.489> food

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
then you want to start adding some food

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.220 
then you want to start adding some food
so<00:01:00.149> right<00:01:00.329> now<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
so right now you can see I have a

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.260 
so right now you can see I have a
population<00:01:01.530> at<00:01:02.039> ten<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.609> am<00:01:02.670> starting<00:01:03.030> to

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
population at ten and I am starting to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.390 
population at ten and I am starting to
add<00:01:03.420> my<00:01:03.780> first<00:01:03.989> villagers<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:05.159> start

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
add my first villagers to start

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.359 
add my first villagers to start
gathering<00:01:05.700> wood<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:07.229> idea<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.979> want

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
gathering wood the idea is that you want

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.520 
gathering wood the idea is that you want
to<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.970> enough<00:01:09.360> food<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.229> can<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.500> a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
to get enough food and you can have a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.010 
to get enough food and you can have a
stable<00:01:10.950> population<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.150> then<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.659> switch

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
stable population and then you switch

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.820 
stable population and then you switch
all<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.920> your<00:01:14.490> villagers<00:01:14.850> later<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:16.320> wood

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
all of your villagers later on to wood

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.370 
all of your villagers later on to wood
because<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.670> idea<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.299> quest<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.869> simply

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
because the idea of this quest is simply

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.289 
because the idea of this quest is simply
just<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.710> make<00:01:19.860> 10<00:01:20.070> farms<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.640> under<00:01:21.090> five

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
just to make 10 farms on under five

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.230 
just to make 10 farms on under five
minutes<00:01:21.950> one<00:01:22.950> thing<00:01:23.189> I'm<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.640> say<00:01:23.759> is

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
minutes one thing I'm going to say is

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.060 
minutes one thing I'm going to say is
that<00:01:24.450> i<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.840> an<00:01:25.020> advisor<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.740> right<00:01:26.040> now

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
that i have an advisor on right now

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.200 
that i have an advisor on right now
which<00:01:26.670> lowers<00:01:27.270> my<00:01:28.640> resources<00:01:29.640> needed<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.939> make

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
which lowers my resources needed to make

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.480 
which lowers my resources needed to make
buildings<00:01:30.689> by<00:01:30.869> eight<00:01:31.110> percent<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.920> increases

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
buildings by eight percent and increases

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.490 
buildings by eight percent and increases
the<00:01:32.520> building<00:01:32.970> speed<00:01:33.270> by<00:01:33.600> eight<00:01:33.840> percent<00:01:34.290> as

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the building speed by eight percent as

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.190 
the building speed by eight percent as
well<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.939> making<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> little<00:01:36.840> easier

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
well so it's making this a little easier

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.790 
well so it's making this a little easier
than<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.070> normally<00:01:38.189> would

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
than it normally would

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.440 
than it normally would
me<00:01:38.860> and<00:01:39.100> I<00:01:39.190> suggest<00:01:39.640> if<00:01:39.790> you<00:01:39.940> can<00:01:40.120> get<00:01:40.300> this

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
me and I suggest if you can get this

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.810 
me and I suggest if you can get this
advisor<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:41.260> can't<00:01:41.740> remember<00:01:41.830> i<00:01:42.190> think<00:01:42.580> i<00:01:42.670> got

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
advisor I can't remember i think i got

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.000 
advisor I can't remember i think i got
it<00:01:42.880> from<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.210> chest<00:01:43.540> then<00:01:44.410> you<00:01:44.710> should

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
it from a chest then you should

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.850 
it from a chest then you should
definitely<00:01:45.160> add<00:01:45.610> it<00:01:45.820> because<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.360> helps<00:01:46.720> so<00:01:47.710> as

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
definitely add it because it helps so as

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.370 
definitely add it because it helps so as
you<00:01:47.950> can<00:01:48.070> see<00:01:48.220> right<00:01:48.250> now<00:01:48.430> i'm<00:01:48.730> up<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.450> 13

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
you can see right now i'm up to 13

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.010

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
right now but I'm pretty sure it's above

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.970 
right now but I'm pretty sure it's above
15<00:03:51.840> I'm<00:03:52.400> not<00:03:53.400> sure<00:03:53.459> why<00:03:54.080> but<00:03:55.080> I<00:03:55.170> set<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.410> second

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
15 I'm not sure why but I set a second

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.449 
15 I'm not sure why but I set a second
and<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.430> third<00:03:56.459> villager<00:03:57.120> right<00:03:57.330> now<00:03:57.480> on<00:03:57.810> the

and a third villager right now on the
start<00:03:59.459> building<00:03:59.850> farms<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:01.140> idea<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.560> that

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
start building farms the idea is that

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.310 
start building farms the idea is that
one<00:04:02.190> villager<00:04:02.760> or<00:04:02.940> this<00:04:03.360> is<00:04:03.480> my<00:04:03.600> expanded<00:04:04.140> lazy

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
one villager or this is my expanded lazy

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.740

and<00:04:04.500> age<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.770> empires<00:04:05.070> to<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:06.060> one<00:04:06.239> villager

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
and age of empires to that one villager

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.270 
and age of empires to that one villager
builds<00:04:07.140> quicker<00:04:07.560> than<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.800> whole<00:04:08.010> bunch<00:04:08.160> of

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
builds quicker than a whole bunch of

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.449 
builds quicker than a whole bunch of
villagers<00:04:09.080> so<00:04:10.080> you<00:04:10.800> want<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.100> set<00:04:11.280> one
