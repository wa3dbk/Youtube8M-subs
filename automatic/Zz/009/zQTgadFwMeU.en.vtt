hey<00:00:07.440> guys<00:00:07.740> I'm<00:00:08.130> we<00:00:08.760> are<00:00:09.059> back<00:00:09.420> with<00:00:09.690> episode<00:00:10.410> 2

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
hey guys I'm we are back with episode 2

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.720 
hey guys I'm we are back with episode 2
of<00:00:10.769> our<00:00:11.190> redstone<00:00:11.639> tutorials<00:00:13.250> last<00:00:14.250> episode

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
of our redstone tutorials last episode

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.730 
of our redstone tutorials last episode
we<00:00:14.910> just<00:00:14.940> got<00:00:15.269> through<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.719> basics<00:00:16.170> over<00:00:16.529> here

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
we just got through the basics over here

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.220 
we just got through the basics over here
and<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.789> episode<00:00:18.270> we're<00:00:18.510> going<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.720> do<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:19.140> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
and this episode we're going to do a a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.439 
and this episode we're going to do a a
bit<00:00:19.680> more<00:00:19.890> advanced<00:00:22.340> redstone<00:00:23.340> those<00:00:24.180> over

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
bit more advanced redstone those over

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.689 
bit more advanced redstone those over
there<00:00:24.539> will<00:00:24.720> be<00:00:24.840> for<00:00:25.019> our<00:00:25.050> other<00:00:25.199> episodes<00:00:25.699> but

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
there will be for our other episodes but

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.320 
there will be for our other episodes but
this<00:00:27.359> ones<00:00:27.599> where<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.529> focus<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.400> four<00:00:29.880> main

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
this ones where the focus on four main

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.229 
this ones where the focus on four main
gates<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.990> have<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.439> or<00:00:31.679> gate<00:00:32.009> up<00:00:32.579> there's<00:00:33.000> an

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
gates we have the or gate up there's an

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.000 
gates we have the or gate up there's an
or<00:00:33.420> gate<00:00:33.450> whenever<00:00:34.110> there's<00:00:34.410> something<00:00:34.710> above

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
or gate whenever there's something above

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.709 
or gate whenever there's something above
that<00:00:35.219> it's<00:00:35.430> basically<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.969> inverted<00:00:36.540> version

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
that it's basically the inverted version

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.959 
that it's basically the inverted version
but<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.440> called<00:00:38.040> something<00:00:38.190> else<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.850> I'll

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
but it's called something else so I'll

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.200 
but it's called something else so I'll
just<00:00:39.000> put<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.480> there<00:00:39.629> instead<00:00:40.640> here's<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.790> XOR

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
just put it there instead here's the XOR

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.000 
just put it there instead here's the XOR
gate<00:00:42.420> there's<00:00:42.660> an<00:00:42.809> X<00:00:42.989> nor<00:00:43.260> gate<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:43.829> just

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
gate there's an X nor gate but it's just

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.610 
gate there's an X nor gate but it's just
massive<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.940> almost<00:00:45.420> not<00:00:45.750> need<00:00:45.960> adult<00:00:46.230> like

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
massive and almost not need adult like

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.680 
massive and almost not need adult like
all<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.250> will<00:00:47.399> L<00:00:47.579> really<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.300> at<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> end

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
all you will L really is is at the end

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.150 
all you will L really is is at the end
of<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.890> goes<00:00:50.190> into<00:00:51.829> like<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> wire<00:00:53.129> that

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
of this this goes into like a wire that

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.310 
of this this goes into like a wire that
goes<00:00:53.640> into<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.059> block<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.329> inverts<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.079> at<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
goes into a block that inverts it at the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.860 
goes into a block that inverts it at the
end<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.340> saw<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.670> last<00:00:56.820> video<00:00:57.390> an

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
end and if you saw the last video an

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.130 
end and if you saw the last video an
inverter<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.980> just<00:00:59.309> this<00:01:00.140> basically

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
inverter is just this basically

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.280 
inverter is just this basically
transfers<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.180> inverts<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.180> power<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
transfers the inverts the power to the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.570 
transfers the inverts the power to the
opposite<00:01:04.920> power<00:01:05.189> source<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.549> what<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:07.580> so

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
opposite power source of what it is so

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.600 
opposite power source of what it is so
first<00:01:08.970> off<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.570> an<00:01:09.780> or<00:01:09.990> gate<00:01:10.400> which<00:01:11.400> is

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
first off we have an or gate which is

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.370 
first off we have an or gate which is
I'm<00:01:11.760> pretty<00:01:12.030> simple<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.840> got<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
I'm pretty simple and you just got to

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.609 
I'm pretty simple and you just got to
power<00:01:13.590> sources<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.310> into<00:01:14.520> one<00:01:14.700> block<00:01:15.619> that

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
power sources going into one block that

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.130 
power sources going into one block that
this<00:01:16.950> dot<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.640> dot<00:01:17.700> once<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.780> chip<00:01:18.960> they

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
this dot this dot once the chip they

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.140 
this dot this dot once the chip they
change<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.590> red<00:01:19.770> stone<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.790> way<00:01:21.000> its

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
change the red stone so that way its

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.910 
change the red stone so that way its
dots<00:01:21.420> instead<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.930> before<00:01:22.140> used<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:22.830> be

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
dots instead of before used to just be

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.850 
dots instead of before used to just be
like<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.070> cross<00:01:23.540> but<00:01:24.540> it'll<00:01:25.229> still<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:25.500> powered

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
like a cross but it'll still be powered

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.899 
like a cross but it'll still be powered
even<00:01:26.070> though<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.220> doesn't<00:01:26.340> look<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.549> it'll

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
even though it doesn't look like it'll

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.200 
even though it doesn't look like it'll
be<00:01:27.000> take<00:01:27.240> power<00:01:27.450> see<00:01:27.840> um<00:01:28.729> Brad<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.850> or<00:01:30.030> gate

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
be take power see um Brad this or gate

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.770 
be take power see um Brad this or gate
basically<00:01:31.400> only<00:01:32.400> once<00:01:32.790> or<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.180> will<00:01:33.329> activate

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
basically only once or so will activate

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.980 
basically only once or so will activate
it<00:01:33.960> at<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.320> time<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.360> haven't<00:01:36.659> both<00:01:36.810> up

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
it at a time so if I haven't both up

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.649 
it at a time so if I haven't both up
like<00:01:37.369> one<00:01:38.369> will<00:01:38.460> be<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.180> one<00:01:39.390> will<00:01:39.509> do

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
like one will be on this one will do

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.760 
like one will be on this one will do
nothing<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.750> pretty<00:01:42.750> much<00:01:42.810> that's

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
nothing so like pretty much that's

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.080 
nothing so like pretty much that's
pretty<00:01:44.130> much<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.640> i<00:01:44.820> mean<00:01:44.850> it's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
pretty much what it is i mean it's

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.929 
pretty much what it is i mean it's
pretty<00:01:45.299> simple<00:01:46.220> select<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.369> one<00:01:47.399> stuck<00:01:47.729> on

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
pretty simple select that one stuck on

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.580 
pretty simple select that one stuck on
but<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.570> block<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.049> block<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.350> still

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
but this block this block is still

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.679 
but this block this block is still
constantly<00:01:50.130> being<00:01:50.399> powered<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.119> one<00:01:51.329> no

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
constantly being powered so this one no

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.899 
constantly being powered so this one no
matter<00:01:51.840> what<00:01:52.159> it'll<00:01:53.159> stay<00:01:53.369> constantly

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
matter what it'll stay constantly

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.859 
matter what it'll stay constantly
powered<00:01:55.969> on<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.119> one<00:01:57.240> up<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:57.509> basically

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
powered on this one up here basically

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.719 
powered on this one up here basically
inverter<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.130> goes<00:01:59.280> into<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.520> block

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
inverter is just it goes into a block

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.270 
inverter is just it goes into a block
which<00:02:00.299> has<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> redstone<00:02:01.500> torch<00:02:01.740> at<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> end

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
which has a redstone torch at the end

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.069 
which has a redstone torch at the end
which<00:02:02.460> it'll<00:02:02.880> turn<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.420> off<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.810> i<00:02:03.930> got

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
which it'll turn it on and off and i got

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.160 
which it'll turn it on and off and i got
stuck<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.469> door<00:02:05.210> this<00:02:06.210> one<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.630> more<00:02:06.869> used

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
stuck in a door this one is more used

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.960 
stuck in a door this one is more used
for<00:02:07.530> things<00:02:07.740> where<00:02:08.069> like<00:02:08.099> say<00:02:08.429> they<00:02:08.580> have<00:02:08.759> to

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
for things where like say they have to

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.710 
for things where like say they have to
go

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
go

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.460 
go
um<00:02:11.390> if<00:02:12.390> they<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:14.690> like<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:16.170> know<00:02:16.200> if<00:02:16.380> you

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
um if they have to like you know if you

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.810 
um if they have to like you know if you
have<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.620> map<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.100> there's<00:02:17.220> two<00:02:17.430> switches

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
have a map and there's two switches

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.420 
have a map and there's two switches
inside<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.480> wall<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.080> like<00:02:19.860> yet<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.250> find

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
inside the wall and like yet to find

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.800 
inside the wall and like yet to find
like<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.910> entrance<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.480> their<00:02:21.600> two<00:02:21.780> rooms

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
like the entrance to their two rooms

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.480 
like the entrance to their two rooms
yeah<00:02:24.810> pretty<00:02:25.170> much<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.100> have<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.340> have

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
yeah pretty much like you have to have

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.090 
yeah pretty much like you have to have
one<00:02:26.700> switch<00:02:27.380> like<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.620> have<00:02:28.710> to<00:02:28.800> have<00:02:28.950> them

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
one switch like you have to have them

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.350 
one switch like you have to have them
both<00:02:29.580> on<00:02:29.850> or<00:02:30.410> both<00:02:31.410> up<00:02:31.650> off<00:02:32.030> whatever<00:02:33.030> like<00:02:33.270> you

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
both on or both up off whatever like you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.560 
both on or both up off whatever like you
have<00:02:33.540> them<00:02:33.660> default<00:02:34.050> on<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:35.150> like<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.330> map

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
have them default on and like the map

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.970 
have them default on and like the map
there<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.140> flip<00:02:37.350> one<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.740> they<00:02:37.800> have<00:02:37.890> to

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
there to the flip one and they have to

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.530 
there to the flip one and they have to
go<00:02:38.100> find<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.460> other<00:02:38.580> switch<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.060> know<00:02:39.240> and

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
go find the other switch you know and

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.030 
go find the other switch you know and
then<00:02:39.690> they<00:02:39.810> have<00:02:39.960> like<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.140> secret<00:02:40.410> door<00:02:40.710> open

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
then they have like a secret door open

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.160 
then they have like a secret door open
or<00:02:41.130> something<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.520> know<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.870> that's<00:02:43.020> pretty

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
or something you know so that's pretty

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.990 
or something you know so that's pretty
much<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.350> inverted<00:02:43.800> version<00:02:43.950> here<00:02:44.670> we<00:02:44.850> have

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
much the inverted version here we have

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.520 
much the inverted version here we have
an<00:02:45.150> xor<00:02:45.660> gate<00:02:47.450> basically<00:02:48.450> both<00:02:48.780> switches<00:02:49.080> will

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
an xor gate basically both switches will

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.740 
an xor gate basically both switches will
activate<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.190> same<00:02:50.400> door<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.180> no<00:02:51.450> matter<00:02:51.600> what

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
activate the same door so no matter what

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.910 
activate the same door so no matter what
like<00:02:52.220> if<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.430> one's<00:02:53.640> on<00:02:53.850> then<00:02:54.660> they<00:02:55.080> both

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
like if this one's on then they both

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.750 
like if this one's on then they both
activate<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.209> this<00:02:57.900> one<00:02:58.170> when<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.160> torches

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
activate it so this one when it torches

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.790 
activate it so this one when it torches
off<00:02:59.910> there's<00:03:00.570> basically<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:00.959> usually<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.410> poem

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
off there's basically is usually a poem

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.740 
off there's basically is usually a poem
it's<00:03:02.040> always<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.459> power<00:03:02.850> source<00:03:03.120> going<00:03:03.480> into

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
it's always a power source going into

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.130 
it's always a power source going into
the<00:03:03.840> block<00:03:04.080> which<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:05.390> powering<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.540> torch<00:03:06.900> off

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
the block which is powering it torch off

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.199 
the block which is powering it torch off
if<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.130> get<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:09.020> but<00:03:10.020> so<00:03:10.950> technically<00:03:11.700> right

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
if you get that but so technically right

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.660 
if you get that but so technically right
now<00:03:12.360> this<00:03:12.600> this<00:03:12.810> levers<00:03:13.769> off<00:03:14.070> and<00:03:14.400> this<00:03:14.459> one's

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
now this this levers off and this one's

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.780 
now this this levers off and this one's
off<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:15.120> as<00:03:15.480> they're<00:03:15.989> both<00:03:16.140> off<00:03:16.400> this<00:03:17.400> one<00:03:17.670> can

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
off so as they're both off this one can

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.479 
off so as they're both off this one can
power<00:03:18.030> both<00:03:18.480> them<00:03:18.780> this<00:03:19.739> one<00:03:19.980> can<00:03:20.130> power<00:03:20.310> both

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
power both them this one can power both

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.830 
power both them this one can power both
of<00:03:20.640> them<00:03:22.790> but<00:03:23.790> we<00:03:23.910> can<00:03:24.060> power<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.450> door<00:03:24.660> and

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
of them but we can power the door and

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.229 
of them but we can power the door and
then<00:03:25.440> if<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.800> one's<00:03:26.010> left<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:26.550> which<00:03:27.030> means

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
then if that one's left on which means

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.790 
then if that one's left on which means
the<00:03:27.360> power<00:03:27.510> sources<00:03:27.780> off<00:03:28.019> this<00:03:28.410> one<00:03:28.620> will

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
the power sources off this one will

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.900 
the power sources off this one will
still<00:03:29.010> work<00:03:30.260> pretty<00:03:31.260> simple<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.390> gate

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
still work pretty simple the and gate

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.470 
still work pretty simple the and gate
was<00:03:35.910> just<00:03:36.450> can't<00:03:36.630> gate<00:03:37.140> and<00:03:37.739> some<00:03:38.060> they<00:03:39.060> pretty

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
was just can't gate and some they pretty

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.780 
was just can't gate and some they pretty
much<00:03:39.570> they<00:03:39.810> both<00:03:39.989> have<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.290> be<00:03:40.470> they<00:03:41.430> both<00:03:41.610> have

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
much they both have to be they both have

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.759 
much they both have to be they both have
both<00:03:42.299> switches<00:03:42.540> have<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.900> be<00:03:43.019> on<00:03:43.260> by<00:03:43.530> default

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
both switches have to be on by default

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.740 
both switches have to be on by default
it's<00:03:44.250> kind<00:03:44.430> of<00:03:44.549> like<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:45.200> or<00:03:46.200> gate<00:03:46.850> just<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.970> more

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
it's kind of like a or gate just a more

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.100 
it's kind of like a or gate just a more
complicated<00:03:49.170> I'd<00:03:49.650> say<00:03:50.690> that's<00:03:51.690> pretty<00:03:51.840> much

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
complicated I'd say that's pretty much

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.920 
complicated I'd say that's pretty much
what<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.380> is<00:03:52.850> over<00:03:53.850> here<00:03:54.060> we<00:03:54.180> have<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.390> pretty

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
what it is over here we have a pretty

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.570 
what it is over here we have a pretty
much<00:03:55.140> like<00:03:55.590> one<00:03:55.739> of<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:55.890> main<00:03:56.100> things<00:03:56.130> if

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
much like one of the main things if

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.100 
much like one of the main things if
you're<00:03:56.730> looking<00:03:57.120> forward<00:03:57.330> to<00:03:57.510> creating<00:03:57.810> like

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
you're looking forward to creating like

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.710 
you're looking forward to creating like
a<00:03:58.140> huge<00:03:58.530> red<00:03:58.799> stone<00:03:59.070> thing<00:03:59.370> or<00:04:00.269> like<00:04:00.480> say<00:04:00.660> you

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
a huge red stone thing or like say you

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.990 
a huge red stone thing or like say you
want<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.019> make<00:04:01.170> over<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.470> them<00:04:01.769> like<00:04:01.920> piston<00:04:02.459> TV

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
want to make over to them like piston TV

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.960 
want to make over to them like piston TV
this<00:04:03.959> is<00:04:04.140> like<00:04:04.290> one<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.650> most<00:04:04.920> like<00:04:05.160> things

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
this is like one of the most like things

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.160 
this is like one of the most like things
that<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.239> wouldn't<00:04:06.390> this<00:04:06.780> is<00:04:06.870> one<00:04:07.019> of<00:04:07.049> the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
that you wouldn't this is one of the

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.330 
that you wouldn't this is one of the
biggest<00:04:07.260> things<00:04:07.530> you'll<00:04:07.680> need<00:04:07.799> to<00:04:07.920> know<00:04:07.980> as<00:04:08.310> a

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
biggest things you'll need to know as a

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.090 
biggest things you'll need to know as a
memory<00:04:08.580> latch<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:09.750> basically<00:04:10.290> if<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.650> click<00:04:10.920> the

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
memory latch so basically if I click the

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.340 
memory latch so basically if I click the
switch

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
switch

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.560 
switch
it<00:04:12.860> has<00:04:13.400> gone<00:04:13.670> through<00:04:13.940> that<00:04:14.060> one<00:04:14.270> tick<00:04:14.540> that

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
it has gone through that one tick that

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.540 
it has gone through that one tick that
the<00:04:14.840> button<00:04:15.110> makes<00:04:15.350> turn<00:04:16.100> this<00:04:16.250> redstone

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:16.550 
the button makes turn this redstone

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.320 
the button makes turn this redstone
torch<00:04:16.850> off<00:04:18.340> which<00:04:19.340> makes<00:04:19.580> this<00:04:19.700> power<00:04:19.910> line<00:04:20.180> go

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
torch off which makes this power line go

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.240 
torch off which makes this power line go
off<00:04:20.480> and<00:04:20.660> let's<00:04:20.780> make<00:04:20.900> this<00:04:21.110> torch<00:04:21.440> go<00:04:21.620> on<00:04:21.830> and

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
off and let's make this torch go on and

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.700 
off and let's make this torch go on and
it's<00:04:22.760> basically<00:04:23.150> stuck<00:04:23.510> like<00:04:23.690> that<00:04:23.750> until<00:04:24.650> you

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
it's basically stuck like that until you

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.000 
it's basically stuck like that until you
go<00:04:24.980> over<00:04:25.100> here<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:27.470> have<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.710> go<00:04:27.830> like

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
go over here and you have to go like

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.810 
go over here and you have to go like
your<00:04:28.340> pet<00:04:28.700> to<00:04:28.730> press<00:04:29.150> this<00:04:29.300> one<00:04:30.460> usually<00:04:31.460> how

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
your pet to press this one usually how

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.760 
your pet to press this one usually how
they<00:04:32.000> use<00:04:32.210> this<00:04:32.420> is<00:04:32.690> like<00:04:32.960> say<00:04:33.290> if<00:04:33.350> you<00:04:33.500> have<00:04:33.740> a

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
they use this is like say if you have a

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.940 
they use this is like say if you have a
power<00:04:34.070> source<00:04:34.310> going<00:04:34.640> through<00:04:35.650> like<00:04:36.650> this

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
power source going through like this

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.970 
power source going through like this
thing<00:04:37.190> and<00:04:38.150> something<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.380> they<00:04:39.620> like<00:04:39.770> then

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
thing and something and they like then

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.470 
thing and something and they like then
the<00:04:40.070> power<00:04:40.220> source<00:04:40.400> consider<00:04:40.790> again<00:04:41.030> it<00:04:41.270> won't

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
the power source consider again it won't

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.000 
the power source consider again it won't
affect<00:04:41.780> it<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:43.450> like<00:04:44.450> say<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.500> same<00:04:45.800> thing

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
affect it and like say the same thing

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.470 
affect it and like say the same thing
with<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.160> switch<00:04:46.460> but<00:04:46.670> except<00:04:46.940> for<00:04:46.970> switches

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
with the switch but except for switches

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:55.090 
with the switch but except for switches
a<00:04:47.510> little<00:04:47.750> bit<00:04:47.900> oh<00:04:48.080> gosh<00:04:48.380> rain<00:04:48.830> hold<00:04:49.460> on<00:04:54.100> sorry

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
a little bit oh gosh rain hold on sorry

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.370 
a little bit oh gosh rain hold on sorry
that<00:04:55.670> ring<00:04:55.910> I<00:04:56.120> hate<00:04:56.390> the<00:04:56.510> noise<00:04:56.660> like<00:04:57.080> it's

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
that ring I hate the noise like it's

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.940 
that ring I hate the noise like it's
really<00:04:57.470> loud<00:04:57.710> but<00:04:59.350> still<00:05:00.350> I<00:05:00.440> got<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.740> switch

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
really loud but still I got the switch

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.680 
really loud but still I got the switch
it'll<00:05:01.280> be<00:05:01.490> glitchy<00:05:01.730> if<00:05:01.970> you<00:05:02.090> both<00:05:02.270> if<00:05:02.480> you<00:05:02.570> have

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
it'll be glitchy if you both if you have

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.980 
it'll be glitchy if you both if you have
them<00:05:02.780> both<00:05:02.930> on<00:05:03.790> then<00:05:04.790> you<00:05:05.090> know<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.600> torches

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
them both on then you know the torches

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.480 
them both on then you know the torches
are<00:05:06.110> off<00:05:06.230> but<00:05:06.440> the<00:05:06.560> power<00:05:06.770> sources<00:05:07.130> are<00:05:07.370> on

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
are off but the power sources are on

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.460 
are off but the power sources are on
because<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.090> power<00:05:08.270> went<00:05:08.600> backwards<00:05:09.200> and

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
because the power went backwards and

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.710 
because the power went backwards and
each<00:05:09.560> set<00:05:09.800> into<00:05:10.040> one<00:05:10.160> of<00:05:10.280> these<00:05:10.570> it's<00:05:11.570> on

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
each set into one of these it's on

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.780 
each set into one of these it's on
pretty<00:05:11.960> much<00:05:12.170> all<00:05:12.470> that<00:05:12.980> like<00:05:13.220> change<00:05:13.550> but

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
pretty much all that like change but

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:20.650 
pretty much all that like change but
still<00:05:14.180> like<00:05:15.640> see<00:05:16.640> it<00:05:16.880> gets<00:05:17.210> stuck<00:05:17.420> on<00:05:19.660> then

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
still like see it gets stuck on then

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.660 
still like see it gets stuck on then
yeah<00:05:21.290> that's<00:05:21.740> pretty<00:05:21.950> much<00:05:22.070> it<00:05:22.220> for<00:05:22.400> this

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
yeah that's pretty much it for this

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:29.260 
yeah that's pretty much it for this
episode<00:05:23.350> episode<00:05:24.350> 2<00:05:24.890> of<00:05:24.920> a<00:05:25.340> redstone<00:05:25.940> so<00:05:26.420> oh<00:05:28.270> oh

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
episode episode 2 of a redstone so oh oh

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.690 
episode episode 2 of a redstone so oh oh
like<00:05:30.140> did<00:05:30.590> I<00:05:30.620> show<00:05:30.800> you<00:05:30.860> this<00:05:31.040> it's<00:05:31.490> pretty

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
like did I show you this it's pretty

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.220 
like did I show you this it's pretty
much<00:05:31.850> the<00:05:31.940> same<00:05:32.180> thing<00:05:32.240> that's<00:05:32.600> below<00:05:32.900> its

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
much the same thing that's below its

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.620 
much the same thing that's below its
Justin<00:05:33.590> well<00:05:34.220> this<00:05:34.370> one's<00:05:34.580> not<00:05:34.790> inverted<00:05:35.300> this

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
Justin well this one's not inverted this

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.580 
Justin well this one's not inverted this
time<00:05:35.840> this<00:05:36.380> one<00:05:36.590> is<00:05:36.740> inverted<00:05:38.200> this<00:05:39.200> should<00:05:39.440> be

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
time this one is inverted this should be

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.610 
time this one is inverted this should be
an<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:40.460> gate<00:05:40.670> I<00:05:41.030> think<00:05:41.300> any<00:05:41.780> Andy<00:05:42.140> and<00:05:42.380> the

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
an and gate I think any Andy and the

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.470 
an and gate I think any Andy and the
other<00:05:42.770> one<00:05:42.890> should<00:05:43.190> be<00:05:43.220> and<00:05:43.490> one<00:05:44.120> it's<00:05:44.330> like

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 
other one should be and one it's like

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.480 
other one should be and one it's like
one<00:05:44.840> of<00:05:44.960> those<00:05:45.080> but<00:05:45.410> and<00:05:47.350> these<00:05:48.350> and<00:05:48.980> in<00:05:49.280> the

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
one of those but and these and in the

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.160 
one of those but and these and in the
end<00:05:49.610> whatever<00:05:49.850> or<00:05:50.210> I'd<00:05:50.630> say<00:05:50.900> pretty<00:05:51.080> much

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
end whatever or I'd say pretty much

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.490 
end whatever or I'd say pretty much
exactly<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.710> same<00:05:51.920> as<00:05:52.070> this<00:05:52.220> cuz<00:05:52.550> look<00:05:53.500> like

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
exactly the same as this cuz look like

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.320 
exactly the same as this cuz look like
you<00:05:54.650> know<00:05:54.770> only<00:05:54.950> one<00:05:55.310> switch<00:05:55.610> can<00:05:55.820> power<00:05:56.030> it<00:05:56.210> at

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
you know only one switch can power it at

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.200 
you know only one switch can power it at
a<00:05:56.420> time<00:05:56.450> if<00:05:56.960> if<00:05:57.290> the<00:05:57.530> other<00:05:57.620> ones<00:05:57.830> off<00:05:58.030> so<00:05:59.030> like

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
a time if if the other ones off so like

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.210 
a time if if the other ones off so like
safe<00:05:59.840> they're<00:06:00.050> both<00:06:00.200> on<00:06:00.350> right<00:06:00.530> now<00:06:00.560> nothing

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
safe they're both on right now nothing

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.040 
safe they're both on right now nothing
will<00:06:01.340> happen<00:06:02.710> like<00:06:03.710> that<00:06:03.980> one's<00:06:04.340> on<00:06:05.050> even

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
will happen like that one's on even

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.410 
will happen like that one's on even
though<00:06:06.140> they<00:06:06.230> don't<00:06:06.290> weigh<00:06:06.410> on

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
though they don't weigh on

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.810 
though they don't weigh on
I<00:06:07.480> guess<00:06:08.260> it<00:06:08.440> will<00:06:08.560> still<00:06:09.130> work<00:06:09.160> it's<00:06:09.490> just<00:06:09.670> not

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
I guess it will still work it's just not

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.120 
I guess it will still work it's just not
