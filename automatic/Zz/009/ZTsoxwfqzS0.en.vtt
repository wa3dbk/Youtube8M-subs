00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
it I ended up thinking about for like

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.839 
it I ended up thinking about for like
over<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.609> year<00:00:27.560> maybe<00:00:28.560> not<00:00:28.800> exactly<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.550> color

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
over a year maybe not exactly this color

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.040 
over a year maybe not exactly this color
but<00:00:30.349> it<00:00:31.349> will<00:00:31.560> fade<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.279> oh<00:00:32.489> look<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.750> color<00:00:33.930> I

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
but it will fade and oh look the color I

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.740 
but it will fade and oh look the color I
wanted<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.760> but<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> always<00:00:36.090> wanted<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:36.719> a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
wanted to but I always wanted like a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.260 
wanted to but I always wanted like a
reddish<00:00:37.170> brown<00:00:37.530> color<00:00:37.559> now<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.120> little

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
reddish brown color now it's a little

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.229 
reddish brown color now it's a little
more<00:00:39.420> red<00:00:39.809> than<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.379> expected<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:41.940> my

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
more red than I expected it to be but my

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.869 
more red than I expected it to be but my
hair<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.960> actually<00:00:43.440> lighter<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.190> some<00:00:44.460> areas

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
hair is actually lighter in some areas

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.760 
hair is actually lighter in some areas
and<00:00:45.210> darker<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.629> some<00:00:45.840> areas<00:00:46.140> therefore<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
and darker in some areas therefore the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.889 
and darker in some areas therefore the
color<00:00:46.950> turned<00:00:47.250> out<00:00:47.430> kind<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.360> blend<00:00:48.750> of

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
color turned out kind of a blend of

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.600 
color turned out kind of a blend of
colors<00:00:49.230> which<00:00:49.469> actually<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.890> guess<00:00:50.070> looks<00:00:50.370> more

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
colors which actually I guess looks more

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.040 
colors which actually I guess looks more
natural<00:00:50.760> than<00:00:51.149> one<00:00:51.600> solid<00:00:51.960> color<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.730> so<00:00:54.050> I'll

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
natural than one solid color and so I'll

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.479 
natural than one solid color and so I'll
show<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.800> soon<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.059> ended<00:00:57.449> up<00:00:57.480> using<00:00:57.780> a

it all done my friend actually did it

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.080 
it all done my friend actually did it
because<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.890> didn't<00:01:40.890> want<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.400> do<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.060> my

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
because I I didn't want to do it on my

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.510 
because I I didn't want to do it on my
own<00:01:42.240> because<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:43.140> very<00:01:43.380> long<00:01:43.829> hair<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.490> I

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
own because I have very long hair so I

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.730 
own because I have very long hair so I
was<00:01:44.700> really<00:01:45.060> worried<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.509> missing<00:01:45.899> spots<00:01:46.140> she

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
was really worried of missing spots she

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.219 
was really worried of missing spots she
did<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> really<00:01:47.040> good<00:01:47.280> job<00:01:47.340> again<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.659> it

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
did a really good job again like it

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.920 
did a really good job again like it
might<00:01:49.560> look<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.130> missed<00:01:50.579> spots<00:01:50.729> or<00:01:51.390> she

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
might look like I missed spots or she

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.020 
might look like I missed spots or she
missed<00:01:52.140> spots<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:52.619> she<00:01:52.770> didn't<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.100> um<00:01:53.250> it's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
missed spots but she didn't it um it's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.539 
missed spots but she didn't it um it's
just<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.420> reflection<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.829> Sun<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.369> will

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
just the reflection of the Sun that will

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.080 
just the reflection of the Sun that will
bring<00:01:56.820> out<00:01:56.969> certain<00:01:57.180> parts<00:01:57.540> more<00:01:58.049> than<00:01:58.259> others

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
bring out certain parts more than others

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.850 
bring out certain parts more than others
so<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> guess<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.570> looks<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:01.079> little<00:02:01.259> bit<00:02:01.560> more

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
so I guess it looks a little bit more

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.109 
so I guess it looks a little bit more
natural<00:02:02.790> than<00:02:03.180> normal<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.040> do<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.759> like

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
natural than normal so I do have it like

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.910 
natural than normal so I do have it like
red<00:02:06.420> here<00:02:06.810> if<00:02:07.530> my<00:02:07.770> camera<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.160> picking<00:02:08.340> up<00:02:09.920> so

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
red here if my camera is picking up so

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.610 
red here if my camera is picking up so
yeah<00:02:11.160> um<00:02:11.700> my<00:02:12.690> mom<00:02:12.930> does<00:02:13.319> not

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
natural when I pull back because when

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.020 
natural when I pull back because when
the<00:04:01.680> Sun<00:04:01.889> hits<00:04:02.099> it<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:02.310> feel<00:04:02.609> like<00:04:02.639> it<00:04:02.879> looks

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
the Sun hits it I feel like it looks

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.629 
the Sun hits it I feel like it looks
maybe<00:04:03.569> my<00:04:03.989> natural<00:04:04.379> I've<00:04:04.560> no<00:04:04.799> idea

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
maybe my natural I've no idea
