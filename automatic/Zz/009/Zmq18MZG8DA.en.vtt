00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hi guys is welcome this is a 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.700
 appointment today we do a live blog 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.500
 that is, I show you what I have 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.370
 done this morning with hugo and veil 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.460
 comment 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.139
 then then this morning indeed 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.870
 as you can see above 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.520
 I decided to show me the progress 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.160
 which I did regarding 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.740
 feeding for hugo then how there 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.660
 I said at the beginning it was done everything 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.170
 however inside the cage therefore not 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.390
 however, he wanted to allow himself in the sense that 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.189
 in the cage he ate saliva on the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.989
 hand did everything though in the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.870
 moment in which he had to leave the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.760
 cage did not want to do it and this did not 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.440
 okay because the fact that he gets it 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.300
 above the hand is fine but then there is 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.489
 the next step than that too 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.649
 fundamental where it owes totally 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.660
 entrust and to do this we must do 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.550
 get out of his glass bell 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.510
 then this morning as you see I did 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.430
 a little something to see I put the food 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.840
 in my mouth, I practically did it 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.609
 get out of the cage 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.739
 look carefully as in moments 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.030
 he sees the hands scares this 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.129
 is associated with the speech he made 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.900
 on the last video that is their 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.970
 they can see different colors 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.070
 compared to ours automatically for 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.060
 their nails are conscious and here 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.430
 who are afraid 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.560
 see, however, the approach is quiet 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.810
 I know I eat it quietly and the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.479
 progress as it was for him 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.490
 he is doing out of the cage then 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.770
 so it means that anyway it starts 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.290
 already trusting more and this is the part 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.689
 fundamental later I want to try 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.479
 as I had already mentioned also to put 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.159
 the hand that is to make it rise on the hand for 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.860
 come and eat this way him 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.270
 would be totally out for the moment 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.520
 however this is good progress 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.430
 because you see is not afraid however here 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.869
 every now and then I have a beak part 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.950
 put it right to play it I see though 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.290
 anyway he 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.450
 basically start again entrust 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.840
 also good because 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.360
 he owes it to the end as I said he is 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.820
 there was sense in the cage now 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.189
 a part of it, therefore, 50 percent 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.750
 the one behind feels protected 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.099
 in front, instead, it is completely 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.290
 throwing at me I always said 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.569
 basically the breeding of a 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.390
 parrot is quite subjective 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.580
 one must have that delicacy of 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.380
 to perceive we say terminated marked in the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.110
 moment when I realized that he 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.819
 he trusted me but inside the cage to me 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.580
 not enough in the sense that in any case the 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.739
 total trust when he is at 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.720
 out of anger itself and this 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.540
 could be a great exercise that 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.450
 however, I recommend it because I repeat it 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.640
 then a part of himself comes out 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.450
 in this way he puts it in yours 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.310
 hands 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.290
 obviously you have to be attracted to a 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.810
 something in this case for in food 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.700
 see for everyone at the end of the food then 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.769
 slowly slowly you will see that however i 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.769
 results will be superior and different 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.950
 he continues undaunted to eat e 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.709
 without problems 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.319
 then a detail is noticed when i 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.660
 I put it I take the food to see how it does a 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.090
 watch you see this practically it 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.970
 it refers precisely to the non-ad hand 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.920
 the other you see the beak opens it for this 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.560
 reason why he is afraid anyway 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.260
 the rest sees how he plays as he knows 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.290
 it makes the study a bit likely to play yes 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.290
 fun 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.720
 so this test this water I 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.370
 I advise everyone because it is a 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.290
 good relationship in my opinion is a good one 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.329
 indeed method in order to establish a 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.090
 report I recommend 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.010
 close the windows important things 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.799
 because if unfortunately vico returns it 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.750
 and in the end, what's important I add e 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.819
 I take advantage of you guys you have to use the 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.040
 painters it is true that it is good to see 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.590
 the animal outside, however, are animals 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.349
 a gust of wind is instinctive 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.139
 noise a group of them birds 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.690
 escape and then do not return more then 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.299
 however, always put on the bibs 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.080
 many guys who signed up at 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.480
 group 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.480
 youtube that is just saw name 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.760
 they went out with their houses without 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.220
 Many bibs unfortunately told me 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.740
 who lost them ran away 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.120
 so I recommend using vectors 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.109
 do n't be fooled 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.720
 ok closed parentheses then you will see 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.800
 however I continue domestication in 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:29.100
 this way then it is important 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.830
 now I'll show you here too 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.550
 he always looks at the hand already looks 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.450
 always low because I also tried a 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.980
 to do it 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.780
 I think I also told you about it on the video 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.510
 I don't remember, I also tried a 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.240
 do it by putting your hand between my face 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.350
 and the cage then under him and 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.000
 let's say it came out however a little 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.830
 afraid I thought well of 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.020
 go a little slower 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.570
 and in fact he every time I have to go out 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.700
 look down to see if there is 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.580
 however the hand passed the problem 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.260
 of the hand is made but see also the 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.350
 made that he still still hesitates 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.870
 this demonstration that the parrots 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.300
 however or better the domestication 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.890
 of the parrots the approach that a being 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.410
 human can have with the parrot is 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.290
 subjective because it depends on them 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.900
 in the sense that in any case every parrot a 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.060
 with his way of seeing then 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.530
 I hope you enjoy this video 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.050
 it was useful however a funny thing 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.370
 I wanted to let you know 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.780
 directly the parenthesis live 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.430
 directly however the live of this one 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.780
 Today's experience I'll see you at 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.780
 next video and good headlights
