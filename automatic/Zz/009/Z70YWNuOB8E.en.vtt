hi everyone Jeremy sign me or 3d rivers

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.260 
hi everyone Jeremy sign me or 3d rivers
just<00:00:12.040> doing<00:00:12.220> some<00:00:12.400> experimentation<00:00:12.910> with<00:00:13.240> a

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.270 
just doing some experimentation with a

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.980 
just doing some experimentation with a
new<00:00:13.930> model<00:00:14.170> called<00:00:14.680> flexi<00:00:15.160> hand<00:00:15.430> and<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:16.750> wanted

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
new model called flexi hand and I wanted

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.630 
new model called flexi hand and I wanted
to<00:00:17.080> share<00:00:17.260> some<00:00:17.530> information<00:00:18.190> about<00:00:18.490> that

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
to share some information about that

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.990 
to share some information about that
this<00:00:19.420> is<00:00:19.480> a<00:00:19.890> proof<00:00:20.890> of<00:00:20.980> concept<00:00:21.130> not<00:00:21.670> really<00:00:21.970> a

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
this is a proof of concept not really a

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.250 
this is a proof of concept not really a
fully<00:00:22.180> working<00:00:22.510> prosthetic<00:00:23.080> though

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
fully working prosthetic though

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.759 
fully working prosthetic though
certainly<00:00:23.800> be<00:00:23.949> easy<00:00:24.220> to<00:00:25.109> turn<00:00:26.109> these<00:00:26.259> concepts

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
certainly be easy to turn these concepts

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.310 
certainly be easy to turn these concepts
into<00:00:27.099> one<00:00:27.310> this<00:00:28.269> was<00:00:28.480> developed<00:00:28.599> by<00:00:28.900> man<00:00:29.140> named

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
into one this was developed by man named

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.340 
into one this was developed by man named
Steve<00:00:29.560> wood<00:00:31.800> gyro<00:00:32.800> bottle<00:00:33.160> TV<00:00:33.400> and<00:00:34.290> what<00:00:35.290> I

Steve wood gyro bottle TV and what I

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.990 
Steve wood gyro bottle TV and what I
found<00:00:35.500> interesting<00:00:35.710> about<00:00:36.190> it<00:00:36.250> was<00:00:36.340> the<00:00:36.610> use

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
found interesting about it was the use

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.180 
found interesting about it was the use
of<00:00:37.210> incorporating<00:00:37.780> flexible<00:00:38.440> filament<00:00:38.680> into

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
of incorporating flexible filament into

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.720 
of incorporating flexible filament into
these<00:00:39.460> hinges<00:00:39.700> and<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.920> flexible<00:00:42.430> filament

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
these hinges and that flexible filament

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.090 
these hinges and that flexible filament
sort<00:00:43.390> of<00:00:43.450> handles<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.870> return<00:00:44.170> motion<00:00:44.649> on<00:00:44.920> the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
sort of handles the return motion on the

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.340 
sort of handles the return motion on the
fingers<00:00:45.489> so<00:00:46.059> that<00:00:46.090> you<00:00:46.239> don't<00:00:46.420> need<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.989> second

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
fingers so that you don't need a second

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.470 
fingers so that you don't need a second
set<00:00:47.559> of<00:00:47.620> chords<00:00:48.370> to<00:00:48.699> handle<00:00:48.969> that<00:00:49.120> return

supposed to be made with flexible

supposed to be made with flexible
filament<00:01:01.059> which<00:01:01.750> I<00:01:01.989> tried<00:01:02.379> and<00:01:02.769> I<00:01:03.699> wasn't

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
filament which I tried and I wasn't

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.700 
filament which I tried and I wasn't
convinced<00:01:04.930> that's<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.170> way<00:01:05.290> to<00:01:05.350> go<00:01:05.530> the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
convinced that's the way to go the

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.970 
convinced that's the way to go the
flexible<00:01:06.070> filament<00:01:06.340> has<00:01:06.730> too<00:01:07.660> much<00:01:07.840> give<00:01:08.740> to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
flexible filament has too much give to

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.310 
flexible filament has too much give to
it<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.820> instructions<00:01:10.390> do<00:01:10.840> call<00:01:11.110> the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
it the instructions do call the

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.230 
it the instructions do call the
prestretching<00:01:11.950> that<00:01:12.250> filament<00:01:12.580> as<00:01:12.909> much<00:01:13.090> as

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
prestretching that filament as much as

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.420 
prestretching that filament as much as
possible<00:01:13.450> which<00:01:13.900> I<00:01:14.020> did<00:01:14.229> and<00:01:14.470> that<00:01:14.950> does<00:01:15.159> help

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
possible which I did and that does help

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.910 
possible which I did and that does help
to<00:01:15.729> stretch<00:01:16.600> it<00:01:16.780> longer<00:01:17.200> so<00:01:17.229> that<00:01:17.500> it<00:01:17.590> doesn't

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
to stretch it longer so that it doesn't

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.340 
to stretch it longer so that it doesn't
have<00:01:18.040> as<00:01:18.220> much<00:01:18.340> remaining<00:01:18.759> elasticity<00:01:19.390> but<00:01:19.960> I

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
have as much remaining elasticity but I

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.810 
have as much remaining elasticity but I
found<00:01:20.650> that<00:01:20.830> there<00:01:20.979> was<00:01:21.130> still<00:01:21.430> too<00:01:21.700> much

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
found that there was still too much

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.569 
found that there was still too much
elasticity<00:01:22.360> in<00:01:22.720> it<00:01:22.869> such<00:01:23.439> that<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:24.310> finger

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
elasticity in it such that the finger

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.580 
elasticity in it such that the finger
certainly<00:01:24.939> closed<00:01:25.240> okay<00:01:25.689> but<00:01:25.960> not<00:01:26.170> with<00:01:26.439> a<00:01:26.470> lot

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
certainly closed okay but not with a lot

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.359 
certainly closed okay but not with a lot
of<00:01:27.060> gripping<00:01:28.060> force<00:01:28.270> so<00:01:29.200> I<00:01:29.229> actually<00:01:29.920> replaced

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
of gripping force so I actually replaced

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.429 
of gripping force so I actually replaced
the<00:01:30.820> flexible<00:01:31.329> filament<00:01:31.600> running<00:01:32.259> through

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
the flexible filament running through

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.850 
the flexible filament running through
the<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.890> channels<00:01:33.280> with<00:01:33.520> with<00:01:34.119> standard<00:01:34.869> cord

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
the the channels with with standard cord

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.760 
the the channels with with standard cord
like<00:01:36.310> what's<00:01:36.579> used<00:01:36.820> in<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.210> other<00:01:37.680> models<00:01:38.680> out

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
like what's used in the other models out

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.280 
like what's used in the other models out
there<00:01:38.829> like<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.189> cyborg<00:01:39.610> Beast<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:40.290> that

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
there like the cyborg Beast and that

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.990 
there like the cyborg Beast and that
seems<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.710> me<00:01:41.920> to<00:01:41.950> work<00:01:42.430> much<00:01:42.939> better

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
seems to me to work much better

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.620 
seems to me to work much better
a<00:01:44.030> much<00:01:44.600> tighter<00:01:45.560> tighter<00:01:46.100> grip<00:01:46.460> on<00:01:46.670> it<00:01:46.850> really

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
a much tighter tighter grip on it really

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.330 
a much tighter tighter grip on it really
was<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:47.870> lot<00:01:48.080> of<00:01:48.140> strength<00:01:48.500> than<00:01:48.740> this<00:01:48.890> which<00:01:49.130> is

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
was a lot of strength than this which is

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.770 
was a lot of strength than this which is
something<00:01:50.180> that<00:01:50.270> I<00:01:50.330> think<00:01:50.540> is<00:01:50.630> interesting

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
something that I think is interesting

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.170 
something that I think is interesting
about<00:01:51.230> the<00:01:51.410> model<00:01:51.710> one<00:01:51.830> of<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.180> advantages

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
about the model one of the advantages

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.660 
about the model one of the advantages
that<00:01:53.390> I<00:01:53.450> see<00:01:53.750> here<00:01:54.050> is<00:01:54.170> when<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.040> look<00:01:55.490> at<00:01:55.580> the

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
that I see here is when you look at the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.090 
that I see here is when you look at the
design<00:01:55.970> all<00:01:56.360> of<00:01:56.390> these<00:01:56.690> stress<00:01:57.080> points<00:01:57.530> really

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
design all of these stress points really

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.359 
design all of these stress points really
seem<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.430> be<00:01:58.550> within<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:58.970> hinges<00:01:59.390> and<00:02:00.369> the

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
seem to be within the hinges and the

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.520 
seem to be within the hinges and the
hinges<00:02:02.330> themselves<00:02:02.510> are<00:02:02.990> made<00:02:03.110> out<00:02:03.229> of<00:02:03.350> this

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
hinges themselves are made out of this

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.469 
hinges themselves are made out of this
this<00:02:03.800> flexible<00:02:04.430> film<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:04.910> I'll<00:02:05.000> take<00:02:05.210> one<00:02:05.360> out

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
this flexible film and I'll take one out

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:06.400 
this flexible film and I'll take one out
in<00:02:05.570> a<00:02:05.630> little<00:02:05.810> while<00:02:05.960> I'll<00:02:06.050> show<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:06.380> a

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
in a little while I'll show you a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.560 
in a little while I'll show you a
close-up<00:02:06.680> but<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:08.000> nice<00:02:08.149> thing<00:02:08.179> about<00:02:08.390> that

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
close-up but the nice thing about that

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.330 
close-up but the nice thing about that
is<00:02:08.869> that<00:02:08.899> that<00:02:09.170> flexible<00:02:09.590> filament<00:02:09.860> like<00:02:10.220> I

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
is that that flexible filament like I

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.340 
is that that flexible filament like I
said<00:02:10.520> as<00:02:10.820> much<00:02:10.850> as<00:02:11.180> I've<00:02:11.330> tried<00:02:11.630> I<00:02:11.900> can't<00:02:11.959> get

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
said as much as I've tried I can't get

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.620 
said as much as I've tried I can't get
the<00:02:12.470> stuff<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.830> break<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.280> seems<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.700> be<00:02:13.880> pretty

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
the stuff to break it seems to be pretty

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.560 
the stuff to break it seems to be pretty
near<00:02:14.959> unbreakable<00:02:15.590> stuff<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.330> so<00:02:17.330> that

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
near unbreakable stuff and so that

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.479 
near unbreakable stuff and so that
flexibility<00:02:18.230> combined<00:02:18.650> with<00:02:18.890> that<00:02:19.100> strength

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
flexibility combined with that strength

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.530 
flexibility combined with that strength
really<00:02:20.180> seems<00:02:20.570> to<00:02:20.660> work<00:02:20.840> nicely<00:02:21.730> in<00:02:22.730> those

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
really seems to work nicely in those

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.570 
really seems to work nicely in those
joints<00:02:24.050> where<00:02:24.230> all<00:02:24.410> of<00:02:24.590> those<00:02:24.770> those<00:02:25.250> tensions

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
joints where all of those those tensions

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.930 
joints where all of those those tensions
are<00:02:26.060> occurring<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.620> this<00:02:28.280> really<00:02:28.489> might<00:02:28.760> have

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
are occurring so this really might have

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.490 
are occurring so this really might have
some<00:02:29.090> interesting<00:02:29.540> potential<00:02:29.959> in

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
some interesting potential in

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.560 
some interesting potential in
incorporating<00:02:31.250> this<00:02:31.489> into<00:02:31.550> some<00:02:32.420> of<00:02:32.510> the

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
incorporating this into some of the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.360 
incorporating this into some of the
other<00:02:32.690> designs<00:02:33.200> there<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.980> are<00:02:34.070> already<00:02:34.190> out

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
other designs there that are already out

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.540 
other designs there that are already out
there<00:02:34.640> or<00:02:35.300> modifying<00:02:35.690> this<00:02:35.930> one<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.520> know

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
there or modifying this one so you know

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.640 
there or modifying this one so you know
again<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.970> idea<00:02:38.209> is<00:02:38.330> that<00:02:38.510> these<00:02:38.660> cords<00:02:39.440> the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
again the idea is that these cords the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.130 
again the idea is that these cords the
single<00:02:39.950> set<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.160> cords<00:02:40.580> pulls<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.600> fingers<00:02:41.930> in

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
single set of cords pulls the fingers in

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.920 
single set of cords pulls the fingers in
come<00:02:42.560> in<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:42.950> then<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.550> elastic<00:02:43.930> joints

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
come in and then the elastic joints

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.960 
come in and then the elastic joints
automatically<00:02:45.739> bring<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.340> fingers<00:02:46.790> back<00:02:46.910> to

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
automatically bring the fingers back to

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.190 
automatically bring the fingers back to
their<00:02:47.300> original

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
their original

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.970 
their original
just<00:02:49.099> because<00:02:49.400> of<00:02:49.550> that<00:02:49.670> elasticity<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:50.980> again

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
just because of that elasticity so again

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.000 
just because of that elasticity so again
the<00:02:52.160> hand<00:02:52.819> itself<00:02:53.209> is<00:02:53.540> pretty<00:02:54.020> much<00:02:54.200> one<00:02:54.410> solid

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
the hand itself is pretty much one solid

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.100 
the hand itself is pretty much one solid
piece<00:02:55.160> there<00:02:55.640> shaped<00:02:56.390> very<00:02:56.630> much<00:02:56.870> like<00:02:57.080> a

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
piece there shaped very much like a

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.530 
piece there shaped very much like a
human<00:02:57.349> palm<00:02:57.950> nice<00:02:58.340> curved<00:02:58.670> design<00:02:59.090> which<00:02:59.360> is

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
human palm nice curved design which is

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.320 
human palm nice curved design which is
about<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.840> very<00:02:59.930> very<00:03:00.410> nice<00:03:01.220> aesthetic<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.180> it

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
about a very very nice aesthetic to it

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.890 
about a very very nice aesthetic to it
the<00:03:03.040> thumb<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.310> fingers<00:03:05.209> themselves<00:03:05.780> are

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
the thumb and fingers themselves are

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.630 
the thumb and fingers themselves are
divided<00:03:06.410> into<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:06.860> different<00:03:07.130> challenges

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
divided into the different challenges

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.150 
divided into the different challenges
and<00:03:08.150> like<00:03:09.050> I<00:03:09.170> said<00:03:09.380> have<00:03:09.590> that<00:03:09.709> flexible

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
and like I said have that flexible

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.910 
and like I said have that flexible
filament<00:03:10.400> in<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.760> middle<00:03:11.060> so<00:03:11.290> really<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.440> the

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
filament in the middle so really the the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.500 
filament in the middle so really the the
plastic<00:03:13.370> parts<00:03:13.640> don't<00:03:13.880> really<00:03:14.090> get<00:03:14.239> a<00:03:14.300> whole

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
plastic parts don't really get a whole

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.160 
plastic parts don't really get a whole
lot<00:03:14.660> of<00:03:16.390> forces<00:03:17.390> that<00:03:17.540> would<00:03:17.660> cause<00:03:17.840> them<00:03:18.110> to

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
lot of forces that would cause them to

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.400 
lot of forces that would cause them to
to<00:03:18.800> break<00:03:19.040> seeing<00:03:19.610> an<00:03:19.760> ordinary<00:03:20.180> use<00:03:20.480> which<00:03:21.200> is

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
to break seeing an ordinary use which is

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.020 
to break seeing an ordinary use which is
why<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.040> seems<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.489> have<00:03:22.610> some<00:03:22.760> really

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
why this seems to have some really

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.050 
why this seems to have some really
interesting<00:03:23.180> potential<00:03:24.340> now<00:03:25.340> be<00:03:25.610> the

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
interesting potential now be the

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.059 
interesting potential now be the
obviously<00:03:26.480> design<00:03:26.950> modification<00:03:27.950> because

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
obviously design modification because

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.460 
obviously design modification because
there's<00:03:28.670> nowhere<00:03:29.330> currently<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.989> actually

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
there's nowhere currently to actually

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.780 
there's nowhere currently to actually
mount<00:03:30.709> this<00:03:31.069> this<00:03:31.280> would<00:03:31.430> have<00:03:31.580> to<00:03:31.760> be

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
mount this this would have to be

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.690 
mount this this would have to be
modified<00:03:32.690> into<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:33.049> design<00:03:33.380> much<00:03:34.220> like<00:03:34.459> the

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
modified into a design much like the

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.910 
modified into a design much like the
cyborg<00:03:35.540> Beast<00:03:35.690> of<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:35.989> town<00:03:36.230> or<00:03:36.530> those<00:03:36.680> others

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
cyborg Beast of the town or those others

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.680 
cyborg Beast of the town or those others
out<00:03:37.040> there<00:03:37.280> that<00:03:37.489> would<00:03:37.670> fit<00:03:38.450> in<00:03:38.540> with

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
out there that would fit in with

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.479 
out there that would fit in with
gauntlet<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:39.350> perhaps<00:03:39.920> using<00:03:40.130> Owens

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
gauntlet and perhaps using Owens

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.600 
gauntlet and perhaps using Owens
tensioner<00:03:40.970> system<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:42.019> I<00:03:42.890> think<00:03:43.400> you<00:03:43.489> could

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
tensioner system and I think you could

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.170 
tensioner system and I think you could
have<00:03:43.730> something<00:03:43.970> really<00:03:44.330> really<00:03:44.750> interesting

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
have something really really interesting

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.130 
have something really really interesting
okay<00:03:47.180> so<00:03:47.269> here<00:03:47.540> you<00:03:47.600> can<00:03:47.720> see<00:03:47.870> a<00:03:47.900> little<00:03:47.989> bit

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
okay so here you can see a little bit

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.280 
okay so here you can see a little bit
closer<00:03:48.380> up<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:50.290> cords<00:03:51.820> go<00:03:52.820> through<00:03:53.329> sort<00:03:54.230> of

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
closer up the cords go through sort of

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.050 
closer up the cords go through sort of
loop<00:03:54.500> around<00:03:54.859> through<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.370> fingertip<00:03:55.880> and

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
loop around through the fingertip and

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.569 
loop around through the fingertip and
they're<00:03:56.180> tied<00:03:56.359> off<00:03:56.510> underneath<00:03:57.340> one<00:03:58.340> of<00:03:58.489> the

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
they're tied off underneath one of the

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.460 
they're tied off underneath one of the
advantages<00:03:59.030> of<00:03:59.090> that<00:03:59.180> flexible<00:03:59.810> film<00:04:00.079> was

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
advantages of that flexible film was

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.620 
advantages of that flexible film was
that<00:04:00.890> because<00:04:01.040> of<00:04:01.310> that<00:04:01.400> elasticity<00:04:01.910> that

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
that because of that elasticity that

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.110 
that because of that elasticity that
knot<00:04:02.959> would<00:04:03.260> then<00:04:03.470> retract<00:04:03.980> inside<00:04:04.609> of<00:04:04.910> that

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
knot would then retract inside of that

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.509 
knot would then retract inside of that
channel<00:04:05.660> so<00:04:05.690> it<00:04:05.989> was<00:04:06.109> nicely<00:04:06.320> hidden<00:04:06.680> that

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
channel so it was nicely hidden that

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.039 
channel so it was nicely hidden that
doesn't<00:04:07.820> happen<00:04:07.940> with<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.329> cord<00:04:08.630> but<00:04:08.900> I'm

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
doesn't happen with the cord but I'm

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.330 
doesn't happen with the cord but I'm
sure<00:04:09.350> there's<00:04:09.530> a<00:04:09.620> better<00:04:10.130> way<00:04:10.400> of

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
sure there's a better way of

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.839 
sure there's a better way of
so<00:04:11.910> that<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.540> could<00:04:12.750> be<00:04:12.780> better<00:04:13.050> hidden<00:04:13.640> as<00:04:14.640> you

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
so that it could be better hidden as you

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.569 
so that it could be better hidden as you
can<00:04:15.030> see<00:04:15.270> the<00:04:15.540> there<00:04:16.019> are<00:04:16.200> these<00:04:16.410> joints<00:04:17.220> in

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
can see the there are these joints in

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.830 
can see the there are these joints in
the<00:04:17.669> middle<00:04:17.910> they're<00:04:18.120> made<00:04:18.269> out<00:04:18.299> of<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.630> blue

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
the middle they're made out of the blue

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.590 
the middle they're made out of the blue
flexible<00:04:19.440> filament<00:04:19.680> go<00:04:20.519> ahead<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:20.790> slide<00:04:21.419> on

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
flexible filament go ahead and slide on

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.090 
flexible filament go ahead and slide on
these<00:04:21.750> out<00:04:21.930> so<00:04:22.139> you<00:04:22.230> can<00:04:22.350> see<00:04:22.560> what<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:22.830> looks

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
these out so you can see what that looks

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.330 
these out so you can see what that looks
like

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.920 

so<00:04:26.340> they<00:04:26.669> fit<00:04:27.090> in<00:04:27.180> there<00:04:27.330> pretty<00:04:27.570> pretty

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
so they fit in there pretty pretty

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.720 
so they fit in there pretty pretty
tightly<00:04:28.200> but<00:04:28.590> they're<00:04:28.770> not<00:04:28.889> hard<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.340> get<00:04:29.520> in

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
tightly but they're not hard to get in

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.870 
tightly but they're not hard to get in
as<00:04:30.090> far<00:04:30.389> as<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.810> different<00:04:31.700> challenges<00:04:32.700> are

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
as far as the different challenges are

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.129 
as far as the different challenges are
concerned<00:04:33.270> like<00:04:33.480> the<00:04:33.630> one<00:04:33.780> that<00:04:33.900> I'm<00:04:33.990> doing

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
concerned like the one that I'm doing

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.190 
concerned like the one that I'm doing
now<00:04:34.620> but<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.850> getting<00:04:36.330> fingers<00:04:36.780> on<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.110> the

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
now but the getting fingers on to the

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.470 
now but the getting fingers on to the
base<00:04:37.380> of<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.710> hand<00:04:38.010> proved<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:39.150> be<00:04:39.210> pretty

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
base of a hand proved to be pretty

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.070 
base of a hand proved to be pretty
difficult<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:41.540> that<00:04:42.540> could<00:04:42.720> probably<00:04:42.840> be

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
difficult and that could probably be

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.650 
difficult and that could probably be
improved<00:04:43.590> but<00:04:44.160> this<00:04:44.550> is<00:04:44.729> this<00:04:45.030> is<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.360> design

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
improved but this is this is the design

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.890 
improved but this is this is the design
for<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.650> hinges<00:04:47.040> it's<00:04:47.720> essentially<00:04:48.720> got

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
for the the hinges it's essentially got

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.530 
for the the hinges it's essentially got
a<00:04:48.930> bulge<00:04:49.680> on<00:04:49.860> each<00:04:50.010> side<00:04:50.280> that<00:04:50.580> holds<00:04:51.360> it<00:04:51.450> in

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
a bulge on each side that holds it in

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.450 
a bulge on each side that holds it in
place<00:04:51.720> and<00:04:52.110> then<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.440> part<00:04:52.889> in<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:52.979> middle<00:04:53.160> is

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
place and then the part in the middle is

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.180 
place and then the part in the middle is
the<00:04:53.639> perfect<00:04:54.030> flexes<00:04:54.870> and<00:04:55.080> like<00:04:55.800> I<00:04:55.830> said<00:04:56.070> it's

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
the perfect flexes and like I said it's

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.030 
the perfect flexes and like I said it's
really<00:04:56.250> quite<00:04:56.669> strong<00:04:57.000> so<00:04:57.800> please<00:04:58.800> put<00:04:59.010> that

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
really quite strong so please put that

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.030 
really quite strong so please put that
so<00:04:59.370> far<00:04:59.669> in<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.090> testing<00:05:00.510> so<00:05:01.020> that<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.590> design

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
so far in the testing so that the design

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.730 
so far in the testing so that the design
of<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:02.220> fingers<00:05:02.729> in<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.030> way<00:05:03.150> that<00:05:03.330> they

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
of the fingers in the way that they

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.460 
of the fingers in the way that they
slide<00:05:04.740> into<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.600> hinges<00:05:06.600> is<00:05:06.990> really<00:05:07.290> nice

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
slide into the hinges is really nice

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.290 
slide into the hinges is really nice
because<00:05:07.620> it<00:05:07.830> basically<00:05:07.979> just<00:05:08.430> slides<00:05:09.090> into

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
because it basically just slides into

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.300 
because it basically just slides into
the<00:05:09.389> channel<00:05:09.810> there<00:05:09.990> which<00:05:10.889> makes<00:05:11.130> it<00:05:11.280> really

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
the channel there which makes it really

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.990 
the channel there which makes it really
easy<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.940> put<00:05:12.389> in<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.810> then<00:05:13.550> likewise<00:05:14.550> slides

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
easy to put in and then likewise slides

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.670 
easy to put in and then likewise slides
into<00:05:15.300> the

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
into the

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.120 
into the
next<00:05:17.509> challenge<00:05:18.509> the<00:05:18.750> challenge<00:05:19.590> is<00:05:19.770> getting

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
next challenge the challenge is getting

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.850 
next challenge the challenge is getting
the<00:05:20.729> actual<00:05:21.090> base<00:05:21.360> onto<00:05:21.780> that<00:05:22.199> hand<00:05:22.560> there

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
the actual base onto that hand there

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.810 
the actual base onto that hand there
it's<00:05:23.759> not<00:05:24.150> designed<00:05:24.900> to<00:05:25.139> be<00:05:25.229> slid<00:05:26.070> onto<00:05:26.430> it

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
it's not designed to be slid onto it

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.090 
it's not designed to be slid onto it
like<00:05:27.000> the<00:05:27.180> others<00:05:27.509> it<00:05:27.810> has<00:05:27.840> to<00:05:28.199> be<00:05:28.350> pushed<00:05:28.800> onto

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
like the others it has to be pushed onto

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.520 
like the others it has to be pushed onto
it<00:05:29.460> and<00:05:29.699> use<00:05:30.419> a<00:05:30.449> flathead<00:05:30.750> screwdriver

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
it and use a flathead screwdriver

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.430 
it and use a flathead screwdriver
sort<00:05:31.830> of<00:05:31.889> cram<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:32.880> hinge<00:05:33.720> into<00:05:34.110> there<00:05:34.289> and

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
sort of cram the hinge into there and

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.249 
sort of cram the hinge into there and
it's<00:05:34.590> quite<00:05:35.160> challenging<00:05:35.400> so<00:05:36.060> that<00:05:36.900> could<00:05:37.139> be

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 
it's quite challenging so that could be

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:39.290 
it's quite challenging so that could be
improved<00:05:37.620> maybe<00:05:38.070> by<00:05:38.310> incorporating<00:05:39.030> this

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
improved maybe by incorporating this

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.370 
improved maybe by incorporating this
type<00:05:39.539> of<00:05:39.690> a<00:05:39.810> slide<00:05:40.110> design<00:05:41.039> if<00:05:41.759> you<00:05:41.880> left<00:05:42.180> a

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
type of a slide design if you left a

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.080 
type of a slide design if you left a
spot<00:05:43.380> on<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:43.650> side<00:05:43.860> for<00:05:44.190> that<00:05:44.340> to<00:05:44.490> slide<00:05:44.789> in

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
spot on the side for that to slide in

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.270 
spot on the side for that to slide in
you<00:05:45.660> may<00:05:45.810> be<00:05:45.870> covering<00:05:46.350> up<00:05:46.590> afterwards<00:05:47.160> or

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
you may be covering up afterwards or

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.620 
you may be covering up afterwards or
something<00:05:47.449> that<00:05:48.449> might<00:05:48.630> be<00:05:49.190> preferable<00:05:50.630> so

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
something that might be preferable so

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.540 
something that might be preferable so
this<00:05:52.380> of<00:05:52.530> course<00:05:52.560> could<00:05:52.889> be<00:05:52.919> finished<00:05:53.370> much

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
this of course could be finished much

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.629 
this of course could be finished much
more<00:05:53.729> nicely<00:05:54.030> I<00:05:54.530> started<00:05:55.530> to<00:05:55.650> do<00:05:56.190> some<00:05:56.370> sanding

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
more nicely I started to do some sanding

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.689 
more nicely I started to do some sanding
on<00:05:57.090> the<00:05:57.240> palm<00:05:57.810> and<00:05:57.889> as<00:05:58.889> you<00:05:59.039> can<00:05:59.190> see<00:05:59.370> it<00:05:59.460> didn't

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
on the palm and as you can see it didn't

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.290 
on the palm and as you can see it didn't
really<00:05:59.960> finish<00:06:00.960> that<00:06:01.320> up<00:06:01.500> it<00:06:02.280> would<00:06:02.940> benefit

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
really finish that up it would benefit

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.480 
really finish that up it would benefit
from<00:06:03.360> some<00:06:03.840> final<00:06:04.650> sanding<00:06:05.039> and<00:06:05.220> their<00:06:05.310> code

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
from some final sanding and their code

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.100 
from some final sanding and their code
of<00:06:05.520> good<00:06:06.889> urethane<00:06:07.889> but<00:06:08.599> since<00:06:09.599> this<00:06:09.690> was<00:06:09.870> just

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
of good urethane but since this was just

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.810 
of good urethane but since this was just
a<00:06:10.229> initial<00:06:10.889> test<00:06:13.010> but<00:06:14.010> the<00:06:14.280> design<00:06:14.520> is<00:06:14.550> quite

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
a initial test but the design is quite

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.339 
a initial test but the design is quite
nice<00:06:15.060> as<00:06:15.360> you<00:06:15.449> can<00:06:15.599> see<00:06:15.750> pretty<00:06:15.960> realistic

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
nice as you can see pretty realistic

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:20.779 
nice as you can see pretty realistic
looking<00:06:17.389> fingertips<00:06:18.590> nicely<00:06:19.590> designed<00:06:20.250> and

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
looking fingertips nicely designed and

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:24.260 
looking fingertips nicely designed and
the<00:06:21.240> shape<00:06:21.930> of<00:06:22.050> the<00:06:22.169> hand<00:06:22.349> itself<00:06:22.680> and<00:06:23.240> like<00:06:24.240> I

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
the shape of the hand itself and like I

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.689 
the shape of the hand itself and like I
said<00:06:24.539> those<00:06:24.720> the<00:06:24.960> flexible<00:06:25.470> parts<00:06:25.830> create

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 
said those the flexible parts create

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:28.400 
said those the flexible parts create
some<00:06:26.940> interesting<00:06:27.630> options<00:06:27.750> you'll<00:06:28.080> notice

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
some interesting options you'll notice

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.589 
some interesting options you'll notice
no<00:06:28.919> hardware<00:06:29.370> anywhere<00:06:30.060> in<00:06:30.150> this<00:06:30.300> design

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
no hardware anywhere in this design

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.779 
no hardware anywhere in this design
there's<00:06:30.810> no<00:06:30.960> screws<00:06:31.410> there's<00:06:31.979> no<00:06:32.159> nuts<00:06:32.460> and

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
there's no screws there's no nuts and

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:33.589 
there's no screws there's no nuts and
bolts<00:06:33.000> to<00:06:33.150> worry<00:06:33.300> about

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
bolts to worry about

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:36.770 
bolts to worry about
it's<00:06:34.080> those<00:06:34.320> flexible<00:06:35.180> filament<00:06:36.180> parts<00:06:36.630> to

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
it's those flexible filament parts to

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.620 
it's those flexible filament parts to
handle<00:06:37.250> the<00:06:38.250> function<00:06:38.789> of<00:06:38.909> what<00:06:39.389> that

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
handle the function of what that

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.689 
handle the function of what that
hardware<00:06:40.080> would<00:06:40.289> have<00:06:40.409> done<00:06:40.620> so<00:06:41.010> that's<00:06:41.490> quite

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 
hardware would have done so that's quite

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:43.219 
hardware would have done so that's quite
interesting<00:06:42.240> as<00:06:42.330> well<00:06:42.449> because<00:06:42.510> you<00:06:43.080> come

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:43.229 
interesting as well because you come

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:45.860 
interesting as well because you come
closer<00:06:43.500> to<00:06:43.889> a<00:06:44.220> hand<00:06:44.699> that<00:06:44.849> is<00:06:44.970> entirely<00:06:45.449> 3d

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
closer to a hand that is entirely 3d
