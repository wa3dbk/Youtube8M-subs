hi<00:00:01.380> John<00:00:01.860> here<00:00:02.149> on<00:00:03.149> making<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:03.810> pallet

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:04.700 
hi John here on making a pallet

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.510 
hi John here on making a pallet
strawberry<00:00:05.700> planter

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:07.520 
strawberry planter

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.220 
strawberry planter
so<00:00:08.530> it's<00:00:09.530> up<00:00:09.740> against<00:00:10.040> the<00:00:10.219> fence

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.230 
so it's up against the fence

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.110 
so it's up against the fence
and<00:00:11.320> just<00:00:12.190> here<00:00:12.400> there's<00:00:12.610> not<00:00:12.730> very<00:00:12.790> much

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
and just here there's not very much

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.650 
and just here there's not very much
topsoil

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
topsoil

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.280 
topsoil
so<00:00:15.520> it's<00:00:16.520> useful<00:00:16.790> to<00:00:17.060> have<00:00:17.300> a<00:00:17.570> construction

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.290 
so it's useful to have a construction

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.340 
so it's useful to have a construction
that<00:00:18.440> gives<00:00:18.710> a<00:00:18.830> bit<00:00:18.980> more<00:00:19.010> of<00:00:19.190> topsoil<00:00:19.700> and

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350 
that gives a bit more of topsoil and

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.700 
that gives a bit more of topsoil and
I've<00:00:21.350> got<00:00:21.529> her<00:00:21.710> a<00:00:21.950> flat<00:00:22.610> palette<00:00:23.060> on<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:23.270> back

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
I've got her a flat palette on the back

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.530 
I've got her a flat palette on the back
and<00:00:24.710> I've<00:00:24.860> done<00:00:25.310> the<00:00:25.460> sides<00:00:25.760> with<00:00:26.240> broken

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
and I've done the sides with broken

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.339 
and I've done the sides with broken
pallet<00:00:27.080> boards<00:00:27.260> and<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.730> top<00:00:28.970> pallet<00:00:29.420> is<00:00:30.290> a

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
pallet boards and the top pallet is a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.610 
pallet boards and the top pallet is a
really<00:00:30.619> nice<00:00:31.509> palette<00:00:32.509> it's<00:00:32.750> one<00:00:33.260> over<00:00:33.410> this

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
really nice palette it's one over this

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.830 
really nice palette it's one over this
hardwood<00:00:34.190> but<00:00:34.430> it's<00:00:34.579> all<00:00:34.790> knotted<00:00:35.120> it's<00:00:35.660> not

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
hardwood but it's all knotted it's not

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.100 
hardwood but it's all knotted it's not
just<00:00:36.140> ordinary<00:00:36.380> pine<00:00:37.540> and<00:00:38.540> what's<00:00:38.780> that<00:00:38.930> wood

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
just ordinary pine and what's that wood

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.290 
just ordinary pine and what's that wood
it<00:00:39.230> is<00:00:39.260> but<00:00:39.530> it's<00:00:39.649> a<00:00:39.800> year<00:00:40.520> chiral<00:00:40.880> and<00:00:41.090> I<00:00:41.120> don't

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
it is but it's a year chiral and I don't

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.170 
it is but it's a year chiral and I don't
think<00:00:41.600> it's<00:00:41.750> going<00:00:41.960> to<00:00:42.200> rot<00:00:43.130> so<00:00:43.790> just<00:00:43.970> straight

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
think it's going to rot so just straight

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.500 
think it's going to rot so just straight
away

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
away

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.180 
away
I<00:00:45.489> think<00:00:46.489> that'll<00:00:46.760> last<00:00:46.880> a<00:00:47.120> few<00:00:47.270> years

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
I think that'll last a few years

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.460 
I think that'll last a few years
so<00:00:49.190> I've<00:00:49.400> started<00:00:49.580> filling<00:00:50.210> filling<00:00:51.200> it<00:00:51.350> up

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
so I've started filling filling it up

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.180 
so I've started filling filling it up
with<00:00:51.620> soil<00:00:51.860> I<00:00:53.020> put<00:00:54.020> these<00:00:54.170> edges<00:00:54.620> on<00:00:54.800> to<00:00:54.950> stop

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
with soil I put these edges on to stop

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.860 
with soil I put these edges on to stop
the<00:00:55.340> soil<00:00:55.970> spinning<00:00:56.510> out

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.290 

why<00:01:00.470> well<00:01:00.950> there<00:01:01.550> is<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:03.699> palette<00:01:04.699> strawberry

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
why well there is the palette strawberry

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.490 
why well there is the palette strawberry
planter<00:01:06.100> more<00:01:07.100> finished<00:01:08.050> took<00:01:09.050> more<00:01:09.229> soul

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
planter more finished took more soul

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.800 
planter more finished took more soul
than<00:01:09.530> I<00:01:09.800> thought<00:01:10.330> you<00:01:11.330> know<00:01:11.479> once<00:01:11.660> you<00:01:11.750> start

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
than I thought you know once you start

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.530 
than I thought you know once you start
putting<00:01:12.170> soil<00:01:12.470> in<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:12.920> then<00:01:13.240> it<00:01:14.240> sinks<00:01:14.420> down

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
putting soil in and then it sinks down

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.820 
putting soil in and then it sinks down
bitch<00:01:14.960> I<00:01:15.260> don't<00:01:16.130> have<00:01:16.250> what<00:01:16.400> was<00:01:16.550> it<00:01:16.640> 1<00:01:16.790> 2<00:01:17.090> 3

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
bitch I don't have what was it 1 2 3

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.070 
bitch I don't have what was it 1 2 3
that<00:01:18.830> fight<00:01:19.100> fight<00:01:20.030> power<00:01:20.270> loads<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.660> soil<00:01:20.900> way

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
that fight fight power loads a soil way

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.810 
that fight fight power loads a soil way
in<00:01:21.140> there<00:01:21.790> I<00:01:22.790> have<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:24.130> strawberry<00:01:25.130> plants<00:01:25.700> in

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
in there I have the strawberry plants in

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.180 
in there I have the strawberry plants in
the<00:01:25.910> greenhouse<00:01:26.090> ones<00:01:26.750> which<00:01:27.020> they're<00:01:27.979> more

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
the greenhouse ones which they're more

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.640 
the greenhouse ones which they're more
than<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:28.430> year<00:01:28.760> old<00:01:28.790> they're<00:01:29.780> not<00:01:29.810> run<00:01:30.229> as<00:01:30.380> quite

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
than a year old they're not run as quite

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.080 
than a year old they're not run as quite
run<00:01:30.860> as<00:01:31.010> last<00:01:31.250> year<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:31.729> they're<00:01:31.880> quite<00:01:32.000> good

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
run as last year so they're quite good

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.630 
run as last year so they're quite good
plants<00:01:32.660> and<00:01:33.200> notice<00:01:33.530> some<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:33.860> them<00:01:34.070> did<00:01:34.610> have

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
plants and notice some of them did have

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.570 
plants and notice some of them did have
flower<00:01:35.360> buds<00:01:35.750> on<00:01:38.020> strawberries<00:01:39.020> they<00:01:39.830> do<00:01:39.890> have

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
flower buds on strawberries they do have

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.680 
flower buds on strawberries they do have
the<00:01:40.790> flowers<00:01:41.210> are<00:01:41.509> set<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.259> previous<00:01:42.560> autumn

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
the flowers are set the previous autumn

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.980 
the flowers are set the previous autumn
so<00:01:44.740> if<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:46.130> take<00:01:46.340> runners<00:01:46.820> one<00:01:47.090> year<00:01:47.420> don't

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
so if you take runners one year don't

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.410 
so if you take runners one year don't
expect<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.619> get<00:01:48.770> fruit<00:01:49.070> from<00:01:49.369> that<00:01:49.430> from<00:01:50.390> that

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
expect to get fruit from that from that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.150 
expect to get fruit from that from that
year<00:01:50.720> that<00:01:50.990> they<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.289> take<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.680> runners<00:01:51.979> from

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
year that they you take the runners from

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.389 
year that they you take the runners from
them<00:01:52.479> that<00:01:53.479> you've<00:01:53.630> taken<00:01:53.899> them<00:01:54.590> has<00:01:54.950> runners

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
them that you've taken them has runners

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.609 
them that you've taken them has runners
because<00:01:56.270> they<00:01:56.660> have<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:57.020> sort<00:01:57.229> of<00:01:57.289> build<00:01:57.470> up

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
because they have to sort of build up

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.960 
because they have to sort of build up
their<00:01:57.830> energy<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.490> strength<00:01:58.820> and<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:01.789> it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
their energy and strength and and it

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.090 
their energy and strength and and it
takes<00:02:02.180> about<00:02:02.300> year<00:02:02.690> before<00:02:02.990> you<00:02:03.320> get<00:02:03.560> ash<00:02:03.860> and

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
takes about year before you get ash and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.010 
takes about year before you get ash and
gets<00:02:04.280> routing<00:02:04.670> flowers<00:02:05.179> fruiting

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
gets routing flowers fruiting

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.770 
gets routing flowers fruiting
strawberries<00:02:07.209> so<00:02:08.209> anyway<00:02:08.539> I'm<00:02:08.630> really

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
strawberries so anyway I'm really

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.630 
strawberries so anyway I'm really
chuffed<00:02:08.929> with<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.319> I've<00:02:09.619> put<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:09.860> staggered

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
chuffed with that I've put a staggered

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.030 
chuffed with that I've put a staggered
the<00:02:10.759> strawberries<00:02:11.180> like<00:02:11.390> this<00:02:11.630> over<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.920> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
the strawberries like this over to the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.460 
the strawberries like this over to the
five<00:02:13.280> on<00:02:13.310> one<00:02:13.760> line<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.030> six<00:02:14.600> on<00:02:14.780> another

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
five on one line and six on another

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.010 
five on one line and six on another
and<00:02:17.000> hoping<00:02:18.000> for<00:02:18.270> great<00:02:18.420> things<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.900> of

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
and hoping for great things and of

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.270 
and hoping for great things and of
course<00:02:19.200> I'll<00:02:19.380> be<00:02:19.500> doing<00:02:19.710> updates<00:02:20.040> all<00:02:20.250> the
