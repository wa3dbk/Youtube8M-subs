 brush then we will find 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:35.600
 letting the hairs without expression 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:39.270
 first find the whole picture 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.980
 draw a little face as far as we can and in 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:49.290
 late expressive here these masks 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:51.900
 will become 4 you crush menstruation 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.159
 fill still look what you need angle 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:01.260

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:13.350
 noble not pure white 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:18.890

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.890
 plus brown almost black 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.950
 hairs 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:36.229
 dash rags 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:39.520
 gradually groping well, here's a little bit 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:43.700
 now and man look closer chairs 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.140
 you can even do what you do when 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.520
 works with a rag a little bit of moisture 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:56.869
 still pour see a little 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:59.530
 aside where he waved too far 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.530
 dryly 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:11.780
 can to formally start learning 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:14.510
 nothing and then work on the highlight 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.450
 same a rag that is a rag here 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.110
 act as your work tool as 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.110
 big tassel 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.870
 look at something to blame 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.879
 rag can either turn over on 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.879
 clean place and rich and clean out 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:03:01.299
 we have a mouth here and now in speech 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:08.829
 when I'm not on the raw cheek here is already secu 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:12.859
 now fill your finger with whitewash 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.890
 clean whitewash it all 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:19.060
 with light 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:23.430
 look like your finger is a bit crunchy i mean 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.170
 he doesn't like a lot of stuff 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:34.600
 means a little paint dial 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:37.140
 those places where you bathed the light apply too 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.140
 drive up 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.140
 the bar is clear you need more red 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.560
 you have everything packed uniform 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.560
 hatch 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:02.360
 distribution this case is no longer needed 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.880
 need to define more essentially 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.880
 look brush squeezes paint 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.170
 tightly packed 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:22.340
 palette knife if something then cherries and plums 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:24.950
 but for now also doesn't i see is-3 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:30.400
 forged but little substance still here 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.400
 enough to wait out 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.690
 almost all eyes have 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:52.420
 so now with a palette knife with paint together 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.420
 such movements 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:07.810
 here we are not here first 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:13.740
 first the dark movements are dark and 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.740
 through the loops i'm afraid well 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:27.520
 yes the main profit from the hair 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:27.520
 there are a variety of sound 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:38.410
 see little paint doesn't work realized 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.990
 that's where the list is good 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.819
 put look no all the time happens 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:02.440
 when one fluff beautifully circling 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:09.560
 ugly now 1 masses ok 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:16.759
 that's how it will be abnormal that is even 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:20.710
 not hit and pull on your lead 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.710
 ugly press down 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:27.040
 What is it like 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:30.970
 this 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:33.470
 do you understand the dark and controversial of oh 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:36.860
 more precisely of from 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:40.730
 not and a bright custom 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.440
 from the outside you can only see what I ask for 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.220
 you always in a rag not to 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.220
 turned out gruel 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.180
 opportunities 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.180
 bigger with a rag
