00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.589
 hi I'm luca pagliaro but we're in 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.160
 Croatia 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:14.790
 today it will trigger a seeded there 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.760
 I'll show you how I have it already 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.240
 clean and already elevated 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:26.340
 I removed I removed my eyes I removed the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:31.710
 mouth so it becomes a little longer 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:35.100
 let's go with order then we are at 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.800
 search for the bream we already have two 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.350
 canne the evil we are fishing in 10 15 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.489
 meters deep 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:52.320
 the bottom is seen misto sand 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:56.809
 rock from a good position we install the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.809
 the bream however can also arrive 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.809
 then 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:14.530
 I prepared a plan of 110 grams two 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:19.240
 sedans save node an act lina a 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:26.740
 terminal of about half a meter for not 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:28.840
 grounding so much a hook is not 40 either 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.229
 so great because if a fish comes 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.229
 of 3 4 5 pounds in short is not a hook 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:45.030
 great let's see how to put the head 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:45.030
 then I had some bb stuffed in the middle 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:02:01.979
 let's use elastic thread like this 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:06.440
 the head becomes longer and better 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.440
 on the wire and on the hooks 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.720
 abolish 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.480
 put the elastic thread end up to 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:35.579
 goals 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:41.840
 we leave the tentacles out and then 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:41.840
 let's tie a knot in the elastic thread 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.189
 ok 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.170
 Now 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.200
 if we put it on the call 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.220
 the tip out 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:34.900
 and this is our trigger work 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.900
 important
