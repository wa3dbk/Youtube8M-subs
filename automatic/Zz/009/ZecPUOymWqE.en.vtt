00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.299
 small review the question of what 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.090
 differ from each other scissors by 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.320
 to metal 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.690
 differ in not cutting directions 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:20.130
 not appropriately named scissors 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:28.160
 right cut right and right and held 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:32.279
 not in the left hand Left-Handed Scissors 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:37.710
 cut straight and left and respectively 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.840
 they are held in the right hand and right 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.350
 left scissors have a little bend 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.760
 blades up here it is scissors straight 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:54.120
 they hold in their right hand too but them 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:56.090
 just straight blades there is another one more 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.449
 important difference in scissors 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:04.439
 This is the way of fixing the two halves 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:07.650
 blade here we have the easiest 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:14.280
 way just in the middle 2 end 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:17.520
 in the middle of carnations and another way with 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.080
 offset mount i.e. cut line 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.850
 pass by the connection what does it give it 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:32.189
 gives us the opportunity to cut the profile 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:35.520
 along and for example make a cut rested 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.320
 and then we have scissors do not go that is 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.200
 they need to be tilted or there 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:45.090
 harder to press well, very ugly 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:53.040
 it turns out and scissors with offset 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:55.730
 mount do the cut and what we see 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.890
 that the cut metal passes by 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.230
 the connection of the two halves and the poet we 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:08.970
 we can just cut the profile without 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:15.740
 voltage as much as we are here in this 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.740
 and there is a difference between scissors
