00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.150
 baby rabbit this little one 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.440
 lease termination canon which gets 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.540
 we missed everything in the 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.120
 little sweet is clear we ask them 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.530
 now a rabbit before that sweet 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.710
 friendly and soft is but 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.350
 know in the sense of small hector is even 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.740
 not rather the long - eared gigant of 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.240
 steinfurt christian ronig has hector that 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.760
 Belgian giant rabbits wanted hector 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.250
 the titan among the giants he bucks 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.590
 blows up all known dimensions 60 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.809
 inches long incredible twelve kilos 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.700
 heavy with it the whole size of the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.620
 Belgian giant clearly becomes well 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.530
 Breeder Heinz fled from Steinfurt 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:49.559
 Dwarf rabbits more than seven times 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:01:00.239
 easier then have your head off 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:01:03.350
 but so bad that hector do you speak 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.350
 yes not Belgian or 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.640
 how are they really on the giants 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.760
 They have come at some point 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.110
 seen that I want to grow in 1978 am 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.500
 I started there I am on one 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.630
 Great Animal Show has been in Amsterdam 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.890
 the centers in the city halls 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.259
 the city of damn and there I have 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.200
 seen these creatures and then I was 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.869
 so impression of it and then have 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.060
 started with this breed because if 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.030
 then even big animals and small animals 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.280
 because huge animals have a whole 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.280
 others broadcast and take them though 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.509
 not so I'm with the house 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.960
 and then I look at what was something 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.090
 he lacks nothing , for example 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.159
 he shows himself he makes what was something 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.829
 he has learned and when he can not 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.899
 and do not want then there is solinger 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.920
 Street 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.470
 even if that's actually this 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.020
 care of which therefore the breeding one must 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.790
 So I have to be professional against him 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.910
 Now I know something for a long time 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.019
 even the naturopath one must 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.430
 flair 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:25.470
 I can not only help you for so now 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.569
 we have the gisela mÃ¼ller we 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.440
 actually, it usually looks like that 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:39.420
 I can only do that 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:42.360
 yes dutch so this is a few 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.590
 months younger and so see the see 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.190
 the giants usually made a difference 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.190
 why is so much bigger than that 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.980
 normal reha then is a mutation 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.739
 Leaping change of a living thing 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.730
 I know the giant about 45 years 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.180
 I have never seen such an animal 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:08.250
 this tremendous pressure is about too 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.519
 comparison yes the joke make the name 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.799
 all honor these watches which are the 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.780
 warmest somehow can yes there goes 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.700
 circulation through when it is true 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.410
 Most of the time it was a good sign 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.910
 that the animal is healthy 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:28.940
 it is cold so my even now to 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.940
 cold , my god came here now 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:38.440
 my god is one and recognize that 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.440
 Are you coming back nice and stoic? 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.239
 Factor here is no longer on 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.239
