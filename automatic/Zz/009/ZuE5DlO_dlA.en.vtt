pack<00:00:23.160> bundle<00:00:23.430> that's<00:00:23.730> going<00:00:23.939> for<00:00:24.090> 10,000

points<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.410> think<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.740> equates<00:00:26.099> like<00:00:26.400> one

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
points and I think that equates like one

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.880 
points and I think that equates like one
hundred<00:00:26.939> dollars<00:00:27.269> which<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> bit<00:00:27.990> much<00:00:28.230> and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
hundred dollars which is a bit much and
