00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
how do you look back on your first bike

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.330 
how do you look back on your first bike
as<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.830> tournament<00:00:05.660> well<00:00:06.660> it<00:00:07.259> was<00:00:07.500> not<00:00:07.859> so<00:00:08.099> good

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
as a tournament well it was not so good

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.870 
as a tournament well it was not so good
as<00:00:08.940> i<00:00:09.510> wished<00:00:09.780> but<00:00:10.400> you<00:00:11.400> know<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.700> was

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
as i wished but you know it was

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.539 
as i wished but you know it was
different<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.660> probably<00:00:13.259> i<00:00:13.830> had<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.340> play

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
different and probably i had to play

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.910 
different and probably i had to play
more<00:00:14.820> games<00:00:15.059> before<00:00:15.630> coming<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.199> waken<00:00:16.740> say

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
more games before coming to waken say

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.490 
more games before coming to waken say
because<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:17.880> always<00:00:18.029> had<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.449> brakes<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.199> three

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
because I always had the brakes to three

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.880 
because I always had the brakes to three
months<00:00:19.680> before<00:00:20.039> playing<00:00:20.580> such<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> tourneys<00:00:21.890> so

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
maybe next time it's better to play

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.429 
maybe next time it's better to play
something<00:00:24.990> just<00:00:25.650> before<00:00:26.029> otherwise<00:00:27.260> you<00:00:28.260> know

so<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.939> was<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.299> reason<00:01:33.329> actually<00:01:33.720> wait

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
so that was the reason actually wait

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.910 
so that was the reason actually wait
time<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:35.220> Sasha<00:01:35.670> key<00:01:36.000> through<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:37.170> what<00:01:37.799> is
