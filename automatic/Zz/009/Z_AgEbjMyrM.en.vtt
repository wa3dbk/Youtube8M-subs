00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:13.469
 It is clear that the main function of the library is to be able to find and open 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.039
 a book 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.410
 If you have few books this is not very complicated but how many more 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.720
 books you have in the system 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.980
 more important will be to be able to quickly access the book you want from 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.659
 different ways 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:33.109
 essentially there are two main ways to use the library for 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:34.920
 find a book 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.020
 First 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.020
 I will find the functions of searching 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.640
 and second 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.700
 I will find the songs 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.820
 to order 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.030
 we will try the first of these two ways in this tutorial and the second alt 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.020
 In the next 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.810
 Of course the most intuitive way to find a book is simply 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.890
 typing something in the search engine 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.270
 any text that is in one of the fields that supports search is something that 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.660
 you can search 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.690
 this is probably the way you will use to find a book the great 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.570
 most of the time 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.570
 you start typing something like that as you type 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.380
 get it by limiting the results to what you have entered 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.830
 if we type sketches 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.170
 we see that the tool returns 24 results 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.500
 the first six results have the word in the same title 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.730
 so if we were looking for biblical sketches he took two 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.580
 new testament by a also stonemasons 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.710
 all you need to do is take the third book that comes out in the list 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.760
 to open it we can click directly on the title 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.380
 or right click to open it in a panel 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.050
 an independent window 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.150
 if it turns out that we were looking for a thousand sketches for preachers of samuel vida 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.640
 since it is the first one that appears in the list with simply hit the key 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.740
 intro opens by default 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.970
 in fact 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.370
 normally if a book is highlighted with the enter key that 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.590
 book will open 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.499
 be the first on the list or not 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:11.699
 but how is it that 18 more books appear 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:14.699
 we do not see the word because I josé in no other field 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:20.609
 as it turns out that in these cases the word sketches appears in the text of 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.979
 in formation about the resource 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.099
 any word that appears in one of the metadata fields 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.829
 may appear 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.590
 that's why it can come in handy to know how to limit the search results 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:36.119
 even more 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.060
 by the way when you do a search in the library 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.370
 a new column appears on the left that says ripped 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:44.350
 At first 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.129
 the lower the value of the number 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.389
 most likely it has to do with what the logos 4 assumes we are looking for 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.389
 finished the search to return the search box to its original state 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.389
 you can click on the circle with the x 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:02.779
 to travel 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:07.290
 The most efficient way to limit the search is to know in which fields 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:09.299
 find what you want is to look 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.809
 and limit the search 

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:12.849
 to that field 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.560
 to do that you need to enter the name of the field first followed by two 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.499
 points 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:20.499
 and the word you are looking for 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:22.060
 for example author 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.479
 two points martínez 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:28.239
 for this it is important to know the filter code because unfortunately 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.219
 these are in English 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:35.689
 the complete list is the help of the four 'major' section fields of 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.929
 library filters 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:42.529
 fortunately as it is likely that one normally only use two or three 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:44.659
 fields regularly 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.659
 these can be easily learned by heart 

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:51.329
 for example if you do not want to search by author 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.669
 you can type to do 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.199
 and the name of the author 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.669
 for example vila 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.669
 if you search for it by title you can type ayto 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:04.929
 any word that the title appears 

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:06.219
 for example 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:08.569
 sketches 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.199
 if you want to find a type of book you can type fayt 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.809
 and for example dictionary 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:16.739
 also 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.309
 a couple of fields work with numbers 

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:23.189
 and therefore admit to do a search with the symbols of greater than 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:25.460
 Menorca 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.639
 for example even know equilibria I have to be published before 1980 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:32.620
 type 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.860
 avda of ips 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.289
 two points 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.289
 lower than in 1980 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.050
 It can also be used on it 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.770
 greater today we have talked 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.849
 oo minor for matching 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.849
 but in those cases the sign of fact equal 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.809
 has to go after the biggest minor theft 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:55.809
 so that the search works correctly 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.069
 finally and you can combine terms in the search according to the operator that 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:02.479
 it's used 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.479
 these can be in Spanish for example 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.610
 yes keyboard make two points life 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.879
 fayt two points encyclopedia 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.099
 it returns a result 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.099
 however, I do believe accents vila points 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.080
 there two points encyclopedia 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.620
 it gives me back 46 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.130
 clear this second time that gives the memo is all the dictionaries not only 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.139
 those who have vila as an actor 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.990
 obviously using operators in more complex searches is probably not something 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.699
 that you do too much until your book collection does not reach a 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.520
 amount that really requires having to limit the results a lot 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:49.610
 with everything 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.059
 it's good to know 

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.879
 what can be done
