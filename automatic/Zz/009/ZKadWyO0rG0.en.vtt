well so I always have the advantage one
way<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.789> drop<00:00:27.060> shot<00:00:27.330> many<00:00:27.539> people<00:00:27.810> find

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
way is to drop shot many people find

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.660 
way is to drop shot many people find
this<00:00:28.109> cheap<00:00:28.439> but<00:00:28.710> let's<00:00:29.010> be<00:00:29.160> honest<00:00:29.519> those

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
this cheap but let's be honest those

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.640 
this cheap but let's be honest those
people<00:00:29.970> are<00:00:30.060> just<00:00:30.599> probably<00:00:30.810> too<00:00:31.170> lazy<00:00:31.380> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
people are just probably too lazy to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.069 
people are just probably too lazy to
switch<00:00:31.890> over<00:00:32.329> another<00:00:33.329> way<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.660> jump

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
switch over another way is to jump

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.750 
switch over another way is to jump
around<00:00:34.200> corners<00:00:34.860> when<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.219> see<00:00:35.370> them<00:00:35.550> and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
around corners when you see them and

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.630 
around corners when you see them and
clip<00:00:36.510> will<00:00:36.630> be<00:00:36.660> shown<00:00:36.870> later<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.640> so

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
clip will be shown later of that so

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.150 
clip will be shown later of that so
after<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.510> jump<00:00:39.719> around<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.989> corner<00:00:40.559> possibly

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
after you jump around a corner possibly

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.740 
after you jump around a corner possibly
drop<00:00:41.340> shot<00:00:41.579> again<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.059> you're<00:00:42.270> like<00:00:42.480> flying

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
drop shot again so you're like flying

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.600 
drop shot again so you're like flying
through<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.079> air<00:00:43.110> like<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.500> flying<00:00:43.890> saucer<00:00:44.190> and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
through the air like a flying saucer and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.639 
through the air like a flying saucer and
you're<00:00:44.730> gonna<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:45.059> usually<00:00:45.750> winning<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.410> gun

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
you're gonna be usually winning that gun

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.770 
you're gonna be usually winning that gun
fights<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.730> lot<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.149> people<00:00:48.360> would<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.600> wait

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
fights a lot of people would just wait

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.180 
fights a lot of people would just wait
with<00:00:49.020> her<00:00:49.110> aim<00:00:49.260> around<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> corner<00:00:49.920> aimer

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
with her aim around the corner aimer

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.270 
with her aim around the corner aimer
around<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> corner<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.680> they<00:00:52.680> don't<00:00:52.860> expect

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
around the corner and they don't expect

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.920 
around the corner and they don't expect
you<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.579> go<00:00:53.879> flying<00:00:54.300> around<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> corner

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
you to go flying around the corner

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.760 
you to go flying around the corner
because<00:00:55.020> they're<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.559> looking

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
because they're just going to be looking

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.920 
because they're just going to be looking
at<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> little<00:00:56.250> edge<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.539> creep<00:00:57.780> out

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
at the little edge for you to creep out

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.119 
at the little edge for you to creep out
if<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.199> creeped<00:00:58.410> out<00:00:58.530> you're<00:00:58.710> usually<00:00:58.859> going

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
if you creeped out you're usually going

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.860 
if you creeped out you're usually going
to<00:00:59.250> lose<00:00:59.430> those<00:00:59.550> gunfights<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.510> right<00:01:00.690> here<00:01:00.840> I

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
to lose those gunfights so right here I

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.460 
to lose those gunfights so right here I
ran<00:01:01.109> around<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.500> flank<00:01:01.920> them<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.629> yeah<00:01:03.629> my

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
ran around and flank them and yeah my

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.010 
ran around and flank them and yeah my
aim<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.680> my<00:01:05.489> mine<00:01:05.820> blows<00:01:06.119> me<00:01:06.360> away<00:01:06.390> sometimes

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
aim is my mine blows me away sometimes

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.530 
aim is my mine blows me away sometimes
and<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.770> how<00:01:08.159> good<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:08.909> sometimes<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
and like how good it is sometimes and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.820 
and like how good it is sometimes and
honestly<00:01:09.810> that's<00:01:09.930> probably<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:10.740> from

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
honestly that's probably just from

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.300 
honestly that's probably just from
practice<00:01:11.310> um<00:01:12.200> I<00:01:13.200> use<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> higher<00:01:13.950> sensitivity

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
practice um I use a higher sensitivity

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.120 
practice um I use a higher sensitivity
and<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:16.170> almost<00:01:16.290> know<00:01:16.619> how<00:01:16.830> many<00:01:16.979> bullets

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
and I can almost know how many bullets

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.770 
and I can almost know how many bullets
is<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.610> take<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.909> kill<00:01:18.060> someone<00:01:18.270> now<00:01:18.509> and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
is going to take to kill someone now and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.230 
is going to take to kill someone now and
I<00:01:19.619> pretty<00:01:20.070> much<00:01:20.189> will<00:01:20.430> stop<00:01:20.640> shooting<00:01:20.970> someone

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
I pretty much will stop shooting someone

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.580 
I pretty much will stop shooting someone
and<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.390> move<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.960> next<00:01:21.990> even<00:01:22.500> if

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
and just move on to the next even if

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.810 
and just move on to the next even if
there's<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.830> little<00:01:22.950> bit<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.189> leg<00:01:23.430> because<00:01:23.729> I

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
there's a little bit of leg because I

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.030 
there's a little bit of leg because I
just<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.540> almost<00:01:24.750> time<00:01:25.170> how<00:01:25.590> long<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.860> takes

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
just can almost time how long it takes

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.090 
just can almost time how long it takes
my<00:01:26.549> boat's<00:01:26.759> empty<00:01:27.299> at<00:01:27.659> my<00:01:27.840> gun<00:01:28.020> kill<00:01:28.680> them<00:01:28.860> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
my boat's empty at my gun kill them and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.190 
my boat's empty at my gun kill them and
I<00:01:29.250> can<00:01:29.490> start<00:01:29.939> moving<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.390> before<00:01:30.960> they<00:01:31.110> even

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
I can start moving on before they even

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.580
