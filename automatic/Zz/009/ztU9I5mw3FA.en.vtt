00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:02.250
 Hi all 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.910
 not long ago I posted a video called 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.750
 the profits of the cybernaut 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.770
 in it he passed several tips between downloadable programs and techniques for 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.519
 to make life easier in the pc 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.409
 I bring you now the second part with more tips and details that can be 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:18.869
 be very useful 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.769
 as in the previous video 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.250
 The main characteristic of these utilities is that besides being 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:25.000
 efficient 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 they can be downloaded from the internet for free 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.550
 all of them I've already tested them so you can be sure that you do not 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.050
 I'm recommending any nonsense 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.260
 the links can be found in the description of the video 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.330
 Well, let's comment 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.710
 we start with something that can not miss the users of messenger 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.150
 it is an antivirus application specially designed for this 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.990
 Program 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.790
 the msn cleaner 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.860
 usually you should register in a boring forum to download it 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.360
 however in the link that hurt them the only thing they will have to do 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.820
 will write the letters they ask 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.239
 this program eliminates the malicious advertising that 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.689
 they involuntarily send you their friends in they do not see it but they do 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.550
 never accept these files as they are expigua press 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.170
 the use of this program is quite easy so I do not think it's 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.590
 need to show them how it works 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.600
 let's move on to the next 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.330
 The following program is a very complete compilation of utilities for 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.969

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.540

 is the normal version and the pay but no problem the free is 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.900
 pretty good and does not contain the damn message countdown how many days 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.850
 that are left for free trial 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.350
 to use it first click on the status tab and update the program 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.960
 now click on the maintenance tab 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.400

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.250
 ready now they are going to get rid of the crap that your pc stores with the 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.060
 weather

 in the modules tab you will find more ways to optimize your pc 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.619
 continuing with cleaning your computer 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.320
 he passed another program 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.569
 this one is called a cleaner and it's fascinating since that's the only thing 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.290
 clean oral stomp file is only one pass without the need to be 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.209
 entering internet options of the browsers that we have 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.040
 its use is quite easy 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.870
 just sign in all the boxes and the program will do everything by itself 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.029
 the rest 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:26.870
 However 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.879
 this one that follows is quite appropriate if you want to learn typing 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.000
 that is, typing with the keyboard using all the fingers which translates to 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.769
 faster writing 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.989
 without paying for any course online without installing anything 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.129
 at your own pace 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.859
 the program is called meca net 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.059
 and just by double click on it 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:49.929
 the program tells you everything you should do even the position that they should 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:52.139
 have your fingers on the keyboard 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.319
 once they start learning 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.190
 they can change the difficulty so that they memorize the location of all the 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:02:59.149
 keys 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:00.859
 if they use it constantly 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.369
 in a month they will be fascinated 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:06.480
 the next recommendation is a website 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.189
 his name is serial 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.280
 The quality of this page is that it is a database that stores 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.769
 serial numbers of different programs 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.819
 Its use is very simple 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.810
 you only write correctly the name of your program and several 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.779
 lists with codes for him 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:26.510
 You must keep in mind that the year of the program you have with the 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:27.619
 results 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:31.079
 the codes on this page have bailed me out more than once 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.790
 in case all you're looking for is somewhere where it's worth losing 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:37.029
 a while the time 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:39.029
 enter the next page 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:42.879
 the games that are here are mostly online can play 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.179
 billiards 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:47.649
 poker and many more games with other real players 

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:49.689
 I recommend that you register 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.760
 so they will have preferential access 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.969
 It's free 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:56.619
 You can also find me here to challenge them to a game 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:58.529
 mini peacock streets 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:02.389
 for firefox users I bring you the following utility 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.069
 it is a complement that shows in the lower right part of the 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.069
 law browser with which we currently connect to the internet 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:13.579
 once they install it they have to restart their firefox to see the 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:14.799
 changes 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.799
 this other page that I want to show you is one of my favorites 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.809
 it's called double mobile and it's fantastic 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:24.750
 it is a page where material is stored for your cell phone 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.810
 from wallpapers to games and several more now every time I get a message 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.169
 I have a tone for each person 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.270
 It is not necessary to register but it is advisable to do so as this is not the case 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.419
 you have to wait for the automatic download and you have no limit of 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.150
 downloaded files 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.220
 after you see this page it will make you silly to pay 5 and euros plus VAT for 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.210
 a nice wallpaper for your cell phone 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.080
 everything is free 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.540
 next I want to show you a few things with your folders 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.770
 if they want to hide them so that nobody else can enter them 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.949
 do what I do 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.930
 make sure you do not have the automatic organization check box checked in 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:01.710
 desk 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.930
 to tilt made to hide folder 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.930
 and by train on properties 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.259
 enter the customize tab and train change icon if any of the 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.350
 they see they like it, but to hide the folder they will see some spaces 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:18.139
 in white 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.059
 choose those to hide it 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:24.369
 now simply arrange the folder in a place away from the other accesses 

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:25.650
 direct 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.639
 now that if they prefer to have more security in their folders they can 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.839
 Download the following utility 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:35.809
 it is a program that encrypts your folders under a password that 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:37.159
 you choose 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:40.129
 its use is intuitive and the program is free 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:43.430
 just do not forget to notice the password or something 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.409
 following with the folders the next utility passed them 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:52.199
 It serves to personalize your folders with striking colors so you will not have them 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.659
 all yellow 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:56.710
 its use is only aesthetic because it has no greater utility 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.680
 so that you always remember your pending issues this program is perfect 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.360

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.460
 Once you download it, do not forget to download the translation to 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.360
 Spanish 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.490
 all without giving a penny 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.099
 to finalize this video he passed a utility that can not be lost 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:20.199
 it's called mx swan 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.389
 is an antivirus whose peculiarity is that it is designed specifically for 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.169
 removable devices 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:26.910

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.150
 a new folder called portables which should not be deleted because the program 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.930
