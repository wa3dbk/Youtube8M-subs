00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
circuit but unfortunately there's no

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.710 
circuit but unfortunately there's no
opponents<00:01:49.550> to<00:01:49.670> raise<00:01:52.120> hopefully<00:01:53.120> soon<00:01:53.390> that

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720

any character and you know instead of
seeing<00:04:40.570> Mario's<00:04:40.900> nose<00:04:41.200> see<00:04:41.530> that<00:04:41.710> character

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
seeing Mario's nose see that character

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.950 
seeing Mario's nose see that character
you<00:04:44.790> know<00:04:45.790> feel<00:04:46.120> like<00:04:46.300> you're<00:04:46.480> that<00:04:46.600> that

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.610 

right<00:04:54.660> now<00:04:54.810> I<00:04:54.840> don't<00:04:55.020> actually<00:04:55.290> have<00:04:55.530> a

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
right now I don't actually have a

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.380 
right now I don't actually have a
steering<00:04:55.950> wheel<00:04:56.130> so<00:04:56.310> I<00:04:56.370> just<00:04:56.610> got<00:04:56.790> my<00:04:56.910> ps3

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
steering wheel so I just got my ps3

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.630 
steering wheel so I just got my ps3
controller<00:04:57.780> hooked<00:04:57.960> up<00:04:58.200> and<00:04:58.710> I'm<00:04:59.280> using<00:04:59.460> that

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
controller hooked up and I'm using that

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.690 
controller hooked up and I'm using that
to<00:05:00.060> control<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:02.780> which<00:05:03.780> is<00:05:04.580> probably<00:05:05.580> not

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
to control it which is probably not

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.040 
to control it which is probably not
quite<00:05:05.760> as<00:05:06.120> good<00:05:06.210> as<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.420> string<00:05:06.630> one<00:05:06.780> would<00:05:06.900> be

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
quite as good as the string one would be

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.400 
quite as good as the string one would be
but<00:05:07.290> it's<00:05:07.440> definitely<00:05:08.070> doable<00:05:09.200> still<00:05:10.200> a<00:05:10.230> lot

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
but it's definitely doable still a lot

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:17.220 
but it's definitely doable still a lot
of<00:05:10.530> fun

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:31.410 

and<00:05:17.590> here's<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:17.950> finish<00:05:18.220> line

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420
