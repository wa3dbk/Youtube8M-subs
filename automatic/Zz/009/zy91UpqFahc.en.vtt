obviously<00:00:06.600> on<00:00:06.810> slums<00:00:07.379> as<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:07.770> guys<00:00:07.890> can<00:00:08.099> see<00:00:08.160> i

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
obviously on slums as you guys can see i

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.549 
obviously on slums as you guys can see i
have<00:00:09.210> assets<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.690> hard<00:00:09.900> point<00:00:10.080> here<00:00:10.290> because<00:00:10.530> I

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
have assets a hard point here because I

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.190 
have assets a hard point here because I
figured<00:00:10.980> hardpoints<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.910> little<00:00:12.120> more<00:00:12.420> played

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
figured hardpoints a little more played

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.350 
figured hardpoints a little more played
the<00:00:13.410> nomination<00:00:13.980> oh<00:00:14.190> maybe<00:00:14.549> not<00:00:14.730> played<00:00:15.059> but

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
the nomination oh maybe not played but

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.290 
the nomination oh maybe not played but
more<00:00:15.770> more<00:00:16.770> in-depth<00:00:17.250> than<00:00:17.490> domination

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
more more in-depth than domination

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.210 
more more in-depth than domination
because<00:00:18.600> domination<00:00:19.080> really<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:20.130> only

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
because domination really the only

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.380 
because domination really the only
difference<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.640> have<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.850> capture<00:00:21.180> spots

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
difference you have is capture spots

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.269 
difference you have is capture spots
where<00:00:21.630> as<00:00:21.779> hard<00:00:22.199> point<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.769> lot<00:00:23.250> of

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
where as hard point you have a lot of

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.670 
where as hard point you have a lot of
different<00:00:23.550> spots<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:23.970> can<00:00:24.090> use<00:00:24.269> for

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
different spots that you can use for

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.439 
different spots that you can use for
anchoring<00:00:25.680> or<00:00:25.980> attacking<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.029> objective

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
anchoring or attacking the objective

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.540 
anchoring or attacking the objective
things<00:00:27.779> like<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.920> especially

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
things like that that especially

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.980 
things like that that especially
competitive<00:00:30.029> players<00:00:30.240> will<00:00:30.449> use<00:00:30.570> but<00:00:30.750> even

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
competitive players will use but even

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.290 
competitive players will use but even
casual<00:00:31.380> players<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.769> are<00:00:31.830> just<00:00:31.980> playing

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
casual players that are just playing

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.810 
casual players that are just playing
hard<00:00:33.300> point<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:34.070> core<00:00:35.070> public<00:00:35.430> match<00:00:35.550> will

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
hard point in core public match will

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.240 
hard point in core public match will
definitely<00:00:36.270> be<00:00:36.450> able<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.719> use<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.590> I'll<00:00:38.100> show

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250

you a few spots and slums show you some
ink<00:00:39.989> response<00:00:40.320> because<00:00:40.620> that's<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.010> play

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690

ink response because that's what I play
when<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.719> play<00:00:42.960> competitively<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.680> hopefully

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
when I play competitively and hopefully

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.360 
when I play competitively and hopefully
you<00:00:44.640> guys<00:00:44.700> enjoy<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> video<00:00:45.590> so<00:00:46.590> first<00:00:47.219> off

you guys enjoy the video so first off

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.290 
you guys enjoy the video so first off
we're<00:00:47.550> going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.730> start<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.090> middle

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
we're going to start on the middle

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.220 
we're going to start on the middle
because<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> middle<00:00:48.780> hard<00:00:48.930> point<00:00:49.110> is

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
because the middle hard point is

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.250 
because the middle hard point is
obviously<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.070> middle<00:00:50.280> there<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.390> we're

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
obviously in the middle there and we're

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.479 
obviously in the middle there and we're
going<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> show<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> couple<00:00:53.039> spots<00:00:53.309> that

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
going to show you a couple spots that

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.069 
going to show you a couple spots that
you<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.760> use<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> head<00:00:54.120> glitch<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
you can use the head glitch on the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.299 
you can use the head glitch on the
bricks<00:00:55.350> these<00:00:55.620> are<00:00:55.739> called<00:00:55.920> bricks<00:00:56.219> right

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
bricks these are called bricks right

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.310 
bricks these are called bricks right
here<00:00:56.579> that's<00:00:57.360> what<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.840> call<00:00:57.960> them<00:00:58.199> at

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
here that's what we like to call them at

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.260 
here that's what we like to call them at
least<00:00:58.489> I've<00:00:59.489> heard<00:00:59.670> some<00:00:59.910> people<00:01:00.120> call<00:01:00.239> it

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
least I've heard some people call it

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.299 
least I've heard some people call it
plaque<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:01.109> honest<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:01.710> there's<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
plaque but honest because there's this

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.460 
plaque but honest because there's this
hair<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:02.730> honestly<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.480> think<00:01:03.930> bricks<00:01:04.170> much

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
hair but honestly I I think bricks much

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.140 
hair but honestly I I think bricks much
easier<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.890> say<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.760> use<00:01:05.880> these<00:01:05.970> high

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
easier to say so you can use these high

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.000 
easier to say so you can use these high
glitches<00:01:06.510> depending<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.470> which<00:01:07.590> way<00:01:07.710> people

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
glitches depending on which way people

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.740 
glitches depending on which way people
are<00:01:08.070> coming<00:01:08.340> from<00:01:08.369> other<00:01:09.030> than<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.330> there's

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
are coming from other than that there's

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.780 
are coming from other than that there's
not<00:01:09.900> really<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.170> many<00:01:10.560> places<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.670> go

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
not really that many places you can go

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.039 
not really that many places you can go
you<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:12.030> kind<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.330> go<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.510> top<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.840> statue

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
you can kind of go on top of the statue

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.679 
you can kind of go on top of the statue
here<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.409> guess<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.860> if<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.430> want<00:01:14.670> things<00:01:15.479> like

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
here I guess is if you want things like

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.140 
here I guess is if you want things like
that<00:01:15.810> um<00:01:16.140> over<00:01:16.950> here<00:01:17.130> would<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.549> called<00:01:17.850> graves

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
that um over here would be called graves

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.950 
that um over here would be called graves
obviously<00:01:18.780> because<00:01:19.020> there<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.350> graves<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
obviously because there are graves in it

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.320 
obviously because there are graves in it
so<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.439> pretty<00:01:22.680> self-explanatory<00:01:23.330> people

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
so it's pretty self-explanatory people

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.450 
so it's pretty self-explanatory people
like<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.509> call<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.720> jump<00:01:25.049> up<00:01:25.200> usually<00:01:25.460> that's

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
like to call this jump up usually that's

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.100 
like to call this jump up usually that's
usually<00:01:26.790> what<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:26.909> hear<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.210> hear<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.810> be<00:01:27.960> called

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
usually what I hear it hear it be called

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.240 
usually what I hear it hear it be called
especially<00:01:28.530> since<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.860> really<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> only

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
especially since it's really the only

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.700 
especially since it's really the only
place<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.850> actually<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> jump<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.500> I

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
place you can actually do a jump up I

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.130 
place you can actually do a jump up I
guess<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.280> slums<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:33.689> pretty<00:01:33.900> simple

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
next hard point or near the next hour

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.650 
next hard point or near the next hour
point<00:02:08.489> this<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.670> called<00:02:09.000> double<00:02:09.270> ds<00:02:09.420> because

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
point this is called double ds because

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.880 
point this is called double ds because
there's<00:02:09.810> one<00:02:09.989> dumpster<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.500> there's<00:02:10.709> two

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
there's one dumpster and there's two

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.830 
there's one dumpster and there's two
dumpsters<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.760> two<00:02:12.030> dumpsters<00:02:12.270> double<00:02:12.690> ds

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
dumpsters so two dumpsters double ds

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.790 
dumpsters so two dumpsters double ds
makes<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.290> kind<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.470> easy

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
makes it kind of easy

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.550 
makes it kind of easy
so<00:02:14.550> double<00:02:14.820> D's<00:02:14.940> works<00:02:15.300> for<00:02:15.630> this<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:16.380> would

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
so double D's works for this this would

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.380 
so double D's works for this this would
obviously<00:02:16.650> police<00:02:17.310> car<00:02:17.550> it's<00:02:18.030> actually<00:02:18.150> the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
they do that from right here and if they

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.000 
they do that from right here and if they
start<00:03:00.810> hitting<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.410> shooting<00:03:01.710> you<00:03:01.800> then

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
start hitting you and shooting you then

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.290 
start hitting you and shooting you then
you<00:03:02.100> can<00:03:02.220> pretty<00:03:02.340> much<00:03:02.430> go<00:03:02.730> prone<00:03:02.970> right<00:03:03.180> here

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
you can pretty much go prone right here

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.130 
you can pretty much go prone right here
and<00:03:03.390> they're<00:03:03.480> not<00:03:03.540> gonna<00:03:03.660> be<00:03:03.750> able<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.930> hit<00:03:03.990> you

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
and they're not gonna be able to hit you

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.120 
and they're not gonna be able to hit you
because<00:03:04.350> they're<00:03:04.560> not<00:03:04.650> going<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:04.830> know<00:03:04.920> where

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
because they're not going to know where

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.250 
because they're not going to know where
you<00:03:05.250> are<00:03:05.490> so<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.420> can<00:03:06.600> also<00:03:06.720> anchor<00:03:06.990> from<00:03:07.110> this

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
you are so you can also anchor from this

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
access to the actual hard point whereas

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.730 
access to the actual hard point whereas
the<00:03:11.640> other<00:03:11.670> spot<00:03:12.060> really<00:03:12.330> doesn't<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:13.560> can

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
the other spot really doesn't you can

the other spot really doesn't you can
kind<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.130> watch<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.940> way<00:03:15.090> but<00:03:15.360> it's<00:03:15.690> really

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
kind of watch that way but it's really

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.480 
kind of watch that way but it's really
not<00:03:16.080> that<00:03:16.140> effective<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.860> spot<00:03:17.040> if<00:03:17.280> your

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
not that effective so the spot if your

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.770 
not that effective so the spot if your

team needs help in the hardpoint you can

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.180 
team needs help in the hardpoint you can
go<00:03:18.870> right<00:03:19.020> here<00:03:19.230> it's<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.770> little<00:03:20.010> bit<00:03:20.100> better

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
go right here it's a little bit better

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.610 
go right here it's a little bit better
this<00:03:20.880> could<00:03:21.150> be<00:03:21.180> back<00:03:21.480> car<00:03:21.780> honestly<00:03:22.350> I'd<00:03:22.500> I've

this is one of the most trafficked areas

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.920 
this is one of the most trafficked areas
on<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.880> entire<00:04:00.120> map<00:04:00.330> it's<00:04:00.510> one<00:04:00.630> of<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.780> most

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
on the entire map it's one of the most

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.140 
on the entire map it's one of the most
important<00:04:01.830> areas<00:04:02.040> on<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.220> entire<00:04:02.459> map<00:04:02.640> this

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
important areas on the entire map this

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.150 
important areas on the entire map this
would<00:04:03.330> be<00:04:03.360> blue<00:04:03.660> stairs<00:04:03.930> mainly<00:04:04.800> it's<00:04:05.010> called

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
here almost everybody in the entire game

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.630 
here almost everybody in the entire game
calls<00:04:09.239> that<00:04:09.390> blue<00:04:09.600> so<00:04:09.780> this<00:04:09.900> is<00:04:10.019> blue<00:04:10.230> stairs

also worth noting this would be called
double<00:04:13.200> D<00:04:13.320> stairs<00:04:13.590> or<00:04:13.769> just<00:04:13.950> middle<00:04:14.220> stairs

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
would be tacking that hard point down

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.599 
would be tacking that hard point down

machines all over the place this could
get<00:05:11.570> a<00:05:11.630> little<00:05:11.720> bit<00:05:12.020> confusing<00:05:12.350> i<00:05:12.530> guess

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
has a laundry area but if you just

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.920 
has a laundry area but if you just
remember<00:05:16.520> what<00:05:16.760> map<00:05:16.940> you're<00:05:17.150> on<00:05:17.270> it<00:05:17.600> shouldn't

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
remember what map you're on it shouldn't

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.840 
remember what map you're on it shouldn't
be<00:05:17.990> too<00:05:18.140> confusing<00:05:18.460> hopefully<00:05:19.460> you<00:05:19.550> don't<00:05:19.640> get

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
be too confusing hopefully you don't get

that<00:05:20.000> confused<00:05:20.240> at<00:05:20.450> all<00:05:20.710> this<00:05:21.710> could<00:05:21.860> be

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
that confused at all this could be

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.890 
that confused at all this could be
called<00:05:22.100> red<00:05:22.310> car<00:05:22.520> I<00:05:22.550> guess<00:05:22.880> now<00:05:23.720> many<00:05:23.870> people

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
called red car I guess now many people

sit there anyway this is probably the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.790 
sit there anyway this is probably the

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
best anchor spot for both that hard

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.350
