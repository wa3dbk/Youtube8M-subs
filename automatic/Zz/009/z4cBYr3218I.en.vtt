00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.070
 very close 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.830
 I was playing devic at the beginning of 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.509
 meeting even called jacek he was 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.250
 in one place or just killing it is 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.350
 quick because I had a sword 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.939
 money in the hands of the galley 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.859
 and that's when I was in the next I 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.960
 I deleted smoked inventory very quickly 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.430
 I have a small web that naturalizes 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.280
 dinho is is to accelerate 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.079
 sorry guys there some mistakes that 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.730
 first time I'm doing a 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.399
 something you see as many nearby 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.890
 I thought it was very cool to do so. 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.629
 like that and also comment over 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.699
 people and there I went ps if a context is 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.149
 I'm craft box is edited I'm 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.789
 editing it a lot until then but it is very 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.489
 That's when I'm going to him when 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.100
 He came near to him, enjoying the sun 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.259
 hits it falls in the water is more a simple 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.410
 in the water with the aerial sword in hands 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:13.979
 was well digested guys then I dropei 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.750
 for ipad stone outside but watched catch 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.429
 her because someone michael fine me 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.880
 something brothers does not need to be a 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:22.050
 ax but was even has to fight but 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.310
 I do not think I even needed 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:29.280
 I was pursued lenk 4321 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.740
 he was he was stompers I stayed 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.739
 even a little afraid of him at the time 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.649
 they are over but nothing he said 

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:42.090
 single shot at him and he climbed the tower 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.069
 he is a little the one that was not in the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.810
 hour after I went to see it but not 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:52.050
 gave a lot there and with the search that is 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.750
 very cute is her color and she changes from 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.119
 colors so much time she and I stay 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.670
 changing faces so I'm going to win 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.500
 even when I look down I only see 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.530
 nick down 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.259
 Then I thought better and him now than 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.649
 then it was me and quickly the 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.080
 car to him and I go until he was good as 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.000
 I was one of the few 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.170
 that was the wetland I do not know why but 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.780
 a lot of people are not going 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.060
 The more I get there when 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.290
 I get in it 's covered it was very easy just 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.840
 break under him falls on me and good of 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.739
 few hits and little fall for everything 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.640
 How much is it side? 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:36.840
 but then when I go to see I already get 25 ayew 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.239
 I know how to do and they left very fast because I 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.350
 I will have a great advantage of pvp this 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.170
 it will be good 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.410
 there when I'm going to use once 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.959
 they do not have space to attach to this little bit 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.950
 Space, I'll pick you up , you 'll see what 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.590
 A very cool thing is going to happen. 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.830
 when after you finish doing 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.080
 first make a very big stupidity is 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.420
 a really big hit 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.470
 I'll put the stones on them. 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.420
 leave 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.420
 rafa is a very immense police 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.510
 the individual there things become of life and 10 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.430
 blocks in two furnaces because I was 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.410
 desperate that he had a car on top 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.959
 I wanted to get the zaire there. 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.200
 I was very desperate to 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:26.640
 to prevent there in the two furnaces his 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.410
 instead dividing the 8 and ended up doing more 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.170
 alright, people 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.090
 when I go to crucify my ax and the 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.880
 graphite not put on the street d neighborhood 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.799
 Good girl debate is not late for 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.959
 the entrance of our area because many 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.180
 slaves and was number 9 for this game 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.500
 It was very quick in the middle where I was 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.410
 team some hits with sword 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.739
 stone was already in her hands she died and went 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.760
 well driving I asked already inof that many 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.769
 wait at that time 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.769
 I went there to do things not only 11 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.709
 It's a pretty cool thing to pilot. 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.380
 have been almost died quite 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.970
 fear I made my pectoral I stayed 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.430
 one more person died said he requires 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.730
 because only then the guy thought he should 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.769
 is in double with someone is to see if he I 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.910
 I thought he was going for it. 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.609
 died right now 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.549
 then I thought now today but I'll do 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:20.940
 the things that he should have even if they had 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.850
 Soup is good to have my things and 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.860
 get out everything you had to do 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.860
 This is good people here. 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.580
 I did my things there, do not be clear. 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.770
 I lacked a helmet, but I'm fine , I'm alone. 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.020
 I got the last thing I was father and 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.250
 I went upstairs, huh? 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:48.610
 A little bit of fear, too. 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.240
 fear, I did not want to die, I was 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.420
 well prepared to win and but is 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.850
 also complicated to win but is already 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.410
 becoming quite annoyed that she did not 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.780
 managed to win a match for some time 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.120
 but I played I think about 11 for this 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.630
 It's a very difficult game to play. 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.660
 had no br yet on that day is the day that 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.669
 before 11 is not a this then I 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.250
 had dawn was not the last 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:18.190
 morning for the day christmas 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.820
 There you play that game. 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:24.040
 one day after the departure, the cpr left 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.740
 which is already so much less dropped this is 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.940
 very good but I still prefer is what 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.980
 I like a lot 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.960
 I was starting well in this part as 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:38.680
 I was fine today, I gave the 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:40.720
 Fear of me falling there I got there appeared 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.130
 on the compass it was no longer 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.740
 pointing to nobody 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.600
 There I picked up the wood I thought 'no I 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.060
 I have to finish it soon to finish it 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.610
 I met him growing up and he failed to rise 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.220
 It will be a problem for me too. 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.470
 horse on it if you have it down but it's more 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.000
 easy than it up I'm going to kiss 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.070
 again because as if it were a 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.340
 trampling fall not afraid of trump 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.169
 Trump was already quite scared when 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.780
 I suddenly think his leg 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.350
 kahombo aside and I will delude looking 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.280
 elly 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:17.770
 I already put another soup I look for pus 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.780
 popular with the other and I think they 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.930
 nothing gives the hits as part of a network 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:25.570
 without anything running away 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:28.270
 Then I even said that I wanted three matches 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.820
 for English bad but it's okay to 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.530
 face new 11 matches go to 7 usa 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.200
 this match that by what besides 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.669
 suddenly it the left idea that bpp 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.150
 is fighting a lot that the person can 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:41.710
 reenter the brain but that's just it 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.780
 same galley was worth all that 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.600
 watched 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:49.440
 I count on olic but the comment from you 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.270
 and do them first of all I'll leave 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.490
 for you to see an emeritus of olinda the 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:57.620
 epic that I did good to realize that no 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:07:00.210
 took more damage but it was mary gene rr 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.010
 so it was good to everyone who watched how much 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:06.830
 with olic but how do you forget the 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.830
