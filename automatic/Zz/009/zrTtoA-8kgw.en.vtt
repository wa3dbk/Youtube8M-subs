going to bring the scope in here as you

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.800 
going to bring the scope in here as you
can<00:03:58.010> see<00:03:58.099> like<00:03:58.459> I<00:03:58.579> said<00:03:58.819> it<00:03:59.000> is<00:03:59.030> not<00:03:59.120> a<00:03:59.419> red

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
can see like I said it is not a red

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.979 
can see like I said it is not a red
green<00:04:01.000> illuminated<00:04:02.000> cross<00:04:02.480> their<00:04:02.660> scope

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
green illuminated cross their scope

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.539 
green illuminated cross their scope
right<00:04:03.230> now<00:04:03.380> it's<00:04:03.560> off<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.250> can<00:04:04.310> see

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
right now it's off and you can see

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.520 
right now it's off and you can see
there's<00:04:04.700> no<00:04:04.790> crossers<00:04:05.239> in<00:04:05.389> there<00:04:05.750> so<00:04:06.500> I'm

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
there's no crossers in there so I'm

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.930 
there's no crossers in there so I'm
going<00:04:06.889> to<00:04:06.919> turn<00:04:07.099> it<00:04:07.250> on<00:04:07.310> as<00:04:07.519> best<00:04:07.639> as<00:04:07.819> I<00:04:07.880> can

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
going to turn it on as best as I can

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.309 
going to turn it on as best as I can
with<00:04:08.299> the<00:04:08.389> different<00:04:08.690> variations<00:04:09.200> of

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
with the different variations of

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.409 
with the different variations of
brightness<00:04:09.709> going<00:04:10.040> from<00:04:10.250> red<00:04:10.459> to<00:04:10.669> green<00:04:10.700> so

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
brightness going from red to green so

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.860 
brightness going from red to green so
it's<00:04:11.690> hopefully<00:04:12.019> you<00:04:12.109> can<00:04:12.200> see<00:04:12.500> this<00:04:13.720> get<00:04:14.720> the

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
it's hopefully you can see this get the

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.849 
it's hopefully you can see this get the
suggested<00:04:15.500> good<00:04:17.109> bring<00:04:18.109> it<00:04:18.169> right<00:04:18.410> up<00:04:18.470> we'll

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
suggested good bring it right up we'll

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.650 
suggested good bring it right up we'll
bring<00:04:18.979> it<00:04:19.130> right<00:04:19.160> up<00:04:19.280> just<00:04:19.609> like<00:04:19.700> this<00:04:19.880> so<00:04:20.479> it's

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
bring it right up just like this so it's

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.200 
bring it right up just like this so it's
like<00:04:20.989> you're<00:04:21.109> looking<00:04:21.260> in<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.560> scope<00:04:22.210> so

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
like you're looking in the scope so

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.580 
like you're looking in the scope so
there<00:04:23.539> you<00:04:23.570> go<00:04:25.270> first<00:04:26.270> right<00:04:26.840> now<00:04:26.990> second<00:04:27.410> bite

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
there you go first right now second bite

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.839 
there you go first right now second bite
us<00:04:28.060> third<00:04:29.060> and<00:04:29.810> then<00:04:30.740> fourth<00:04:31.250> kind<00:04:31.580> of<00:04:31.669> hard<00:04:31.789> to

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
us third and then fourth kind of hard to

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.679 
us third and then fourth kind of hard to
see<00:04:32.090> there

00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:33.689 
see there

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.199 
see there
and<00:04:33.779> then<00:04:34.649> we're<00:04:35.189> going<00:04:35.279> to<00:04:35.339> go<00:04:35.459> back<00:04:35.489> to<00:04:35.729> zero

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:36.209 
and then we're going to go back to zero

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:43.809 
and then we're going to go back to zero
and<00:04:37.639> now<00:04:38.639> adjusted<00:04:39.360> green<00:04:40.879> first<00:04:42.349> second<00:04:43.349> and

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
and now adjusted green first second and

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.819 
and now adjusted green first second and
third<00:04:44.959> I'm<00:04:45.959> going<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.169> go<00:04:46.229> back<00:04:46.379> to<00:04:46.409> the<00:04:46.559> first

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:46.829 
third I'm going to go back to the first

00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:48.439 
third I'm going to go back to the first
brightness<00:04:47.369> hopefully<00:04:47.759> you<00:04:47.849> guys<00:04:47.969> can<00:04:48.029> see

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
brightness hopefully you guys can see

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.559 
brightness hopefully you guys can see
this<00:04:48.599> is<00:04:48.779> going<00:04:48.899> to<00:04:48.989> try<00:04:49.139> and<00:04:49.169> zoom<00:04:49.529> in<00:04:50.569> let's

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
this is going to try and zoom in let's

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:56.839 
this is going to try and zoom in let's
see<00:04:51.869> I<00:04:54.259> know<00:04:55.259> that<00:04:55.529> looks<00:04:55.799> kind<00:04:56.099> of<00:04:56.159> bad<00:04:56.489> from

the tightness of it and yeah I mean like

00:05:57.869 --> 00:05:59.509 
the tightness of it and yeah I mean like
I<00:05:58.019> said<00:05:58.050> it's<00:05:58.349> a<00:05:58.379> fantastic<00:05:59.009> scope<00:05:59.249> is

00:05:59.509 --> 00:05:59.519 
I said it's a fantastic scope is

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:01.790 
I said it's a fantastic scope is
relatively<00:06:00.089> cheap<00:06:00.389> really<00:06:01.019> high<00:06:01.110> quality<00:06:01.139> I

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
relatively cheap really high quality I

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.729
