here's<00:00:01.110> something<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:01.770> see<00:00:02.100> homeowners<00:00:02.610> and

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
here's something I see homeowners and

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.910 
here's something I see homeowners and
do-it-yourselfers<00:00:03.990> doing<00:00:04.440> but<00:00:04.680> you're

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
do-it-yourselfers doing but you're

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.530 
do-it-yourselfers doing but you're
probably<00:00:05.130> never<00:00:05.640> going<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.060> see<00:00:06.330> a

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
probably never going to see a

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.990 
probably never going to see a
professional<00:00:07.040> concrete<00:00:08.040> finisher<00:00:08.700> do

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
professional concrete finisher do

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.220 
professional concrete finisher do
something<00:00:09.450> like<00:00:09.630> this

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
something like this

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.110 
something like this
and<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:10.980> would<00:00:11.070> actually<00:00:11.219> be<00:00:11.460> if<00:00:11.700> you<00:00:11.849> have<00:00:12.090> a

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
and that would actually be if you have a

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.279 
and that would actually be if you have a
set<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.690> porch<00:00:13.230> stairs<00:00:14.929> something<00:00:15.929> like<00:00:16.109> the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
set of porch stairs something like the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.930 
set of porch stairs something like the
one<00:00:16.470> you're<00:00:16.619> looking<00:00:16.650> at<00:00:17.070> here<00:00:17.340> again<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
one you're looking at here again the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.480 
one you're looking at here again the
picture<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:18.930> actually<00:00:19.320> came<00:00:19.800> across<00:00:19.859> I

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
picture that I actually came across I

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.040 
picture that I actually came across I
can't<00:00:20.730> use<00:00:20.970> these<00:00:21.150> pictures<00:00:21.420> because<00:00:21.779> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
can't use these pictures because the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.590 
can't use these pictures because the
copyright<00:00:22.470> laws<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.310> don't<00:00:24.150> want<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.359> get<00:00:24.480> in

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
copyright laws I don't want to get in

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.420 
copyright laws I don't want to get in
trouble<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.140> kind<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:25.650> drew<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.189> one

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
trouble so I kind of just drew this one

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.429 
trouble so I kind of just drew this one
myself<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.390> if<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.539> could<00:00:27.660> just<00:00:27.810> imagine<00:00:28.140> a

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
myself so if you could just imagine a

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.759 
myself so if you could just imagine a
small<00:00:28.680> set<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.670> concrete<00:00:29.910> stairs<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:31.320> up<00:00:31.560> to

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
small set of concrete stairs going up to

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.370 
small set of concrete stairs going up to
either<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.040> concrete<00:00:32.669> deck<00:00:33.059> or<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> wood<00:00:34.020> deck

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
either a concrete deck or a wood deck

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.750 
either a concrete deck or a wood deck
and<00:00:35.390> then<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.660> homeowner<00:00:37.350> or<00:00:37.760> do-it-yourselfer

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
and then a homeowner or do-it-yourselfer

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.840 
and then a homeowner or do-it-yourselfer
wanting<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.930> extend<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.160> width<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.760> length

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
wanting to extend the width and length

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.680 
wanting to extend the width and length
of<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:43.170> stairs<00:00:43.969> now<00:00:44.969> what<00:00:45.000> you're<00:00:45.360> looking<00:00:45.390> at

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
of the stairs now what you're looking at

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.380 
of the stairs now what you're looking at
here<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.140> concrete<00:00:46.559> form<00:00:47.190> board<00:00:47.700> around<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
here is a concrete form board around the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.799 
here is a concrete form board around the
stairs<00:00:48.660> again<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.170> goal<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.860> extend

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
stairs again the goal here is to extend

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.860 
stairs again the goal here is to extend
the<00:00:52.160> steps<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.579> you're<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.690> fill

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the steps so you're just going to fill

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.840 
the steps so you're just going to fill
it<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.260> know<00:00:55.350> build<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.739> form<00:00:56.010> around<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
it you know build a form around it and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.689 
it you know build a form around it and
fill<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.480> up<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:57.870> concrete<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.680> again<00:00:59.100> this

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
fill it up with concrete and again this

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.139 
fill it up with concrete and again this
is<00:01:00.469> something<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.949> lot<00:01:02.219> more<00:01:02.250> often<00:01:02.969> than

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
is something I see a lot more often than

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.260 
is something I see a lot more often than
I<00:01:03.180> would<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:04.129> whether<00:01:05.129> or<00:01:05.549> not<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:06.119> are

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270

I would like to whether or not you are
going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.659> make<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.110> stairs<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.680> same<00:01:07.950> height

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
going to make the stairs the same height

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.960 
going to make the stairs the same height
or<00:01:08.790> raise<00:01:09.720> them<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.350> let's<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.460> say<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.820> you

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
or raise them up let's just say that you

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.820 
or raise them up let's just say that you
wanted<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> forms<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.930> raise<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.380> 2<00:01:13.590> inches

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
wanted the forms to raise up 2 inches

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.460 
wanted the forms to raise up 2 inches
for<00:01:14.460> whatever<00:01:14.640> reason<00:01:15.119> maybe<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> set

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
for whatever reason maybe you have a set

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.330 
for whatever reason maybe you have a set
of<00:01:16.500> stairs<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:18.860> isn't<00:01:19.860> built<00:01:20.070> right

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
of stairs that is isn't built right

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.480 
of stairs that is isn't built right
something<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.450> I'm<00:01:21.979> going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.159> suggest

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
something like that I'm going to suggest

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.719 
something like that I'm going to suggest
and<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.990> big<00:01:25.170> biggie<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.520> you

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
and this is the big biggie here that you

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.719 
and this is the big biggie here that you
remove<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:28.259> concrete<00:01:28.979> stairs<00:01:29.630> instead<00:01:30.630> of

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
remove the concrete stairs instead of

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.520 
remove the concrete stairs instead of
using<00:01:32.729> them<00:01:32.970> or<00:01:33.240> incorporating<00:01:34.020> them<00:01:34.229> into

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
using them or incorporating them into

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.910 
using them or incorporating them into
your<00:01:35.310> stairway<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:37.049> you're<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.740> do

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
your stairway and if you're going to do

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.230 
your stairway and if you're going to do
something<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.579> where<00:01:38.729> you're<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.060> have

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
something to where you're going to have

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.690 
something to where you're going to have
about<00:01:39.420> 10<00:01:39.900> inches<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.350> concrete<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.280> between

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
about 10 inches of concrete in between

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.749 
about 10 inches of concrete in between
the<00:01:41.880> existing<00:01:42.210> stairs<00:01:43.009> you<00:01:44.009> might<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.700> a

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
the existing stairs you might not have a

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.060 
the existing stairs you might not have a
problem<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:46.049> know<00:01:46.229> but<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:46.649> that's<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.950> case

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
problem you know but if that's the case

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.249 
problem you know but if that's the case
obviously<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:48.360> know<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.020> 10

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
obviously you know if you can have 10

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.399 
obviously you know if you can have 10
inches<00:01:49.470> you're<00:01:49.860> not<00:01:50.040> going<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.520> worry<00:01:50.880> about

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
inches you're not going to worry about

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.710 
inches you're not going to worry about
the<00:01:52.409> concrete<00:01:53.189> stairs<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.909> there<00:01:54.149> or<00:01:54.540> you

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
the concrete stairs in there or you

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.959 
the concrete stairs in there or you
might<00:01:54.899> remove<00:01:55.259> them<00:01:55.439> anyway<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.490> hope<00:01:56.759> I'm

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
might remove them anyway and I hope I'm

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.550 
might remove them anyway and I hope I'm
making<00:01:57.000> sense<00:01:57.810> here<00:01:58.200> if<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.490> think<00:01:59.759> I<00:02:00.090> will

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
making sense here if not I think I will

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.830 
making sense here if not I think I will
further<00:02:01.560> along<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.369> video<00:02:02.840> so

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
further along in the video so

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.840 
further along in the video so

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
this it's like I said this is something

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.410 
this it's like I said this is something
I<00:02:22.420> see<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.720> lot<00:02:22.960> of<00:02:22.990> homeowners<00:02:23.740> doing

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
I see a lot of homeowners doing

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.100 
I see a lot of homeowners doing
do-it-yourselfers<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:25.630> you're<00:02:25.780> not<00:02:25.870> going

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
do-it-yourselfers but you're not going

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.840 
do-it-yourselfers but you're not going
to<00:02:26.200> see<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:26.350> professional<00:02:26.590> because<00:02:27.250> they<00:02:27.580> know

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
to see a professional because they know

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.990 
to see a professional because they know
this<00:02:28.750> stuff<00:02:29.080> will<00:02:29.380> crack<00:02:29.770> in<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.310> future<00:02:30.760> and

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
this stuff will crack in the future and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.020 
this stuff will crack in the future and
it<00:02:31.630> can<00:02:31.780> actually<00:02:31.930> crack<00:02:32.500> right<00:02:32.920> around<00:02:33.400> the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
it can actually crack right around the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.060 
it can actually crack right around the
perimeter<00:02:34.990> of<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:36.400> area<00:02:37.740> underneath<00:02:38.740> where

perimeter of the area underneath where

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.250

the stairs would have been located the

the stairs would have been located the
existing<00:02:41.830> stairway<00:02:42.490> it's<00:02:43.150> not<00:02:43.420> uncommon<00:02:43.900> to

crack<00:02:47.290> from<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.710> corners

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
crack from the corners

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.820 
crack from the corners
it'll<00:02:49.120> just<00:02:49.360> crack<00:02:49.600> from<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:52.320> corner<00:02:53.320> of<00:02:53.350> the

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
it'll just crack from the corner of the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.100 
it'll just crack from the corner of the
new<00:02:54.040> concrete<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.320> corner<00:02:56.320> of<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:57.220> area

where the existing stairs were now this

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.140 
where the existing stairs were now this
like<00:03:01.570> I<00:03:01.750> said<00:03:01.780> earlier<00:03:02.380> will<00:03:03.250> also<00:03:03.730> apply<00:03:04.060> to

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
like I said earlier will also apply to

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.960 
like I said earlier will also apply to
stairs<00:03:05.160> let's<00:03:06.160> say<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.520> you're<00:03:06.640> going<00:03:06.910> to

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
stairs let's say that you're going to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.410 
stairs let's say that you're going to
raise<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:08.320> stairway<00:03:08.830> up<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.460> inches<00:03:09.940> so

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
raise the stairway up to inches so

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.120 
raise the stairway up to inches so
you're<00:03:10.720> going<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.900> have<00:03:11.080> two<00:03:11.380> inches<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.890> new

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
you're going to have two inches of new

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.120 
you're going to have two inches of new
concrete<00:03:12.640> over<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.180> existing<00:03:13.690> concrete<00:03:14.130> well

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
concrete over the existing concrete well

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.010 
concrete over the existing concrete well
if<00:03:15.310> that's<00:03:15.490> the<00:03:15.700> case<00:03:15.790> I<00:03:16.330> need<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:16.630> to<00:03:16.780> take<00:03:16.990> a

looking<00:03:27.640> at<00:03:27.850> a<00:03:28.350> room<00:03:29.350> addition<00:03:30.010> slab<00:03:30.580> this<00:03:31.000> was

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
looking at a room addition slab this was

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.050 
looking at a room addition slab this was
a<00:03:31.300> slab<00:03:31.840> that<00:03:32.260> was<00:03:32.320> poured<00:03:32.770> onto<00:03:33.070> an<00:03:33.640> existing

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
a slab that was poured onto an existing

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.810 
a slab that was poured onto an existing
home<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:37.120> area<00:03:37.630> you're<00:03:38.020> looking<00:03:38.050> at

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
home and the area you're looking at

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.040 
home and the area you're looking at
would<00:03:39.820> have<00:03:40.150> been<00:03:40.420> where<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.290> stoop<00:03:41.920> or<00:03:42.220> a

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
would have been where the stoop or a

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.630 
would have been where the stoop or a
concrete<00:03:44.050> porch<00:03:44.380> let's<00:03:44.770> say<00:03:44.980> little<00:03:45.250> little

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
concrete porch let's say little little

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.699 
concrete porch let's say little little
little<00:03:48.000> concrete<00:03:49.000> pad<00:03:49.420> that<00:03:50.110> would<00:03:50.320> have<00:03:50.440> been

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
little concrete pad that would have been

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.420 
little concrete pad that would have been
maybe<00:03:51.160> 36<00:03:51.730> inches<00:03:52.330> by<00:03:52.510> 36<00:03:52.900> inches<00:03:53.430> something

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
maybe 36 inches by 36 inches something

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.280 
maybe 36 inches by 36 inches something
like<00:03:54.610> that<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.660> if<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:55.900> would<00:03:55.990> have<00:03:56.050> stepped

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
like that so if you would have stepped

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.480 
like that so if you would have stepped
outside<00:03:56.620> of<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:58.720> kitchen<00:03:59.230> door<00:03:59.530> you<00:04:00.370> would

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
outside of the kitchen door you would

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.550 
outside of the kitchen door you would
have<00:04:00.610> stepped<00:04:00.790> on<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.300> the<00:04:01.330> concrete<00:04:01.840> pad<00:04:02.200> and

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
have stepped on to the concrete pad and

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.310 
have stepped on to the concrete pad and
then<00:04:02.920> on<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.790> dirt<00:04:04.000> or<00:04:04.300> another<00:04:04.600> walkway

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
then on to the dirt or another walkway

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.590 
then on to the dirt or another walkway
and<00:04:05.500> this<00:04:05.650> is<00:04:05.800> common<00:04:06.280> with<00:04:06.880> homes<00:04:07.180> and

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600

level inside the house well there are
plenty<00:04:17.230> of<00:04:17.500> people<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:18.040> I've<00:04:18.160> even<00:04:18.310> done<00:04:18.580> it

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
plenty of people and I've even done it

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.750 
plenty of people and I've even done it
myself<00:04:19.230> where<00:04:20.230> you<00:04:20.620> just<00:04:20.830> simply<00:04:21.010> pour<00:04:21.430> over

area that you're going to be able to
fill<00:04:27.610> up<00:04:27.849> and<00:04:28.210> and<00:04:29.020> it's<00:04:29.830> hey<00:04:30.039> let's<00:04:30.310> just<00:04:30.400> go

ahead and fill it up well this is

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.290 
ahead and fill it up well this is
usually<00:04:32.889> what's<00:04:33.129> going<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.520> happen<00:04:34.060> you'll

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
usually what's going to happen you'll

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.670 
usually what's going to happen you'll
get<00:04:34.539> a<00:04:34.569> nice<00:04:34.870> crack<00:04:35.379> all<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.830> way<00:04:36.819> around<00:04:37.680> the

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
get a nice crack all the way around the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.939 
get a nice crack all the way around the
area<00:04:39.490> where<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.539> where<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:40.960> existing<00:04:41.289> stairs

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
area where the where the existing stairs

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.610 
area where the where the existing stairs
were<00:04:42.719> so<00:04:43.719> you're<00:04:43.900> probably<00:04:44.020> thinking<00:04:44.229> hey

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
were so you're probably thinking hey

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.969 
were so you're probably thinking hey
what's<00:04:44.949> the<00:04:45.189> safest<00:04:45.639> distance<00:04:46.150> or<00:04:46.300> the

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
what's the safest distance or the

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.070 
what's the safest distance or the
minimum<00:04:47.979> distance<00:04:48.490> that<00:04:48.580> you<00:04:48.909> could<00:04:49.090> go<00:04:49.330> where

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
minimum distance that you could go where

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.659 
minimum distance that you could go where
you<00:04:50.259> wouldn't<00:04:50.469> have<00:04:50.620> a<00:04:50.740> crack<00:04:51.129> and<00:04:51.460> that's

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
you wouldn't have a crack and that's

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.869 
you wouldn't have a crack and that's
that's<00:04:51.849> hard<00:04:52.240> for<00:04:52.360> me<00:04:52.629> to<00:04:52.840> answer<00:04:53.520> six<00:04:54.520> inches

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:54.879 
that's hard for me to answer six inches

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:58.110 
that's hard for me to answer six inches
maybe<00:04:55.330> again<00:04:56.020> that's<00:04:56.289> maybe<00:04:56.699> do<00:04:57.699> you<00:04:57.789> need<00:04:58.000> to

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
maybe again that's maybe do you need to

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.510 
maybe again that's maybe do you need to
tear<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.479> entire<00:04:58.509> stairway<00:04:59.349> out<00:04:59.560> if<00:05:00.310> you're

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
tear the entire stairway out if you're

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.809 
tear the entire stairway out if you're
going<00:05:00.729> to<00:05:00.819> be<00:05:00.939> building<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:02.159> larger<00:05:03.159> one<00:05:03.340> on<00:05:03.400> top

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
going to be building a larger one on top

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.029 
going to be building a larger one on top
of<00:05:04.060> it<00:05:04.210> hey<00:05:04.779> I'm<00:05:05.110> going<00:05:05.229> to<00:05:05.319> leave<00:05:05.529> that<00:05:05.560> up<00:05:05.830> to
