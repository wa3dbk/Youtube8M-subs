00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.080 
that way you can just food process it
and<00:01:58.649> then<00:01:58.860> Vitamix<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.610> I'm<00:01:59.700> using<00:01:59.880> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
and then Vitamix it so I'm using the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.580 
and then Vitamix it so I'm using the
Vitamix<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.750> I'm<00:02:00.810> gonna<00:02:00.930> put<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.350> full

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
Vitamix and I'm gonna put it on full

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.459 
Vitamix and I'm gonna put it on full
blast<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:03.240> push<00:02:03.479> into<00:02:03.810> each<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
blast and just push into each of the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.039 
blast and just push into each of the
corners<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.759> should<00:02:06.000> solidify<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.840> then

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
corners and it should solidify and then

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.540 
corners and it should solidify and then
I<00:02:07.079> might<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.350> hold<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.860> straight<00:02:08.129> down<00:02:08.369> and

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
I might just hold it straight down and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:03:39.990 
I might just hold it straight down and
get<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.940> turn<00:02:09.349> let's<00:02:10.349> see

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.970 

okay<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.270> that's<00:03:41.629> it<00:03:41.900> done<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.739> don't<00:03:42.860> want

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
okay and that's it done you don't want

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.110 
okay and that's it done you don't want
to<00:03:43.040> do<00:03:43.099> it<00:03:43.190> for<00:03:43.310> too<00:03:43.550> long

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
to do it for too long

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.110 
to do it for too long
once<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:44.870> find<00:03:45.230> once<00:03:45.530> it'll<00:03:46.459> get<00:03:46.640> started<00:03:46.940> just

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
once I find once it'll get started just

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.820 
once I find once it'll get started just
put<00:03:47.300> the<00:03:47.420> vitami<00:03:47.840> I<00:03:47.989> mean<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.379> plunges

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.040 
put the vitami I mean the plunges
straight<00:03:49.129> down<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:50.030> seems<00:03:50.300> to<00:03:50.480> make<00:03:50.599> it<00:03:50.660> turn<00:03:51.019> a

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
straight down it seems to make it turn a
