just make a slow attack like we talked
about<00:00:54.720> I<00:00:56.660> might<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.750> able<00:00:57.810> to<00:00:57.930> get<00:00:58.080> him<00:00:58.170> but

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
about I might be able to get him but

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.970 
about I might be able to get him but
it's<00:01:00.900> pretty<00:01:01.080> easy<00:01:01.290> for<00:01:01.440> him<00:01:01.560> to<00:01:01.620> block<00:01:01.770> for

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
it's pretty easy for him to block for

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.360 
it's pretty easy for him to block for
the<00:01:02.040> shield

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the shield

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.450 
the shield
-<00:01:02.490> he<00:01:03.120> wasn't<00:01:03.360> even<00:01:03.510> moving<00:01:03.630> in<00:01:03.870> any<00:01:04.020> block<00:01:04.460> so

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
- he wasn't even moving in any block so

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.400 
- he wasn't even moving in any block so
instead<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.630> going<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> straight

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
instead of just going in for a straight

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.850 
instead of just going in for a straight
attack<00:01:07.760> what<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.880> want<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.120> do<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.650> step<00:01:10.650> out

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
attack what you want to do is step out

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
now look fighting and normally like this

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.820 
now look fighting and normally like this
versus<00:01:20.369> stepping<00:01:20.760> up<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.750> now<00:01:22.380> this

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
versus stepping up here and now this

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.920 
versus stepping up here and now this
side<00:01:23.160> isn't<00:01:23.460> open<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> me<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.660> didn't<00:01:24.810> even

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
side isn't open to me and I didn't even

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.510 
side isn't open to me and I didn't even
have<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.290> do<00:01:25.410> a<00:01:25.440> bathroom<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:26.040> they<00:01:26.130> never<00:01:26.250> just

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
have to do a bathroom if they never just

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.400 
have to do a bathroom if they never just
make<00:01:27.300> it<00:01:27.420> make<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.600> straight<00:01:27.840> attack<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:30.410> don't

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
make it make a straight attack so don't

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.800 
make it make a straight attack so don't
confine<00:01:31.770> yourself<00:01:32.160> just<00:01:32.520> going<00:01:32.850> forward<00:01:33.720> and

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
confine yourself just going forward and

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.719 
confine yourself just going forward and
backward<00:01:34.229> instead<00:01:34.950> look<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> openings

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
backward instead look for the openings

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.310 
backward instead look for the openings
that<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.790> will<00:01:39.150> get<00:01:39.360> when<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:39.990> move<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
that you will get when you move to a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.050 
that you will get when you move to a
different<00:01:40.350> position<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:41.310> works<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:41.640> same<00:01:41.700> way

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
different position it works the same way

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.930 
different position it works the same way
for<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:42.869> shield<00:01:43.140> side<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:46.560> here<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.850> do

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
for the shield side so here we can do

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.410 
for the shield side so here we can do
those<00:01:48.270> wraps<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.750> talked<00:01:49.140> about<00:01:50.420> and

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
those wraps I talked about and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.669 
those wraps I talked about and
aggressive<00:01:51.750> block<00:01:51.899> because<00:01:52.200> he<00:01:52.259> has<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> corner

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
aggressive block because he has a corner

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.330 
aggressive block because he has a corner
of<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.800> shield<00:01:53.009> right<00:01:53.130> there<00:01:55.160> similarly<00:01:56.160> people

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
of a shield right there similarly people

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.590 
of a shield right there similarly people
are<00:01:56.490> actually<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.820> don't<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> penny<00:01:57.330> of<00:01:57.450> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
are actually I don't have a penny of a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.390 
are actually I don't have a penny of a
shield<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:58.800> if<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.789> step<00:02:00.000> out<00:02:00.210> or<00:02:02.509> I

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
shield but if I step out or I

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.800 
shield but if I step out or I
maybe<00:02:06.210> even<00:02:06.570> love<00:02:08.330> which<00:02:09.330> we<00:02:09.479> said<00:02:09.690> you

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
maybe even love which we said you

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.720 
maybe even love which we said you
shouldn't<00:02:10.320> bother<00:02:10.410> ribs<00:02:10.770> if<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.370> can<00:02:11.550> get

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
shouldn't bother ribs if you can get

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.510 
shouldn't bother ribs if you can get
over<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:12.180> this<00:02:12.300> side<00:02:13.010> then<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.160> can<00:02:14.190> make<00:02:14.430> an

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
over on this side then you can make an

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.400 
over on this side then you can make an
attack<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.120> have<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.600> minimal<00:02:15.960> risk<00:02:16.140> of

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
attack and have a minimal risk of

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.950 
attack and have a minimal risk of
counter-attack<00:02:17.450> because<00:02:18.450> your<00:02:18.570> shield<00:02:18.840> is

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
counter-attack because your shield is

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.470 
counter-attack because your shield is
there<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.230> protect<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:22.040> similarly<00:02:23.450> there<00:02:24.450> are

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
there to protect you similarly there are

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.650 
there to protect you similarly there are
variations<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.560> stance<00:02:25.920> even<00:02:26.240> using<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.360> same

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
variations in stance even using the same

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.320 
variations in stance even using the same
tribal<00:02:28.470> defense<00:02:28.890> we<00:02:29.040> talked<00:02:29.250> about<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:30.090> can

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.110 
number of differences and advantages in
this<00:02:40.050> manner<00:02:40.320> goes<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.620> each<00:02:40.710> of<00:02:40.860> these<00:02:41.120> with

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
this manner goes to each of these with

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.290 
this manner goes to each of these with
the<00:02:42.230> left<00:02:43.400> foot<00:02:44.400> forward<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.850> shield<00:02:45.060> foot

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
the left foot forward the shield foot

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.020 
the left foot forward the shield foot
forward<00:02:45.660> we<00:02:46.590> have<00:02:46.710> a<00:02:46.740> stronger<00:02:47.340> defense<00:02:47.700> right

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
forward we have a stronger defense right

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.060 
forward we have a stronger defense right
because<00:02:48.360> shield<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:49.470> there<00:02:49.650> protecting<00:02:52.070> and

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
because shield is there protecting and

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.480 
because shield is there protecting and
firstly<00:02:53.730> if<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.270> have<00:02:54.450> my<00:02:54.660> right<00:02:54.840> foot<00:02:55.080> forward

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
firstly if I have my right foot forward

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.430 
firstly if I have my right foot forward
I'm<00:02:56.490> a<00:02:56.550> little<00:02:56.820> weaker<00:02:57.120> because<00:02:57.900> my<00:02:58.050> body<00:02:58.260> is

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
I'm a little weaker because my body is

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.940 
I'm a little weaker because my body is
turned<00:02:58.680> towards<00:02:59.040> him<00:02:59.250> so<00:03:00.080> it's<00:03:01.080> it's<00:03:01.530> easier

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
turned towards him so it's it's easier

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.240 
turned towards him so it's it's easier
for<00:03:02.040> him<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.340> get<00:03:02.490> inside<00:03:03.110> but<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.800> advantage

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
for him to get inside but the advantage

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.420 
for him to get inside but the advantage
to<00:03:06.170> right<00:03:07.170> foot<00:03:07.410> forward<00:03:07.740> to<00:03:07.860> sword<00:03:08.220> foot

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
to right foot forward to sword foot

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.220 
to right foot forward to sword foot
forward<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:09.240> that<00:03:09.390> even<00:03:09.630> much<00:03:09.720> greater<00:03:09.989> range

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
forward is that even much greater range

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.530 
forward is that even much greater range
so<00:03:10.860> let's<00:03:11.100> let's<00:03:11.550> prepare<00:03:11.910> his<00:03:12.570> sword<00:03:14.330> is<00:03:15.330> so

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
so let's let's prepare his sword is so

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.350 
so let's let's prepare his sword is so
much<00:03:15.690> shorter<00:03:15.930> than<00:03:16.140> mine<00:03:16.320> but<00:03:17.190> when<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.239> have

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
much shorter than mine but when I have

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.030 
much shorter than mine but when I have
my<00:03:18.510> left<00:03:18.780> foot<00:03:18.989> but<00:03:19.320> he<00:03:19.380> has<00:03:19.560> his<00:03:19.709> right<00:03:19.860> foot

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
my left foot but he has his right foot

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.040 
my left foot but he has his right foot
forward<00:03:21.920> we<00:03:22.920> have<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.070> comparable<00:03:23.550> range

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
forward we have a comparable range

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.820 
forward we have a comparable range
similarly<00:03:25.050> you<00:03:25.530> can<00:03:25.650> compare<00:03:25.980> here<00:03:27.650> versus<00:03:28.650> if

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
similarly you can compare here versus if

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.380 
similarly you can compare here versus if
I<00:03:28.950> switch<00:03:29.190> off

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.230 

I<00:03:32.420> gained<00:03:33.140> about<00:03:33.170> 6<00:03:33.740> inches<00:03:33.890> in<00:03:34.100> range<00:03:34.310> now<00:03:35.120> of

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
I gained about 6 inches in range now of

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.500 
I gained about 6 inches in range now of
course<00:03:35.450> if<00:03:35.720> I<00:03:35.810> switch<00:03:36.050> off<00:03:36.970> my<00:03:37.970> arm<00:03:38.210> is<00:03:38.360> going

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
course if I switch off my arm is going

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.840 
course if I switch off my arm is going
to<00:03:38.570> disclose<00:03:38.840> my<00:03:39.170> attack<00:03:39.610> so<00:03:40.610> this<00:03:40.760> is

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
to disclose my attack so this is

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:41.920 
to disclose my attack so this is
something<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.090> have<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.270> take<00:03:41.420> into<00:03:41.660> a<00:03:41.690> house

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
something you have to take into a house

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.260 
something you have to take into a house
you<00:03:42.110> can<00:03:42.260> do<00:03:42.350> we<00:03:42.590> talked<00:03:42.770> about<00:03:42.920> earlier<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:44.090> it

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
you can do we talked about earlier is it

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.470 
you can do we talked about earlier is it
your<00:03:44.360> shield<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:46.640> protect<00:03:46.820> yourself<00:03:47.210> against

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
your shield to protect yourself against

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.780 
your shield to protect yourself against
an<00:03:47.540> attack<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:48.170> really<00:03:49.040> there<00:03:49.190> are<00:03:49.310> many

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
an attack and really there are many

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.720 
an attack and really there are many
different<00:03:50.300> ways<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:50.540> do<00:03:50.660> this<00:03:50.810> but

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
different ways to do this but

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.560 
different ways to do this but
essentially<00:03:52.730> when<00:03:52.940> you<00:03:53.000> have<00:03:53.120> your<00:03:53.210> sword<00:03:53.420> put

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
essentially when you have your sword put

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.840 
essentially when you have your sword put
forward<00:03:53.870> whether<00:03:54.800> weaker<00:03:55.130> defense<00:03:55.520> which<00:03:55.730> you

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
forward whether weaker defense which you

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.150 
forward whether weaker defense which you
have<00:03:55.970> to<00:03:56.060> compensate<00:03:56.570> for<00:03:56.780> but<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:58.010> have<00:03:58.130> a

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
have to compensate for but you have a

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.920 
have to compensate for but you have a
much<00:03:58.370> greater<00:03:58.670> range<00:03:58.940> on<00:03:59.510> offense

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
much greater range on offense

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.520 
much greater range on offense
when<00:04:02.930> you<00:04:02.989> have<00:04:03.140> your<00:04:03.260> left<00:04:03.439> foot<00:04:03.849> shield<00:04:05.530> you

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
when you have your left foot shield you

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.809 
when you have your left foot shield you
can<00:04:06.680> generate<00:04:07.010> power<00:04:07.090> much<00:04:08.090> more<00:04:08.299> easily

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
can generate power much more easily

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.429 
can generate power much more easily
especially<00:04:10.819> true<00:04:11.030> if<00:04:11.390> you<00:04:11.569> step<00:04:11.870> in<00:04:11.989> with<00:04:12.409> your

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:12.439 
especially true if you step in with your

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.559 
especially true if you step in with your
right<00:04:12.560> foot<00:04:12.709> attack<00:04:13.459> just<00:04:14.060> like<00:04:14.209> I<00:04:14.329> said<00:04:14.390> you

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
right foot attack just like I said you

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.920 
right foot attack just like I said you
shouldn't<00:04:14.840> do<00:04:15.070> you<00:04:16.070> can<00:04:16.250> try<00:04:16.519> it<00:04:16.579> if<00:04:17.540> you<00:04:17.600> do<00:04:17.900> it

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
shouldn't do you can try it if you do it

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.640 
shouldn't do you can try it if you do it
under<00:04:18.590> control<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:19.370> you<00:04:19.910> don't<00:04:20.090> you<00:04:23.500> which<00:04:24.500> is

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
under control and you don't you which is

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.620 
under control and you don't you which is
now<00:04:24.800> easier<00:04:25.250> for<00:04:25.370> me<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.490> hit<00:04:25.699> but<00:04:26.000> China<00:04:26.240> has<00:04:26.600> a

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
now easier for me to hit but China has a

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.810 
now easier for me to hit but China has a
forward<00:04:26.960> I<00:04:27.380> see<00:04:28.010> a<00:04:28.160> lot<00:04:28.370> more<00:04:28.580> power<00:04:30.729> even<00:04:31.729> if

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
forward I see a lot more power even if

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:38.110 
forward I see a lot more power even if
you<00:04:31.940> block<00:04:33.130> try<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.190> again<00:04:36.430> your<00:04:37.430> opponent<00:04:37.850> is

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
you block try it again your opponent is

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.610 
you block try it again your opponent is
going<00:04:38.479> to<00:04:38.750> take<00:04:38.930> that<00:04:39.139> here

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.770 

don't<00:04:43.430> confine<00:04:43.790> yourself<00:04:44.180> just<00:04:44.540> going

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
don't confine yourself just going

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.040 
don't confine yourself just going
forward<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:45.830> backward<00:04:46.250> instead<00:04:46.940> look<00:04:47.870> for

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
forward and backward instead look for

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.030 
forward and backward instead look for
the<00:04:48.110> openings<00:04:49.750> that<00:04:50.750> you<00:04:51.020> will<00:04:51.169> get<00:04:51.350> when<00:04:51.919> you

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
the openings that you will get when you

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.330 
the openings that you will get when you
move<00:04:52.190> to<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.340> different<00:04:52.370> position<00:04:52.700> and<00:04:54.340> reverse

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
move to a different position and reverse

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.620 
move to a different position and reverse
a<00:04:55.490> block<00:04:55.730> because<00:04:55.940> he<00:04:56.060> has<00:04:56.150> a<00:04:56.210> corner<00:04:56.480> of<00:04:56.570> a

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
a block because he has a corner of a

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.500 
a block because he has a corner of a
shield<00:04:56.810> right<00:04:56.930> there<00:04:57.250> but<00:04:58.250> if<00:04:59.060> I<00:04:59.210> step<00:04:59.419> out<00:05:01.510> or

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
shield right there but if I step out or

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:09.280 
shield right there but if I step out or
I<00:05:04.600> maybe<00:05:05.600> even<00:05:05.960> low<00:05:07.360> if<00:05:08.360> you<00:05:08.480> can<00:05:08.630> get<00:05:08.840> over<00:05:09.020> on

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
I maybe even low if you can get over on

stronger defenses shield is there

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.520
