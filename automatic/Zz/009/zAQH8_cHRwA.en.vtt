00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:56.620 

fear<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.290> he<00:04:45.530> might<00:04:45.740> have<00:04:46.040> left<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.430> red

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
but I think they were applauding the

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.409 
but I think they were applauding the
fact<00:06:13.979> they<00:06:14.129> were<00:06:14.159> pleased<00:06:14.580> that<00:06:14.909> tinta

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.170 

think<00:07:30.590> you<00:07:30.710> may<00:07:30.889> well<00:07:31.100> drop<00:07:31.370> the<00:07:31.580> pink<00:07:31.819> in<00:07:32.030> and

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:32.180 
think you may well drop the pink in and

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.820 
think you may well drop the pink in and
then<00:07:32.300> try<00:07:32.569> and<00:07:32.750> play<00:07:32.990> a<00:07:33.020> good<00:07:33.229> safety<00:07:33.289> shot

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:49.830 
then try and play a good safety shot
from<00:07:34.039> the<00:07:34.190> yellow

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.900 

of<00:07:50.260> course<00:07:50.500> if<00:07:50.680> he<00:07:50.800> takes<00:07:50.980> that<00:07:51.250> pink<00:07:51.520> on<00:07:51.730> and

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:51.910 
of course if he takes that pink on and

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.850 
of course if he takes that pink on and
mrs.<00:07:52.240> it<00:07:52.389> then<00:07:52.660> he<00:07:53.139> could<00:07:53.380> have<00:07:53.500> left<00:07:53.680> the

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:53.860
