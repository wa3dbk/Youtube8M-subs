what<00:00:48.719> better<00:00:48.750> way<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.050> try<00:00:49.320> then<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.890> actually

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
what better way to try then to actually

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.619 
what better way to try then to actually
do<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.610> got<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> split-screen<00:00:51.149> here<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.510> got

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
do it so I got a split-screen here I got

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.930 
do it so I got a split-screen here I got
an<00:00:51.719> extra<00:00:51.840> controller<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.610> radar<00:00:53.610> started

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
an extra controller and radar started

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.049 
an extra controller and radar started
going<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> custom<00:00:54.600> game<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:56.000> we're<00:00:57.000> just

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
going in a custom game and we're just

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.729 
going in a custom game and we're just
gonna<00:00:57.180> work<00:00:57.390> away<00:00:57.600> 225<00:00:58.140> kills<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.530> see<00:00:58.620> what

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
gonna work away 225 kills and see what

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.990 
gonna work away 225 kills and see what
happens<00:00:59.039> and<00:01:00.109> my<00:01:01.109> opinion<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.579> really

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
happens and my opinion this is really

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.719 
happens and my opinion this is really
dumb<00:01:03.530> you'll<00:01:04.530> notice<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.489> little<00:01:05.640> bit

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
dumb you'll notice here in a little bit

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.140 
dumb you'll notice here in a little bit
what<00:01:05.939> happens<00:01:06.270> when<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.560> actually<00:01:08.189> do<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.640> 25

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
what happens when I actually do get 25

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.350 
what happens when I actually do get 25
kills<00:01:10.220> again<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.729> only<00:01:11.790> do<00:01:12.030> using

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
kills again you can only do using

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.330 
kills again you can only do using
weapons<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:12.930> I'm<00:01:13.049> using<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.439> new<00:01:13.590> tube<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.130> used

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
weapons here I'm using a new tube I used

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.859 
weapons here I'm using a new tube I used
a<00:01:14.430> grenade<00:01:14.729> earlier<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.330> all<00:01:15.509> counts

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
a grenade earlier and that all counts

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.630 
a grenade earlier and that all counts
I'm<00:01:16.229> pretty<00:01:16.650> sure<00:01:16.770> our<00:01:16.830> knife<00:01:17.009> works<00:01:17.280> too<00:01:17.490> it's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
I'm pretty sure our knife works too it's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.890 
I'm pretty sure our knife works too it's
just<00:01:17.700> all<00:01:17.939> weapons<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.560> no<00:01:19.560> kill<00:01:19.770> streak<00:01:20.009> so

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
just all weapons it's no kill streak so

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.660 
just all weapons it's no kill streak so
as<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.259> said<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.590> think<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.220> kind<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.460> dumb

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
as I said I think this is kind of dumb

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.380 
as I said I think this is kind of dumb
because<00:01:23.880> 25<00:01:24.479> kills<00:01:25.040> with<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.400> guns<00:01:26.700> only<00:01:26.939> in

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
because 25 kills with just guns only in

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.130 
because 25 kills with just guns only in
this<00:01:27.720> game<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:29.540> is<00:01:30.540> gonna<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.900> pretty

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
this game is is gonna be pretty

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.130 
this game is is gonna be pretty
difficult<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:31.590> anyone<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.040> obtain<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.960> more

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
difficult for anyone to obtain the more

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.920 
difficult for anyone to obtain the more
I<00:01:34.170> played<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:35.240> feel<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.600> spawns

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
I played this I feel like the spawns

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.810 
I played this I feel like the spawns
Conor<00:01:37.290> are<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> little<00:01:37.920> funk<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.430> fied<00:01:39.590> people

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
Conor are a little funk to fied people

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.730 
Conor are a little funk to fied people
spawn<00:01:41.820> behind<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.750> know<00:01:42.869> people<00:01:43.439> spawn

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
spawn behind you you know people spawn

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.340 
spawn behind you you know people spawn
right<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.130> front<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.549> or<00:01:44.899> it's<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:46.170> kind

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
right in front of you or it's just kind

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.550 
right in front of you or it's just kind
of<00:01:46.439> weird<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:47.090> I<00:01:48.090> think<00:01:48.810> for<00:01:49.110> somebody<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.470> get

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
of weird but I think for somebody to get

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.270 
of weird but I think for somebody to get
25<00:01:49.950> kills<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.670> guns<00:01:51.000> no<00:01:51.930> deaths<00:01:52.170> not<00:01:52.950> using

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
25 kills with guns no deaths not using

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.569 
25 kills with guns no deaths not using
kill<00:01:53.460> streaks<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:55.100> freaking<00:01:56.100> hard<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:57.259> for

have died if I didn't shoot him anyways
he<00:02:55.300> probably<00:02:55.480> would<00:02:55.660> have<00:02:55.720> died<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.490> probably

he probably would have died I probably

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.490 
he probably would have died I probably
should<00:02:57.760> not<00:02:57.970> have<00:02:58.120> shot<00:02:58.300> him<00:02:58.450> but<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.320> was

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
should not have shot him but I was

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.900 
should not have shot him but I was
surprised<00:02:59.830> to<00:02:59.980> see<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.220> he<00:03:00.430> comes<00:03:00.640> back

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
surprised to see that he comes back

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.460 
surprised to see that he comes back
alive<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.510> he<00:03:01.570> you<00:03:01.900> know<00:03:01.960> I<00:03:02.020> grabbed<00:03:02.350> the

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
alive and he you know I grabbed the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.570 
alive and he you know I grabbed the
other<00:03:02.560> controller<00:03:02.950> there<00:03:03.220> he<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.400> running

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
other controller there he is running

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.490 
other controller there he is running
around<00:03:03.930> nothing<00:03:04.930> no<00:03:05.470> like<00:03:06.750> no<00:03:07.750> damage<00:03:08.200> really

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
around nothing no like no damage really

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.930 
around nothing no like no damage really
is<00:03:08.770> done<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.190> him<00:03:09.340> except<00:03:09.640> it's<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.820> little

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
is done to him except it's a little

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.240 
is done to him except it's a little
slower<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.480> guess<00:03:10.780> he<00:03:11.440> has<00:03:11.650> no<00:03:11.980> radar<00:03:14.250> shooting

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
slower I guess he has no radar shooting

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.070 
slower I guess he has no radar shooting
me<00:03:15.340> in<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.460> face<00:03:15.640> so<00:03:16.630> he<00:03:17.380> has<00:03:17.620> no<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.959> guess<00:03:19.959> you

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
me in the face so he has no I guess you

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.380 
me in the face so he has no I guess you
can't<00:03:20.290> see<00:03:20.560> any<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.040> his<00:03:21.280> stats<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:21.880> anything

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
can't see any of his stats and anything

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.690 
can't see any of his stats and anything
like<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.540> he<00:03:22.840> can't<00:03:23.050> see<00:03:23.170> his<00:03:23.230> mini-map<00:03:23.700> but

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
like that he can't see his mini-map but

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.470 
like that he can't see his mini-map but
it's<00:03:24.940> relatively<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.780> same<00:03:25.990> old<00:03:26.620> thing<00:03:26.890> you

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
it's relatively the same old thing you

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.550 
it's relatively the same old thing you
know<00:03:28.480> it's<00:03:29.700> just<00:03:30.700> a<00:03:30.880> red<00:03:31.060> screen<00:03:31.330> and<00:03:31.690> they

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
know it's just a red screen and they

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.550 
know it's just a red screen and they
have<00:03:32.709> an<00:03:32.830> EMP<00:03:33.160> so<00:03:34.030> for<00:03:34.540> 25<00:03:34.900> kills<00:03:35.170> I<00:03:35.350> just

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
have an EMP so for 25 kills I just

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.750 
have an EMP so for 25 kills I just
thought<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:35.709> was<00:03:35.890> kind<00:03:35.950> of<00:03:36.130> cheap<00:03:36.310> I<00:03:36.490> thought

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
thought that was kind of cheap I thought

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.940 
thought that was kind of cheap I thought
that<00:03:37.260> they<00:03:38.260> should<00:03:38.290> have<00:03:38.560> had<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.680> little<00:03:38.800> bit

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
that they should have had a little bit

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.640 
that they should have had a little bit
more<00:03:40.709> benefit<00:03:41.760> for<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:42.970> you<00:03:43.270> know<00:03:43.420> I<00:03:43.989> don't

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
more benefit for that you know I don't

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.300 
more benefit for that you know I don't
know<00:03:44.830> I<00:03:45.510> guess<00:03:46.510> that<00:03:46.920> infinity<00:03:47.920> war<00:03:48.130> was

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
know I guess that infinity war was

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.370 
know I guess that infinity war was
trying<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.730> prevent<00:03:49.120> any<00:03:49.630> of<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:51.750> drama<00:03:52.750> that

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
trying to prevent any of the drama that

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.860 
trying to prevent any of the drama that
nuke<00:03:54.040> boosting<00:03:54.550> look<00:03:54.880> I<00:03:55.000> mean<00:03:55.120> now<00:03:55.390> there<00:03:55.750> it

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
nuke boosting look I mean now there it

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.479 
nuke boosting look I mean now there it
is<00:03:55.989> it's<00:03:56.230> back<00:03:56.410> to<00:03:56.620> normal<00:03:58.500> that's<00:03:59.500> you<00:04:00.400> know

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
is it's back to normal that's you know
