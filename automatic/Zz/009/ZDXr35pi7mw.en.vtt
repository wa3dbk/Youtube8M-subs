because you said that that

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.470 
because you said that that
that<00:02:28.709> you<00:02:29.709> still<00:02:30.190> tend<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.819> keep<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.209> a<00:02:31.300> ball

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480

very close to the heel one of the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.400 
very close to the heel one of the
biggest<00:02:36.550> issues<00:02:36.940> that<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.540> happens<00:02:37.930> is<00:02:38.080> the

to the shaft of the club it took a
vertical<00:04:26.650> club<00:04:26.860> see<00:04:27.250> I<00:04:27.310> got<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.490> triangle<00:04:27.910> there

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
vertical club see I got a triangle there

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000 
vertical club see I got a triangle there
if<00:04:28.060> we<00:04:28.180> draw<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.389> line<00:04:28.630> from<00:04:28.660> my<00:04:29.020> from<00:04:29.590> my<00:04:29.620> elbows

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010

up to my hands I have a type of

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.140 
up to my hands I have a type of
basically<00:04:32.200> an<00:04:32.289> equilateral<00:04:32.590> triangle<00:04:33.010> in<00:04:33.490> my

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
basically an equilateral triangle in my

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.640 
basically an equilateral triangle in my
elbows<00:04:34.450> are<00:04:34.479> relatively<00:04:34.960> horizontal<00:04:35.530> to<00:04:35.620> the

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
elbows are relatively horizontal to the

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.060 
elbows are relatively horizontal to the
ground<00:04:36.450> now<00:04:37.450> when<00:04:37.930> I<00:04:37.960> take<00:04:38.200> this<00:04:38.349> back<00:04:38.590> arm<00:04:38.860> and

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
ground now when I take this back arm and

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.850 
ground now when I take this back arm and
I<00:04:39.370> can<00:04:39.550> i<00:04:39.640> make<00:04:39.820> my<00:04:39.940> triangle<00:04:40.390> like<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:40.659> nice

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
I can i make my triangle like a nice

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.830 
I can i make my triangle like a nice
narrow<00:04:42.340> divided<00:04:42.849> the<00:04:42.939> base<00:04:43.120> of<00:04:43.270> my<00:04:43.389> triangle

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
narrow divided the base of my triangle

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.080 
narrow divided the base of my triangle
by<00:04:44.650> putting<00:04:45.009> this<00:04:45.310> perpendicular<00:04:45.729> to<00:04:46.030> the

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
by putting this perpendicular to the

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.969 
by putting this perpendicular to the
ground<00:04:46.150> where<00:04:46.539> did<00:04:46.629> the<00:04:46.689> club<00:04:46.870> just<00:04:47.020> go<00:04:47.199> it<00:04:47.800> got

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
ground where did the club just go it got

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.129 
ground where did the club just go it got
laid<00:04:48.159> off<00:04:48.189> the<00:04:48.939> club<00:04:49.150> is<00:04:49.180> now<00:04:49.419> laid<00:04:49.689> off<00:04:49.900> in

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
laid off the club is now laid off in

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.990 
laid off the club is now laid off in
heavy<00:04:50.500> and<00:04:50.800> it<00:04:51.250> now<00:04:51.400> means<00:04:51.580> that<00:04:51.789> in<00:04:51.909> many

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
heavy and it now means that in many

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.730 
heavy and it now means that in many
cases<00:04:52.120> when<00:04:52.419> you<00:04:52.479> do<00:04:52.629> that<00:04:52.840> it's<00:04:53.289> also<00:04:53.530> going

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
cases when you do that it's also going

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.170 
cases when you do that it's also going
to<00:04:53.800> pull<00:04:54.009> your<00:04:54.099> arms<00:04:54.370> down<00:04:54.490> lower<00:04:54.789> your<00:04:55.030> hands

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
to pull your arms down lower your hands

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.270 
to pull your arms down lower your hands
lower<00:04:55.449> and<00:04:55.659> the<00:04:56.199> club<00:04:56.439> gets<00:04:56.620> laid<00:04:56.800> off<00:04:56.949> and<00:04:57.129> so

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
lower and the club gets laid off and so

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.679 
lower and the club gets laid off and so
now<00:04:57.460> if<00:04:57.729> you're<00:04:57.969> trying<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.270> hit<00:04:58.389> a<00:04:58.419> golf<00:04:58.569> ball

00:04:58.679 --> 00:04:58.689 
now if you're trying to hit a golf ball

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:00.869 
now if you're trying to hit a golf ball
from<00:04:59.050> that<00:04:59.080> position<00:04:59.379> and<00:04:59.830> you've<00:05:00.550> come<00:05:00.699> up

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:00.879 
from that position and you've come up

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.339 
from that position and you've come up
