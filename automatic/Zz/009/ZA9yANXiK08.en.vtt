00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:11.210
 have never given the truth I will 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.309

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.719

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.400
 you throw the oil is skin again 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.369
 fish we can use the fillet of 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.369
 fish is mango difference if the apron 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:34.649
 the apron lacked my apron but I did not 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.219
 I put social because we are not going to put 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.219
 so much salt 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.309
 I love cooking and I have a daughter 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.920
 four years with which I cook also 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.210
 very much and I teach him because I think that 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.370
 besides the kitchen is something so familiar is 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.399
 a way to get closer 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.770
 then we cook a lot of my daughter and I 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.750
 together and I love the other day we did 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.579
 some delicious potatoes and she helped me 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.579
 today we put cream and clear 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:11.369
 is the satisfaction of knowing veins the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.700
 saucer and suddenly your partner does not 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.460
 I know the families of the area says the help 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.390
 encourages more reading what you have done 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.119
 pepper saucers is also the taste 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.740
 I really like it when you hear louis 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.430
 cruise switch between the tool 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.430
 fantastic 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.840
 now that I have tarragon and that is very 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:37.520
 economic and fresh and smells delicious 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.039
 and that's how they've been going to put 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.869
 tension and all tarragon I'm going to try 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:47.780
 clear of course it is totally 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.880
 as have other properties that 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.530
 the lands are herbs is something that 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.850
 really gives the plus to all 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.850
 citizens feed some 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.120
 exactly 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.580
 so much butter 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.990
 and good that no food hears and because 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.990
 you saw the talk 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.520
 and a little bit of orange juice there 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.770
 that requires a fish takes tantito 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.390
 citrus and always that and I like the 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.820
 combination now we put orange 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.400
 because the asparagus and the orange always 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.810
 have to combine perfect fantasy or 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.190
 so then and what do you think we are 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.160
 turn on our oven we have it 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.680
 ready ok do not close it's called daddy 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.390
 georg is a name then we start 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.090
 as well as to bend it as you will see 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.130
 wanting it is very important to seal it 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.800
 we are not finding it perfectly 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.210
 we're folding it does not matter what 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.210
 has bending does not happen absolutely 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.800
 that pre country that I love that screams at me 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.370
 let's make these two little ones 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.750
 Folds that is like a little empanadita 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.700
 exactly or if you do not want to be and 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.489
 then this thing is much easier the 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.680
 aluminum foil nothing easier and for 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.090
 equal to fusion and equal what annoyance 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.430
 maybe the waxed paper because 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.620
 really before it was done in papillote 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.709
 this is a papillon we need the 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.910
 tray and the time in 15 minutes we are 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.130
 ready with our delicious recipe 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.630
 tiana and I these ingredients we are 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.090
 four squares of waxed paper or 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.580
 aluminum four fish fillets his 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.440

 squares in 4 2 cut asparagus and 4 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.660
 spoons of nothing 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:43.459
 very well and combine and risk because 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.280
 the whole kitchen is made of today's 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.140
 clear errors of trials the other 100 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.180
 women and wants to tell them that it is 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.890
 ready in our fish in papillÃ³n 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.510
 they are ready 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.510
 I'm going to take them to the table like this 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:04.360
 and each guest serves a piece of paper 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.360
 and then the only thing he's going to do is 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.270
 to open it 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:14.530
 in this way 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:16.329

 in papillon 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.430
 so you can see it well 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.400
 here is nothing else that says the states 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.500
 They are perfectly cooked 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.570

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.230
 I opened it gave off a smell of tarragon 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.650
