00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.940 
was just rubbing his hand back and forth
on<00:01:57.249> the<00:01:57.399> saddle<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:58.079> since<00:01:59.079> everything<00:01:59.619> has<00:01:59.920> a

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.800 
radius these two strings the D and the G
strings<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.249> end<00:02:03.609> up<00:02:03.880> sitting<00:02:04.270> up<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.569> little

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
strings and end up sitting up a little

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.139 
strings and end up sitting up a little
bit<00:02:04.899> higher<00:02:05.079> so<00:02:05.429> he<00:02:06.429> was<00:02:06.579> just<00:02:06.909> basically

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
bit higher so he was just basically

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.700 
bit higher so he was just basically
sawing<00:02:07.899> away<00:02:08.200> on<00:02:08.530> those<00:02:09.100> two<00:02:09.340> strings<00:02:09.729> so<00:02:10.710> if

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
sawing away on those two strings so if

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.260 
sawing away on those two strings so if
you<00:02:11.830> have<00:02:12.010> if<00:02:12.220> you're<00:02:12.370> anybody<00:02:12.820> out<00:02:13.000> there<00:02:13.030> is

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
experiencing that kind of problem maybe

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.690 
experiencing that kind of problem maybe
just<00:02:15.010> change<00:02:15.280> your

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
just change your

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.369 
just change your
hand<00:02:15.910> position<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.360> little<00:02:16.450> bit<00:02:16.720> get<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.230> away

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
hand position a little bit get it away

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.860 
hand position a little bit get it away
from<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.800> saddle<00:02:18.250> either<00:02:19.120> move<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.480> towards

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
from that saddle either move it towards

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.270 
from that saddle either move it towards
the<00:02:20.050> sound<00:02:20.319> hole<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.530> little<00:02:20.620> bit<00:02:20.860> maybe<00:02:21.010> back<00:02:21.250> a

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
the sound hole a little bit maybe back a

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.740 
the sound hole a little bit maybe back a
little<00:02:21.519> bit<00:02:21.760> change<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.360> way<00:02:22.450> your<00:02:22.569> palm

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
little bit change the way your palm

scale<00:02:53.470> guitar<00:02:53.829> because<00:02:54.280> it's<00:02:54.459> a<00:02:54.519> shorter

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910

scale guitar because it's a shorter
scale<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.329> going<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.569> have<00:02:55.720> less<00:02:55.959> tension<00:02:56.260> so

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
scale is going to have less tension so

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.400 
scale is going to have less tension so
you<00:02:57.730> may<00:02:58.269> be<00:02:58.329> able<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.780> get<00:02:58.959> away<00:02:59.170> with<00:02:59.380> a

gauge string on a smaller body guitar as

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.240 
gauge string on a smaller body guitar as
counterintuitive<00:03:05.140> as<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.739> might<00:03:05.950> sound

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
counterintuitive as that might sound

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.569 
counterintuitive as that might sound
because<00:03:07.239> of<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.480> shorter<00:03:07.840> scale<00:03:08.340> tonally<00:03:09.340> it

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
because of the shorter scale tonally it

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.410 
because of the shorter scale tonally it
may<00:03:10.120> make<00:03:10.360> more<00:03:10.599> sense<00:03:11.280> if<00:03:12.280> anybody<00:03:13.239> out<00:03:13.390> there

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
may make more sense if anybody out there

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.680 
may make more sense if anybody out there
has<00:03:13.660> an<00:03:13.780> lxm<00:03:14.349> size<00:03:14.799> 5<00:03:15.099> guitar<00:03:15.549> you're<00:03:16.480> going

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
has an lxm size 5 guitar you're going

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.960 
has an lxm size 5 guitar you're going
back<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:17.200> long<00:03:17.440> long<00:03:17.500> time<00:03:18.040> looking<00:03:18.790> at<00:03:18.880> the

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
seven size guitars

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.370 
seven size guitars
they're<00:03:20.950> very<00:03:21.310> small<00:03:21.670> scale<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:22.810> there's<00:03:23.319> a

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
they're very small scale so there's a

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.559 
they're very small scale so there's a
really<00:03:24.250> not<00:03:24.519> a<00:03:24.549> lot<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:24.940> tension<00:03:25.359> on<00:03:25.450> those

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
really not a lot of tension on those

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.140 
really not a lot of tension on those
strings<00:03:25.959> so<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.709> might<00:03:27.160> be<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.519> surprise<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:27.970> you

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
strings so it might be a surprise to you

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.750 
strings so it might be a surprise to you
to<00:03:28.569> find<00:03:28.840> out<00:03:29.019> that<00:03:29.230> for<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.620> LX<00:03:29.920> guitars<00:03:30.549> we

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
to find out that for the LX guitars we

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.160 
to find out that for the LX guitars we
actually<00:03:31.030> string<00:03:31.269> them<00:03:31.420> with<00:03:31.569> medium<00:03:31.959> gauge

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
actually string them with medium gauge

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.530 
actually string them with medium gauge
strings<00:03:32.560> not<00:03:32.920> lights<00:03:33.250> because<00:03:34.090> again<00:03:34.389> when

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
strings not lights because again when

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.840 
strings not lights because again when
you<00:03:34.660> have<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:35.079> shorter<00:03:35.739> scale<00:03:36.069> you<00:03:36.700> have<00:03:36.790> a

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
you have that shorter scale you have a

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.150 
you have that shorter scale you have a
lot<00:03:37.060> less<00:03:37.269> tension<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:37.959> make<00:03:38.260> up<00:03:38.440> for<00:03:38.980> that

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
lot less tension so to make up for that

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.920 
lot less tension so to make up for that
so<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.459> strings<00:03:39.760> aren't<00:03:40.000> just<00:03:40.209> elastic<00:03:40.750> and

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
so the strings aren't just elastic and

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.750 
so the strings aren't just elastic and
flopping<00:03:41.380> around<00:03:41.470> on<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.799> guitar<00:03:42.190> we<00:03:42.579> put

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
flopping around on the guitar we put

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.199 
flopping around on the guitar we put

this guitar up that minor third you

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.129 
this guitar up that minor third you
might<00:04:16.090> start<00:04:16.269> finding<00:04:16.599> a<00:04:16.690> lot<00:04:16.810> of<00:04:16.900> strings

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
might start finding a lot of strings

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.050 
might start finding a lot of strings
breaking<00:04:17.680> while<00:04:18.280> you're<00:04:18.459> tuning<00:04:18.789> them<00:04:18.910> up

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.159 
breaking while you're tuning them up
over<00:04:19.359> that<00:04:19.900> long<00:04:20.260> span<00:04:20.889> so<00:04:21.960> those<00:04:22.960> are<00:04:23.110> a

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
over that long span so those are a

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.510 
over that long span so those are a

other one and I talked about it in

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.640 
other one and I talked about it in

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
another video is your pick choice

another video is your pick choice

welcome to do but you're doing it with a

welcome to do but you're doing it with a
you<00:04:36.130> know<00:04:36.250> if<00:04:36.610> you<00:04:36.790> found<00:04:37.120> a<00:04:37.240> quarter<00:04:37.540> back<00:04:38.259> in

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
you know if you found a quarter back in

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.950 
you know if you found a quarter back in
1968<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.610> it's<00:04:39.699> your<00:04:39.820> lucky<00:04:40.120> quarter<00:04:40.389> and<00:04:40.750> you

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
1968 and it's your lucky quarter and you

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.629 
1968 and it's your lucky quarter and you
shaved<00:04:41.289> it<00:04:41.440> down<00:04:41.620> into<00:04:41.889> the<00:04:41.979> shape<00:04:42.190> of<00:04:42.310> a<00:04:42.430> pic

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
shaved it down into the shape of a pic

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.279 
shaved it down into the shape of a pic
and<00:04:42.820> now<00:04:42.940> you<00:04:43.000> play<00:04:43.270> all<00:04:43.419> of<00:04:43.449> your<00:04:43.690> shows<00:04:43.870> on<00:04:44.139> it

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
and now you play all of your shows on it

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.129 
and now you play all of your shows on it
but<00:04:44.860> every<00:04:45.430> show<00:04:45.639> you<00:04:45.699> end<00:04:46.030> up<00:04:46.210> breaking<00:04:46.630> five

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
but every show you end up breaking five

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.650 
but every show you end up breaking five
of<00:04:47.350> your<00:04:47.470> six<00:04:47.740> strings<00:04:48.180> pretty<00:04:49.180> sure<00:04:49.360> it's<00:04:49.539> the

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
of your six strings pretty sure it's the

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.400 
of your six strings pretty sure it's the
pic<00:04:49.840> chase

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
pic chase

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.379 
pic chase
so<00:04:50.860> again<00:04:51.250> just<00:04:51.280> be<00:04:51.639> smart<00:04:51.970> about<00:04:52.060> things

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
so again just be smart about things

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:53.879 
so again just be smart about things
there's<00:04:52.720> a<00:04:52.780> lot<00:04:52.930> of<00:04:53.050> things<00:04:53.229> that<00:04:53.380> you<00:04:53.500> can<00:04:53.710> do

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
there's a lot of things that you can do

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.430 
there's a lot of things that you can do
to<00:04:54.729> prevent<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.449> strings<00:04:55.750> breaking<00:04:56.229> give

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
to prevent the strings breaking give

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.189 
to prevent the strings breaking give
them<00:04:56.620> nice<00:04:56.949> long<00:04:57.220> life<00:04:57.520> and<00:04:57.759> in<00:04:58.240> turn<00:04:58.479> protect

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
them nice long life and in turn protect

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.260 
them nice long life and in turn protect
the<00:04:59.320> guitar<00:04:59.590> as<00:04:59.740> a<00:04:59.770> whole<00:05:00.009> as<00:05:00.190> well<00:05:00.340> so<00:05:01.060> now<00:05:01.180> if

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
Martin we've been making a lot of

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.560 
Martin we've been making a lot of
guitars<00:05:24.160> for<00:05:24.400> a<00:05:24.460> really<00:05:24.729> long<00:05:24.910> time<00:05:24.970> since

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
guitars for a really long time since

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.469 
guitars for a really long time since
1833<00:05:26.410> in<00:05:26.680> fact<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:27.130> over<00:05:27.970> the<00:05:28.090> last<00:05:28.240> hundred

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
1833 in fact and over the last hundred

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.810 
1833 in fact and over the last hundred
and<00:05:28.690> eighty<00:05:28.840> years<00:05:29.110> or<00:05:29.289> so<00:05:29.470> the<00:05:30.310> guitars<00:05:30.639> have

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
and eighty years or so the guitars have

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.969 
and eighty years or so the guitars have
changed<00:05:31.180> a<00:05:31.270> lot<00:05:31.419> the<00:05:32.289> body<00:05:32.470> size<00:05:32.770> has<00:05:32.949> changed

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
changed a lot the body size has changed

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.279 
changed a lot the body size has changed
the<00:05:33.490> scale<00:05:33.699> length<00:05:33.940> has<00:05:34.150> changed<00:05:34.660> and<00:05:34.840> the

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
the scale length has changed and the

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.110 
the scale length has changed and the
strings<00:05:35.650> along<00:05:36.130> with<00:05:36.310> it<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.550> material<00:05:37.000> has

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
strings along with it the material has

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.790 
strings along with it the material has
changed<00:05:37.599> the<00:05:37.750> tension<00:05:38.139> of<00:05:38.260> the<00:05:38.289> strings<00:05:38.620> has

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
changed the tension of the strings has

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.560 
changed the tension of the strings has
changed<00:05:39.250> so<00:05:39.760> there's<00:05:40.060> a<00:05:40.120> bunch<00:05:40.300> of<00:05:40.419> different

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
changed so there's a bunch of different

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.210 
changed so there's a bunch of different
strings<00:05:41.110> that<00:05:41.199> we<00:05:41.349> still<00:05:41.560> have<00:05:41.710> in<00:05:41.860> our<00:05:41.949> line

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
strings that we still have in our line

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.120 
strings that we still have in our line
that<00:05:42.870> correlate<00:05:43.870> with<00:05:44.020> each<00:05:44.080> guitar<00:05:44.380> but<00:05:45.010> that

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
that correlate with each guitar but that

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.950 
that correlate with each guitar but that
doesn't<00:05:45.460> necessarily<00:05:45.580> mean<00:05:46.240> that<00:05:46.599> each

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
doesn't necessarily mean that each

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.920 
doesn't necessarily mean that each
guitar<00:05:47.199> needs<00:05:47.650> to<00:05:47.949> have<00:05:48.130> a<00:05:48.159> specific<00:05:49.030> gauge

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
guitar needs to have a specific gauge

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.170 
guitar needs to have a specific gauge
string<00:05:50.470> on<00:05:50.620> it<00:05:50.770> you<00:05:51.400> can<00:05:51.550> really<00:05:51.699> put<00:05:51.940> any

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
string on it you can really put any

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.330 
string on it you can really put any
gauge<00:05:52.449> string<00:05:52.810> on<00:05:52.960> any<00:05:53.139> single<00:05:53.470> guitar<00:05:53.710> it's

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
gauge string on any single guitar it's

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.620 
gauge string on any single guitar it's
going<00:05:54.490> to<00:05:54.550> react<00:05:54.820> a<00:05:54.940> little<00:05:55.060> bit<00:05:55.300> differently

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
going to react a little bit differently

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.480 
going to react a little bit differently
again<00:05:56.020> with<00:05:56.620> the<00:05:56.710> different<00:05:57.010> scale<00:05:57.250> lengths

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
again with the different scale lengths

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.680 
again with the different scale lengths
you're<00:05:57.580> going<00:05:57.729> to<00:05:57.789> have<00:05:57.940> a<00:05:57.970> different<00:05:58.389> kind<00:05:58.510> of

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
you're going to have a different kind of

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.600 
you're going to have a different kind of
elastic<00:05:59.139> feel<00:05:59.590> with<00:05:59.770> it<00:05:59.889> if<00:05:59.949> you<00:06:00.039> if<00:06:00.280> you<00:06:00.430> have

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
elastic feel with it if you if you have

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.070 
elastic feel with it if you if you have
say<00:06:01.449> a<00:06:01.500> 24-9<00:06:02.729> guitar<00:06:03.729> with<00:06:04.090> extra<00:06:04.690> light<00:06:04.870> gauge

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
say a 24-9 guitar with extra light gauge

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.300 
say a 24-9 guitar with extra light gauge
strings<00:06:05.380> on<00:06:05.560> it<00:06:05.710> you're<00:06:05.949> going<00:06:06.039> to<00:06:06.130> have<00:06:06.280> a

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
strings on it you're going to have a

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.370 
strings on it you're going to have a
little<00:06:06.610> bit<00:06:06.760> lighter<00:06:07.030> feel<00:06:07.360> maybe<00:06:07.990> that's<00:06:08.260> the

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
little bit lighter feel maybe that's the

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.360 
little bit lighter feel maybe that's the
feel<00:06:08.560> that<00:06:08.740> you're<00:06:08.830> after<00:06:08.979> and<00:06:09.310> that's

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
quick setup to make sure the guitar is

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.420 
quick setup to make sure the guitar is
doing<00:06:23.169> everything<00:06:23.409> that<00:06:23.590> you<00:06:23.800> expect<00:06:24.099> it<00:06:24.280> to

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
doing everything that you expect it to

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.790 
doing everything that you expect it to
and<00:06:24.610> that<00:06:25.090> we<00:06:25.240> expect<00:06:25.360> it<00:06:25.690> to<00:06:25.720> as<00:06:25.930> well<00:06:26.110> I<00:06:26.289> just

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
and that we expect it to as well I just

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.469 
and that we expect it to as well I just
have<00:06:26.949> one<00:06:26.979> less<00:06:27.520> thing<00:06:27.550> that<00:06:28.000> I<00:06:28.030> want<00:06:28.270> to<00:06:28.330> add

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
have one less thing that I want to add

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.649 
have one less thing that I want to add
to<00:06:29.139> prevent<00:06:29.470> string<00:06:29.770> breaking<00:06:30.220> and<00:06:30.419> it<00:06:31.419> may

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:31.659 
to prevent string breaking and it may

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:33.330 
to prevent string breaking and it may
again<00:06:32.199> be<00:06:32.229> another<00:06:32.590> thing<00:06:32.830> you<00:06:32.979> don't<00:06:33.070> think

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
again be another thing you don't think

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.339 
again be another thing you don't think
about<00:06:33.430> but<00:06:33.699> it's<00:06:33.789> a<00:06:33.849> very<00:06:34.060> simple<00:06:34.330> thing<00:06:34.599> the

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:35.349 
about but it's a very simple thing the

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:36.930 
about but it's a very simple thing the
way<00:06:35.530> that<00:06:35.740> you<00:06:35.800> actually<00:06:36.159> install<00:06:36.580> the

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
way that you actually install the

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.209 
way that you actually install the
strings<00:06:37.270> on<00:06:37.570> the<00:06:37.750> guitar<00:06:37.779> now<00:06:38.650> I'm<00:06:38.830> not<00:06:39.010> just

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:39.219 
strings on the guitar now I'm not just

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:41.129 
strings on the guitar now I'm not just
talking<00:06:39.610> about<00:06:39.700> making<00:06:40.510> sure<00:06:40.539> that<00:06:40.719> you<00:06:40.960> have

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139 
talking about making sure that you have

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:42.390 
talking about making sure that you have
the<00:06:41.289> right<00:06:41.469> string<00:06:41.740> in<00:06:41.860> the<00:06:41.919> right<00:06:42.099> spot

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
the right string in the right spot

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.140 
the right string in the right spot
because<00:06:42.580> obvious

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
because obvious

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.480 
because obvious
if<00:06:43.330> you<00:06:43.450> have<00:06:43.630> the<00:06:43.840> low<00:06:44.170> e-string<00:06:44.380> and<00:06:44.860> where

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
if you have the low e-string and where

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.800 
if you have the low e-string and where
the<00:06:45.610> g-string<00:06:46.000> goes<00:06:46.210> and<00:06:46.360> you<00:06:46.420> try<00:06:46.600> and<00:06:46.630> tune

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810 
the g-string goes and you try and tune

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.560 
the g-string goes and you try and tune
it<00:06:46.930> up<00:06:47.020> it's<00:06:47.320> going<00:06:47.470> to<00:06:47.530> pop<00:06:47.800> I<00:06:48.070> mean<00:06:48.310> make<00:06:49.300> sure

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
it up it's going to pop I mean make sure

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.540 
it up it's going to pop I mean make sure
that<00:06:49.900> everything<00:06:50.440> is<00:06:50.560> pulled<00:06:50.860> up<00:06:51.070> nice<00:06:51.520> and

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
that everything is pulled up nice and

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.280 
that everything is pulled up nice and
tight<00:06:51.940> the<00:06:52.120> ball<00:06:52.300> ends<00:06:52.540> are<00:06:52.690> tucked<00:06:52.840> nice<00:06:53.110> and

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
tight the ball ends are tucked nice and
