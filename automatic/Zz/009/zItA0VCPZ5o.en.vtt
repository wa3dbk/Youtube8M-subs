00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 very good, hello, hello, how are you greeted? 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.640
 educational and today we are going to talk 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.050
 about two things that happen in the world of 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.300
 the video games and this time covers xbox 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.710
 good xbox appears there are two things one is 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.560
 one rumor and the other 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.800
 it's like or you already know that parallel 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.900
 but good one is the following microsoft 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.359
 that for us it seems that mike is going 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.460
 to launch a version of xbox one more 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.509
 cheap this year 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.509
 it seems that this 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.070
 It looks like this is going to be true and it's going 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.920
 to confirm more than anything this week that 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.649
 it seems that an employee of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.420
 microsoft commented to some partners 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.090
 who are thinking of taking out a new 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.370
 model of the xbox one before finishing 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.860
 this year and this is what was confirmed 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.650
 in a very important web page no eye 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.250
 I repeat this was like 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.540
 this said a method plan to several 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.900
 developer partners not if it is not 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.180
 anything this had already used to them 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.150
 come but also remember that out there 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.980
 was planning to take out an xbox one that did not 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.020
 I was going to read disc or I was just going to 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.550
 being digital that was a rumor but 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.070
 it seems that this was going to be very true 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:18.930
 a new cheaper xbox one for 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.900
 end of 2014 to the question is this 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.790
 will be true will come out if or not remember that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.210
 microsoft sells its xbox one consoles 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.000
 to $ 500 and playstation 4 to 400 or 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.190
 be 100 dollars cheaper not the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.860
 pretension 4 so why not take out 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.460
 an xbox one console more accessible to the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.770
 public to compete with the 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.280
 playstation 4 let's see if this is 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.130
 it concludes no but you already know 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.350
 xbox cheapest web ok now yes let's go 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.479

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.940
 another news apart microsoft is going to take 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.460
 legal actions against the pages or 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.369
 false informants or people who 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.259
 give good liquid information all 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.720
