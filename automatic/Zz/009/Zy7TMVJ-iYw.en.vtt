it has not been local certified so you

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.699

the driver however you still can't use
it<00:03:56.489> because<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:56.820> need<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.000> dial-up<00:03:57.360> adapter

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
it because you need a dial-up adapter

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.229 
it because you need a dial-up adapter
and<00:03:58.049> a<00:03:58.860> modem<00:03:59.130> configured<00:03:59.880> for<00:04:00.090> that

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
and a modem configured for that

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.199 
and a modem configured for that
particular<00:04:00.390> device<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:02.010> we<00:04:02.880> return<00:04:03.180> to

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
particular device and so we return to

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.039 
particular device and so we return to
the<00:04:03.330> wizard<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.900> do<00:04:04.019> that<00:04:04.230> we<00:04:05.190> hit<00:04:05.340> next<00:04:06.049> we

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
the wizard to do that we hit next we

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.380 
the wizard to do that we hit next we
have<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.200> quick<00:04:07.440> install<00:04:07.650> button<00:04:08.150> we<00:04:09.150> press<00:04:09.360> a

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
have a quick install button we press a

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.630 
have a quick install button we press a
quick<00:04:09.690> install<00:04:09.900> button<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.650> what<00:04:11.310> that<00:04:11.430> does

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
quick install button and what that does

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.460 
quick install button and what that does
is<00:04:11.670> it<00:04:11.910> causes<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.690> windows<00:04:12.959> machine<00:04:13.260> to

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
is it causes the windows machine to

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.199 
is it causes the windows machine to
probe<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:14.130> serial<00:04:14.430> ports<00:04:14.700> looking<00:04:15.060> for

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
probe the serial ports looking for

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.110 
probe the serial ports looking for
satellite<00:04:15.570> phones<00:04:15.859> it<00:04:16.859> should<00:04:17.070> find<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.700> GSP

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
satellite phones it should find the GSP

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.500 
satellite phones it should find the GSP
1700<00:04:19.109> here<00:04:19.260> momentarily<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.220> when<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.330> does

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
1700 here momentarily and when it does

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.280 
1700 here momentarily and when it does
it<00:04:22.080> will<00:04:22.349> go<00:04:22.560> ahead

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
it will go ahead

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.610 
it will go ahead
and<00:04:24.030> here<00:04:25.030> we<00:04:25.060> go<00:04:25.150> ask<00:04:25.540> us<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.080> install<00:04:26.410> a

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
and here we go ask us to install a

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.680 
and here we go ask us to install a
driver<00:04:26.890> again<00:04:27.670> this<00:04:27.820> driver<00:04:28.090> is<00:04:28.240> not<00:04:28.360> local

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
driver again this driver is not local

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.050 
driver again this driver is not local
certified<00:04:28.980> so<00:04:29.980> we'll<00:04:30.160> say<00:04:30.340> install<00:04:30.700> anyway

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
certified so we'll say install anyway

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.060 
certified so we'll say install anyway
and<00:04:32.340> then<00:04:33.340> we<00:04:33.550> get<00:04:33.640> a<00:04:33.700> message<00:04:35.070> momentarily

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
and then we get a message momentarily

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.280 
and then we get a message momentarily
here<00:04:36.550> after<00:04:36.880> the<00:04:37.030> drivers<00:04:37.390> installed<00:04:40.290> stating
