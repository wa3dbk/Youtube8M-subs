00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.700
 104 which I will show are called sand 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.259
 watch name was like due to the fact that 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.599
 such a bizarre form 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.370
 I will show you quickly in 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.570
 mind 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.830
 you stretch 2 triangles and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.189
 throws between them and and back and forth 3 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.730
 entirely brilliantly if performed 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.730
 his swimming 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.480
 it's an hourglass and now I 'll explain everything 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.430
 in order 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.720
 You need to start with a half landing here 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.230
 so very similar the movement was in tricks and 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.469
 what 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.570
 once threw meet on the steering wheel here 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.720
 doing the same thing but instead 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.860
 plant it inside the triangle 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.269
 pushing it to the top so that 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.239
 you got two triangles on 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.339
 one on each side and near 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.860
 reconstruction you need to rock it and in 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:01.250
 one of these triangles and and sits down 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.440
 several times where on the trick there is but 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.899
 what variations i will show that option 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:13.550
 which I myself once studied so 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:15.920
 the very beginning as I said the ejection above 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.690
 her out and you stretch these two 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.700
 triangle 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.009
 for this as soon as it fell out 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.270
 you take with three fingers you pull that rope 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.830
 with the sun in the loop in the thumb 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.690
 index and middle to achieve 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.049
 maximum disclosure is the same with 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.100
 other country thumb forefinger 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.380
 Well, it should get this 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.380
 admire the design but so that 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.450
 you got it fast from this 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.560
 places once wandering towards the free 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.119
 put your hands on this rope like this 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.530
 Here I will train and execute this part 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.479
 this is the main hourglass movement 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.149
 release her open triangle and 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.710
 put inside 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.990
 Well , look what is already well done you 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.570
 know how to throw it out reveals 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.350
 triangles put her in one of them on 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.670
 besides, I continue this rope to you 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.910
 I'll show you the whole trick again 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.970
 then you do the lighting 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:21.650
 turnover again and now turn 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:25.579
 back and put shorter again okay okay 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.549
 once again here swinging the first movement 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:31.370
 and now must put her on this 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.549
 the rope further need to throw and plant 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.169
 turns on the same place turn 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.760
 attention that you will reset everything now 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.120
 Koreans will get you because 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.700
 this 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.360
 lie or loops so they need 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.980
 unwind one more turn and it turns out 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.010
 the very triangles that were in 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.810
 the beginning of 45 and the rope well further 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.150
 keep on circling planted in 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.989
 triangle you get another node 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.079
 now unwind it back and first 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.640
 position is the whole trick of this trick 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.709
 to make these triangles 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.200
 and then you can do anything with it 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.720
 put in one to another throw over 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.329
 back and forth variations which I showed 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.459
 just one of the ways 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:17.629
 not wish I can throw it back and forth 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.700
 me and the more reps to do 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.090
 follow closely so that did not work 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.319
 node well and again 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.750
 sand through throwing it 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.569
 open triangles 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.079
 throw it inside one of them 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.540
 throwing it off 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.269
 soot again with a turn to consider 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.549
 other side and repeat 6 movements 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.280
 a couple of times to disassemble the structure 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:49.359
 just throw rope and do 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.359
 rush a trick called hourglass
