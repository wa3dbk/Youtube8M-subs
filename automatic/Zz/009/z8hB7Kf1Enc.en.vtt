should point out while I'm doing that
I'm<00:02:29.440> actually<00:02:29.590> using<00:02:30.010> another<00:02:30.519> right<00:02:31.330> hand

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
I'm actually using another right hand

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.690 
I'm actually using another right hand
technique<00:02:31.840> called<00:02:32.170> palm<00:02:32.560> muting<00:02:32.950> where<00:02:33.580> I'm

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.580 
resting my right palm right hand palm
right<00:02:37.239> on<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.630> bridge<00:02:37.870> where<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.319> strings

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
right on the bridge where the strings

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.880 
right on the bridge where the strings
meet<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.910> bridge<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:40.930> that<00:02:41.140> instead<00:02:41.769> of

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
meet the bridge so that instead of

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.940 
meet the bridge so that instead of
having<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.160> out<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.370> ring<00:02:42.549> out<00:02:43.920> they're<00:02:44.920> a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
having that out to ring out they're a

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.259 
having that out to ring out they're a
little<00:02:45.250> more<00:02:45.610> thumpy<00:02:46.090> sounding<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:48.519> once<00:02:49.120> you

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
little more thumpy sounding so once you

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.440 
little more thumpy sounding so once you
have<00:02:49.450> this<00:02:49.660> steady<00:02:49.959> base<00:02:50.200> going<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:52.150> next

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
have this steady base going the next

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.839 
have this steady base going the next
technique<00:02:52.780> is<00:02:52.989> call<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.069> pinch<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.670> that

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
technique is call the pinch and that

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.759 
technique is call the pinch and that
means<00:02:55.090> playing<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.720> note<00:02:55.930> with<00:02:56.170> your<00:02:56.319> finger

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
means playing a note with your finger

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.400 
means playing a note with your finger
right<00:02:57.310> hand<00:02:57.489> finger<00:02:57.819> at<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.120> same<00:02:58.329> time<00:02:58.660> that

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
right hand finger at the same time that

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.410 
right hand finger at the same time that
you<00:02:59.590> play<00:02:59.829> a<00:03:00.250> bass<00:03:00.670> note

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
you play a bass note

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.210 
you play a bass note
and<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.100> can<00:03:05.620> start<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:06.740> do<00:03:06.860> this<00:03:07.010> by

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
and so you can start to do this by

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.670 
and so you can start to do this by
playing<00:03:07.520> a<00:03:07.760> pinch<00:03:08.240> on<00:03:08.390> every<00:03:08.930> bass<00:03:09.110> note<00:03:09.380> like

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
playing a pinch on every bass note like

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:18.250 
playing a pinch on every bass note like
this<00:03:12.490> 1<00:03:13.490> 2<00:03:14.050> 3<00:03:15.050> 4<00:03:15.800> now<00:03:16.569> I'm<00:03:17.569> using<00:03:17.750> my<00:03:17.870> ring

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
this 1 2 3 4 now I'm using my ring

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.650 
this 1 2 3 4 now I'm using my ring
finger<00:03:18.590> for<00:03:18.620> that<00:03:18.890> high<00:03:19.070> string<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.610> for<00:03:20.240> now

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
finger for that high string and for now

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.860 
finger for that high string and for now
as<00:03:20.720> a<00:03:21.290> general<00:03:21.650> rule<00:03:21.850> you<00:03:22.850> can<00:03:23.030> plan<00:03:23.600> on<00:03:23.630> using

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
as a general rule you can plan on using

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.770 
as a general rule you can plan on using
your<00:03:24.020> thumb<00:03:24.350> for<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.650> bottom<00:03:24.980> three<00:03:25.010> strings

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.510 
your thumb for the bottom three strings
your<00:03:26.780> ring<00:03:27.380> finger<00:03:27.709> for<00:03:27.740> the<00:03:27.950> high<00:03:28.130> string

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
your ring finger for the high string

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.610 
your ring finger for the high string
middle<00:03:29.180> finger<00:03:29.570> for<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.810> second<00:03:30.200> string<00:03:30.470> and

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
middle finger for the second string and

middle finger for the second string and
index<00:03:31.310> finger<00:03:31.580> for<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.790> third<00:03:32.000> string<00:03:32.330> that's

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
index finger for the third string that's

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.820 
index finger for the third string that's
going<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:32.810> change<00:03:32.959> around<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.350> bit<00:03:33.560> but<00:03:33.680> that's

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
going to change around a bit but that's

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.550 
going to change around a bit but that's
a<00:03:33.890> good<00:03:34.040> place<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.250> start<00:03:35.170> so<00:03:36.170> we've<00:03:36.290> got<00:03:36.470> the

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
a good place to start so we've got the

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.199 
a good place to start so we've got the
steady<00:03:36.739> bass<00:03:36.980> we've<00:03:37.310> got<00:03:37.459> pinching<00:03:37.880> on<00:03:38.000> all

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
steady bass we've got pinching on all

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.110 
steady bass we've got pinching on all
the<00:03:38.390> notes<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:39.380> next<00:03:39.739> thing<00:03:39.860> to<00:03:39.980> do<00:03:40.160> is<00:03:40.370> to

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
the notes the next thing to do is to

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.080 
the notes the next thing to do is to
only<00:03:41.360> pinch<00:03:41.870> on<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.620> first<00:03:42.950> beat<00:03:43.220> out<00:03:43.519> of<00:03:43.820> four

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
only pinch on the first beat out of four

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:59.350

like<00:03:44.420> this<00:03:50.170> 1<00:03:51.170> 2<00:03:51.200> 3<00:03:52.450> 4<00:03:53.450> 1<00:03:54.110> 2<00:03:54.860> 3<00:03:54.890> 4<00:03:58.209> once<00:03:59.209> you're

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
like this 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 once you're

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.770 
like this 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 once you're
comfortable<00:03:59.480> with<00:03:59.810> that<00:04:00.610> put<00:04:01.610> back<00:04:01.790> in<00:04:02.060> one<00:04:02.750> of

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
comfortable with that put back in one of

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.770 
comfortable with that put back in one of
the<00:04:02.930> pinches<00:04:03.350> on<00:04:03.530> beat<00:04:04.160> 2<00:04:04.340> 3<00:04:04.700> so<00:04:05.420> you<00:04:05.540> end<00:04:05.690> up

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
the pinches on beat 2 3 so you end up

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.700 
the pinches on beat 2 3 so you end up
with<00:04:05.840> this

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:19.910 

one<00:04:10.710> two<00:04:11.550> three<00:04:12.480> four<00:04:13.230> now<00:04:17.780> a<00:04:18.780> good<00:04:19.709> way<00:04:19.769> to

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
one two three four now a good way to

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.300 
one two three four now a good way to
work<00:04:20.100> on<00:04:20.280> that<00:04:20.549> is<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:21.150> go<00:04:21.359> through<00:04:22.310> some

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
work on that is to go through some

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.370 
work on that is to go through some
different<00:04:23.520> notes<00:04:23.910> on<00:04:24.180> different<00:04:24.600> strings<00:04:25.050> and
