and you know kill you basically but also
make<00:02:12.120> sure<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.300> don't<00:02:12.540> go<00:02:12.660> over<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.900> edge<00:02:13.080> to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
make sure you don't go over the edge to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.590 
make sure you don't go over the edge to
well<00:02:13.680> because<00:02:14.340> if<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.580> eventually<00:02:14.970> go<00:02:15.270> over
