00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
I don't know if anyone else made this

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.420 
I don't know if anyone else made this
but<00:00:17.940> yeah<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.529> basically<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:19.920> button<00:00:20.279> over

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
but yeah so basically this button over

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.480 
but yeah so basically this button over
here<00:00:20.490> look<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.740> you<00:00:22.740> get<00:00:22.859> trapped<00:00:23.250> down<00:00:23.460> here

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
here look it you get trapped down here

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.570 
here look it you get trapped down here
and<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.390> wall<00:00:24.600> turn<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.930> into<00:00:25.050> obsidian<00:00:25.580> so

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
and the wall turn it into obsidian so

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.669 
and the wall turn it into obsidian so
let's<00:00:27.300> say<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:28.710> just<00:00:28.740> take<00:00:29.220> like

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
let's say that we just take like

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.850 
let's say that we just take like
sandstone<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.009> try<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> build<00:00:32.610> our<00:00:32.820> way<00:00:32.940> up<00:00:33.860> we

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
sandstone and try to build our way up we

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.110 
sandstone and try to build our way up we
won't<00:00:34.980> be<00:00:35.100> able<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.370> get<00:00:35.520> out<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:35.820> it's

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
won't be able to get out because it's

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.229 
won't be able to get out because it's
made<00:00:36.270> out<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.510> obsidian<00:00:37.020> as<00:00:37.739> well<00:00:38.219> as<00:00:38.460> every

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
made out of obsidian as well as every

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.970 
made out of obsidian as well as every
other<00:00:39.450> thing<00:00:40.200> over<00:00:40.440> here<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.800> can<00:00:40.829> see

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
other thing over here as you can see

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.479 
other thing over here as you can see
there<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:42.290> glowstone<00:00:43.290> break<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:44.040> sitting

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
there is glowstone break it up sitting

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.180 
there is glowstone break it up sitting
under<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.480> you're<00:00:46.320> basically<00:00:46.469> stuck<00:00:46.950> here

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
under so you're basically stuck here

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.440 
under so you're basically stuck here
unless<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.579> diamond<00:00:47.850> pickaxe<00:00:48.210> which

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
unless you have a diamond pickaxe which

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.900 
unless you have a diamond pickaxe which
will<00:00:48.719> take<00:00:48.989> pretty<00:00:49.710> long<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.190> even<00:00:50.430> dig<00:00:50.789> this

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
will take pretty long to even dig this

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.760 
will take pretty long to even dig this
out<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> diamond<00:00:51.629> pickaxe<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.410> most

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
out with the diamond pickaxe but most

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.119 
out with the diamond pickaxe but most
people<00:00:53.010> won't<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.309> diamond<00:00:53.610> pickaxe<00:00:53.940> so

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
people won't have a diamond pickaxe so

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.170 
people won't have a diamond pickaxe so
yeah<00:00:56.129> let's<00:00:56.370> show<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.489> guys<00:00:56.670> how<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.910> build

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
yeah let's show you guys how to build

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.130 
yeah let's show you guys how to build
this<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:58.230> hard<00:00:58.739> at<00:00:59.010> all<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.520> it<00:01:00.359> should

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
this it's not hard at all and it should

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.930 
this it's not hard at all and it should
be<00:01:01.170> pretty<00:01:01.500> easy<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.859> follow<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.399> let's<00:01:02.789> begin

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
be pretty easy to follow so let's begin

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.369 
be pretty easy to follow so let's begin
so<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> first<00:01:03.750> thing<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.140> actually

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
so the first thing I do is actually

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.990 
so the first thing I do is actually
build<00:01:04.710> your<00:01:04.860> floor<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.519> can<00:01:05.640> make<00:01:05.820> this

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
build your floor so you can make this

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.570 
build your floor so you can make this
however<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.869> want<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.890> doesn't<00:01:08.400> matter

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
however I want it to be doesn't matter

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.600 
however I want it to be doesn't matter

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
said that right foot yeah then you could

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.539 
said that right foot yeah then you could
just<00:01:24.630> dig<00:01:25.409> down<00:01:25.590> twice<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.220> ground

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
just dig down twice for the ground

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.539 
just dig down twice for the ground
because<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.939> want<00:01:27.090> them<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.390> able<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.659> see

because you want them to be able to see

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.700 
because you want them to be able to see
that<00:01:29.549> their<00:01:29.759> draft<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:31.320> want<00:01:31.530> them<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710

that their draft but you want them to
get<00:01:31.920> out<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.430> basically<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.900> put<00:01:34.799> your

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
get out so basically just put your

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.230 
get out so basically just put your
obsidian<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.720> ground<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:38.400> then<00:01:38.729> surround

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
obsidian on the ground and then surround

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.410 
obsidian on the ground and then surround
this<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:39.600> obsidian<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:42.119> could<00:01:42.299> use<00:01:42.390> better

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
this with obsidian you could use better

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.030 
this with obsidian you could use better
up<00:01:42.810> also<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:46.020> know<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.680> doesn't

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
up also but it's you know it doesn't

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.490 
up also but it's you know it doesn't
really<00:01:47.159> go<00:01:47.399> well<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:48.450> does<00:01:48.869> go<00:01:49.079> well<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.439> like

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
really go well it does go well but like

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.929 
really go well it does go well but like
I<00:01:49.829> use<00:01:50.009> obsidian<00:01:50.549> because<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:53.490> top<00:01:53.729> turns

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
I use obsidian because the the top turns

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.440 
I use obsidian because the the top turns
into<00:01:54.119> obsidian<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.140> want<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.530> make<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
into obsidian so I want to make the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.060 
into obsidian so I want to make the
outside<00:01:57.450> obsidian<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.439> now<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.619> want<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.950> go

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
outside obsidian so now you want to go

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.130 
outside obsidian so now you want to go
up<00:01:59.369> as<00:01:59.610> high<00:01:59.640> as<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.969> want<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.450> we'll<00:02:00.960> come

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
two blocks after each Pistons so you'll

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.720 
two blocks after each Pistons so you'll
have<00:03:51.120> like<00:03:51.390> this<00:03:51.570> and<00:03:52.250> there's<00:03:53.250> two<00:03:53.430> blocks

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
have like this and there's two blocks

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.330 
have like this and there's two blocks
after<00:03:53.970> each<00:03:54.270> piston<00:03:55.610> for<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:58.650> then<00:03:59.160> I'll

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
after each piston for and then I'll

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.520 
after each piston for and then I'll
place<00:03:59.700> your<00:04:00.000> repeaters<00:04:00.630> going<00:04:01.050> into<00:04:01.290> each

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
place your repeaters going into each

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.220 
place your repeaters going into each
piston<00:04:01.830> so<00:04:02.450> make<00:04:03.450> sure<00:04:03.480> they<00:04:03.750> actually<00:04:04.110> go

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
piston so make sure they actually go

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.700 
piston so make sure they actually go
into<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.500> piston<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.900> then<00:04:06.900> link<00:04:07.200> that<00:04:07.350> rope

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
into the piston and then link that rope

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.470 
into the piston and then link that rope
with<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.010> redstone<00:04:08.430> repeaters<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:11.420> now<00:04:12.420> we

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
with the redstone repeaters and now we

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.960 
with the redstone repeaters and now we
want<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.990> is<00:04:13.230> hook<00:04:14.040> both<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.520> those<00:04:14.670> up

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
want to is hook both of those up

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:23.940 
want to is hook both of those up
together<00:04:15.180> so<00:04:16.489> just<00:04:17.720> go<00:04:18.720> like<00:04:18.900> this<00:04:19.250> and<00:04:22.160> oops

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
together so just go like this and oops

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.120 
together so just go like this and oops
just<00:04:24.850> put<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.120> redstone<00:04:25.480> going<00:04:25.690> like<00:04:25.810> that

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
just put the redstone going like that

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.400 
just put the redstone going like that
and<00:04:27.930> once<00:04:28.930> you<00:04:29.080> have<00:04:29.260> that<00:04:29.290> done<00:04:30.030> like<00:04:31.030> this
