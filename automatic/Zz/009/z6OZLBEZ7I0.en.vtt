00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 here we are on the 494 LAN we are with 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.490
 luigi coretti commercial director of 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.110
 adria ship shipyard importers 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.990
 Slovenian Luigi this is the new boat 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.549
 Tell us about this boat from the salon 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.850
 large volumes as can be seen also 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.830
 immediately the new elan impression 494 is 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.740
 the last born in the elan project house 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.320
 always by rober humphrey is a boat of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.109
 15 meters from the large volumes from the wide 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.849
 liveability both internal and external 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.790
 we have a well that is the largest 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.750
 of the category where comfortably 8 10 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.730
 people can sit down we have two 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.710
 wheels for the first time on a boat from 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.960
 cruise are also two balls impression 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.899
 in the water reporting a concept that was 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.270
 already been carried out by elan with the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.010
 performance line a stern platform 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.239
 in this case even increased 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:58.140
 for a wide visibility in the bay and a 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.210
 deck with a deck welding tree 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.210
 harken with the possibility of both 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.119
 self-tacking bow that of a genoa 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.650
 instead overlapped embossed bow 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.049
 or external jib required 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.710
 clearly normally gennaker with a 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.750
 good fixed price with blender 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.280
 internally waiting for the interior 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.350
 we go down and then we do them 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.780
 see in a moment we got off 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.110
 below deck of impressions 494 as 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.909
 you can see a real open space luigi 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.890
 certainly we are in 494 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.409
 that there is a new concept of interiors in 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.820
 how much the dinette was placed in the area 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.320
 central of the boat where we will have the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.290
 maximum beam therefore giving the maximum 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.479
 visibility by moving the bow towards the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.939
 kitchen that in this case having one 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.420
 master cabin forward is a real e 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.689
 its what or if we also want a u 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.579
 trick was in quotes was 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.520
 that of moving the engine from the area 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.040
 under the ladder in the center of the boat 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.799
 thus managing to center the weights a 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.689
 remove noise and heat clearly 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.759
 from the aft cabins and have the 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.880
 possibility of access to the cabins 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.800
 always aft thanks to everything 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.780
 this space we have recovered 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.790
 as you can see the space is its own 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.910
 that of an open space that gives the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.070
 maximum visibility this boat 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.350
 here it has a three cabin layout with the 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.290
 bow stateroom with his 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.060
 bathroom and two aft cabins with others 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.520
 two bathrooms one clearly of service 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.010
 for all the people who are on board e 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.640
 one right in the cabin are available 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.370
 other layouts as you can have 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.050
 two cabins at the bow you can have another 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.450
 stern cabin in place of this bathroom 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.280
 so there is a say modular layout 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.770
 that from the three cabins can become 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.200
 four can even be 5 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.040
 the kala sails in the bow can become a cabin 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:54.740
 I would say very well that from the sailor 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.740
 impression 494 it's all after hello
