00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
the scope of the symmetry modifier and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.630 
the scope of the symmetry modifier and
bass<00:00:50.870> there<00:00:51.080> aren't<00:00:51.260> two<00:00:51.350> deaths<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:54.640> just

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
bass there aren't two deaths and just

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:03.060 
bass there aren't two deaths and just
conveyed<00:00:55.940> editable<00:00:56.450> poly<00:00:56.690> and<00:01:01.540> like<00:01:02.540> these

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
conveyed editable poly and like these

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.740 
conveyed editable poly and like these
worlds<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:04.339> Arles<00:01:04.760> increase<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.210> thresholds

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
worlds and Arles increase the thresholds

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.610 
worlds and Arles increase the thresholds
probably<00:01:06.080> will<00:01:06.230> be<00:01:06.350> quite<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.620> bit<00:01:06.740> yeah<00:01:08.620> that's

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
probably will be quite a bit yeah that's

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.719 
probably will be quite a bit yeah that's
something<00:01:09.830> like<00:01:09.979> that<00:01:11.200> which<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.229> great<00:01:12.729> now

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
something like that which is great now

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.660 
something like that which is great now
can<00:01:13.940> add<00:01:14.030> a<00:01:14.060> shell<00:01:14.479> modifier<00:01:18.310> let's<00:01:19.310> go<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.490> the

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
can add a shell modifier let's go to the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.359 
can add a shell modifier let's go to the
front<00:01:19.790> viewport<00:01:20.170> see<00:01:21.170> how<00:01:21.259> much<00:01:21.530> we<00:01:22.040> really

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
front viewport see how much we really

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.430 
front viewport see how much we really
need<00:01:22.520> to<00:01:22.670> add<00:01:24.310> like<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:25.550> more<00:01:25.850> or<00:01:25.910> less<00:01:25.940> uh

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
that's fine convert see that the poly

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.859 
that's fine convert see that the poly
again<00:01:30.970> that<00:01:31.970> said<00:01:34.150> what<00:01:35.150> if<00:01:35.330> something<00:01:35.720> like

to front view ports and Alessio this

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.280 
to front view ports and Alessio this
adds<00:02:38.950> up<00:02:41.190> actually<00:02:42.190> pretty<00:02:42.400> decent<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:44.110> it
