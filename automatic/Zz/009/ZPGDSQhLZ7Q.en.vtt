00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.200
 ae 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.890
 is 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.950
 the guys your boss and you jorge 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.600
 they just saw me play crazy train 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.190
 ozzy osbourne randy rhoads nessa 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.070
 recording in particular had 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.890
 simply a gigantic setup of 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.480
 march amplifiers are all in stec 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.120
 he also used a guitar les 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.870
 paul and put sound pressure on the stem 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.580
 it 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.430
 I am very good after a lot of stuff 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.050
 also production of lens lep beck sound 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.940
 the room was also picked up and we will 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.710
 try to reproduce this now let's 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.900
 start with the guitar or sell clothes 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.760
 wore a few two burgers laws 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.040
 This is my hunting tractor with 35 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.470
 So what we can do is 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.659
 use the ram converter for 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.159
 single runs what to m80 time to people 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.450
 gives a full bodied sound so this is the 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:14.360
 extract bridge computer sound 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:16.040
 Let's plug in a converter. It's over. 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.020
 full bodied with rambo now have 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.210
 simulate the sound amplifier he used 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.040
 those giant gears my 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.470
 cante gets here a choice the option 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.300
 stec and connect it also uses pedals 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.310
 of distortion so we can simulate 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.700
 this is also cool that the pedal of 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.700
 gain 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.399
 got that buzzing in the sharp is 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.500
 coming close now to simulate the sound 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.930
 two microphones picked up from the room 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.970
 you can use a very fast delay as well 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.189
 simple a single repeat we call 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.140
 that the law leaves the feedback for 0 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.970
 leaves the volume quite high for 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.770
 to simulate the distance of the microphone relation 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.630
 broad only think that every month second 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.220
 you have a foot away so how much 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.220
 more milliseconds farther 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.770
 now you have that sonority of the 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.110
 ample something else too 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.540
 feature of this sound was slap beck 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.040
 of law used in the soil so let's 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.690
 here our law is not well 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.360
 fast 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.050
 and finally they will add a 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.050
 reverb 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.660
 and there we have the roth team if you 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.400
 want to download this team to your m 80 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.690

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.550
 said people, I'm Jorge, send them to us 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.550
