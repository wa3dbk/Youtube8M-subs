00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
bring a depth in a complexity and their

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.260 
bring a depth in a complexity and their
realism<00:05:14.139> to<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.190> feel<00:05:15.520> it<00:05:15.760> feels<00:05:15.940> like<00:05:16.060> these

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
realism to the feel it feels like these

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.149 
realism to the feel it feels like these
are<00:05:16.419> real<00:05:16.570> people<00:05:16.599> say<00:05:17.349> it<00:05:17.560> with<00:05:17.710> me<00:05:17.740> I'm

obviously the love triangles and things

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.140 
obviously the love triangles and things
like<00:05:23.440> that<00:05:23.500> can<00:05:24.190> bring<00:05:24.760> a<00:05:24.820> little<00:05:24.940> bit<00:05:25.090> of

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
like that can bring a little bit of

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.420 
like that can bring a little bit of
extra<00:05:25.300> tension<00:05:25.720> there<00:05:26.169> they're<00:05:26.860> not<00:05:27.039> things

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
extra tension there they're not things

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.860 
extra tension there they're not things
