00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:28.839 

everything<00:03:23.980> I'd<00:03:24.980> in<00:03:25.219> the<00:03:25.340> way<00:03:25.579> I<00:03:25.939> want<00:03:26.420> it<00:03:27.849> I'm

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
everything I'd in the way I want it I'm

everything I'd in the way I want it I'm
going<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.090> whip<00:03:29.299> finish<00:03:34.629> and<00:03:35.629> this<00:03:35.959> is<00:03:36.109> another

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
going to whip finish and this is another

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:44.350 
going to whip finish and this is another
epoxy<00:03:36.859> fly<00:03:37.310> so

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.310

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
epoxy this one definitely definitely

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.560 
epoxy this one definitely definitely
helps<00:04:00.380> to<00:04:00.530> have<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:01.370> our<00:04:01.580> epoxy<00:04:02.000> which<00:04:02.270> I

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
helps to have to our epoxy which I

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.330 
helps to have to our epoxy which I
talked<00:04:02.810> about<00:04:02.930> last<00:04:03.230> time<00:04:03.440> on<00:04:03.740> the<00:04:03.970> on<00:04:04.970> the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
talked about last time on the on the

talked about last time on the on the
Popovic<00:04:07.340> minute<00:04:10.990> so<00:04:11.990> I<00:04:12.020> use<00:04:12.260> a<00:04:12.290> two<00:04:12.860> hour<00:04:15.220> to

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
Popovic minute so I use a two hour to

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:23.560 
Popovic minute so I use a two hour to
hour<00:04:17.230> defcon<00:04:18.230> clear<00:04:18.739> epoxy<00:04:20.799> and<00:04:22.180> I<00:04:23.180> mentioned

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
hour defcon clear epoxy and I mentioned

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.120 
hour defcon clear epoxy and I mentioned
in<00:04:23.630> another<00:04:23.720> video<00:04:24.140> I<00:04:24.680> make<00:04:25.010> a<00:04:25.040> little<00:04:26.890> cup<00:04:27.890> out

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
in another video I make a little cup out

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.900 
in another video I make a little cup out
of<00:04:28.160> aluminum<00:04:28.730> foil<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:31.150> squeeze<00:04:32.150> in<00:04:33.910> some

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
of aluminum foil and squeeze in some

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:48.790 
of aluminum foil and squeeze in some
both<00:04:35.360> parts<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.930> oxy<00:04:38.890> into<00:04:39.890> the<00:04:40.010> cup

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.820 

and<00:04:49.490> down<00:04:51.009> reason<00:04:52.009> I'm<00:04:52.099> so<00:04:52.370> OCD<00:04:53.090> about<00:04:53.870> epoxy

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
and down reason I'm so OCD about epoxy

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:01.950 
and down reason I'm so OCD about epoxy
two-part<00:04:55.610> epoxy<00:04:56.740> is<00:04:57.740> that<00:04:58.599> when<00:04:59.599> you<00:04:59.720> mix<00:04:59.990> it<00:05:00.259> I

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
two-part epoxy is that when you mix it I

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.629 
two-part epoxy is that when you mix it I
mean<00:05:02.960> you<00:05:03.050> gotta<00:05:03.289> really<00:05:03.680> mix<00:05:03.889> it<00:05:04.099> good<00:05:04.129> so<00:05:04.580> I

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
mean you gotta really mix it good so I

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.879 
mean you gotta really mix it good so I
met<00:05:04.879> last<00:05:05.210> time<00:05:05.419> I<00:05:05.539> made<00:05:06.229> a<00:05:06.259> mistake<00:05:06.379> on<00:05:06.770> the

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
met last time I made a mistake on the

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.760 
met last time I made a mistake on the
video<00:05:07.190> and<00:05:07.370> I<00:05:07.400> said<00:05:07.669> I<00:05:08.150> mix<00:05:08.960> it<00:05:09.080> for<00:05:09.139> 10<00:05:09.500> minutes

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
video and I said I mix it for 10 minutes

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.490 
video and I said I mix it for 10 minutes
I<00:05:10.039> meant<00:05:10.190> to<00:05:10.280> say<00:05:10.460> I<00:05:10.490> mix<00:05:10.729> it<00:05:10.879> for<00:05:11.139> maybe<00:05:12.139> one

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
I meant to say I mix it for maybe one

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.879 
I meant to say I mix it for maybe one
and<00:05:12.620> a<00:05:12.710> half<00:05:12.740> two<00:05:13.310> minutes<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:14.300> I'll<00:05:14.479> just<00:05:14.889> I'm

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
and a half two minutes and I'll just I'm

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.459 
and a half two minutes and I'll just I'm
just<00:05:15.979> stirring<00:05:16.580> it<00:05:16.759> like<00:05:18.460> 10<00:05:19.460> times<00:05:19.729> one<00:05:20.090> way

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:20.469 
just stirring it like 10 times one way

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:26.830 
just stirring it like 10 times one way
in<00:05:21.469> 10<00:05:21.710> times<00:05:21.979> another<00:05:25.389> counterclockwise<00:05:26.389> and

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
in 10 times another counterclockwise and

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.129 
in 10 times another counterclockwise and
then<00:05:27.169> clockwise<00:05:28.210> you<00:05:29.210> can<00:05:29.360> see<00:05:29.509> the<00:05:29.629> epoxy

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
then clockwise you can see the epoxy

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.629 
then clockwise you can see the epoxy

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
getting clear or cloudy and then clear

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:44.939 
getting clear or cloudy and then clear
and<00:05:34.639> I<00:05:34.759> just<00:05:35.330> I<00:05:38.590> just<00:05:39.590> keep<00:05:40.039> going<00:05:40.280> until<00:05:40.639> I

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:50.200 

don't<00:05:45.949> see<00:05:46.840> any<00:05:47.840> cloudiness<00:05:48.669> it<00:05:49.669> all<00:05:49.849> looks

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
don't see any cloudiness it all looks

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.670 
don't see any cloudiness it all looks
just<00:05:50.780> perfectly<00:05:51.199> clear<00:05:51.590> and<00:05:51.979> you<00:05:52.969> know<00:05:53.090> if<00:05:53.840> you

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
just perfectly clear and you know if you

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.040 
just perfectly clear and you know if you
don't<00:05:54.919> mix<00:05:55.159> it<00:05:55.340> long<00:05:55.550> enough<00:05:56.110> it<00:05:57.370> won't<00:05:58.370> set

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
don't mix it long enough it won't set

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.379 
don't mix it long enough it won't set
completely<00:06:00.050> in<00:06:00.440> the<00:06:00.500> Flies<00:06:00.919> just<00:06:01.460> sticky<00:06:01.880> and

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
completely in the Flies just sticky and

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:05.589 
completely in the Flies just sticky and
stay<00:06:03.169> sticky<00:06:03.500> forever<00:06:04.009> but<00:06:04.789> the<00:06:04.909> advantage<00:06:05.180> of

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:05.599 
stay sticky forever but the advantage of

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.580 
stay sticky forever but the advantage of
using<00:06:05.990> this<00:06:06.380> to<00:06:06.800> our<00:06:06.979> epoxy<00:06:07.370> is<00:06:08.139> that<00:06:09.139> all<00:06:09.380> of<00:06:09.500> a

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
using this to our epoxy is that all of a

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.450 
using this to our epoxy is that all of a
lot<00:06:09.800> of<00:06:09.979> time<00:06:10.190> to<00:06:11.349> work<00:06:12.349> the<00:06:12.590> epoxy<00:06:13.099> and<00:06:13.310> as<00:06:13.430> a

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
lot of time to work the epoxy and as a

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.510 
lot of time to work the epoxy and as a
polar<00:06:13.729> fiber<00:06:14.440> without<00:06:15.440> having<00:06:15.770> to<00:06:15.860> rush

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
polar fiber without having to rush

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.680 
polar fiber without having to rush
before<00:06:17.330> it<00:06:17.629> hardens<00:06:17.840> and<00:06:19.210> other<00:06:20.210> things<00:06:20.509> that

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
before it hardens and other things that

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:28.570 
before it hardens and other things that
since<00:06:21.110> its<00:06:21.400> stronger<00:06:22.400> epoxy<00:06:23.319> it<00:06:26.949> doesn't

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
since its stronger epoxy it doesn't

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.029 
since its stronger epoxy it doesn't
or<00:06:28.759> doesn't<00:06:29.360> crack<00:06:29.690> and<00:06:32.169> it<00:06:33.169> stays<00:06:33.620> clear

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 
or doesn't crack and it stays clear

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:40.320 
or doesn't crack and it stays clear
forever<00:06:34.610> rather<00:06:35.000> than<00:06:35.409> five<00:06:36.409> minute<00:06:36.849> which

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.550 

will<00:06:41.330> turn<00:06:41.539> yellow<00:06:41.779> like<00:06:42.229> after<00:06:42.469> a<00:06:42.889> year<00:06:43.580> or

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
will turn yellow like after a year or

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.089 
will turn yellow like after a year or
maybe<00:06:45.560> less<00:06:45.919> than<00:06:45.949> that<00:06:46.190> it's<00:06:47.710> out<00:06:48.710> in<00:06:48.979> your

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:49.099 
maybe less than that it's out in your

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:54.250 
maybe less than that it's out in your
tackle<00:06:49.340> box<00:06:49.580> and<00:06:50.060> then<00:06:50.210> earn<00:06:50.629> your<00:06:50.840> boat<00:06:53.020> whew

I use this all the time i use it for
epoxy<00:07:16.250> and<00:07:17.470> we<00:07:18.470> use<00:07:18.650> it<00:07:18.680> for<00:07:20.920> take<00:07:21.920> off<00:07:22.100> this<00:07:22.430> I
