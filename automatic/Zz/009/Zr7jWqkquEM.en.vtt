00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.520
 hello friends welcome to me 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.380
 video reviews about the new maps of 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.330
 firewall tree that are those of after match 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.419
 where I will show you the new weapon that 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.520
 is the crossbow as well as the 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.800
 eastern ex of some maps that I've 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.239
 They found are not I will not show all 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.279
 because then it is going to lengthen a lot this 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.170
 video and well that's what I do not want like that 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.940
 Well then I'll bring you a video 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.489
 where I will show you the other sisters ex 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.590
 but for now I will focus on this and 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.539
 Besides the new game mode 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.610
 where them called Scavenger 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.890
 where the radek modes and that consists and 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.780
 what is it that he tries so that the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.430
 that do not have these maps are 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.640
 aware and well then enjoy my 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.640
 video 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.190
 Here I present my new friend who 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.410
 is the crossbow which which is very 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.630
 complicated to use since it has a lot 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.000
 fall to the distance here as it 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.710
 sample also does not have much damage but 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.180
 in short distances is extremely 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.360
 effective you can already this can you 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.190
 get what would be a double 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.110
 one shot tokyo 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.720
 one two three because I have not seen if 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.120
 there are musicians but apparently until the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.870
 trip or yes it is confirmed here 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.370
 I show you the effectiveness of this weapon 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.250
 in short distances here since there was 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.040
 got a one show chuck jones and 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.750
 here I do the same but in short also 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.390
 you have different types of ammunition 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.820
 this spring which would be a dart 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.440
 explosive as well as the normal that is the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.900
 that been firing on the other two 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.580
 clips and this is the explosive but then 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.220
 I make the change to the normal shot that is that 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.500
 and well, as I showed you, 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.180
 some fall so point it up but 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.310
 if I get here I do not know if it's the soldier 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.470
 it was already damaged but good the arrow 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.150
 explosive as well as the long distance 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.950
 you get when you finish with the new 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.350
 assignments that they gave us in these 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.000
 author match maps which are very 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.000
 good to do says balls vehicles 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.500
 light as helicopters and jeeps and what 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 which is also the jets but 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.590
 it is not advisable to use it 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.090
 against tanks because this does not happen to him 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.510
 no harm and chances are that you 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.080
 go kill 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.080
 what 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.720
 now let's move on to what has been the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.810
 new game mode that is called 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.660
 ska vigor which consists in walking 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.370
 running around a map to find 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.010
 different types of weapons of which 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.890
 they go from level 1 that are the least 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.950
 power up to level 5 I think they are from 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.430
 high power as rifles already with calibers 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.070
 heavier and more powerful this kind of 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.230
 game is very fun that does kill you 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.069
 too much sometimes because how do you start 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.900
 with what 'only you' hand one 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.090
 you can run into someone who already 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.950
 found a level 5 weapon or something by 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.519
 style and obviously you are in 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.019
 disadvantage so if they want no 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.609
 download your killer network I recommend them 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.650
 better go play something else but if 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:08.249
 they want a moment of chaos this is 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.249
 a good option 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.650
 what's new with the vehicles in 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.420
 after match it is assumed that a 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.560
 terrible earthquake in which even the 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.440
 appearance of our soldiers has 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.920
 changed to look a little more damaged 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.840
 and crushed as well as they have scrapes 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.790
 bandages and stuff like that and then 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.800
 good the vehicles apparently have 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.090
 run by the same fate in which 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.950
 the soldiers have had to make him 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.600
 some modifications like this 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.090
 zombie where they made him a 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.890
 modification and now it's called phoenix in 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.720
 where you have the normal turret of the 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.670
 zombie like here is shown just like 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.980
 this new one that is something like this 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.380
 like a grenade launcher type and then this 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.630
 is my favorite weapon of this vehicle already 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.200
 which is very deadly and I love it 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.200
 use it 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.400
 another new vehicle is this trolley to 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.160
 which they did an adaptation of a 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.710
 turret on the top what fits 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.270
 highlight is that this truck that you 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.570
 you can handle the most apart also 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.780
 you can use your weapon this weapon is very 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.780
 powerful and very versatile the only bad thing that 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.820
 as it is a civil vehicle this does not have 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.130
 no type of protection which only 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.260
 we need a simple tree to fly 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.460
 We are in pieces and you can die so 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.100
 Well, I do not recommend using 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.200
 this vehicle for a long time better 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.150
 put a strategic zone do 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.630
 a few deaths and then flee 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.630
 for his life 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:39.079
 now we see these mini clips for the 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:41.239
 final move to the interest part 

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:43.309
 where will I show you two of these so that 

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:45.049
 know your location and then if you 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:46.969
 they want to go and look for them and well 

00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:48.760
 follow in this video and do not leave by 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:51.240
 favor 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.240
 to 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.139
 ah 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.240
 Y 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.400
 come crazy 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.620
 but what I found 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.840
 and a cart 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:58.419
 in peace 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.070
 what 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.450
 ah 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.450
 you are nobody 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.930
 now let's move on to the part of the 

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:45.610
 histories where you have to direct 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.409
 to this building that I'm shooting 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.779
 here that is on the map of brands 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:51.520
 monolith now yes you have to 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:53.469
 take a helicopter and fly it up 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.990
 there or with a partner to help them 

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:58.599
 arrive to see this record 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.909
 since he is in it in what has been 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:02.949
 the roof of this building so so 

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:05.169
 here we get off and we go to what 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:07.990
 which is the right corner of 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:10.960
 this building and there they see those are the 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.460
 euros shoes stage the game of thousands 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.499
 there is I do not know if they have seen it or if 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.300
 no, because it's not a very good game 

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:19.159
 but well let's continue on the other 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.930
 now we are on this map that 

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:22.400
 is the epis center that should be highlighted 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.139
 that is the only map that while you're 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.639
 playing from a sudden trembles 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:27.409
 but anyway now let's go to what is the 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:29.629
 iceberg we go directly to this 

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:31.759
 pipeline and we move on until we find a 

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:33.680
 toy dinosaur point to this one by 

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:36.229
 a few seconds and unlock what is 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.970
 an achievement either for the decision that they are 

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:40.460
 trophies and I think that for the xbox they are 

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:42.020
 Finally medals for good with this 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.060
 you unlock this achievement and well 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.610
 I hope and you liked my video by 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.889
 please if you liked like it and also 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:53.050

00:07:48.889 --> 00:07:53.050
 videos that come on the way until later
