a group of young people which can bring

a group of young people which can bring

I'm<00:04:19.370> off<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:19.760> stuff<00:04:19.970> now<00:04:20.180> I'm<00:04:20.450> at<00:04:20.570> home<00:04:20.720> with

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
I'm off the stuff now I'm at home with

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.050 
I'm off the stuff now I'm at home with
my<00:04:21.139> family<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:22.190> I<00:04:22.850> tend<00:04:23.240> to<00:04:23.300> keep<00:04:23.480> it<00:04:23.600> that<00:04:23.720> way

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
my family and I tend to keep it that way

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.629 
my family and I tend to keep it that way
the<00:04:26.060> future<00:04:27.020> looks<00:04:27.230> very<00:04:27.440> promising<00:04:27.680> one<00:04:28.550> of

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
the future looks very promising one of

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.340 
the future looks very promising one of
the<00:04:28.730> things<00:04:28.910> that<00:04:29.150> I'm<00:04:29.270> finding<00:04:29.960> from<00:04:30.139> my

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
the things that I'm finding from my

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.540 
the things that I'm finding from my
research<00:04:30.740> is<00:04:31.280> that<00:04:31.700> a<00:04:32.300> coin<00:04:32.840> facilitator

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
research is that a coin facilitator

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.720 
research is that a coin facilitator
psychotherapy<00:04:34.550> has<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.210> ability<00:04:35.630> to<00:04:35.660> engage

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
psychotherapy has the ability to engage

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.370 
psychotherapy has the ability to engage
very<00:04:37.730> difficult<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.360> engage<00:04:38.480> client<00:04:39.169> groups

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
very difficult to engage client groups

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.260 
very difficult to engage client groups
so<00:04:39.560> this<00:04:39.680> could<00:04:39.919> be<00:04:39.950> groups<00:04:40.340> of<00:04:40.520> young<00:04:40.700> people

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
so this could be groups of young people

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.600 
so this could be groups of young people
that<00:04:41.450> perhaps<00:04:41.990> are<00:04:42.320> disaffected<00:04:42.590> it<00:04:43.220> could<00:04:43.430> be

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
that perhaps are disaffected it could be

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.570 
that perhaps are disaffected it could be
with<00:04:44.330> adults<00:04:44.690> that<00:04:45.470> have<00:04:45.710> potentially

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
with adults that have potentially

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.840 
with adults that have potentially
disengaged<00:04:47.150> from<00:04:47.389> community<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.639> from<00:04:49.639> their

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
disengaged from community and from their

00:04:49.850 --> 00:06:08.990 
disengaged from community and from their
immediate<00:04:50.120> surroundings

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000
