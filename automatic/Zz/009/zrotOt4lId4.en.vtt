00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.190
 very good guys that so welcome from 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.740
 new channel if you do not know you 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:12.519
 I'm going to give a small piece of information like that between 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.340
 other things almost two years ago that 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.460
 came out call of duty black ops 2 to the 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.849
 sale and at this point I just 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.789
 I have a question why and why 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.369
 why did I spend the night 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.949
 so well playing this game because the 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.769
 people are still playing en masse a call of 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.649
 duty black ops 2 because this game follows 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:39.550
 what is the secret of black 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.710
 We are playing in raid this map 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.960
 so typical of this game that I 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.719
 could go from corner to corner 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.480
 playing with the enee 94 that I have 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.359
 tropecientosmil casualties and last night 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.030
 taking me out this game za I returned it to 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.469
 happen again again I'm not 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.480
 talking about the zombies that all 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.390
 we know that they are a great world apart 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.399
 because what is the secret of targets 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.649
 2 that has managed to create a 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.130
 multiplayer that after almost 2 years 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.530
 follow 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.509
 a multiplayer so great that a 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.440
 new call of duty and people follow 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.110
 vitiated to this because it 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.820
 I ask you that in the video and that's the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.770
 question raised in today's video 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.590
 I want you to tell me your opinion in 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.140
 the comments I 'm still looking for 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.820
 I do not know, it's very difficult to find it, it 's like 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.750
 Coca-Cola formula uncle nobody 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.240
 know maybe it's the uncle weapons that every 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.400
 one has an identity of your own, you say 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.590
 of the year 94 and it comes to your head 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.410
 its sound its way of killing you say the mmc 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.140
 the peacekeeper the wy each one is 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.480
 different from the rest the mp7 maybe it's the 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.010
 camouflage the existence of a camouflage 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.260
 of diamond that you have to remove 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.510
 all the remaining gold weapons of the 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.220
 weapons category to obtain it maybe 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.230
 be the camouflages of payment as the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.360
 cyborg like the after life like this 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.479
 same as I carry the graffiti of all are 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.910
 maybe the streaks are a v6 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.240
 that lets you bust enemies 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.820
 what about being swarming dogs maybe they're 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.800
 those so abusive gusts that make you 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.420
 have a great time when you take them out 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.760
 but nevertheless when destined to you 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.100
 because it infuriates you is quite maybe 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.210
 that people sponge you more in this 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.190
 game and that's why it does not kill you 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.500
 of any small amount of bullets 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.290
 any campers there 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.390
 maybe it's the uncle maps that all the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.010
 maps are practically playable good - 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.020
 aftermath that we have it there apart 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.210
 maybe it's the maps that are all 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.730
 small ones that represent the gameplay 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.650
 that has always had call of duty I do not know 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.700
 maybe the challenges are the nuclear the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.460
 chain of casualties 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.360
 the master murderer may be the way 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.210
 league or maybe they are all these 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.550
 things mentioned together and other guys 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.230
 that all I just mentioned is the 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.110
 blah secret costs do not know what 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.640
 you think but I last night 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.430
 I took this game until as I already 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.560
 I say with a super typical weapon on a map 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.240
 super typical of this game that I'm already 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.540
 I will not say boring because I 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.940
 I had another good time playing things so 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.430
 typical and that I'm leaving I do not know what 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.490
 game after game I keep playing at 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.460
 I play with a smile on my face in the 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.110
 youtube I'll give you the example the last 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.020
 times I was already playing I was 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.220
 swelling to kill and said fuck is that 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.900
 I'm not enjoying shit 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.320
 I was going to talk to everyone, maybe I would 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.390
 I was doing 16 for an example that 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.220
 I did not get a game and I was still 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.770
 happy with my smile on my face with 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.320
 want to play more because he has this 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.570

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.340
 comments because I if no 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.440
 of the things that I said earlier 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.870
 or rather the whole thing that yes what 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.640
 I think I do not know what is the secret of this 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.280
 game and the truth has me super 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.530
