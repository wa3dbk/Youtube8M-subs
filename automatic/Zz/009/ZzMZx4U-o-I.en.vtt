00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.500
 Putin's ladder met in the morning 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.650

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.059

 subject but at home things are waiting so 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.800
 Vladimir Putin at the final 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.690
 press conferences in australian 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.740
 Brisbane explained his earlier departure and 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.630
 refusal of breakfast 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.490
 the head of state also asked not 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.010
 seek no submarine in his decision 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.939
 there are no currents here 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.789
 speculation 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.529
 why I didn't go on for tomorrow as it were on 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.350
 total there remained our finance minister 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.010
 and he will tell you what I have just told. 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.969
 about our efforts towards fighting 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.489
 Ebola Well, we are here to fly from here to 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.489
 Vladivostok 9 hours and then from 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.469
 Vladivostok to Moscow still another 9 hours 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.399
 on to get home and monday 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.690
 gaining 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.070
 but at least 45 hours should sleep in 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.750
 conversation with the press Vladimir Putin 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.879
 told and about the sanctions of the West in 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.199
 respect Russia and expressed the hope that 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.840
 turbulence of world relations 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.689
 will not last long if we are 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.670
 adhere to fundamental principles 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.619
 international law will respect 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.670
 interesting friend the other then it will last 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.409
 not for long, but if it continues further 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.630
 suggest attempts to resolve all issues 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.860
 solely in their own interests 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.270
 guided solely by their 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.340
 the geopolitical interests of something 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.310
 it's hard to predict how long 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.049
 I hope I will continue 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.789
 that awareness of a common interest in 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.219
 normalizing the situation will lead us to 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.200
 the solution of all questions is left without 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.009
 attention and the main reason for these sanctions 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.960
 Ukraine 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.640
 According to Putin, this issue was discussed 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.619
 only at bilateral meetings 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.420
 the president commented and last 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.420
 Poroshenko decree kernel from the media 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.200
 Information I learned that the president 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.709
 Ukraine issued a decree in my yes 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.250
 actually economic blockade of these 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.250
 regions 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:11.660
 and Lugansk and Donetsk it seems to me that this 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.300
 big mistake because they 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.990
 cut off these regions with your own hand 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.210
 why don't i understand this but we 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.090
 let's talk more with Peter wrinkles on this 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.330
 The topic is some kind of just yesterday during 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.360
 bilateral meetings european 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.100
 partners said that it was impossible 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.320
 would allow such a development a 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.440
 suddenly this morning I see that it is just 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:40.820
 and this also happened not fatally I think 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.940
 I want to hope that life 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:48.310
 practice will make its own adjustments in real life 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:51.080
 The whole situation in my opinion has 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.570
 good prospects for settlement as 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.840
 it does not seem strange but still 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.390
 created structure on both sides 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.120
 which could with more 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.750
 responsibility to decide facing 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.120
 First of all, having them in mind 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.250
 the interests of the people told Vladimir Putin 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.510
 and about the economy in the country according to him 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.300
 Russia in case of a sharp deterioration 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.000
 situations have a plan of action we don't 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.120
 going as I said shoot in 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.310
 our reserves our resources are not reserve 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.049
 governments are not even more reserves 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.150
 central bank they are meant to 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.480
 other goals we will adjust 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.340
 our expenses for at the same time if 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.660
 need of course I want to emphasize this 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.860
 if necessary 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.299
 this year all the income we have associated with 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.209
 oil prices and will be guaranteed 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.600
 because this price fluctuation 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.190
 up down 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.910
 early mid year prices were 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.100
 quite high we got very 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.860
 good incomes continue to receive them but 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.460
 But at the end of the year, prices have decreased but 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.940
 whole year, oil prices will be 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.610
 sure how we laid their budget in 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.450
 next year, let's see, but if 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.490
 will be 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.530
 but we will adjust our expenses 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.390
 right after my journalist's conversation 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.190
 Vladimir Putin went to the airport 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.190
 waited for him here on vladivostok 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.160
 elena zakharov world 24 presidency 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.080
 December 21 will go to Turkey and the next 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.040
 The summit will be held in Antalya reports 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.040
