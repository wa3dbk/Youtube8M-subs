again<00:04:37.190> and<00:04:37.460> they've<00:04:38.030> been<00:04:38.210> shown<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:38.570> actually

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
again and they've been shown to actually

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.070 
again and they've been shown to actually
reverse<00:04:39.860> early<00:04:40.280> brain<00:04:40.550> injury<00:04:40.940> for<00:04:41.270> up<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.480> 35

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
reverse early brain injury for up to 35

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.740 
reverse early brain injury for up to 35
minutes<00:04:42.760> you<00:04:43.760> get<00:04:43.910> a<00:04:43.940> number<00:04:44.120> of<00:04:44.360> animal

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
minutes you get a number of animal

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.870 
minutes you get a number of animal
studies<00:04:45.110> performed<00:04:45.680> and<00:04:46.310> what<00:04:46.550> they<00:04:46.670> found

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
studies performed and what they found

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.280 
studies performed and what they found
this<00:04:47.120> even<00:04:47.360> when<00:04:47.450> they<00:04:47.540> take<00:04:47.720> animals<00:04:48.140> and

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
this even when they take animals and

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.830 
this even when they take animals and
they<00:04:48.350> stop<00:04:48.620> their<00:04:48.800> hearts<00:04:49.190> for<00:04:49.480> even<00:04:50.480> hours

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
they stop their hearts for even hours

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.330 
they stop their hearts for even hours
filling<00:04:51.170> them<00:04:51.410> with<00:04:51.440> I<00:04:51.650> sort<00:04:51.950> of<00:04:52.010> chilling

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
filling them with I sort of chilling

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.190 
filling them with I sort of chilling
their<00:04:52.460> bodies<00:04:52.760> down<00:04:52.970> these<00:04:53.600> animals<00:04:54.050> were

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
their bodies down these animals were

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.580 
their bodies down these animals were
revived<00:04:54.620> hours<00:04:55.190> later<00:04:55.490> are<00:04:56.060> okay<00:04:56.570> so<00:04:57.290> here<00:04:57.560> a

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
revived hours later are okay so here a

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.980 
revived hours later are okay so here a
basic<00:04:58.130> concept<00:04:58.730> has<00:04:58.910> worked<00:04:59.210> in<00:04:59.450> animal

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
basic concept has worked in animal

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:10.340 
basic concept has worked in animal
studies

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.860 

it's<00:05:10.920> hope<00:05:11.100> the<00:05:11.250> BCD<00:05:11.790> will<00:05:11.970> become<00:05:12.330> part<00:05:12.750> of

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
it's hope the BCD will become part of

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.840 
it's hope the BCD will become part of
the<00:05:12.930> front<00:05:13.350> line<00:05:13.620> emergency<00:05:14.520> medicine

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
the front line emergency medicine

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.220 
the front line emergency medicine
whether<00:05:15.390> it<00:05:15.510> be<00:05:15.630> in<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:15.810> back<00:05:15.960> of<00:05:16.140> the

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
whether it be in the back of the

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.320 
whether it be in the back of the
ambulance<00:05:16.380> or<00:05:16.830> in<00:05:16.950> the<00:05:17.010> emergency<00:05:17.460> room<00:05:17.640> it

ambulance or in the emergency room it

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.150 
ambulance or in the emergency room it
certainly<00:05:18.870> increases<00:05:19.260> the<00:05:19.650> chances<00:05:20.100> of

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
certainly increases the chances of

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.330 
certainly increases the chances of
survival<00:05:20.880> for<00:05:20.910> a<00:05:21.120> CPR<00:05:21.630> recipient<00:05:22.230> and<00:05:22.350> it<00:05:23.160> adds

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
survival for a CPR recipient and it adds

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.040 
survival for a CPR recipient and it adds
meaning<00:05:23.610> for<00:05:23.820> the<00:05:23.940> old<00:05:24.090> adage<00:05:24.300> that<00:05:24.480> it<00:05:24.810> pays

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
meaning for the old adage that it pays

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.270 
meaning for the old adage that it pays
to<00:05:25.080> keep<00:05:25.530> a<00:05:25.800> cool<00:05:26.190> head<00:05:26.250> in<00:05:26.880> an<00:05:27.060> emergency
