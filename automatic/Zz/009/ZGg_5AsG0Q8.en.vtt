kind of you know detangled dry which is

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.870 
kind of you know detangled dry which is
something<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.470> never<00:02:20.530> do<00:02:21.010> I'd<00:02:21.160> never<00:02:21.370> detangle

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
something I never do I'd never detangle

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.210 
something I never do I'd never detangle
my<00:02:21.910> hair<00:02:22.030> dry<00:02:22.390> for<00:02:22.660> some<00:02:22.810> reason<00:02:23.230> but<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:23.980> did

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
my hair dry for some reason but I did

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.160 
my hair dry for some reason but I did
and<00:02:24.550> it<00:02:24.640> wasn't<00:02:24.910> so<00:02:25.060> bad<00:02:25.240> what<00:02:25.540> those<00:02:25.690> bad<00:02:25.900> as<00:02:26.050> I

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
and it wasn't so bad what those bad as I

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.840 
and it wasn't so bad what those bad as I
thought<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.440> was<00:02:26.830> actually<00:02:27.250> really<00:02:27.489> doable

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
thought it was actually really doable

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.420 
thought it was actually really doable
but<00:02:28.780> um<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.220> tangled<00:02:31.150> my<00:02:31.239> hair<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.630> then<00:02:31.750> I

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
but um so I tangled my hair and then I

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.150 
but um so I tangled my hair and then I
twisted<00:02:33.430> my<00:02:33.670> hair<00:02:34.420> put<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:34.870> in<00:02:34.989> and<00:02:35.800> then<00:02:35.950> put

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
twisted my hair put it in and then put

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.729 
twisted my hair put it in and then put
it<00:02:36.280> into<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.520> bantu<00:02:37.090> knot<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:38.260> did<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.709> for

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
it into a bantu knot and I did that for

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.280 
it into a bantu knot and I did that for
each<00:02:39.160> of<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.430> five<00:02:39.610> sections<00:02:40.209> on<00:02:40.510> my<00:02:40.720> hair<00:02:41.050> and

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.690 
each of the five sections on my hair and

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
then I slept like that overnight and

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.050

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.380 
too bad i mean i think it turned out
pretty<00:02:56.470> good<00:02:56.769> actually<00:02:57.100> like<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.670> nice<00:02:58.209> little

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
pretty good actually like a nice little

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.000 
pretty good actually like a nice little
change<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:58.989> pace<00:02:59.230> from<00:02:59.650> my<00:03:00.430> usual<00:03:00.640> texture<00:03:01.450> um

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
change of pace from my usual texture um

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.350 
change of pace from my usual texture um
and<00:03:03.010> my<00:03:03.670> hair<00:03:03.910> feels<00:03:04.150> really<00:03:04.480> moisturized<00:03:05.470> um

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
and my hair feels really moisturized um

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.690 
and my hair feels really moisturized um
because<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.780> double<00:03:08.290> agent<00:03:08.620> butter<00:03:08.799> I'm

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
because of the double agent butter I'm

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.590 
because of the double agent butter I'm
still<00:03:10.650> I'm<00:03:11.650> still<00:03:11.829> completely<00:03:12.430> an<00:03:13.060> amateur

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
still I'm still completely an amateur

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.190 
still I'm still completely an amateur
when<00:03:13.630> it<00:03:13.870> comes<00:03:14.110> this<00:03:14.230> whole<00:03:14.470> twist<00:03:14.860> ow<00:03:15.040> thing

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
when it comes this whole twist ow thing

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.140 
when it comes this whole twist ow thing
so<00:03:17.200> I'm<00:03:17.829> surprised<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.340> came<00:03:18.370> out<00:03:18.700> as<00:03:18.880> good<00:03:19.030> as

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
so I'm surprised it came out as good as

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.830 
so I'm surprised it came out as good as
it<00:03:19.269> did<00:03:19.450> um<00:03:20.400> but<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:21.579> took<00:03:21.700> me<00:03:21.880> probably<00:03:21.940> about

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
it did um but it took me probably about

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.890 
it did um but it took me probably about
maybe<00:03:23.650> an<00:03:23.890> hour<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:24.670> do<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:24.910> twist<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.540> bantu

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.960 
maybe an hour to do the twist the bantu
knots<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:26.530> detangle<00:03:27.340> my<00:03:27.370> hair<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:27.790> all<00:03:27.940> that
