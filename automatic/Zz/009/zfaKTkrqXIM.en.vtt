00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that let's have a look at the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:01:15.460 
that let's have a look at the
ingredients<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.010> know<00:00:50.309> what<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.640> need

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.540 

I'm<00:01:16.010> starting<00:01:16.700> with<00:01:17.050> separating<00:01:18.050> my<00:01:18.560> eggs<00:01:18.800> so

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
I'm starting with separating my eggs so

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.610 
I'm starting with separating my eggs so
I<00:01:19.640> have<00:01:19.970> my<00:01:20.210> egg<00:01:20.420> whites<00:01:20.690> and<00:01:20.900> egg<00:01:21.050> yolks<00:01:21.110> and

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
I have my egg whites and egg yolks and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.310 
I have my egg whites and egg yolks and
the<00:01:22.520> egg<00:01:22.670> whites<00:01:22.940> I'm<00:01:23.180> going<00:01:23.540> to<00:01:23.780> be<00:01:23.930> beating

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
the egg whites I'm going to be beating

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.270 
the egg whites I'm going to be beating
with<00:01:24.500> my<00:01:24.680> handheld<00:01:25.010> mixer<00:01:25.340> until<00:01:26.090> stiff<00:01:26.840> peaks

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
with my handheld mixer until stiff peaks

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.040 
with my handheld mixer until stiff peaks
so<00:01:28.280> basically<00:01:28.760> if<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.150> can<00:01:29.360> turn<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.810> bowl

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
so basically if you can turn that bowl

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.560 
so basically if you can turn that bowl
like<00:01:30.290> that<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:30.770> nothing<00:01:31.070> runs<00:01:31.460> away<00:01:31.610> it's

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
like that and nothing runs away it's

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.650 
like that and nothing runs away it's
