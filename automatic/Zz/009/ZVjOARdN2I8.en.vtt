00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.799
 hello gangsters with you panda is midone 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.230
 either from shadow demos vs. night stalker 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.710
 as it is known shadow demon is very strong 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.139
 guy 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.599
 because he can throw evil 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.250
 stacks of poison if you can call it that 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.650
 in the first dota it was periodically sent 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.750
 on mid order to he sketched these stacks 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.910
 killed everybody but when something 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.039
 several stacks become a demon 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.760
 gets even bigger and you lived lived not 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.680
 tsuzhil himself 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.900
 and then 1 7 100k explode and you 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.700
 dying i collected blademail the night 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.710
 stalker but not really understood how she 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.940
 it works and who has received damage from it 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.219
 just did not have time to figure out 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.200
 you need to potest somehow 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.910
 less do demons work like that 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.600
 way that is to say such stages are hung 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.789
 who will click 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.739
 he is generally right and he will finish off if 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.539
 there are already quite a few starks 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.070
 the game is not such a team and who 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.700
 who with style in general is enough 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.399
 fun 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.340
 the very beginning of the demon demon have great 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.649
 advantage well illusions understandable 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.250
 increased damage again these freaking 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.780
 stacks but closer to the night the situation 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.140
 it becomes a completely different stalker even 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.650
 without a boot, they quickly run and beat powerfully 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.240
 quite well and clearly cut 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.560
 so the farther the game went on the clearer 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.930
 it became that night stalker after all 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.759
 more adapted to surviving in Leyte 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.890
 Well, the night has become almost eternal 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.680
 because one night ended another 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.920
 night next night stalker 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.610
 Well, we must not forget that in the team 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.490
 stalkers also had their evil demon 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.549
 which in batches helped very well 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.960
 making illusions well and enjoyable moment 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.460
 match was the fact that one of the stalkers 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.350
 made a rampagoo and after that rampagi 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.210
 really the situation has changed 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.280
 in favor of the blue night killers like this 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.930
 so in general, the fight was fun 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.579
