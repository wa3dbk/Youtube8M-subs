00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
falling apart and we patched the walls

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.500

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.149 
and we painted the walls a gray color
that<00:00:51.629> matched<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.320> rest<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> master

about<00:03:22.600> master<00:03:23.049> closets<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.829> that<00:03:24.160> since<00:03:24.640> they

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
about master closets is that since they

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.090 
about master closets is that since they
are<00:03:25.269> typically<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.049> largest<00:03:26.319> Closet<00:03:26.920> in<00:03:27.010> the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
keepsakes and memorabilia so we figured

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.490 
keepsakes and memorabilia so we figured
that<00:03:33.430> into<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.940> design<00:03:34.269> too<00:03:34.569> here<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.350> can

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
that into the design too here you can

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.430 
that into the design too here you can
