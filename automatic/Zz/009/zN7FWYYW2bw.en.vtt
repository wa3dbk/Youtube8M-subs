00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.839 

in<00:03:08.110> many<00:03:08.349> ways<00:03:08.560> this<00:03:08.800> is<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.099> great<00:03:09.310> appeal<00:03:09.670> of

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
in many ways this is the great appeal of

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.940 
in many ways this is the great appeal of
the<00:03:09.940> game<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.510> team<00:03:11.230> that's<00:03:11.470> given<00:03:11.739> little

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
the game a team that's given little

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.490 
the game a team that's given little
chance<00:03:12.310> could<00:03:13.060> win<00:03:13.390> as<00:03:13.660> surely<00:03:14.050> they've<00:03:14.230> done

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
chance could win as surely they've done

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.620 
chance could win as surely they've done
with<00:03:15.010> this<00:03:15.099> late<00:03:15.430> goal<00:03:15.700> yeah<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.300> I<00:03:16.390> think

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
with this late goal yeah and I think

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.360 
with this late goal yeah and I think
every<00:03:16.989> single<00:03:17.319> individual<00:03:17.739> is<00:03:17.890> pride<00:03:18.130> at<00:03:18.280> the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
every single individual is pride at the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.309 
every single individual is pride at the
maximum<00:03:18.849> as<00:03:19.030> opposed<00:03:19.390> to<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.630> opposition<00:03:19.930> who

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
maximum as opposed to the opposition who

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.650
