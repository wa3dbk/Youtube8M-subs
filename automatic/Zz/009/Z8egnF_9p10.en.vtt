00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
where it doesn't really matter that

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.210 
where it doesn't really matter that
you're<00:02:14.870> giving<00:02:15.170> away<00:02:15.230> information<00:02:15.470> everyone

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220

still has to play and it's still a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.810 
still has to play and it's still a
leveling<00:02:18.350> war<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:18.860> even<00:02:19.430> though<00:02:19.519> I<00:02:19.550> knew<00:02:19.790> I

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
leveling war so even though I knew I

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.420 
leveling war so even though I knew I
made<00:02:19.940> like<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.570> correct<00:02:21.019> folder<00:02:21.440> had<00:02:22.220> gotten

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
made like a correct folder had gotten

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.830 
made like a correct folder had gotten
bluff<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.940> was<00:02:23.060> still<00:02:23.239> like<00:02:23.390> have<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.630> play<00:02:23.750> the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
bluff it was still like have to play the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.509 
bluff it was still like have to play the
next<00:02:23.959> hands<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.650> thought<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.100> was<00:02:25.160> really<00:02:25.310> cool

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
next hands I thought it was really cool

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:26.800 
next hands I thought it was really cool
and<00:02:25.580> I'm<00:02:25.790> glad<00:02:25.880> they<00:02:26.060> were<00:02:26.120> able<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.330> do<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.630> but

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
and I'm glad they were able to do it but

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.810 
and I'm glad they were able to do it but
it<00:02:27.050> definitely<00:02:27.230> didn't<00:02:28.130> affect<00:02:28.370> the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
it definitely didn't affect the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.250 
it definitely didn't affect the
integrity<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.269> what<00:02:29.720> was<00:02:29.810> happening<00:02:29.930> on<00:02:30.200> the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
integrity of what was happening on the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:40.970 
integrity of what was happening on the
stage

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.010 

Oh
