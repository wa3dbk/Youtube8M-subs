00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello so we meet today 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.359
 for the future I just made you the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.950
 tinqueux routine I do in the morning and 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.510
 I wanted to continue my momentum 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.540
 and make eye makeup 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.500
 and the mouth I'm doing right now 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.790
 a lot of morning because I like 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.859
 a lot it's a combination that's 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.699
 very simple you can see it on my 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.770
 left eye 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.500
 it's really something very 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.650
 simple and quick to perform I 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.859
 do with the mythical de from urban 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.019
 decay and a brush a twenty force 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.890
 evans but it's the shadow version 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.850
 dancer in color sign so here we go 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.590
 it's really something very 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.329
 very fast but I like it a lot and 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.980
 I found that and now he 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.290
 fast and easy the result is nice 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.920
 so we'll go straight to 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.600
 explanations 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.030
 so I took a look of course for 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.350
 save time you already see it and I 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.910
 go zoom and we'll do the second 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:59.730
 so we left 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.609
 so I take for it no cry 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.080
 sorry in my eyelid colors sign of 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.810
 at the indicated man and I come in 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.810
 master on all my mobile eyelid 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.470
 to the hollow 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.299
 I like to add a little bit 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.299
 right here 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.310
 and it will also serve us as a basis 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.420
 because he holds extremely well so 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.490
 we really have something very 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.640
 discreet then with a brush six 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.619
 unfortunate 40 so multiple except the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.300
 girls like that becomes plumb the 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.909
 foxy color which is the color charles 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.680
 pallet matte 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.180
 I take enough generously on the 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.240
 nails a bucket and julien the 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.030
 pause and eyebrows I like to keep the 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.960
 well below the eyebrow by little I 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.240
 do not like when it's 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.179
 brilliant then play even abyss in the lead 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.000
 when I 'm happy but he 's not 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.050
 really shiny it stays something 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.670
 really very discreet I do not like 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.680
 too much to put something to direct his 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.700
 the eyebrow what's going to suit me 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.170
 very well to small then with 1,210 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.780
 yen from mac I come to take the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.890
 color cheese that is the other color 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.750
 matte of the palette 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.120
 there is black also that is matte but 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.510
 I take this one I put it on the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.250
 bund brush i tap remove 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.579
 the surplus I'm fine the place is 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.579
 in the hollow 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.080
 here 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.590
 and then with a small pencil brush 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:06.400
 like the 30 at sigma I will come 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:12.900
 take the busted color here next to the 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.900
 black I want to put it in rat poison 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.799
 superior so really I'm going to the 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.799
 break is like that 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:32.060
 and I go back to multiples the color 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.060
 here very slightly 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.980
 my little brush 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.280
 they are scared 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.460
 I take a little color and 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.230
 julien m in raticide then not until 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.660
 last one never until half 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.660
 very lightly too 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.620
 and I come and seems like the color 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.680
 here it is really fast hurry I 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.560
 take my collar is the year in Bach 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.560
 and I put it in the upper lining 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.750
 and I come to apply my mascara 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.250
 is the cowardly drop in chico volume 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.889
 to girl so I finished the version 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.630
 fusion that I liked I'm ironed 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.389
 to the normal agachon because I've never 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.630
 knew the stock so two layers 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.630
 mascara 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.949
 down 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:09.440
 There you go 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.820
 I have in the sense that there is an eye that is 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.860
 a little more intense than the other 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:18.250
 maybe I add a little bit 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.250
 more country house on that side 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.240
 here I think it's not bad then 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.380
 it's weird because at the camera 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.380
 always spring a little bit more 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.670
 the intense 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.150
 I'm going a little bit now 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.310
 that's it and then what I'm doing in this 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.100
 moment is that I come to apply this 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:08.280
 gloss chanel which is a dacquois light 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.230
 in color 46 gloss is the color 68 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.310
 play the mc oran info bar and I like 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.870
 a lot this gloss because he has a 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.090
 texture a little bit pretty proud and 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.070
 the tip is a small flat brush 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.910
 what did I find really 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.910
 practical for the application 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.270
 it's a month that can be very 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.920
 natural and I find it is fitting 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.920
 with the challenge is beneficial 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.770
 There you go 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.749
 so that's the look that's got me it's a 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.330
 not nice to go to work because 

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:50.789
 that it is not too much load that one can 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:54.360
 easily wear it all day 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:55.979
 in addition his outfit with the pencil had 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:00.089
 indicated below is really very good 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:01.499
 and here are the girls I am always looking for 

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:03.659
 in the morning something pretty fast 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:05.969
 because I do not have much bread 

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:09.599
 do not take too much time to put on makeup 

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:11.039
 and I have some makeup like that in 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.939
 head what I do regularly in 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.649
 different colors 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:16.319
 so if you 're interested to see 

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:17.849
 other day makeup that I do 

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:19.860
 on weekdays but said that me in the 

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:21.120
