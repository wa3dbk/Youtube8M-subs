00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
you get to the artifact you will

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.759 
you get to the artifact you will
probably<00:03:13.569> have<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.780> replay<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.349> mission

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
probably have to replay the mission

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.770 
probably have to replay the mission
because<00:03:15.099> the<00:03:15.129> artifact<00:03:15.700> is<00:03:15.879> do<00:03:16.120> change<00:03:16.480> each

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
because the artifact is do change each

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.470 
because the artifact is do change each
playthrough<00:03:17.109> of<00:03:17.409> each<00:03:17.859> mission<00:03:18.159> of<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:19.359> these

playthrough of each mission of of these

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.979 
playthrough of each mission of of these
ribs<00:03:19.780> so<00:03:21.060> they<00:03:22.060> were<00:03:22.120> probably<00:03:22.419> a<00:03:22.659> chance

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
ribs so they were probably a chance
