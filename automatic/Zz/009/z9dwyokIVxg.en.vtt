00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.730
 hello to all you like the guitar 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.890
 baritone I do not know but me yes 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.260
 that's the baritone guitar for those 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.060
 who do not know it's a guitar 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.530
 standard prior, except that it is 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.450
 granted millar and only 6 me she is 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.560
 granted similar efa liesse if it's to 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.909
 to basically say that's the panda deal 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.989
 standard guitar will be granted like that 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:26.319
 there we win 1 2 3 4 5 4 this and that 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.319
 give that 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.310
 so it's much more serious here 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.809
 so now that we have spent these 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.489
 technical considerations we will look at 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.100
 a little bit what she has in her belly 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.559
 with mechanics finally in the belly 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.600
 rather on the heads of gilded mechanics to 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.160
 oil bath with black buttons that 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.150
 it is for the class mahogany neck 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.370
 with the very refined heel here is the 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.790
 rosewood case that's nickel 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.300
 here is the spruce table 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.280
 and then going to have a touch of ebony 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.309
 that's it for the class side and 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.550
 here the skips for easels 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.830
 will notice the rosa this is not the way 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.330
 there it changes and then in no doubt 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.700
 home and have brought you here too 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.479
 on the thighs at the level of 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.179
 electronics 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.970
 that's very well known it's the fichman 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:19.490
 pro prefix with serious midrange treble the 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.170
 shine the notch it's a small 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.000
 frequency that can be removed if ever 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.979
 a feedback that leaves on a note well 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.310
 particular one can find it and the 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.659
 delete and the volume an inverter of 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.640
 phase and then to access the stack 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.140
 here we just have to open here at 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.179
 exit level it's going on here 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.190
 that's right on the cross task and then 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.399
 now we will listen how that 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.399
 sounds 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.700
 1 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.159
 he 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.920
 it's beautiful I like going to listen 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.920
 stuff a little more muscular 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.930
 here is one last trick because 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.400
 that it is my pamper it is necessary in 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.540
 every wedding there is that it's my 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.540
 magazine's pamper for the moment 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
 he 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.960
 Yes 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.200
 here is a guitar that purrs 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.790
 a lot and still you have not 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.550
 heard connected since elder branch 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.020
 that we recover even more serious 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.510
 it's accurate it's beautiful it sounds good 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.490
 it's not very very expensive compared to 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.240
 competition 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:58.250
 what do you want me to do you 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:02.180
 say and more and more and more 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.630
 pose the guitar look dropped walden 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.640
 they do things big with one 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.880
 flycase this is boquÃ©ho who offered by 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.880
 the House
