 Hello everyone! 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.354
 My name is Aaron Coberly and I'm the main character designer for Guild Wars 2. 

00:00:12.947 --> 00:00:19.093
 Today, we'll show you some new ways to edit your character in speed. 

00:00:24.947 --> 00:00:30.135
 In Guild Wars 2, we provide players with many ways to customize their character. 

00:00:30.258 --> 00:00:33.919
 We have improved the coloring system, which we have already discussed in the previous blog. 

00:00:34.024 --> 00:00:41.244
 There are many traditional hairstyles and hair colors to choose from, as well as face and skin colors, as you can see from Guild Wars 1. 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.248
 But that's not the end of it. 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.657
 In Guild Wars 2 you will have much more control over how you look. 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.250
 For the first time, we are also showing a new body building adjustment system, allowing you to choose what character you are. 

00:01:00.355 --> 00:01:06.080
 You can only see a fraction of it all, but as you can see, you can be thin or skinny, so powerful and muscular ... 

00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:08.980
 ... even hairy or with smooth skin. 

00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:19.245
 In addition to the new types of body building, we've also added a new facial treatment system. 

00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:27.032
 Our facial editing system lets you resize certain parts of your face. 

00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:34.969
 So you will be able to enlarge or narrow your eyes, widen or narrow your nose, lips thin or make more full, etc. 

00:01:38.874 --> 00:01:45.358
 Based on the feedback from Guild Wars 1 players, I found that they wanted their characters to look unique and personal ... 

00:01:45.485 --> 00:01:48.170
 ... and stand out from the crowd. 

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:59.092
 We firmly believe that by combining all the features of your character, every player will be able to look unique and extraordinary.
