00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.810
 if the museum extract it and it is the only 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.740
 naif museum in argentina and it happens is in 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.850
 the melipal cultural center 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:43.510
 that is that in the city of skele in 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.930
 the province of chubut and this museum is 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.420
 created many years ago with very artists 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.879
 recognized and 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.289
 a few years ago I made a 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:59.769
 national call and 35 participated 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:02.850
 artists of which they donated part of 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:07.220
 his works so it increased in a 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.150
 25% museum assets 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.530
 it was an experience 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:17.020
 the voice is naive art intervened so 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.160
 what we see and while while you work 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.760
 we find the one we have here 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.940
 we have a work that is called 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.950
 happy rain I also paint onlive 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.380
 traditional but now I'm working 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:38.260
 with naif intervened in this work has 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:42.850
 texture that texture the dry law with plaster 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:46.300
 that this and the difference between 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.410
 project of the tree and sky 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:54.100
 is that in one case I do it with any 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:57.100
 color so that you can see in 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.210
 any case in either of the two 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.690
 use 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.120
 to make the sky 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.750
 White 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.380
 and another color in a little darker in 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.330
 this case use light blue and pink I'm going 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.630
 to do as if it were a different sky 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:22.750
 then spatula the gesture 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:27.350
 and I'm integrating the different colors 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:30.020
 doing as a small splash of 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.450
 This way, the 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.200
 different colors me that use green 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.140
 and a little orange integrated 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.830
 well after 24 hours we let it dry and 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.930
 the sky is ready in this way 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.319
 using pure white light blue and 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.129
 pink 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.440
 but you can check other colors 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.340
 that is the taste of each one and in 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:02.819
 Regarding the tree crown I put a lot 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:06.420
 material and I worked it with spoon 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.670
 face once loading a lot of stuff and 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.930
 once it starts to its point 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:16.139
 mordant with a spoon one day 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.060
 certain parts to then give you the 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:22.020
 colour 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.230
 which in this case was a turquoise color 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.370
 with respect I worked then the hills 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.349
 the strokes in naif are brushstrokes 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.280
 very neat and always complete 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:38.790
 we started from the back towards 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:42.700
 the previous part and 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:47.230
 always in white first 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:50.500
 we work for your partner and if it is wood 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.319
 choose between hand and hand here I am 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.060
 showing the brushstroke and the brushstroke 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.380
 with acrylics and we work that I 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.950
 I work with acrylic also with oil 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:05.700
 it has to be very neat and if 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.580
 us to this color hand 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.250
 we apply another element in the part 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.550
 top back to lend a hand 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.760
 White one or two hands until it is 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.889
 well flat east so it looks good 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.310
 prolix for example here I wanted to demonstrate 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:28.400
 that if I first paint the silhouette of 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:32.910
 the guys or the silhouette of the umbrella 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.340
 what do you have to do it for the 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.800
 in front of this violet hill the 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.960
 opened for me to take the colorado comes 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.580
 comes the color are well tidy good 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.930
 that those characteristics of the 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.330
 works of the total stasi neat and 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:51.440
 This is clear this is the idea you have to 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.020
 make one to two layers of paint 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.620
 diluted for example here in the case of 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.620
 one base 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:05.919
 clear if I can work with the color 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:09.669
 classic in the case of yellow that has 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:12.129
 little critical power I have to give you some 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.650
 how many hands but I try to be the most 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:18.599
 neat possible the less load of 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:25.479
 paint better and several and several as is 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:27.939
 plan if the time of the TV but 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.020
 we follow the portal I 'm not going until 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:32.340
 talk about the new interventions 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.340
 give them air
