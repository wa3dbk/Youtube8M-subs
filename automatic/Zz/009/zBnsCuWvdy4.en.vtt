so<00:01:50.679> I've<00:01:50.770> effectively<00:01:51.250> made<00:01:51.520> sticks<00:01:52.090> by

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
so I've effectively made sticks by

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
this thin strip right out of the middle

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.340 
this thin strip right out of the middle
all<00:02:01.329> right<00:02:01.479> that<00:02:01.659> tends<00:02:01.869> to<00:02:01.990> be<00:02:02.079> the<00:02:02.170> pretty

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
pieces now for my cut using kind of a

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.979 
pieces now for my cut using kind of a
circular<00:02:23.410> motion<00:02:24.269> I'm<00:02:25.269> cutting<00:02:25.720> them<00:02:25.780> into

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
circular motion I'm cutting them into

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.600 
circular motion I'm cutting them into
thin<00:02:26.230> little<00:02:26.410> triangles<00:02:27.099> called<00:02:27.670> paesan's

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
thin little triangles called paesan's

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.890 
thin little triangles called paesan's
so<00:02:30.610> this<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:30.849> a<00:02:30.879> wonderful<00:02:31.180> cut<00:02:31.629> it's<00:02:31.810> a

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
so this is a wonderful cut it's a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.520 
so this is a wonderful cut it's a
garnish<00:02:32.230> cut<00:02:33.660> but<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:34.780> can<00:02:34.959> see<00:02:35.140> I<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.349> throw

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
garnish cut but you can see I can throw

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.449 
garnish cut but you can see I can throw
up<00:02:35.590> pretty<00:02:35.829> quickly

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
up pretty quickly

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.580 
up pretty quickly
and<00:02:37.329> it<00:02:37.510> gives<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.780> very<00:02:37.810> interesting<00:02:38.410> look<00:02:38.560> to

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
and it gives a very interesting look to

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.809 
and it gives a very interesting look to
the<00:02:38.739> play<00:02:38.889> instead<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.220> just<00:02:39.310> having<00:02:39.430> chunks

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
the play instead of just having chunks

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.940 
the play instead of just having chunks
of<00:02:39.940> carrots<00:02:40.329> and<00:02:40.540> it's<00:02:41.049> all<00:02:41.230> gonna<00:02:41.440> cook<00:02:41.709> at

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950

of carrots and it's all gonna cook at
about<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.370> same<00:02:42.579> rate<00:02:43.769> okay<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:46.510> I'm<00:02:46.569> gonna

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
about the same rate okay so I'm gonna

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.300 
about the same rate okay so I'm gonna
