here are some of our features first of

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.830 
here are some of our features first of
all<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.130> workshop<00:00:30.000> where<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:30.689> can

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
all it is the workshop where we can

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.220 
all it is the workshop where we can
customize<00:00:31.410> our<00:00:31.769> spaceship<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:33.630> goal<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
customize our spaceship the goal of the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.340 
customize our spaceship the goal of the
game<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.790> explore<00:00:35.790> planets<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.570> drill

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
game is to explore planets and drill

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.729 
game is to explore planets and drill
minerals<00:00:38.059> when<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.270> drill<00:00:39.899> minerals<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.530> can

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
minerals when you drill minerals you can

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.280 
minerals when you drill minerals you can
buy<00:00:40.950> upgrades<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.210> spaceship<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.899> drill

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
buy upgrades for a spaceship to drill

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.100 
buy upgrades for a spaceship to drill
more<00:00:43.500> minerals<00:00:43.980> more<00:00:44.280> efficiently<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.390> here

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
more minerals more efficiently so here

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.139 
more minerals more efficiently so here
we<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.309> thrusters<00:00:47.690> some<00:00:48.690> drilling<00:00:49.140> tools

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
we have thrusters some drilling tools

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.080 
we have thrusters some drilling tools
some<00:00:51.149> improvements<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> hull<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
some improvements for a hull and the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.849 
some improvements for a hull and the
sensors<00:00:54.090> etc<00:00:54.860> so<00:00:56.899> now<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.930> don't<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.620> enough

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
sensors etc so now I don't have enough

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.790 
sensors etc so now I don't have enough
money<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.309> to<00:01:00.059> buy<00:01:00.210> something<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.870> i'll<00:01:01.739> just

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
money to to buy something so i'll just

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.390 
money to to buy something so i'll just
start<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> game<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:06.170> this<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.409> our<00:01:07.680> main

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
start the game and this is our main

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.480 
start the game and this is our main
screen<00:01:09.080> as<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.439> see<00:01:10.680> there<00:01:10.979> are<00:01:11.040> two

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
screen as you can see there are two

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.929 
screen as you can see there are two
types<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:12.119> vehicles<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:13.500> first<00:01:13.830> type<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
types of vehicles here first type is the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.179 
types of vehicles here first type is the
probe<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.320> probe<00:01:16.700> goes<00:01:18.259> right<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
probe the probe goes right to the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.640 
probe the probe goes right to the
surface<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> planet<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.270> crashes<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.930> it

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
surface of the planet and crashes and it

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.950 
surface of the planet and crashes and it
is<00:01:22.890> ok<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.520> probe<00:01:23.729> because<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
is ok for the probe because it's the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.620 
is ok for the probe because it's the
it's<00:01:25.290> only<00:01:25.470> purpose<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.159> show<00:01:26.580> us<00:01:26.759> mineral

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
it's only purpose is to show us mineral

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.899 
it's only purpose is to show us mineral
deposits<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.200> then<00:01:28.380> die<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.310> now<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.610> probe

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
deposits and then die so now the probe

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.740 
deposits and then die so now the probe
is<00:01:30.060> dead<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.770> our<00:01:31.770> main<00:01:32.189> spacecraft<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.210> on

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
is dead and our main spacecraft is on

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.819 
is dead and our main spacecraft is on
its<00:01:33.930> way<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.680> planet<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:36.560> first<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.710> all

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
its way to the planet and first of all

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.670 
its way to the planet and first of all
as<00:01:38.520> usual<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.450> lender<00:01:39.930> game<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.409> need<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
as usual in the lender game I need to

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.899 
as usual in the lender game I need to
control<00:01:41.009> my<00:01:41.189> thrusters<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:43.229> lend

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
control my thrusters to to lend

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.639 
control my thrusters to to lend
carefully<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> planet<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:46.530> to

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
carefully on the planet and not to

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.179 
carefully on the planet and not to
damage<00:01:46.799> my<00:01:47.220> spacecraft<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.860> landed

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
damage my spacecraft and I have landed

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.219 
damage my spacecraft and I have landed
successfully<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.970> I'm<00:01:51.149> starting<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.720> drill

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
successfully and I'm starting to drill

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.480 
successfully and I'm starting to drill
holes<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.210> as<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.570> see<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.890> hole<00:01:56.100> was

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
holes and as you can see the hole was

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.649 
holes and as you can see the hole was
like<00:01:58.700> crappy<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:01.040> got<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.700> tiny<00:02:03.329> bit<00:02:03.540> of

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
like crappy and I got a tiny bit of

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.110 
like crappy and I got a tiny bit of
minerals<00:02:04.049> and

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
minerals and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
minerals and
that<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:05.330> because<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:06.350> now<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.890> got<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:08.140> whole

that is because and now I got a whole
lot<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.590> minerals<00:02:09.800> because<00:02:10.160> this<00:02:10.970> is<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.360> the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
lot of minerals because this is the the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.380 
lot of minerals because this is the the
deposit<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:13.310> brochure<00:02:13.820> of<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.120> probe

deposit and the brochure of the probe

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.870 
deposit and the brochure of the probe
showed<00:02:15.050> me<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.410> this<00:02:15.830> place<00:02:16.100> is<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.520> mineral

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
showed me that this place is the mineral

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.990 
showed me that this place is the mineral
deposit<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.920> here<00:02:18.920> we<00:02:19.070> have<00:02:19.100> our<00:02:19.400> volcano

is fully broken now it's show shown in
red<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:33.440> we<00:02:34.130> are<00:02:34.220> not<00:02:34.340> being<00:02:34.640> able<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:35.000> drill

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
red so we are not being able to drill

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.110 
red so we are not being able to drill
any<00:02:35.660> more<00:02:35.960> minerals<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.190> we<00:02:37.490> need<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.790> return

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
any more minerals and we need to return

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.430 
any more minerals and we need to return
to<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.630> mother<00:02:39.320> mother<00:02:40.190> ship<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.670> then<00:02:41.510> in

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
to the mother mother ship and then in

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.490 
to the mother mother ship and then in
the<00:02:42.590> right<00:02:42.710> corner<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.160> can<00:02:43.280> see<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:44.500> amount

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
the right corner you can see the amount

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.700 
the right corner you can see the amount
of<00:02:45.650> fuel<00:02:45.710> we<00:02:46.070> have<00:02:46.220> left<00:02:46.460> and<00:02:46.730> it's<00:02:47.720> well

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
of fuel we have left and it's well

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.400 
of fuel we have left and it's well
enough<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:50.330> get<00:02:50.450> back<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.960> mothership

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
enough to to get back to the mothership

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.970 
enough to to get back to the mothership
but<00:02:52.190> our<00:02:52.760> drilling<00:02:53.120> mission<00:02:53.750> is<00:02:54.020> is<00:02:54.440> over<00:02:54.770> for

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
but our drilling mission is is over for

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.360 
but our drilling mission is is over for
now<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:56.200> yes<00:02:57.200> I'm<00:02:57.560> back<00:02:58.040> at<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.310> ship<00:02:59.050> so<00:03:00.050> I

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
now and yes I'm back at the ship so I

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.240 
now and yes I'm back at the ship so I
got<00:03:01.370> some<00:03:01.790> minerals<00:03:02.210> and<00:03:02.530> now<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.590> will<00:03:03.890> be<00:03:04.160> able

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
got some minerals and now I will be able

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.729 
got some minerals and now I will be able
to<00:03:04.580> buy<00:03:04.760> some<00:03:05.090> upgrades<00:03:05.630> like<00:03:07.480> like<00:03:08.480> like<00:03:09.050> I

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
to buy some upgrades like like like I

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.620 
to buy some upgrades like like like I
don't<00:03:10.160> know<00:03:10.310> don't<00:03:11.060> want<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.330> buy<00:03:11.450> any

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
don't know don't want to buy any

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.140 
don't know don't want to buy any
upgrades<00:03:12.050> now<00:03:14.380> so<00:03:15.400> let's<00:03:16.400> let's<00:03:16.790> continue

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
upgrades now so let's let's continue

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.260 
upgrades now so let's let's continue
playing

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.690 

now<00:03:23.270> I<00:03:23.300> would<00:03:23.720> like<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:24.130> dig<00:03:25.130> more<00:03:25.310> minerals

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
now I would like to dig more minerals

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.640 
now I would like to dig more minerals
and<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.930> would<00:03:27.260> like<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.650> do<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.040> more<00:03:28.190> carefully

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
and I would like to do it more carefully

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.220 
and I would like to do it more carefully
once<00:03:30.650> again<00:03:30.830> I'm<00:03:31.190> launching<00:03:31.520> the<00:03:31.790> probe<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.300> I

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
once again I'm launching the probe and I

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.710 
once again I'm launching the probe and I
can<00:03:33.590> see<00:03:33.860> that<00:03:34.069> there<00:03:34.430> are<00:03:34.459> some<00:03:34.910> unknown

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
can see that there are some unknown

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.050 
can see that there are some unknown
minerals<00:03:36.490> and<00:03:37.490> the<00:03:37.880> place<00:03:38.840> is<00:03:39.520> Jesus<00:03:40.520> Christ<00:03:40.700> I

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
minerals and the place is Jesus Christ I

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.050 
minerals and the place is Jesus Christ I
got<00:03:41.270> hit<00:03:41.480> by<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:41.780> comet<00:03:44.350> yes<00:03:45.400> I'm<00:03:46.400> drilling<00:03:46.820> the

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
got hit by a comet yes I'm drilling the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.300 
got hit by a comet yes I'm drilling the
hole<00:03:47.270> and<00:03:47.770> and<00:03:48.770> nothing<00:03:49.660> but<00:03:50.660> I<00:03:50.690> know<00:03:50.840> that

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
hole and and nothing but I know that

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.360 
hole and and nothing but I know that
right<00:03:53.110> below<00:03:54.110> is<00:03:54.380> a<00:03:55.450> good<00:03:56.450> spot<00:03:56.750> for<00:03:56.810> drilling

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
right below is a good spot for drilling

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:08.199 
right below is a good spot for drilling
now<00:03:58.370> I'm<00:03:58.670> trying<00:03:58.940> to<00:03:59.150> explore<00:03:59.540> it<00:04:05.800> yeah<00:04:07.209> much

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
now I'm trying to explore it yeah much

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.910 
now I'm trying to explore it yeah much
better<00:04:08.739> but<00:04:09.739> still<00:04:10.130> not<00:04:10.310> enough<00:04:11.380> it<00:04:12.380> depends

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
better but still not enough it depends

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.440 
better but still not enough it depends
on<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.930> complexity<00:04:15.709> of<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:16.070> spot<00:04:16.609> the

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
on the the complexity of the spot the

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.490 
on the the complexity of the spot the
the<00:04:17.750> amount<00:04:18.019> of<00:04:18.169> minerals<00:04:18.560> so<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:20.720> easier<00:04:21.140> the

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
the amount of minerals so the easier the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.430 
the amount of minerals so the easier the
spot<00:04:21.769> is<00:04:21.890> the<00:04:23.590> less<00:04:24.590> minerals<00:04:25.040> there<00:04:25.250> are<00:04:25.370> and

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
spot is the less minerals there are and

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.040 
spot is the less minerals there are and
once<00:04:27.440> again<00:04:27.700> nothing<00:04:28.700> but<00:04:28.880> in<00:04:29.030> particular<00:04:30.910> so

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
once again nothing but in particular so

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.159 
once again nothing but in particular so
basically<00:04:33.050> this<00:04:33.530> is<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:34.090> early<00:04:35.090> stage<00:04:35.600> of<00:04:35.630> our

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
basically this is the early stage of our

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.060 
basically this is the early stage of our
game<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:36.740> we<00:04:36.800> have<00:04:37.610> plenty<00:04:38.210> of<00:04:38.419> ideas<00:04:38.570> how<00:04:39.020> to

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
game and we have plenty of ideas how to

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.640 
game and we have plenty of ideas how to
improve<00:04:40.070> it<00:04:40.220> and<00:04:40.419> we<00:04:41.419> hope<00:04:41.600> you<00:04:41.840> like<00:04:42.410> it<00:04:42.560> it
