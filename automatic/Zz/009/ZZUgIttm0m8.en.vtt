00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 we have seen co modify and then 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.490
 primitive geometries 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.320
 but we also see how to modify jazz 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.030
 how to work with shapes then put 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.020
 front view 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.220
 I'll show you that if I draw 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.800
 take for example a motus that 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.240
 the most complex element we could do 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.010
 the same goes for any of 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:39.059
 these normal elements design with a 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:41.879
 series that now a profile often for 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.680
 example I saw how going below 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.760
 of control vertex we can move 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.760
 move our profile 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.789
 ok this way and at this point 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.210
 we can do some percent and saints 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.129
 such as starting to see what 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.229
 it suggests what allows us to do 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.900
 the modify has seen changes panel 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.080
 so I would immediately see that we 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:21.360
 we can with ex turris command in 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.390
 perspective we see it even better ex 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.860
 truehd if it says it here we apply the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.159
 command and studies for a number of hicks 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.460
 cm so that we can exclude a 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.820
 profiled to create our shape a 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.840
 sheet any profile of a shape 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:48.270
 complex division of our segments that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.159
 in this case we are of little interest with 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.090
 a command that can be parameterized anyway 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.100
 parametric we can define it to us 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.590
 this is a type of cola modification 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.940
 box now with the right button 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.790
 the gate 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:08.630
 and I show a more interesting one that 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.630
 the revolution that max is called plan 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:18.930
 here the creates a revolution of ours 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.600
 profile around the given axis 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.790
 from which as said yes so they are 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.880
 always centrally but not always 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.420
 what we want then also has 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.660
 of the control parameters a specification 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.590
 class that we can move into 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.150
 desired position to create then a 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.390
 Revolution 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.030
 the form accomplished in this case a vase 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.060
 or something like that 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:52.070
 in doing so we will change the axis 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:56.370
 also the breadth of the revolution 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.570
 see who secreted why not 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.160
 we have defined it fairly 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.280
 enough the curved surface 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.870
 increasing if we see that the surface 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.870
 goes to start as seen 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.730
 if selected we select vertex account 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.580
 we can always go and change well 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.780
 be seen frontal modify the 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.880
 our profile so that once closed 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.740
 the command we're going to check one 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.060
 different form if we want to see them in 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.580
 real time 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.680
 just simply click the little button here 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:38.870
 below which shows us the changes 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:44.710
 time and I'm selecting the vertices that 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:48.050
 I know I'm in this position like this 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.870
 we will see in real time the 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.610
 changes in shape 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.610
 this is the most interesting thing
