know fallen from grace but I think it's

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.310 
know fallen from grace but I think it's
important<00:02:00.760> to<00:02:00.850> talk<00:02:01.030> about<00:02:01.090> because<00:02:01.510> with

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
important to talk about because with

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.840 
important to talk about because with

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
third party I kind of look to sega as a

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.639
