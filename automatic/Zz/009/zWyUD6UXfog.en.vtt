to<00:01:07.910> the<00:01:08.000> body<00:01:08.180> shell<00:01:08.480> you<00:01:08.870> can<00:01:08.900> see<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.320> marks

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
to the body shell you can see the marks

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.200 
to the body shell you can see the marks
as<00:01:09.770> evidence<00:01:10.220> that<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.460> two<00:01:10.700> panels<00:01:11.090> are

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
as evidence that the two panels are

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.510 
as evidence that the two panels are
significantly<00:01:11.810> misaligned<00:01:12.520> further

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
significantly misaligned further

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.100 
significantly misaligned further
evidence<00:01:13.940> shows<00:01:14.210> that<00:01:14.240> when<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.660> subframe<00:01:14.960> is

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
evidence shows that when the subframe is

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.990 
evidence shows that when the subframe is
taken<00:01:15.530> off<00:01:15.680> you<00:01:16.130> can<00:01:16.340> see<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.610> bolt<00:01:16.820> is

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
taken off you can see the bolt is

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.970 
taken off you can see the bolt is
tightened<00:01:17.300> with<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.720> hole<00:01:17.900> offset<00:01:18.410> thus

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
tightened with the hole offset thus

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.950 
tightened with the hole offset thus
making<00:01:19.340> it<00:01:19.550> impossible<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:20.180> have<00:01:20.390> an<00:01:20.480> accurate

construction of the component is very

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.820 
construction of the component is very
hard<00:01:37.940> and<00:01:38.150> if<00:01:38.570> they<00:01:38.690> do<00:01:38.750> not<00:01:38.990> sit<00:01:39.290> even<00:01:39.710> and

hard and if they do not sit even and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.410 
hard and if they do not sit even and
flat<00:01:40.070> they<00:01:40.369> work<00:01:40.580> against<00:01:41.060> each<00:01:41.150> other

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
flat they work against each other

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.780 
flat they work against each other
creating<00:01:41.960> a<00:01:42.050> spring<00:01:42.410> effect<00:01:42.729> detrimental<00:01:43.729> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.700 

so<00:01:50.549> how<00:01:50.850> do<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.060> rigid<00:01:51.390> collars<00:01:51.719> work<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
so how do the rigid collars work the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.230 
so how do the rigid collars work the
rigid<00:01:52.950> collars<00:01:53.250> will<00:01:53.430> wipe<00:01:53.640> out<00:01:53.850> spring

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
rigid collars will wipe out spring

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.999 
rigid collars will wipe out spring
effect<00:01:54.570> by<00:01:54.780> giving<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> mounting<00:01:55.619> bolt<00:01:55.829> an

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
even surface to bite into the collars

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.929 
even surface to bite into the collars
are<00:01:58.530> constructed<00:01:59.130> using<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.490> special
