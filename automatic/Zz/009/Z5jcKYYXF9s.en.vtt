in here is the new Rubik's peak you now
as<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.039> longtime<00:00:17.279> Cube<00:00:17.640> collector<00:00:17.970> I've<00:00:18.060> been

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
as a longtime Cube collector I've been

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.060 
as a longtime Cube collector I've been
very<00:00:18.330> interested<00:00:18.510> in<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:18.960> for<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.470> while

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
very interested in this for a while

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.189 
very interested in this for a while
straight<00:00:20.760> away<00:00:20.880> looking<00:00:21.630> at<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:22.080> what

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
straight away looking at it you what

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.269 
straight away looking at it you what
you've<00:00:22.320> got<00:00:22.439> here<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.619> actually<00:00:23.070> plastic

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
you've got here is actually plastic

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.089 
you've got here is actually plastic
tiles<00:00:23.730> instead<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.750> stickers<00:00:25.170> yeah<00:00:25.980> because

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
tiles instead of stickers yeah because

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.859 
tiles instead of stickers yeah because
it<00:00:26.279> sticks<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.730> come<00:00:26.880> off<00:00:26.970> wouldn't<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.300> well<00:00:27.660> or

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
it sticks to come off wouldn't a well or

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.450 
it sticks to come off wouldn't a well or
I<00:00:28.140> think<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.590> used<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.800> store<00:00:28.949> my<00:00:29.070> Rubik's<00:00:29.340> Cube

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
I think I used to store my Rubik's Cube

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.679 
I think I used to store my Rubik's Cube
are<00:00:29.519> taking<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.820> stickers<00:00:30.060> off<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.510> it's

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
are taking the stickers off and it's

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.150 
are taking the stickers off and it's
putting<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> back<00:00:31.050> on<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.260> right<00:00:31.349> basis<00:00:31.769> in

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
putting it back on the right basis in

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.130 
putting it back on the right basis in
normal<00:00:32.550> used<00:00:32.790> stickers<00:00:33.360> tend<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.690> come<00:00:33.930> off<00:00:33.960> a

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
normal used stickers tend to come off a

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.660 
normal used stickers tend to come off a
little<00:00:34.230> bit<00:00:34.410> or<00:00:34.620> maybe<00:00:34.739> chip<00:00:35.040> because<00:00:35.550> these

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
little bit or maybe chip because these

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.610 
little bit or maybe chip because these
are<00:00:35.790> actually<00:00:36.059> solid<00:00:36.540> plastic<00:00:37.050> tiles<00:00:37.290> they<00:00:37.559> do

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
are actually solid plastic tiles they do

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.040 
are actually solid plastic tiles they do
not<00:00:37.940> come<00:00:38.940> off<00:00:39.030> at<00:00:39.180> all<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.690> what<00:00:39.809> you've<00:00:39.930> got

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
not come off at all so what you've got

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.720 
not come off at all so what you've got
here<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.350> much<00:00:40.860> more<00:00:40.980> hard-wearing<00:00:41.340> cube

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
here is a much more hard-wearing cube

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.299 
here is a much more hard-wearing cube
that<00:00:41.879> will<00:00:42.030> put<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> lot<00:00:43.020> more<00:00:43.200> abuse<00:00:43.410> you'll

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
that will put a lot more abuse you'll

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.569 
that will put a lot more abuse you'll
notice<00:00:44.610> these<00:00:44.879> little<00:00:45.450> holes<00:00:46.379> here<00:00:46.579> this

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
notice these little holes here this

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.119 
notice these little holes here this
allows<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> appropriate<00:00:49.770> implement

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
allows you with a appropriate implement

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.889 
allows you with a appropriate implement
to<00:00:50.309> take<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> center<00:00:51.210> caps<00:00:51.390> off<00:00:51.539> which<00:00:51.719> you

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
to take the center caps off which you

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.900 
to take the center caps off which you
were<00:00:51.989> able<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.530> do<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> previous

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
were able to do with the previous

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.420 
were able to do with the previous
standard<00:00:54.809> Rubik's<00:00:55.199> Cube<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:56.010> there<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:56.340> I

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
standard Rubik's Cube and in there as I

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.830 
standard Rubik's Cube and in there as I
understand<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> there<00:00:56.969> are<00:00:57.120> screws<00:00:57.600> which

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
understand it there are screws which

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.119 
understand it there are screws which
allows<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.260> actually<00:00:58.410> tension<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
allows you to actually tension and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.520 
allows you to actually tension and
adjust<00:00:59.489> how<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.480> want<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> cue<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.199> actually

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
adjust how you want the cue to actually

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.250 
adjust how you want the cue to actually
move<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.030> hand<00:01:03.480> loose<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.960> or<00:01:04.140> how

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
move and the the hand loose it is or how

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.109 
move and the the hand loose it is or how
tight<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.680> how<00:01:04.920> stable<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:06.030> gives

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
tight it is how stable it is that gives

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.580 
tight it is how stable it is that gives
the<00:01:06.270> name<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.659> key<00:01:06.810> doesn't<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.140> says<00:01:07.260> the

point<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> speed<00:01:20.189> cube<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> lot

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
point is a speed cube that we get a lot

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.330 
point is a speed cube that we get a lot
is<00:01:21.210> when<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.259> got<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.470> speak<00:01:23.009> even<00:01:23.280> you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
is when you have got a speak even you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.499 
is when you have got a speak even you
got<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.610> right<00:01:23.729> when<00:01:24.210> you're<00:01:24.299> moving<00:01:24.390> it

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
got it just right when you're moving it

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.300 
got it just right when you're moving it
very<00:01:24.689> very<00:01:24.900> quickly<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.860> get<00:01:26.040> why<00:01:26.220> he's

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
very very quickly you can get why he's

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.190 
very very quickly you can get why he's
known<00:01:26.460> as<00:01:26.549> pops<00:01:26.820> yeah<00:01:27.299> quite<00:01:27.570> quite<00:01:27.840> regularly

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
known as pops yeah quite quite regularly

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.219 
known as pops yeah quite quite regularly
it's<00:01:28.530> very<00:01:28.770> common<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:29.850> pieces<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.990> fly

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
it's very common for pieces to just fly

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.160 
it's very common for pieces to just fly
out<00:01:31.259> with<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.280> cube<00:01:32.729> that's<00:01:33.540> not<00:01:33.900> going<00:01:34.110> to

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
out with this cube that's not going to

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.870 
out with this cube that's not going to
happen<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.829> have<00:01:34.950> seen<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.310> difficulty

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
there's no way in the world that's gonna

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.560 
there's no way in the world that's gonna
pop<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:41.310> regular<00:01:41.640> song<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.090> anyway<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.300 
pop in a regular song but anyway the
most<00:01:42.720> exciting<00:01:43.079> thing<00:01:43.200> about<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.470> puzzle<00:01:43.740> is

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
most exciting thing about this puzzle is

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.130 
most exciting thing about this puzzle is
the<00:01:44.549> new<00:01:44.670> ball<00:01:44.939> call<00:01:45.270> she<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:45.840> inside

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
instead of having Springs inside the the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.929 
instead of having Springs inside the the
top<00:01:55.470> parts<00:01:55.770> they're<00:01:55.979> actually<00:01:56.219> inside<00:01:56.399> that

terms of the anti-pop designs these are
very<00:02:19.770> exciting<00:02:20.220> here<00:02:20.520> these<00:02:21.270> pieces<00:02:21.630> those

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
very exciting here these pieces those

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.540 
very exciting here these pieces those

mechanism<00:02:29.250> which<00:02:29.430> stops<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.810> pieces<00:02:31.380> from

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
mechanism which stops the pieces from

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.500 
mechanism which stops the pieces from
separating<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.250> thus<00:02:32.430> flying<00:02:32.760> out<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.360> what

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
separating and thus flying out so what

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.360 
separating and thus flying out so what
you've<00:02:33.630> got<00:02:33.660> here<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.110> key<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:34.560> under

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
you've got here is a key that under

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.280 
you've got here is a key that under
normal<00:02:36.180> conditions<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.780> under<00:02:36.960> actually

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
normal conditions and under actually

normal conditions and under actually
fairly<00:02:37.470> abusive<00:02:37.860> conditions<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:39.120> isn't

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
fairly abusive conditions just isn't

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.390 
fairly abusive conditions just isn't
going<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.720> fly<00:02:40.230> apart<00:02:40.590> which<00:02:40.800> is<00:02:40.830> really

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
going to fly apart which is really

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.770 
going to fly apart which is really
important<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.850> speak<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.180> turn<00:02:42.420> at<00:02:42.510> million

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
important to speak you turn at million

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.310 
important to speak you turn at million
miles<00:02:42.930> an<00:02:43.050> hour

miles an hour

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.890 
miles an hour
sometimes<00:02:44.160> just<00:02:44.310> go<00:02:44.400> back<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.030> are<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.810> the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
sometimes just go back and are to the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.510 
sometimes just go back and are to the
worst<00:02:46.080> feeling<00:02:46.320> in<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.440> world<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:47.220> can't

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
worst feeling in the world that can't

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.090 
worst feeling in the world that can't
happen<00:02:47.730> so<00:02:48.240> it<00:02:48.810> doesn't<00:02:49.050> pop<00:02:49.170> doesn't<00:02:49.680> pop<00:02:49.830> but

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
happen so it doesn't pop doesn't pop but

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.050 
happen so it doesn't pop doesn't pop but
there's<00:02:50.220> more<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.490> it<00:02:50.550> than<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.700> there's

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
there's more to it than that there's

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.220 
there's more to it than that there's

moves and in fairness that the standard
all<00:03:10.320> Rubik's<00:03:10.740> didn't<00:03:11.040> really<00:03:11.580> measure<00:03:11.970> up<00:03:12.210> to

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
all Rubik's didn't really measure up to

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.840 
all Rubik's didn't really measure up to
what<00:03:12.360> we<00:03:12.600> want<00:03:12.830> it<00:03:13.830> didn't<00:03:14.130> turn<00:03:14.280> very<00:03:14.760> quickly

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
what we want it didn't turn very quickly

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.430 
what we want it didn't turn very quickly
it<00:03:15.810> wasn't<00:03:16.020> designed<00:03:17.570> as<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.600> toy<00:03:18.900> as<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.170> puzzle

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
it wasn't designed as a toy as a puzzle

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.080 
it wasn't designed as a toy as a puzzle
it's<00:03:20.310> only<00:03:20.640> since<00:03:21.480> then<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:21.810> we've<00:03:21.930> started

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
it's only since then that we've started

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.320 
it's only since then that we've started
yeah

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
yeah

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.270 
yeah
but<00:03:24.810> now<00:03:24.990> because<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:25.920> new<00:03:26.220> design

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
but now because of the new design

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.590 
but now because of the new design
because<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.850> partially<00:03:27.270> because<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.510> the

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
because the partially because of the

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.120 
because the partially because of the
ball<00:03:27.780> core<00:03:28.050> you've<00:03:28.590> got<00:03:28.740> something<00:03:29.010> that

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
ball core you've got something that

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.160 
ball core you've got something that
actually<00:03:29.220> turns<00:03:29.580> very<00:03:29.850> quickly<00:03:30.210> indeed<00:03:31.610> this

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
actually turns very quickly indeed this

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.130 
actually turns very quickly indeed this
moves<00:03:34.170> like<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.590> true<00:03:35.010> speed<00:03:35.520> cube<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:36.050> it's<00:03:37.050> got

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
moves like a true speed cube it it's got

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.480 
moves like a true speed cube it it's got
a<00:03:37.170> little<00:03:37.380> flow<00:03:37.620> about<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:38.070> there<00:03:38.340> is<00:03:38.460> a

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
a little flow about it there is a

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.970 
a little flow about it there is a
certain<00:03:39.390> level<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.660> resistance<00:03:40.350> but<00:03:40.620> not<00:03:40.800> too

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
certain level of resistance but not too

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.770 
certain level of resistance but not too
much<00:03:41.160> so<00:03:41.220> you've<00:03:41.490> got<00:03:41.580> that

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
much so you've got that

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.190 
much so you've got that
ergonomic<00:03:43.260> feedback<00:03:43.770> it's<00:03:44.070> so<00:03:44.220> important<00:03:44.700> and

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
ergonomic feedback it's so important and

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.840 
ergonomic feedback it's so important and
it<00:03:46.200> actually<00:03:46.500> speak<00:03:47.370> use<00:03:47.520> all<00:03:47.640> of<00:03:47.760> this

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
it actually speak use all of this

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.120 
it actually speak use all of this
actually<00:03:48.300> corner<00:03:48.600> cuts<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:49.050> Rube<00:03:49.740> expand<00:03:50.070> the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
actually corner cuts a Rube expand the

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.000 
actually corner cuts a Rube expand the
corner<00:03:50.430> cuts<00:03:50.640> which<00:03:50.910> is<00:03:51.170> so<00:03:52.170> if<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.410> turn<00:03:52.770> and

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
corner cuts which is so if you turn and

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.520 
corner cuts which is so if you turn and
you're<00:03:53.100> not<00:03:53.220> 100%<00:03:53.580> accurate<00:03:54.020> the<00:03:55.020> cube<00:03:55.380> will

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
you're not 100% accurate the cube will

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.940 
you're not 100% accurate the cube will
correct<00:03:55.830> myself<00:03:56.930> now<00:03:57.930> with<00:03:58.290> all<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.740> Rubik's

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
correct myself now with all the Rubik's

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.320 
correct myself now with all the Rubik's
cubes<00:03:59.130> you<00:03:59.250> have<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.520> turn<00:03:59.670> it<00:03:59.820> very<00:04:00.210> very

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
cubes you have to turn it very very

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.610 
cubes you have to turn it very very
precisely<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.870> get<00:04:01.050> everything<00:04:01.230> in<00:04:01.440> line

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
precisely to get everything in line

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.140 
precisely to get everything in line
otherwise<00:04:01.950> you<00:04:02.070> can<00:04:02.190> do<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.370> next<00:04:02.400> turn<00:04:02.730> at

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
otherwise you can do the next turn at

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.080 
otherwise you can do the next turn at
speed<00:04:03.630> that's<00:04:04.470> far<00:04:04.830> far<00:04:05.070> more<00:04:05.280> difficult<00:04:05.490> yeah

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
speed that's far far more difficult yeah

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.660 
speed that's far far more difficult yeah
this<00:04:06.570> turns<00:04:06.930> very<00:04:07.470> smoothly<00:04:07.920> there's<00:04:08.640> a

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
this turns very smoothly there's a

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.950 
this turns very smoothly there's a
little<00:04:08.850> bit<00:04:08.940> of<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.030> rumble<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.570> it<00:04:09.690> which<00:04:09.810> is

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
little bit of a rumble to it which is

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.750 
little bit of a rumble to it which is
nice<00:04:10.140> because<00:04:10.350> you<00:04:10.530> see<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.770> kinesthetic

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
nice because you see that kinesthetic

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.480 
nice because you see that kinesthetic
feedback<00:04:11.790> as<00:04:12.240> I<00:04:12.300> mentioned<00:04:12.570> before<00:04:12.830> and<00:04:13.830> it's

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
feedback as I mentioned before and it's

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.670 
feedback as I mentioned before and it's
some<00:04:14.850> cubes<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.180> just<00:04:15.570> choose<00:04:15.720> me<00:04:15.870> they<00:04:15.960> just

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
some cubes I just choose me they just

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.370 
some cubes I just choose me they just
want<00:04:16.920> to<00:04:16.980> go<00:04:17.100> on<00:04:17.220> their<00:04:17.370> own<00:04:17.400> almost<00:04:18.090> this<00:04:18.900> just

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
want to go on their own almost this just

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.930 
want to go on their own almost this just
needs<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.620> certain<00:04:19.830> amount<00:04:19.890> pressure<00:04:20.250> but<00:04:20.820> it's

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
needs a certain amount pressure but it's

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.219 
needs a certain amount pressure but it's
a<00:04:20.970> comfortable<00:04:21.299> amount<00:04:21.479> of<00:04:21.600> pressure<00:04:21.780> it's

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
a comfortable amount of pressure it's

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.659 
a comfortable amount of pressure it's
something<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.500> can<00:04:22.650> speak<00:04:22.890> you<00:04:23.070> with<00:04:23.250> it's

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
something you can speak you with it's

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.400 
something you can speak you with it's
something<00:04:23.850> you<00:04:23.940> can<00:04:24.060> get<00:04:24.260> genuinely<00:04:25.260> good

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
something you can get genuinely good

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.879 
something you can get genuinely good
times<00:04:25.650> with<00:04:25.800> I<00:04:25.979> think<00:04:26.040> this<00:04:26.220> is<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.400> crack

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
times with I think this is a crack

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.709 
times with I think this is a crack
-<00:04:27.069> the<00:04:27.639> only<00:04:27.789> negatives<00:04:28.120> I<00:04:28.240> mean<00:04:28.360> that's<00:04:28.629> all

00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:28.719 
- the only negatives I mean that's all

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:30.809 
- the only negatives I mean that's all
positive<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:29.289> far<00:04:29.430> anything<00:04:30.430> you<00:04:30.520> could<00:04:30.639> say

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
positive so far anything you could say

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.790 
positive so far anything you could say
that<00:04:31.180> maybe<00:04:31.300> it<00:04:31.389> doesn't<00:04:31.509> measure<00:04:31.800> haven't

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
that maybe it doesn't measure haven't

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.959 
that maybe it doesn't measure haven't
keeps<00:04:32.949> you<00:04:33.099> seen<00:04:34.319> it<00:04:35.319> connect<00:04:35.830> us<00:04:35.949> well<00:04:36.249> but

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:36.969 
keeps you seen it connect us well but

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:39.029 
keeps you seen it connect us well but
not<00:04:37.120> as<00:04:37.180> well<00:04:37.330> as<00:04:37.539> some<00:04:37.840> cubes<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.169> see<00:04:38.349> maybe<00:04:38.919> a

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
not as well as some cubes I see maybe a

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.790 
not as well as some cubes I see maybe a
taste<00:04:39.819> there<00:04:40.090> tell<00:04:40.569> me<00:04:40.599> how<00:04:40.749> can<00:04:40.900> you<00:04:41.050> if

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
taste there tell me how can you if

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.800 
taste there tell me how can you if
you're<00:04:42.009> an<00:04:42.159> accurate<00:04:42.490> Turner<00:04:42.729> you<00:04:43.599> don't

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
you're an accurate Turner you don't

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.119 
you're an accurate Turner you don't
require<00:04:44.080> that<00:04:44.169> level<00:04:44.590> of<00:04:44.650> corner<00:04:44.860> crossing

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129 
require that level of corner crossing

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.790 
require that level of corner crossing
anyway<00:04:45.460> I<00:04:46.060> mean<00:04:46.479> you<00:04:46.900> know<00:04:47.020> how<00:04:47.199> often<00:04:47.529> do<00:04:47.650> you

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
anyway I mean you know how often do you

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.640 
anyway I mean you know how often do you
miss<00:04:48.189> turn<00:04:48.490> by<00:04:48.699> that<00:04:48.879> much<00:04:49.150> but<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.409> rebus

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
miss turn by that much but the the rebus

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.619 
miss turn by that much but the the rebus
will<00:04:50.770> still<00:04:50.949> handle<00:04:51.249> it<00:04:51.340> quite<00:04:51.490> comfortably

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:52.629 
will still handle it quite comfortably

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:56.189 
will still handle it quite comfortably
I<00:04:52.689> haven't<00:04:53.680> yet<00:04:53.889> oh<00:04:54.210> yeah<00:04:55.210> this<00:04:55.569> is<00:04:55.689> a<00:04:55.719> point<00:04:55.930> I
