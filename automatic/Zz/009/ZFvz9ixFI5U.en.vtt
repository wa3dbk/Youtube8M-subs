00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
that there it was a popular demand and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.460 
that there it was a popular demand and
basically<00:01:18.479> they're<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.229> be<00:01:19.350> adding

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
basically they're going to be adding

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.060 
basically they're going to be adding
more<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.570> props<00:01:21.570> more<00:01:21.900> special<00:01:22.380> props<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
more and props more special props in the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.450 
more and props more special props in the
near<00:01:23.250> future<00:01:23.420> in<00:01:24.420> another<00:01:24.990> update<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.950> they're

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
near future in another update so they're

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.340 
near future in another update so they're
thinking<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.180> things<00:01:27.420> like<00:01:27.630> proper<00:01:27.930> stuck

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
thinking of things like proper stuck

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.130 
thinking of things like proper stuck
props<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.820> I'm<00:01:30.030> guessing<00:01:30.240> things<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:30.840> maybe

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
props so I'm guessing things like maybe

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.740 
props so I'm guessing things like maybe
maybe<00:01:31.939> evolution<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.030> stuff<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.479> tire

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
maybe evolution of stuff like tire

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.319 
maybe evolution of stuff like tire
stacks<00:01:34.110> maybe<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:35.100> they<00:01:35.189> do<00:01:35.310> say<00:01:35.579> more<00:01:35.880> ramps

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
stacks maybe but they do say more ramps

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.170 
stacks maybe but they do say more ramps
loops<00:01:36.720> things<00:01:37.680> like<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.700> i'm<00:01:38.759> guessing

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
loops things like that but i'm guessing

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.450 
loops things like that but i'm guessing
the<00:01:39.360> highly<00:01:39.689> demanded<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.470> things<00:01:41.310> that

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
the highly demanded and things that

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.249 
the highly demanded and things that
people<00:01:41.790> wanting<00:01:42.210> rocks<00:01:42.450> there<00:01:42.659> will<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:42.960> added

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
people wanting rocks there will be added

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.929 
people wanting rocks there will be added
and<00:01:43.409> that's<00:01:44.070> basically<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:44.640> they've<00:01:44.759> said

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
and that's basically what they've said

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.969 
and that's basically what they've said
here<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:46.110> really<00:01:46.500> interesting<00:01:46.619> i'll
