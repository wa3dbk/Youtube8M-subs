00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.690
 hello welcome today I want to show you a 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.940
 very basic tutorial so you can 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.429
 practice with small portions of 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.380
 mass that I send you to test them for 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.509
 those that have reached you already can 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.890
 make the video and those that do not not 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.960
 worry because as it will already be in the 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.760
 you can see it when you want today 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.619
 let's do with the yellow this 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.449
 caramelito I do not know if you see it but the 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.939
 true that it is a super simple and a 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.470
 cute and for tomorrow I had thought these 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.809
 tea bags that I love so much 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.820
 make you look like I think it's a 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.070
 cute with your rope quote and you painted 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.960
 some little eyes and a little mouth because nothing 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.190
 let's start with the more yellow that 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.470
 It is the free sample that is sent 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.330
 yellow and white hope everyone will 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.589
 have come from the two that only you 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.320
 had come from a brand is because I already 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.400
 we did not have any more material left and I'm sorry 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.960
 but he did not explain you see because surely 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.269
 later we can send them to some 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.010
 detail let's start doing today the 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.930
 Caramelito, I'll leave it here so that 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.449
 you forget the way we have to 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.360
 end up taking we take one of our 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.120
 yellow air drying masses you can 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.860
 do it the color you want and 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.140
 pretty much a little bit depends on the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.850
 size you want so you can catch more 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.510
 mass less mass you can remove or put 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.070
 as you want, we make a ball that stops 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.620
 me is the basic form that I always use 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.390
 do and what I'm going to do is with the 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.740
 same hands without any need 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.810
 tool so if you can do it 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.380
 those who do not have anything more than the 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.810
 samples 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.780
 let's go squeezing I do not know if you see 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.220
 well a little bit with your hand a little bit 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.290
 of not in form but instead of square or 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.180
 rectangular always tightening more by 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.160
 here that on the sides we press 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.659
 even against the table if you want to 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.939
 example 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.560
 and once you have more or less the 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.810
 shape of a candy is never needed 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.909
 that is accurate because in these things 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.100
 it's almost not so pretty that it's accurate 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.600
 what we are going to do is with something that 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.520
 have an end of a stick for example 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.539
 with a brush if you do not have any 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.119
 hand tool with a little ass 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.759
 some brush or whatever you're going to do 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.650
 a little hole in the center a little bit 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.629
 I know if you see it, it does not need to be a 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.650
 barbaridad of hole and in the other 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.280
 side we repeat the same 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.900
 one little leaf 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.840
 Now what we are going to do are the 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.290
 I do what I do to do the 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.840
 granitos is stretched with the little hand 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.490
 Trickle more or less the same of 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.650
 very thick is very important that 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.510
 the same thickness and with the nopalito 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.489
 if you have or if not with a roller of the 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.489
 kitchen stretch 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.940
 until you stay more or less the same 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.440
 thickness 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.440
 to see if I do it well with this 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.370
 you have to try that the same 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.290
 you can do it with your little hand 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.420
 imagine that you do not have what is 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.700
 seize the little hand head as well 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.980
 with the little hand like I'm doing 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.379
 what I usually do is 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.870
 and align the endings so that they remain 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:10.200
 more or less straight 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.209
 and once you have it, we remove it 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.900
 and we are going to proceed to make the folds 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.659
 It is very easy to bend and stick 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.590
 and fold and paste and if you want even 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.390
 a third time doubles and taps cut 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.930
 the end 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.569
 you give it a little round shape 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.150
 and what we are going to do next is to see if 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.430
 you see it well from the camera we make a 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.900
 little piquito with the bottom you see 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.700
 true that is like a little piquito is 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.700
 seems a little flower we will 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.829
 call it a flower then what 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.010
 we would do is not too long for 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:50.060
 that we get well in the hole and in 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.010
 the holes we had made 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.049
 place it 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.939
 then you give it a little bit of shape like 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.650
 you want bigger smaller days 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.390
 as you want because there are candies that 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.930
 they have many folds that have less 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.220
 and then you can shape it with your hand 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.799
 you see that this mass as dry 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.530
 full you need to bake then you can 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.860
 give it shape even mark more 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.290
 candy entries 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.510
 and you can see how it has turned out, now with 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.670
 the other side we would repeat the same thing is 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.350
 you throw the masita I'm going to make them a little 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.430
 above for you to remember is that 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.710
 does not want to do it again because it's very 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.240
 heavy repeat the same thing is you throw the 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.790
 Masita if you do not have a stick with the 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.320
 hands let's do them a little bit 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.870
 over 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.770
 bend is a little bit of the folds of 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.770
 tdt 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.349
 one is the end and they would have the oil 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.909
 Okay, you see the result, my bitch is 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.370
 night has been rummaging with him in the 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:46.110
 sofa and I have filled it with lint that 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.659
 When I come I'll give it in the ass pim 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.250
 pam because he has put everything full of 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:52.590
 fuzz from the sofa the sow of her but 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.599
 good if you are careful and you do not have 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.210
 bitch are more slots like mine are not 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:59.669
 they will stain it so nothing once 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.620
 finish and aix this you can include unai 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.110
 pin that are those metal bars 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.389
 or if not what you can do is leave it 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.039
 air dry or leave it fresh 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.449
 put somewhere in a little box 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.400
 that you want adorned some frame that 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.050
 you want to decorate, I hope nothing 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.370
 really from the heart that you get the 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.400
 mass sent thing so you can do 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.629
 even this simple tutorial and for 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.699
 which it has yet to come to us 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:23.190
 worry because tomorrow I will do another one in the 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.650
 that we will make the tea bag that I 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.210
 It seems very precious, because I do not expect anything 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.280
 you like it and remind you that any of 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.740
 the things that you saw in the video so much 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.870
 masses like kits like syrups 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.270
 and how the creams you can ask me 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.699
 ok and then I'll give you a trick 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.740
 final that is that for example when here 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:44.039
 You see your piece and it's dry 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.650
 this varnish with varnish based on 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.780
 I'm going to explain to you why the varnish 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.139
 based on water what it does is that the 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.030
 base to be water does not remove for example the 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.860
 paint as the eyes silos would like 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.569
 and you give it the varnish it would not take away the 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.210
 dye okay I would not do it and everything 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:01.620
 scattered or nothing so nothing I hope 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.569
 that tomorrow you'll already have the next 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.340
 tutorial and what can you do with me and 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:07.440
 little by little vice handling this mass 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.330
 that you surely love and more 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.670
 go ahead let's make awesome figures 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.530
 of shooting because nothing a kiss 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.680
 and until the next tutorial until 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.680
 then
