at<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.899> point<00:01:52.110> players<00:01:52.530> reveal<00:01:52.920> their<00:01:53.100> hand

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
at this point players reveal their hand

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.160 
at this point players reveal their hand
and<00:01:53.430> calculate<00:01:53.939> points<00:01:54.149> here<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:54.990> how<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and calculate points here is how the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.499 
and calculate points here is how the
point<00:01:55.470> system<00:01:55.799> works<00:01:56.009> if<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.729> over<00:01:56.969> 200

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
point system works if you have over 200

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.539 
point system works if you have over 200
in<00:01:57.600> one<00:01:57.810> currency<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.770> add<00:01:58.979> up<00:01:59.009> all<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.399> that

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
in one currency you add up all of that

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.090 
in one currency you add up all of that
and<00:01:59.850> add<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.420> your<00:02:00.509> score<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.619> for<00:02:02.070> example

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
and add it to your score so for example

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.149 
and add it to your score so for example
if<00:02:02.759> someone<00:02:02.820> has<00:02:03.329> 220<00:02:04.170> US<00:02:04.409> dollars<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.950> is

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
if someone has 220 US dollars it is

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.280 
if someone has 220 US dollars it is
added<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.520> their<00:02:05.759> score<00:02:06.060> then<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.079> calculate

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
added to their score then you calculate

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.680 
added to their score then you calculate
triples<00:02:08.039> if<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.520> have<00:02:08.700> three<00:02:09.000> 20s<00:02:09.450> or<00:02:09.629> 30s

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
triples if you have three 20s or 30s

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.020 
triples if you have three 20s or 30s
they<00:02:10.440> are<00:02:10.560> worth<00:02:10.770> 100<00:02:11.039> points<00:02:11.280> each

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
they are worth 100 points each

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.360 
they are worth 100 points each
if<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.600> have<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> currency<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.319> less<00:02:13.530> than<00:02:13.560> 200

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
if you have a currency of less than 200

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.350 
if you have a currency of less than 200
then<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.390> get<00:02:15.600> those<00:02:16.140> points<00:02:16.470> minus<00:02:16.920> 100<00:02:17.550> so

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
then you get those points minus 100 so

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.570 
then you get those points minus 100 so
for<00:02:18.540> example<00:02:18.630> if<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.140> have<00:02:19.170> 150<00:02:20.069> US<00:02:20.250> dollars

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
for example if you have 150 US dollars

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.390 
for example if you have 150 US dollars
you<00:02:20.700> will<00:02:20.850> only<00:02:20.970> make<00:02:21.180> 50<00:02:21.540> points<00:02:21.870> from<00:02:22.050> that

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
you will only make 50 points from that

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.559 
you will only make 50 points from that
finally<00:02:23.400> if<00:02:23.490> you<00:02:23.580> have<00:02:23.700> three<00:02:23.970> coins<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:24.420> get

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
finally if you have three coins you get

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.960 
finally if you have three coins you get
an<00:02:24.660> additional<00:02:24.900> 100<00:02:25.319> points<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.790> that's

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
an additional 100 points so that's

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.790 
an additional 100 points so that's
basically<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.540> we<00:02:27.930> had<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.110> lot<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.350> fun<00:02:28.620> with

basically it we had a lot of fun with
this<00:02:28.950> one<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.340> there's<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.610> good<00:02:29.850> element<00:02:30.300> of

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
this one and there's a good element of

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.540 
this one and there's a good element of
strategy<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.590> bluff<00:02:31.830> card<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.280> almost

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
strategy the bluff card is almost

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.309 
strategy the bluff card is almost
useless<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.390> made<00:02:33.540> us<00:02:33.660> laugh<00:02:33.870> at<00:02:34.170> one
