00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.369
 blog 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:18.970
 the galaxy note 2 here it is the 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:21.210
 reporting but where just picked up then 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.500
 we have to do not boxing 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.960
 titanium gray 16 gb 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:31.560
 anyway let's go see some hits 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.400
 of this mobile amoled hd screen 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:40.960
 own video product or gps glonass as 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.180
 pen something 1.6 gigahert 5.5 inches 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.050
 so a nice big megapixel act 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:51.760
 full hd recording and playback and three a 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:54.700
 100,000 bluetooth and 4g wifi gamper not 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.110
 I do n't think so, oh no 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.250
 Android 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.060
 I don't know if 4.6 4.0 4.1 anyway let's go to 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.640
 do from boxing 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.640
 and here it is the beautiful 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:16.119
 let's remove the film is also 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:18.810
 behind really very nice big 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:22.840
 giant boys is really giant 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.439
 here it is video camera and here I am droid not me 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.200
 I like it that I don't like because of me 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:32.679
 I prefer mobile phones more than 4 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:37.149
 and 5 if it shouldn't be maybe even 48 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:41.289
 however only in extreme cases 8 megapixels 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.549
 camera and let's see if I think 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.829
 let's look at the aforementioned integer lo 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:49.030
 shrewd samsung instruction manual 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.459
 anyway guys just like I said 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.369
 don't like these i don't like them 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:59.909
 these giant cells and therefore it is not the 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:03.189
 my true I immediately say a white usb cable 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:09.220
 white with another brand we know 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:11.230

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.850

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.220

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.220

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.880

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.550
 of this beautiful and very great ciro 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.030
 it's nice because I like the shapes 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.160
 little of this cell phone however it will be 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.120

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.180
 headset 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.090

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.470
 in here 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:49.790

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.070

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:57.340

 battery understood as for large 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.290
