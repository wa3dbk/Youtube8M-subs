right<00:00:30.730> now<00:00:30.910> but<00:00:31.390> turn<00:00:32.380> the<00:00:32.470> slide<00:00:32.680> off<00:00:32.829> real

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
right now but turn the slide off real

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.000 
right now but turn the slide off real
quick<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.989> is<00:00:35.110> just<00:00:35.200> a<00:00:35.320> match<00:00:35.470> that<00:00:35.680> I<00:00:35.770> wanted

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
quick this is just a match that I wanted

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.080 
quick this is just a match that I wanted
to<00:00:36.100> commentate<00:00:36.460> even<00:00:36.700> though<00:00:36.760> it's<00:00:36.880> not<00:00:36.910> very

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
to commentate even though it's not very

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.280 
to commentate even though it's not very
good<00:00:37.210> so<00:00:37.390> I<00:00:37.570> thought<00:00:37.720> this<00:00:37.840> would<00:00:37.899> be<00:00:38.140> a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
good so I thought this would be a

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.970 
good so I thought this would be a
perfect<00:00:38.829> moment<00:00:39.809> because<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:41.530> enemy<00:00:41.829> team

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
perfect moment because the enemy team

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.650 
perfect moment because the enemy team
actually<00:00:42.250> gets<00:00:42.760> so<00:00:42.940> pissed<00:00:43.180> off<00:00:43.300> that<00:00:43.360> we're

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
actually gets so pissed off that we're

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.110 
actually gets so pissed off that we're
raping<00:00:43.840> them<00:00:44.050> so<00:00:44.230> bad<00:00:44.440> that<00:00:44.980> all<00:00:45.610> of<00:00:45.820> them

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
raping them so bad that all of them

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.060 
raping them so bad that all of them
leave<00:00:46.390> and<00:00:46.660> it<00:00:46.750> causes<00:00:47.140> them<00:00:47.380> to<00:00:47.410> forfeit<00:00:47.830> so<00:00:47.860> I

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
leave and it causes them to forfeit so I

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.200 
leave and it causes them to forfeit so I
thought<00:00:48.220> this<00:00:48.340> would<00:00:48.400> be<00:00:48.520> kind<00:00:48.910> of<00:00:48.940> a<00:00:49.000> funny

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
thought this would be kind of a funny

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.160 
thought this would be kind of a funny
game<00:00:49.450> to<00:00:50.020> put<00:00:50.200> up<00:00:50.320> with<00:00:50.940> some<00:00:51.940> commentary<00:00:52.450> but

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
game to put up with some commentary but

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.870 
game to put up with some commentary but
I<00:00:53.230> guess<00:00:53.590> you<00:00:53.620> can<00:00:53.860> consider<00:00:53.980> this<00:00:54.310> an<00:00:54.550> episode

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
I guess you can consider this an episode

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.910 
I guess you can consider this an episode
of<00:00:54.910> how<00:00:55.090> to<00:00:55.150> bone<00:00:55.390> because<00:00:55.720> we<00:00:55.870> end<00:00:56.020> up<00:00:56.140> owning

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
of how to bone because we end up owning

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.040 
of how to bone because we end up owning
them<00:00:57.160> as<00:00:57.310> a<00:00:57.340> team<00:00:57.430> so<00:00:57.610> hard<00:00:58.000> that<00:00:58.150> they<00:00:58.300> decide

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
them as a team so hard that they decide

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.210 
them as a team so hard that they decide
that<00:00:59.170> it's<00:00:59.290> good<00:00:59.440> idea<00:00:59.680> that<00:00:59.920> they<00:01:00.010> should

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
that it's good idea that they should

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.219 
that it's good idea that they should
just<00:01:00.400> leave<00:01:00.550> all<00:01:00.850> of<00:01:01.120> them<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:03.579> I<00:01:03.960> hate<00:01:04.960> saying

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
just leave all of them but I hate saying

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.109 
just leave all of them but I hate saying
update<00:01:05.710> video<00:01:05.979> so<00:01:06.340> this<00:01:06.490> isn't<00:01:06.729> an<00:01:06.820> update

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
update video so this isn't an update

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.969 
update video so this isn't an update
video<00:01:07.240> but<00:01:07.570> this<00:01:07.689> is<00:01:07.810> just<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:08.229> video<00:01:08.680> to<00:01:08.860> let
