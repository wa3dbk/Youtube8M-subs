this<00:02:00.410> is<00:02:00.470> certainly<00:02:01.280> not<00:02:01.490> something<00:02:01.700> that<00:02:02.000> we

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
this is certainly not something that we

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.880 
this is certainly not something that we
have<00:02:02.270> seen<00:02:02.480> before<00:02:02.870> but<00:02:03.140> pantech<00:02:03.620> always

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
have seen before but pantech always

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.440 
have seen before but pantech always
likes<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.160> jazz<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:04.700> up<00:02:04.790> a<00:02:04.940> little<00:02:05.060> bit<00:02:05.270> with

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
likes to jazz it up a little bit with

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.270 
likes to jazz it up a little bit with
their<00:02:05.600> designs<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:06.500> we<00:02:06.860> like<00:02:07.010> to<00:02:07.040> see

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
their designs so we like to see

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.850 
their designs so we like to see
something<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.640> bit<00:02:07.760> different<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.860> frankly

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
something a bit different and frankly

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.530 
something a bit different and frankly
looking<00:02:10.490> at<00:02:10.610> now<00:02:10.850> it<00:02:11.030> actually<00:02:11.120> kind<00:02:11.480> of

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
looking at now it actually kind of

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.900 
looking at now it actually kind of
reminds<00:02:11.870> me<00:02:11.990> of<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.500> Xperia<00:02:13.010> Arc<00:02:13.070> in<00:02:13.400> many

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
reminds me of the Xperia Arc in many

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.490 
reminds me of the Xperia Arc in many
ways<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:16.210> overall<00:02:17.210> I<00:02:17.510> love<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.140> design<00:02:18.470> on

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
ways so overall I love the design on

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.250 
ways so overall I love the design on
this<00:02:18.980> very<00:02:19.940> very<00:02:20.270> new<00:02:20.450> very<00:02:20.660> fresh<00:02:20.990> let<00:02:21.170> me

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
this very very new very fresh let me

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.690 
this very very new very fresh let me
wipe<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.800> off<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:22.070> you<00:02:22.160> don't<00:02:22.340> see<00:02:22.460> all<00:02:22.580> the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
wipe that off so you don't see all the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.730 
wipe that off so you don't see all the
fingerprints<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.660> then<00:02:24.170> we'll<00:02:24.320> take<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.500> quick

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
fingerprints and then we'll take a quick

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.800 
fingerprints and then we'll take a quick
look<00:02:24.920> at<00:02:27.370> we'll<00:02:28.370> take<00:02:28.490> a<00:02:28.550> quick<00:02:28.760> look<00:02:28.940> at<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
look at we'll take a quick look at the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.480 
look at we'll take a quick look at the
software<00:02:30.350> here<00:02:30.680> now<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.890> big<00:02:31.250> thing<00:02:31.280> that

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
software here now the big thing that

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.280 
software here now the big thing that
pantech<00:02:31.940> is<00:02:32.060> pushing<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:33.020> easy

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
pantech is pushing is the easy

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.650 
pantech is pushing is the easy
experience<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:34.520> let's<00:02:34.700> pull<00:02:34.850> that<00:02:35.030> up<00:02:35.060> the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
experience so let's pull that up the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.360 
experience so let's pull that up the
easy<00:02:36.020> experience<00:02:36.290> we've<00:02:36.980> seen<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.160> before

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
easy experience we've seen that before

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.520 
easy experience we've seen that before
on<00:02:37.790> another<00:02:38.360> pantech<00:02:38.750> phone<00:02:38.900> called<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.230> Flex

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
on another pantech phone called the Flex

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.500 
on another pantech phone called the Flex
where<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.430> can<00:02:40.580> go<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:40.940> can<00:02:41.000> change<00:02:41.240> the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
basically change the launcher let's see

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.370 
basically change the launcher let's see
here<00:02:44.830> ok<00:02:45.830> yeah<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:46.610> we<00:02:46.670> can<00:02:46.820> go<00:02:46.940> in<00:02:47.120> here<00:02:47.380> Jace's

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
here ok yeah so we can go in here Jace's

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.930 
here ok yeah so we can go in here Jace's
launcher<00:02:48.740> to<00:02:48.830> something<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.160> lot<00:02:49.340> more<00:02:49.370> basic<00:02:49.910> a

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
launcher to something a lot more basic a

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.240 
launcher to something a lot more basic a
lot<00:02:50.060> more<00:02:50.209> simple<00:02:50.570> so<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:51.410> don't<00:02:51.590> have<00:02:51.740> all

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
lot more simple so you don't have all

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.010 
lot more simple so you don't have all
these<00:02:52.459> extra<00:02:52.820> icons<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:53.570> other<00:02:53.720> vacations

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020

just getting in the way so if you like
to<00:02:57.170> keep<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.440> basic<00:02:57.590> this<00:02:58.010> is<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.160> good<00:02:58.340> way<00:02:58.459> to

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
to keep it basic this is a good way to

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.940 
to keep it basic this is a good way to
go<00:02:58.780> as<00:02:59.780> you<00:02:59.900> can<00:03:00.020> see<00:03:00.170> there's<00:03:00.410> no<00:03:00.560> extra

homepages<00:03:01.430> ultimately<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.570> really<00:03:02.810> is<00:03:02.930> just<00:03:03.200> a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
homepages ultimately it really is just a

homepages ultimately it really is just a
launcher<00:03:04.550> and<00:03:04.700> then<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.180> have<00:03:05.330> of<00:03:05.510> course<00:03:05.690> a

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
launcher and then you have of course a

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.810 
launcher and then you have of course a
simplified<00:03:06.590> menu<00:03:06.770> that<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.459> would<00:03:07.580> see<00:03:07.790> on

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
simplified menu that you would see on

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.990 
simplified menu that you would see on
some<00:03:08.690> of<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.930> feature<00:03:09.620> phones<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.670> pen<00:03:10.850> sack
