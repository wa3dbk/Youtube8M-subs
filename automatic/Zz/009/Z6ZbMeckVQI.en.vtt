wanted<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.520> show<00:04:40.640> you<00:04:40.670> guys<00:04:40.880> a<00:04:40.940> little<00:04:41.150> bit<00:04:41.300> of

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
wanted to show you guys a little bit of

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.700 
wanted to show you guys a little bit of
the<00:04:41.450> functionality<00:04:42.140> with<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:42.410> painting

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
the functionality with the painting

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.080 
the functionality with the painting
frames<00:04:42.920> you<00:04:43.100> can<00:04:43.130> place<00:04:43.400> them<00:04:43.640> on<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.790> wall

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
frames you can place them on the wall

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.640 
frames you can place them on the wall
like<00:04:44.270> so<00:04:44.510> these<00:04:44.720> are<00:04:44.900> some<00:04:45.080> of<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.200> bordered

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
like so these are some of the bordered

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.320 
like so these are some of the bordered
ones<00:04:45.830> I<00:04:46.010> believe<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.520> four<00:04:47.270> tiered<00:04:47.810> quadruple

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
ones I believe the four tiered quadruple

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.630 
ones I believe the four tiered quadruple
but<00:04:50.330> also<00:04:50.750> if<00:04:50.990> you<00:04:51.590> don't<00:04:51.770> want<00:04:52.010> to<00:04:52.220> connect

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
but also if you don't want to connect

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.760 
but also if you don't want to connect
them<00:04:52.760> manually<00:04:53.240> like<00:04:53.660> this<00:04:53.960> of<00:04:54.350> course<00:04:54.410> you

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
them manually like this of course you

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.950 
them manually like this of course you
can<00:04:54.980> if<00:04:55.280> you<00:04:55.550> feel<00:04:55.790> if<00:04:56.000> you<00:04:56.120> feel<00:04:56.330> so<00:04:56.570> inclined

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
can if you feel if you feel so inclined

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.870 
can if you feel if you feel so inclined
you<00:04:57.170> can<00:04:57.290> do<00:04:57.410> different<00:04:57.590> patterns<00:04:57.860> of<00:04:58.280> you

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
you can do different patterns of you

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.690 
you can do different patterns of you
can't<00:04:59.150> just<00:04:59.420> use<00:04:59.630> some<00:05:00.020> regular<00:05:00.980> ones<00:05:01.280> and<00:05:01.520> it

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
can't just use some regular ones and it

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.150 
can't just use some regular ones and it
will<00:05:01.880> make<00:05:02.180> them<00:05:02.390> all<00:05:02.600> connect<00:05:03.470> up<00:05:03.620> real<00:05:03.920> nice

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
will make them all connect up real nice

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.040 
will make them all connect up real nice
and<00:05:04.340> neat<00:05:04.550> for<00:05:04.910> your<00:05:05.030> painting<00:05:05.390> so<00:05:05.780> now<00:05:05.900> that

we got some paintings on the wall we're
gonna<00:05:07.280> show<00:05:07.490> some<00:05:07.550> functionality<00:05:08.300> if<00:05:08.450> you

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
gonna show some functionality if you

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.940 
gonna show some functionality if you
just<00:05:08.750> want<00:05:08.930> to<00:05:08.990> do<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.140> little<00:05:09.320> one-by-one

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
that's fine you can of course make it

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.470 
that's fine you can of course make it
bigger<00:05:12.860> and<00:05:13.100> smaller<00:05:13.340> but<00:05:13.970> right<00:05:14.210> now<00:05:14.360> I'm

bigger and smaller but right now I'm
just<00:05:14.570> gonna<00:05:14.720> change<00:05:14.990> the<00:05:15.170> resolution<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:16.010> make

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
just gonna change the resolution to make

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.770 
just gonna change the resolution to make
it<00:05:16.250> look<00:05:16.400> a<00:05:16.490> little<00:05:16.640> bit<00:05:16.850> better<00:05:17.090> a<00:05:17.420> little<00:05:17.600> bit

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
it look a little bit better a little bit

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.570 
it look a little bit better a little bit
better<00:05:17.840> we're<00:05:18.140> painting<00:05:18.320> now<00:05:18.590> we're<00:05:19.250> gonna<00:05:19.340> do

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
better we're painting now we're gonna do

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.100 
better we're painting now we're gonna do
that<00:05:19.730> to<00:05:19.910> this<00:05:20.060> one<00:05:20.240> as<00:05:20.360> well<00:05:20.540> but<00:05:20.810> we're<00:05:20.930> also

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
that to this one as well but we're also

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.110 
that to this one as well but we're also
gonna<00:05:21.650> scale<00:05:22.040> it<00:05:22.160> up<00:05:22.280> you<00:05:22.610> can<00:05:22.760> pick<00:05:22.970> the

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
gonna scale it up you can pick the

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.480 
gonna scale it up you can pick the
corner<00:05:23.570> that<00:05:24.140> it<00:05:24.320> starts<00:05:24.680> from<00:05:24.890> you<00:05:25.160> can<00:05:25.340> also

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
corner that it starts from you can also

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.510 
corner that it starts from you can also
rotate<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.800> painting<00:05:27.800> around<00:05:27.920> which<00:05:28.340> I'll

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
rotate the painting around which I'll

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.330 
rotate the painting around which I'll
show<00:05:28.700> you<00:05:28.730> guys<00:05:29.000> that<00:05:29.270> in<00:05:29.330> just<00:05:29.600> a<00:05:29.720> second

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
show you guys that in just a second

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.490 
show you guys that in just a second
we're<00:05:31.340> gonna<00:05:31.430> up<00:05:31.640> the<00:05:31.760> resolution<00:05:32.290> rotate<00:05:33.290> it

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
we're gonna up the resolution rotate it

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.990 
we're gonna up the resolution rotate it
just<00:05:33.590> to<00:05:33.800> show<00:05:33.980> you<00:05:34.040> guys<00:05:34.510> what<00:05:35.510> it<00:05:35.630> does<00:05:37.000> stuff

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
just to show you guys what it does stuff

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.360 
just to show you guys what it does stuff
like<00:05:38.060> that<00:05:38.419> yep<00:05:39.290> so<00:05:39.590> you<00:05:39.650> can<00:05:39.860> turn<00:05:39.980> it<00:05:40.040> upside

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
like that yep so you can turn it upside

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.190 
like that yep so you can turn it upside
down<00:05:40.400> if<00:05:40.820> you<00:05:40.910> want<00:05:42.550> alright<00:05:43.550> so<00:05:43.940> that<00:05:44.450> is<00:05:44.480> a

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
down if you want alright so that is a

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.960 
down if you want alright so that is a
little<00:05:45.380> bit<00:05:45.620> on<00:05:45.770> the<00:05:45.950> panes<00:05:46.190> and<00:05:46.520> I<00:05:46.669> thought<00:05:46.910> I

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970
