here<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.139> are<00:00:13.170> at<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.650> world<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:14.160> gallop<00:00:14.490> ratio

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
here we are at the world of gallop ratio

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.980 
here we are at the world of gallop ratio
2006<00:00:17.119> I'm<00:00:18.119> going<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.330> show<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.570> couple<00:00:18.869> of

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
2006 I'm going to show you a couple of

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.439 
2006 I'm going to show you a couple of
stuff<00:00:19.199> here<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.439> Gala<00:00:19.619> bridge<00:00:19.800> 2006<00:00:20.490> we<00:00:21.240> have

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
stuff here in Gala bridge 2006 we have

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.340 
stuff here in Gala bridge 2006 we have
the<00:00:21.570> theme-park<00:00:21.810> mode<00:00:22.939> simulation<00:00:23.939> mode

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
the theme-park mode simulation mode

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.220 
the theme-park mode simulation mode
Dierks<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.560> mode<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.160> free<00:00:26.789> mode<00:00:26.990> now<00:00:27.990> I'm

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
Dierks is mode and free mode now I'm

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.560 
Dierks is mode and free mode now I'm
going<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.470> show<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.650> right<00:00:28.890> now<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
going to show you right now the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.880 
going to show you right now the
simulation<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.050> theme-park<00:00:31.320> mode<00:00:31.769> is

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
simulation of the theme-park mode is

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.580 
simulation of the theme-park mode is
like<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.130> story<00:00:32.430> mode<00:00:32.610> again

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
like the story mode again

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.569 
like the story mode again
simulation<00:00:34.590> mode<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.950> where<00:00:35.160> things<00:00:35.430> get

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
simulation mode is where things get

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.729 
simulation mode is where things get
really<00:00:35.640> cool<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.690> no<00:00:36.899> other<00:00:37.079> gallifrey<00:00:37.559> sure

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
really cool and no other gallifrey sure

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.580 
really cool and no other gallifrey sure
has<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.340> here<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.700> go<00:00:42.440> basically<00:00:43.440> an

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
has so here we go basically an

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.920 
has so here we go basically an
assimilation<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.610> simulation<00:00:45.149> mode<00:00:45.329> you

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
assimilation in the simulation mode you

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.139 
assimilation in the simulation mode you
can<00:00:46.200> customize<00:00:46.800> everything<00:00:47.100> when<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.940> say

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
can customize everything when I say

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.660 
can customize everything when I say
everything<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.719> mean<00:00:48.960> everything<00:00:49.520> let's<00:00:50.520> take

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
everything I mean everything let's take

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.119 
everything I mean everything let's take
a<00:00:50.700> look<00:00:50.910> here<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.079> three<00:00:52.379> categories<00:00:52.739> of

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
a look here you have three categories of

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.430 
a look here you have three categories of
the<00:00:53.250> race<00:00:53.399> edit<00:00:53.820> course<00:00:54.300> edit<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.750> jockey<00:00:55.050> edit

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the race edit course edit in jockey edit

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.590 
the race edit course edit in jockey edit
that<00:00:55.860> means<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.850> edit<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.239> races

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
that means that you can edit the races

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.840 
that means that you can edit the races
of<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.780> game<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.770> horses<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> game<00:00:59.579> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
of the game the horses in the game and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.100 
of the game the horses in the game and
the<00:00:59.940> jockey<00:01:00.180> I'll<00:01:01.020> show<00:01:01.230> an<00:01:01.320> example

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
the jockey I'll show an example

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.930 
the jockey I'll show an example
for<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.199> horses<00:01:05.240> let's<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:07.550> you<00:01:08.550> have<00:01:08.670> every

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.910 
for the horses let's see you have every
every<00:01:09.240> forceps<00:01:09.660> in<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> game<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.260> right<00:01:10.680> here

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
every forceps in the game is right here

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.760 
every forceps in the game is right here
and<00:01:11.280> guys<00:01:11.700> there<00:01:12.090> are<00:01:12.150> thousands<00:01:12.810> okay<00:01:13.500> we

a not saying that the other horses

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.749 
a not saying that the other horses
aren't<00:01:47.350> going<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:47.619> be<00:01:47.710> good<00:01:47.920> but<00:01:48.159> all<00:01:48.549> these

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
aren't going to be good but all these

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.609 
aren't going to be good but all these
horses<00:01:49.060> appear<00:01:49.479> that<00:01:49.719> have<00:01:49.869> access<00:01:50.320> beside

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
horses appear that have access beside

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.770 
horses appear that have access beside
their<00:01:50.799> names<00:01:50.979> are<00:01:51.520> super<00:01:52.030> superior<00:01:52.390> horses

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
their names are super superior horses

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.600 
their names are super superior horses
now<00:01:53.500> I'm<00:01:53.799> going<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.009> show<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:54.159> a<00:01:54.250> little<00:01:54.399> bit

of history right here now if you can see
I'm<00:01:57.969> on<00:01:58.420> this<00:01:58.630> horse<00:01:58.869> right<00:01:59.020> name<00:01:59.200> his<00:01:59.320> name<00:01:59.469> is

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
I'm on this horse right name his name is

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.090 
I'm on this horse right name his name is
big<00:01:59.740> type<00:01:59.979> right<00:02:00.520> up<00:02:00.640> here<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.570> it<00:02:02.500> says<00:02:02.560> names

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
big type right up here and it says names

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.840 
big type right up here and it says names
rank

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850

distance now under names can see right

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.270 
distance now under names can see right
there<00:02:10.349> his<00:02:11.349> name<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.560> Big<00:02:11.799> Time

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
there his name is Big Time

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.440 
there his name is Big Time
okay<00:02:13.319> so<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:15.340> means<00:02:15.489> s<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.670> Nate<00:02:15.940> obviously
