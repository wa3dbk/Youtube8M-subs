00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.589
 good, how did you ask or direct? 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.790
 little tone that cake too late but 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.190
 the executive is and then this is 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.330
 It's a flower, I have to put one 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.480
 good round 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.460
 there are several there really you choose 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.380
 What's better is that I bought this 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.400
 first they usually have a 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.170
 marquinha 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.269
 Only this one I'm not here to 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.990
 because otherwise it stays too long 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.260
 chocolate and then you end up in the game 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.020
 Wasting you can put it back but 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:45.920
 It's better the civilian continuum already have 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:01:06.869
 two for a little more on this one 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:01:12.680
 put and place it gives a 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:16.830
 so understood and come with the other part 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:20.070
 you turn around and do not try not to 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.689
 background without making a move that is 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.689
 here for side 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.640
 so who the chocolate 10 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.689
 it's 23 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:47.039
 done you'll get this mob 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:49.549
 and it will put in the freezer until 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:54.380
 White 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:57.000
 Then when you take it out it will be like this. 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.109
 you're going to actually be treated 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.490
 huh 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:06.979
 you take that first part comes with a 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:14.549
 finger you hold and with the other you pull 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:21.500
 her but easily without taking a 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:21.500
 background cone 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.420
 You're not going to take away 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:36.450
 there you can give yourself the precious rating 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.040
 break the window in thinking of her 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:47.069
 network again and comes with a filling of your 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.459
 Preferably in this case here it is 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.459
 Brigadeiro 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.400
 I put it there 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.900
 Then I'll look at another world. 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:16.830
 I usually think it looks like a 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.670
 It gets better for you to put who you 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.670
 will do like this 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.840
 put there is finite
