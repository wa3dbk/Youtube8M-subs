00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.990
 among non 20th century expression 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.010
 Japanese quality also meant that 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.719
 we now mean Chinese quality 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.670
 the Japanese have radically changed 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.760
 idea of ​​the quality of all of them 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.130
 manufactured products when possible 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.279
 this will happen from domestic 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.890
 products about the moment despite 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.670
 what domestic producers 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:32.430
 protein concentrates once or twice and miscalculated 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.070
 negative stereotype is possible 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.630
 the formation of such a situation 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.010
 contributed 70 percent 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.430
 Vara concentration of exact protein 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.290
 produced by hell factory but on 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.530
 Currently there are two more in Ukraine 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.350

 produced in Gadyach and Kharkov 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:56.010
 Yes, they are inferior to German ksb but in general they 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.420
 the quality is quite decent and if 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.239
 look at them appreciating the ratio 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.500
 price-quality products 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.600
 definitely deserves attention before 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.090

 kilogram batch number and expiration date 6 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.920
 months he has a shelf life 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.979
 protein and carbohydrate content and 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.979
 the energy value 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.539
 pull the string 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.220

 insert which contains protein 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.899
 concentrates 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.000
 using physical strength i extracted 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.850
 from this bag 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.789

 This small pouch is small 10 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.690
 kilogram of protein concentrate 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.350
 stirred and dissolved in a shaker 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:31.450

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:40.400
 This protein concentrate I personally 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:42.860
 drink have somewhere to July 14 to 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.460
 German is slightly better but German is much 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.150
