um let me first start off by talking
about<00:00:05.960> my<00:00:06.200> hair<00:00:06.380> a<00:00:06.410> little<00:00:06.560> bit<00:00:06.770> so<00:00:06.980> I<00:00:07.460> took<00:00:07.610> my

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
about my hair a little bit so I took my

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.449 
about my hair a little bit so I took my
braids<00:00:08.149> down<00:00:08.330> a<00:00:08.389> few<00:00:08.599> days<00:00:08.690> ago<00:00:08.870> and<00:00:09.230> my<00:00:10.190> hair

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:10.459 
braids down a few days ago and my hair

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.779 
braids down a few days ago and my hair
grew<00:00:10.820> a<00:00:11.089> lot<00:00:11.660> in<00:00:12.049> just<00:00:12.769> a<00:00:12.919> week<00:00:13.099> it's<00:00:13.369> grown<00:00:13.700> a

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:13.789 
grew a lot in just a week it's grown a

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.010 
grew a lot in just a week it's grown a
lot<00:00:13.940> so<00:00:15.400> with<00:00:16.400> that<00:00:16.550> said<00:00:16.850> the<00:00:17.360> growth<00:00:17.660> that<00:00:17.990> I

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
lot so with that said the growth that I

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.820 
lot so with that said the growth that I
had<00:00:18.320> has<00:00:18.920> been<00:00:18.950> awkward<00:00:19.400> because<00:00:20.360> it's<00:00:20.830> longer

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
had has been awkward because it's longer

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.730 
had has been awkward because it's longer
on<00:00:22.010> the<00:00:22.220> side<00:00:22.490> and<00:00:23.150> shorter<00:00:23.780> at<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:24.020> top<00:00:24.290> and

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
on the side and shorter at the top and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.550 
on the side and shorter at the top and
I'm<00:00:24.920> not<00:00:25.340> necessarily<00:00:25.520> sure<00:00:25.970> if<00:00:26.450> it's<00:00:26.660> that

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
I'm not necessarily sure if it's that

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.279 
I'm not necessarily sure if it's that
much<00:00:27.860> longer<00:00:28.130> um<00:00:28.610> but<00:00:29.539> my<00:00:29.690> curls<00:00:30.080> are<00:00:30.170> like

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
much longer um but my curls are like

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.960 
much longer um but my curls are like
looser<00:00:30.650> on<00:00:30.680> the<00:00:30.920> side<00:00:31.100> so<00:00:31.400> it<00:00:31.490> hangs<00:00:31.730> out

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
looser on the side so it hangs out

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.270 
looser on the side so it hangs out
longer<00:00:32.450> and<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:32.750> top<00:00:33.020> is<00:00:33.050> more<00:00:33.470> compact

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
longer and the top is more compact

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.700 
longer and the top is more compact
unless<00:00:34.670> I<00:00:34.880> you<00:00:35.600> know<00:00:35.720> stretch<00:00:36.140> it<00:00:36.290> out

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
unless I you know stretch it out

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.300

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.390 
make it
so<00:04:01.660> um<00:04:02.660> been<00:04:03.440> action<00:04:03.830> was<00:04:03.920> probably<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.280> best

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
so um been action was probably the best

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.009 
so um been action was probably the best
decision<00:04:04.580> I've<00:04:04.880> ever<00:04:05.000> made<00:04:05.269> with<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.780> glowing

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
decision I've ever made with a glowing

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.650 
decision I've ever made with a glowing
natural<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:07.070> process<00:04:07.549> was<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:08.299> wasn't

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
natural the process was it wasn't

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.589 
natural the process was it wasn't
difficult<00:04:08.840> you<00:04:09.290> just<00:04:09.730> you<00:04:10.730> are<00:04:10.760> you've

difficult you just you are you've

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.690 
difficult you just you are you've
realized<00:04:11.959> so<00:04:12.170> much<00:04:12.349> more<00:04:12.650> about<00:04:12.950> yourself<00:04:13.400> and

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
realized so much more about yourself and

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.300 
realized so much more about yourself and
you<00:04:13.849> wanted<00:04:14.090> to

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
you wanted to

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.400 
you wanted to
better<00:04:14.459> care<00:04:14.760> of<00:04:14.790> your<00:04:15.150> whole<00:04:15.420> body<00:04:15.959> whole

everything because you I don't know why

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.780 
everything because you I don't know why
it<00:04:20.220> just<00:04:20.430> think<00:04:20.639> it<00:04:20.940> just<00:04:21.209> goes<00:04:21.420> together<00:04:21.690> so

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
it just think it just goes together so

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.720 
it just think it just goes together so
yes<00:04:23.790> I<00:04:24.150> would<00:04:24.450> recommend<00:04:24.650> go<00:04:25.650> natural<00:04:26.160> do<00:04:26.580> your
