00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hi guys how are you I hope you are 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.000
 very, very well and today I bring you a 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.519
 tutorial for those people who do not 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.250
 like to go out and get food in 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.370
 minecraft tutorial farm 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.720
 very effective fish 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:26.320
 the materials will be 23 down a poster 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.320
 a bucket of water the wooden hills 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.489
 and a fishing rod and good guys what 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.910
 first thing we have to do would be 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.420
 use these three casualties put seven 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.420
 berries here 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.980
 now put a block of wood here 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:54.360
 another block of wood here 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:58.370
 go go and start 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.370
 to go through one 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:06.089
 7 others always notice that the 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.089
 sides have to be 8 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.159
 on this side I would also have to 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.210
 be in the same way 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.820
 and since this one has another they are the same 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.210
 very well 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.780
 now these two blocks we take them out and 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.940
 we put 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.830
 a block here 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.680
 this 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.680
 and today there is no room for a fence 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.390
 and the poster 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.280
 also on our tip 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.280
 and the only thing we lack 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:51.040
 the water the block quoted from water and how 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.930
 they see a part as it is loose 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.730
 I had done every demonstration 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.510
 and good guys let's see if it works 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:04.190
 what you have to do would be to give yourself 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:09.590
 mind that they work pulling the cane between 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.590
 these two bases are creative 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.290
 fail stirrup we would have to do 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.829
 would be to locate them 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.590
 this first and the second in the third 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:26.890
 between the second drop between the third 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.579
 fence we would have to give the cane 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.579
 fish nearby 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.710
 as in what was here floating to give 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.900
 realize that it works 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:43.379
 you have to see if there are particles in the air 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.239
 I do not know I do not know if we can see but 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.160
 there are particles in the air as if 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.160
 had before times 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.580
 and good now we have to wait come there 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:59.340
 a line like belgium fortis is approaching 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.760
 making the best food in kraft 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.480
 and the truth is that if he stayed here a lot 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.340
 time can not work 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.340
 start realizing that it works 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.870
 to realize that they will be able to fish 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.870
 and in what to see only 100 particles 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.160
 near there are fish particles like 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.400
 Water 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.710
 there are droplets in the sky 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.200
 because they work and they will see 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.200
 a line that was coming that would be 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.460
 the fish as you see it now itches and what 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.040
 we grab and it's a common fish 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.250
 and good guys can also fish 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.070
 salmon and new foods as you know 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.830
 these only work for 1.7 and the 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.930
 1.6 I think that too but it's just going to 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.330
 Give fish can also give you books 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.730
 delighted and can also give you name 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.569
 tax 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.730
 It would be to be able to name your 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.860
 pets or whatever you want and 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.629
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:09.209
 I hope it has served you and as you know 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:11.970
 for the sky what is very useful this for 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.430
 a sky block 1.7 in which you will be able 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.459
 get many good things I hope that 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.150
 they liked life favorites and 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.250
