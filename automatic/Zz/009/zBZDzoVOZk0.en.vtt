00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.869
 on the passage we find some map 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.960
 I play on version 147 so we are looking for this 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:16.979
 version of 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:19.259

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.909
 card on the passage with the young hour this 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.439
 the map is too interesting not to come 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.020
 and 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.780
 of too beautiful and not to forget but 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.850
 we download that release of belts and therefore 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.009
 download new adventures jiva our 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:40.259
 most familiar card on the old channel i 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:42.590
 did video reviews on adventure cards 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.939
 Jinga pretty good card 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.040
 mice do not turn off and we just 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:55.079
 we close on we turn off we extract files 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:58.340
 of the pictures for this we need it so 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.340
 open the screen 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.930
 we will need a safe folder for this 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:11.860
 open what we got from the archive 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.440
 here and there we have two max folders and 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.360
 Jim's adventures we only need one of 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.500
 of these folders so we move the folder 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.120
 Jim's adventures in a safe box 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.980
 when we moved it all we have 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.600
 map on the passage but we have not yet 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.670
 I finished you promised to show only 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.170
 slightly textured 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.519
 enable texture pack twice as easy 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.769
 than download maps for passing for 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.430
 all we need is a department 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.430
 texture pack 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.430
 when we found the texture pack choose 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.970
 any texture for which you will need 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.030
 which you like and your version but 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:56.080
 I have this version 147 so I want 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.989
 find a cool texture pack 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.260
 which I really like it for me 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:05.500

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.810
 texture pack i like let's 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:14.650
 we download it we save on a desktop 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.079
 we wait while to boot everything in principle at 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.870
 we have and texture pack we only need 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.070
 extract files from it and move to 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.549
 folder tag soup ox 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:29.829
 it's very easy to find the textures folder 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:32.650
 pak that's the texture pac we already have one 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:38.530
 texture pack but we move one more 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:42.430
 year the sea well so that you were textured 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.440
 without lags you need to download 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.370
 textures by order of this, I'll show you already in 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:52.269

 the last time I stayed so they 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:04.410
 first we check our textures 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:07.810
 texture packs and we have a tag 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.930

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.670
 lags you can go and what cards 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.099

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.280
 just need to check whether our 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.410

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.770

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.970
 David 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.510
 Interestingly need more about this 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.570

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.840
 everything about this museum 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:46.900
 so we have a block of which consisted of sex 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.729
 the galleon palace block of which stood 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:56.410
 first before the night was going to bend three 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:06:00.419
 pyramids night so where and then so it 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:06.789
 as I understand this friend is so worth the chest 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:07.200
 there is a book of dialogs of scientists hello your 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:10.060
 friend 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.979
 the guide from the bottom said you need 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:16.000
 know about this place history yes it is so 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:17.530
 about it to the feet so yes it is so then 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.570
 tell me about the curse that lies 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.510
 on this museum on it is still in the news 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.039
 spoke stands up damn really 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.040
 exists to strong 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:27.200
 there is 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.290
 I studied this place for a long time until 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.120
 The construction of the museum has not begun but 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.580
 modern excavations left alone 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.500
 tunnel and that historian click on the lever and 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:43.090
 on the first floor will open the entrance to the tunnel 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:48.590
 there she says so now here he is a lever 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:54.020
 yes now it seems to me that everyone has opened up 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:57.560
 we go down I think I will pass 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.570
 only the first part of the card the second part 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:05.360
 cards i will 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:10.640
 Substitute in the second already was part 2 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:14.240
 divide them so now we need 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.860
 some kind of secret move so let's 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.240
 agree with these scientists again 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.240
 some kind of secret move will open 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:27.889
 click on the lever and on the first floor 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:34.180
 the entrance to the tunnel will open there the food says 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:40.340
 that's needed to cover the adhesive on the first floor here 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:41.659
 where will we find him then let's find 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.469
 tunnel and 

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:46.759
 I think we will finish the network so friends 

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:51.889
 found this tunnel 

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:54.680
 here it is a strange way he was 

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:55.659
 here and here we need to say 

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.270
 restore it 

00:07:55.659 --> 00:08:01.839
 Well, I think on this I will finish the passage 

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:05.240
 this half of the map because 

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:08.210
 I need to make shorter time 

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.749
 well everybody thanks for watching you 

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.319
