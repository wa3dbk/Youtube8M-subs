00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
have RCA inputs reline level in you can

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.620 
have RCA inputs reline level in you can
put<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.740> phase<00:00:26.220> out<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.550> phase<00:00:26.789> zero<00:00:27.150> 180

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
put it in phase out of phase zero 180

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.099 
put it in phase out of phase zero 180
degrees<00:00:28.039> you've<00:00:29.039> got<00:00:29.220> your<00:00:29.369> crossover

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
degrees you've got your crossover

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.780 
degrees you've got your crossover
crossover<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.710> what<00:00:31.890> frequency<00:00:32.640> does

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
crossover is that what frequency does

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.209 
crossover is that what frequency does
the<00:00:33.270> subwoofer<00:00:33.630> kind<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.870> kick<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:35.070> right

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
the subwoofer kind of kick in so right

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.270 
the subwoofer kind of kick in so right
now<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.399> have<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> hit<00:00:35.910> set<00:00:36.239> at<00:00:36.360> about<00:00:36.570> 75

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
now I have a hit set at about 75

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.619 
now I have a hit set at about 75
anything<00:00:38.280> below<00:00:38.520> that's<00:00:38.730> where<00:00:39.000> where<00:00:39.540> it

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
anything below that's where where it

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.979 
anything below that's where where it
comes<00:00:39.780> down<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.140> your<00:00:40.290> volume<00:00:40.410> switch

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
comes down you have your volume switch

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.170 
comes down you have your volume switch
the<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.379> sub<00:00:43.559> has<00:00:43.710> 100<00:00:44.070> watts<00:00:44.280> power<00:00:44.579> which

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
the the sub has 100 watts power which

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.090 
the the sub has 100 watts power which
may<00:00:45.360> not<00:00:45.480> sound<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.930> whole<00:00:46.230> heck<00:00:46.440> blab<00:00:46.710> it

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
may not sound like a whole heck blab it

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.290 
may not sound like a whole heck blab it
actually<00:00:47.730> quite<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> bit<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.450> power<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:51.030> does

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
actually quite a bit of power so it does

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.069 
actually quite a bit of power so it does
have<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.920> pretty<00:00:52.920> good<00:00:53.010> little<00:00:53.129> kick<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:54.079> it

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
have a pretty good little kick to it it

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.229 
have a pretty good little kick to it it
puts<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.469> here<00:00:55.739> for<00:00:56.430> subwoofer<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.090> is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
puts in here for subwoofer and this is

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.270 
puts in here for subwoofer and this is
so<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.199> speaker<00:00:58.500> actually<00:00:58.620> performs<00:00:59.160> in

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
so this the speaker actually performs in

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.540 
so this the speaker actually performs in
stereo<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.600> typically<00:01:01.320> your<00:01:01.620> your<00:01:01.980> output

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
stereo so typically your your output

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.880 
stereo so typically your your output
from<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:02.820> stereos<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.750> one<00:01:04.140> so

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
from your stereos and I have one so

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.870 
from your stereos and I have one so
you're<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.159> need<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.460> buy<00:01:05.580> something

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
you're going to need to buy something

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.880 
you're going to need to buy something
like<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.299> which<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.659> splitter<00:01:07.080> where<00:01:07.740> you

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
like this which is a splitter where you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.380 
like this which is a splitter where you
can<00:01:08.040> put<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.400> into<00:01:08.549> both<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.000> left<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.270> right

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
can put it into both the left and right

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.230 
can put it into both the left and right
channels<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.560> your<00:01:10.770> subwoofer<00:01:11.100> will<00:01:11.970> act<00:01:12.119> in

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
channels so your subwoofer will act in

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.630 
channels so your subwoofer will act in
stereo<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.960> keep<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.740> mind<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.159> will

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
stereo so keep that in mind you will

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.210 
stereo so keep that in mind you will
need<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.939> buy<00:01:15.119> RCA<00:01:15.930> splitter<00:01:16.409> such<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:17.040> this

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
need to buy RCA splitter such as this

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.340 
need to buy RCA splitter such as this
yeah<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.970> speaker<00:01:18.630> itself<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.080> fired

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
yeah the speaker itself is fired

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.580 
yeah the speaker itself is fired
directly<00:01:19.710> down<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> no

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
directly down so you have a no

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.990 
directly down so you have a no
protection<00:01:23.100> here<00:01:23.250> no<00:01:23.400> kind<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.670> grating

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
something through the actual subwoofer

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.649 
something through the actual subwoofer

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.660 
you get a lot of your bass response so
you<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.869> part<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.920> going<00:01:44.130> down<00:01:44.189> your

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
you have part of it going down your

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.730 
you have part of it going down your
frequency<00:01:45.030> down<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.479> then<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
frequency down and then you have the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.260 
frequency down and then you have the
port<00:01:47.040> kicking<00:01:47.579> out<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:49.579> yeah<00:01:50.579> people<00:01:51.119> are

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
port kicking out so yeah people are

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.319 
port kicking out so yeah people are
commenting<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.350> kind<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.619> large<00:01:52.829> well

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
commenting that it's kind of large well

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.830 
commenting that it's kind of large well
in<00:01:54.329> order<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.840> get<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.170> big<00:01:56.090> waves<00:01:57.090> frequency

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
in order to get the big waves frequency

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.300 
in order to get the big waves frequency
waves<00:01:58.079> are<00:01:58.259> coming<00:01:58.500> out<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.829> low<00:01:59.070> bass

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
waves are coming out in this low bass

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.639 
waves are coming out in this low bass
the<00:02:00.180> unit<00:02:00.450> actually<00:02:00.540> has<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.930> be<00:02:00.990> relatively

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the unit actually has to be relatively

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.730 
the unit actually has to be relatively
good<00:02:01.920> size<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:03.600> not<00:02:03.869> out<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.140> proportion

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
good size so it's not out of proportion

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.620 
good size so it's not out of proportion
for<00:02:04.890> what<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.189> would<00:02:05.280> expect<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.450> decent

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
for what you would expect for a decent

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.650 
for what you would expect for a decent
dead<00:02:06.930> subwoofer<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.940> might<00:02:09.119> be<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.300> little

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
dead subwoofer so it might be a little

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.960 
dead subwoofer so it might be a little
larger<00:02:09.869> than<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.560> want<00:02:10.890> but<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.580> be<00:02:11.670> honest

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
larger than you want but to be honest

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.580 
larger than you want but to be honest
it's<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.599> size<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.989> needs<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.260> be

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
it's the size it needs to be

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.640 
it's the size it needs to be
bbl<00:02:14.129> balboa<00:02:15.000> sub-10<00:02:15.720> does<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> very<00:02:16.440> good<00:02:16.590> job

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
bbl balboa sub-10 does a very good job

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.790

if<00:02:17.099> you<00:02:17.670> keep<00:02:17.819> with<00:02:18.000> Linux<00:02:18.300> expectations<00:02:18.989> it

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
if you keep with Linux expectations it

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.619 
if you keep with Linux expectations it
is<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.920> 10<00:02:20.160> inch<00:02:20.190> subwoofer<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:20.970> therefore<00:02:21.330> it

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
is a 10 inch subwoofer so therefore it

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.490 
is a 10 inch subwoofer so therefore it
performs<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.860> such<00:02:23.069> if<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.610> want<00:02:24.000> real<00:02:24.900> deep

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
performs the such if you want real deep

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.040 
performs the such if you want real deep
deep<00:02:26.099> bass<00:02:26.550> if<00:02:26.879> you're<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.090> fan<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.480> maybe<00:02:27.750> past

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
to it real loud this will probably

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.770 
to it real loud this will probably
underperform<00:02:35.160> what<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.519> need<00:02:35.700> however<00:02:36.599> if

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
underperform what you need however if

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.630 
underperform what you need however if
you're<00:02:36.930> using<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.319> as<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.440> subwoofer<00:02:38.129> for<00:02:38.459> your

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
you're using it as a subwoofer for your

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.640 
you're using it as a subwoofer for your
home<00:02:39.330> entertainment<00:02:39.690> center<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.379> is<00:02:40.500> going

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
home entertainment center this is going

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.619 
home entertainment center this is going
to<00:02:40.709> be<00:02:40.799> more<00:02:41.580> than<00:02:41.730> enough<00:02:41.849> I<00:02:42.269> think<00:02:42.420> it's

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
to be more than enough I think it's

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.380 
to be more than enough I think it's
going<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.900> sound<00:02:43.019> good<00:02:43.760> with<00:02:44.760> most<00:02:45.030> music

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
going to sound good with most music

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.520 
going to sound good with most music

you played it very high volumes this is

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.309 
you played it very high volumes this is
going<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.290> work<00:02:49.319> out<00:02:49.670> fantastic

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
going to work out fantastic

other people mention you know again it's
a<00:02:54.299> little<00:02:54.390> large<00:02:54.720> but<00:02:54.989> I<00:02:55.170> think<00:02:55.470> it's<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.739> size

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
a little large but I think it's the size

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.030 
a little large but I think it's the size
it<00:02:56.160> needs<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.489> be<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.090> in<00:02:58.079> order<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.440> have<00:02:58.620> good

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
it needs to be so in order to have good

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.949 
it needs to be so in order to have good
accurate<00:02:59.700> representation<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.450> low

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.809 
accurate representation of low
frequencies<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:02.129> need<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.370> be<00:03:02.459> able<00:03:02.549> to<00:03:02.670> move

a fair amount of air and that requires a
