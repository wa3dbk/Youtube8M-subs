00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.270 
necessarily love clothes um I just love
the<00:01:47.360> thought<00:01:47.599> of<00:01:47.659> design<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:48.259> like<00:01:48.799> the

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
the thought of design and like the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.669 
the thought of design and like the
meaning<00:01:49.610> of<00:01:49.700> art<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.149> commerce<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:50.869> that's

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
meaning of art and commerce and that's

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.389 
meaning of art and commerce and that's
pretty<00:01:51.979> much<00:01:52.099> where<00:01:52.340> fashion<00:01:52.549> is<00:01:53.409> so<00:01:54.409> I<00:01:54.890> went

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
pretty much where fashion is so I went

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.789 
pretty much where fashion is so I went
to<00:01:55.579> design<00:01:55.759> school<00:01:55.939> I<00:01:56.299> figured<00:01:56.689> if<00:01:57.289> it<00:01:57.470> doesn't

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
to design school I figured if it doesn't

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.139 
to design school I figured if it doesn't
work<00:01:57.920> I<00:01:58.099> can<00:01:58.280> always<00:01:58.459> go<00:01:58.670> back<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.880> law<00:01:59.119> school

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
work I can always go back to law school

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.319 
work I can always go back to law school
and<00:01:59.860> that's<00:02:00.860> pretty<00:02:01.549> much<00:02:01.700> how<00:02:01.909> I<00:02:01.939> ended<00:02:02.209> up

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
and that's pretty much how I ended up

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.279 
and that's pretty much how I ended up
here<00:02:03.219> no<00:02:04.219> I<00:02:04.250> think<00:02:04.459> so<00:02:04.849> many<00:02:05.030> people<00:02:05.209> like<00:02:05.899> go

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
here no I think so many people like go

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.020 
here no I think so many people like go
through<00:02:06.319> situations<00:02:06.770> where<00:02:07.610> they're<00:02:07.819> like

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
through situations where they're like

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.400 
through situations where they're like
you<00:02:08.179> know<00:02:08.209> I<00:02:08.299> really<00:02:08.569> want<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.780> do<00:02:08.929> this<00:02:08.959> and

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
you know I really want to do this and

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.779 
you know I really want to do this and
then<00:02:09.530> they<00:02:09.679> feel<00:02:09.860> unsure<00:02:10.099> and<00:02:10.549> then<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.759> other

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
then they feel unsure and then the other

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.180 
then they feel unsure and then the other
finding<00:02:11.480> their<00:02:12.079> passion<00:02:12.799> so<00:02:13.010> that's

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
finding their passion so that's

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.069 
finding their passion so that's
definitely<00:02:13.400> something<00:02:13.819> that<00:02:14.090> like<00:02:14.510> you're

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
definitely something that like you're

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.509

representing of you know I thought I

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:17.920
