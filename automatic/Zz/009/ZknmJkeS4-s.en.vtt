regions<00:02:02.049> we<00:02:02.200> had<00:02:02.319> an<00:02:02.469> ice<00:02:02.619> cave<00:02:02.890> over<00:02:03.219> there<00:02:03.249> we

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
regions we had an ice cave over there we

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.199 
regions we had an ice cave over there we
can<00:02:03.700> explore<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:05.710> got<00:02:05.859> some<00:02:06.100> snow<00:02:07.530> winter

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
can explore we got some snow winter

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.490 
can explore we got some snow winter
territory<00:02:10.209> this<00:02:10.450> direction<00:02:10.810> here<00:02:11.019> I<00:02:11.260> don't

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
territory this direction here I don't

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.020 
territory this direction here I don't
know<00:02:11.560> what<00:02:11.709> direction<00:02:11.860> is<00:02:12.220> at<00:02:12.400> where's<00:02:12.910> the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
know what direction is at where's the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.809 
know what direction is at where's the
Sun<00:02:13.239> Hat<00:02:13.620> where'd<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.739> sun<00:02:14.950> come<00:02:15.580> from

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
Sun Hat where'd the sun come from

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.380 
Sun Hat where'd the sun come from
alright<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.019> that<00:02:17.049> would<00:02:17.379> be<00:02:17.410> East<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:19.180> that's

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
alright so that would be East so that's

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.140 
alright so that would be East so that's
to<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.870> northeast<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.250> guess<00:02:21.430> northeast<00:02:21.910> or

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
to the northeast I guess northeast or

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.400 
to the northeast I guess northeast or
east<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:24.310> looks<00:02:24.459> pretty<00:02:24.670> cool<00:02:25.410> alright

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
east so this looks pretty cool alright

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.259 
east so this looks pretty cool alright
yeah<00:02:26.620> we'll<00:02:26.920> have<00:02:27.099> some<00:02:27.310> fun<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.790> there's<00:02:28.180> a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.559 

this<00:02:33.010> actually<00:02:33.250> isn't<00:02:33.549> turning<00:02:33.819> up<00:02:34.000> at<00:02:34.180> it

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
this actually isn't turning up at it

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.750 
this actually isn't turning up at it
some<00:02:34.750> bamboo<00:02:35.110> way<00:02:35.319> over<00:02:35.590> there<00:02:35.769> just<00:02:36.489> kind<00:02:36.730> of

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
some bamboo way over there just kind of

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.430 
some bamboo way over there just kind of
letting<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.120> world<00:02:37.390> randomly<00:02:37.900> generate<00:02:38.260> here

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
letting a world randomly generate here

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.559 
letting a world randomly generate here
so<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.650> guys<00:02:38.920> can<00:02:39.220> get<00:02:39.819> a<00:02:39.879> sense<00:02:40.120> of<00:02:40.269> where<00:02:40.450> I'm
