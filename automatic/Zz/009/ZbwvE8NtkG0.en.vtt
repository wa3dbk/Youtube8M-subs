stacking these ancients right here and
we're<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.259> able<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.469> do<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.740> from

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
we're going to be able to do this from

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.300 
we're going to be able to do this from
right<00:02:08.369> here<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.849> lot<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.360> heroes<00:02:09.660> will<00:02:09.810> do<00:02:10.080> this

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
right here a lot of heroes will do this

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.120 
right here a lot of heroes will do this
but<00:02:12.000> very<00:02:12.930> few<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.290> them<00:02:13.440> can<00:02:13.620> actually<00:02:13.890> do<00:02:14.040> it

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
but very few of them can actually do it

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.089 
but very few of them can actually do it
from<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.370> far<00:02:14.610> away<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:15.120> I'm<00:02:15.810> don't<00:02:16.530> think<00:02:16.920> I

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
from this far away and I'm don't think I

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.500

messed<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.550> up<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.910> think<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.180> did<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:18.330> it

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
messed that up I think I did that it

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.809 
messed that up I think I did that it
right<00:02:18.599> generally<00:02:19.230> around<00:02:19.319> 53<00:02:20.160> seconds<00:02:20.580> on<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
right generally around 53 seconds on the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
minute is one I'll throw my axis and you

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.520 
minute is one I'll throw my axis and you
can<00:02:23.880> see<00:02:24.090> we<00:02:24.540> have<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.720> nice<00:02:24.989> pretty<00:02:25.319> little

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
at level one I his mana pool obviously

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.750 
at level one I his mana pool obviously
it's<00:03:04.620> better<00:03:04.769> because<00:03:04.920> I'm<00:03:05.130> still<00:03:05.310> level<00:03:05.459> one
