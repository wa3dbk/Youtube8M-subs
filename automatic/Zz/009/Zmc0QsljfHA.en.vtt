compositing purposes we'll also talk
about<00:01:59.520> how<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.909> use<00:02:00.060> glow<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.689> flare

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
about how we can use glow and flare

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.920 
about how we can use glow and flare
effects<00:02:01.890> with<00:02:02.310> our<00:02:02.549> 3ds<00:02:03.000> max<00:02:03.299> objects<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
effects with our 3ds max objects and

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.410 
effects with our 3ds max objects and
we'll<00:02:04.530> also<00:02:04.649> learn<00:02:04.920> how<00:02:04.979> max<00:02:05.549> scripting<00:02:06.240> can

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
we'll also learn how max scripting can

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.930 
we'll also learn how max scripting can
be<00:02:06.509> used<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> create<00:02:06.990> dynamic<00:02:07.469> text<00:02:08.009> inside<00:02:08.759> of

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
be used to create dynamic text inside of

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.330 
be used to create dynamic text inside of
3ds<00:02:09.090> max<00:02:09.509> which<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.319> be<00:02:10.410> directly<00:02:10.890> controlled

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
3ds max which can be directly controlled

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.640 
3ds max which can be directly controlled
by<00:02:11.489> some<00:02:11.760> kind<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:11.940> an<00:02:12.060> external<00:02:12.510> database

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
by some kind of an external database

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.490 
by some kind of an external database
finally<00:02:14.430> Chris<00:02:14.819> our<00:02:15.180> VFX<00:02:15.780> instructor<00:02:16.260> will

finally Chris our VFX instructor will

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.929 
finally Chris our VFX instructor will
walk<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:16.890> through<00:02:17.129> some<00:02:17.310> compositing<00:02:17.909> and

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
walk you through some compositing and

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.429 
walk you through some compositing and
enhancement<00:02:18.750> techniques<00:02:19.079> that<00:02:19.170> we<00:02:19.260> can<00:02:19.409> use

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
enhancement techniques that we can use

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.530 
enhancement techniques that we can use
when<00:02:19.709> assembling<00:02:20.220> our<00:02:20.489> rendered<00:02:21.090> passes

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540
