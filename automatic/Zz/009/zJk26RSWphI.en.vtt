00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:10.160
 there are 3 2014 in hobby dotcom consoles 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.340
 it has been a very long day this is the 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.590
 fourth conference the day after 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.470
 those of microsoft electronic arts ubisoft 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.420
 and it's about the sony conference 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.820
 in which we have many 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.860
 hopes for all those rumors that 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.530
 have been leaking on the network yes 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.120
 well everyone seems to think that this is going to 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.220
 be the good of all the conferences 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.379
 although there has been a low level so 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.480
 general in this we have hopes of 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.920
 make new announcements so 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.989
 least because it 's something that has been very 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.940
 little in the other lectures seems 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.650
 that last year what was definitive 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.589
 was the announcement of the playstation price 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.720
 4 this year everyone expects that 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.510
 let's see uncharted 4 maybe a new 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.120
 software I do not know if you have any other 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.799
 bet hidden because not good has been 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.440
 discussed the issue of new new 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.030
 edition of battle royal that has 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.340
 surprised let's see what 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.140
 characters surprise us and if really 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.720
 will take advantage of the technology of play 4 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.460
 which would surprise me is not possible 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.320
 also be the first conference in the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.840
 that we see titles that are not just 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.780
 new generation but also from vita de 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.650
 playstation3 may even come back to 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.150
 tell us to say 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.190
 brass or do you think they are going to focus on 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.110
 the games I think they are going to go to sack 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.410
 for playstation 4 as he has done 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.670
 microsoft which has not talked about 360 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.590
 throughout the conference just talking about 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.270
 one and probably they are and although 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.470
 playstation3 comes to you is a tad more 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.450
 of life go to give him all the 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.520
 prominence to the catalog of weight 4 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.680
 because if they would not be as heavy 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.730
 of e3 well let's see what is it 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.730
 that they have to show us 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.570
 Well , the conference of 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.580
 sony and I have to say I do not know if to be 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.830
 very bad that less badly because it has 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.780
 fact really long not weak are and 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.420
 done exactly what you do not have to 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.580
 do in an e3 conference has been 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.620
 long to be the last the 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.660
 expectations were very high not 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.060
 we know if he has fulfilled them for everything 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.160
 the world and has also been entertained in 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.010
 talk about many things without going deeply 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.930
 in nothing if also good the majority of 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.520
 the games we have seen were 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.830
 expected or had already leaked 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.100
 directly as a metal gear trailer 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.690
 and others as destiny or as of the soups 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.660
 remaster well then we already know 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.640
 quite a lot of them I think actually 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.190
 surprises there have been very few 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.880
 I stay mostly with sj rpg of 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.490
 from software that is the blood born and that 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.500
 it was not part of a series of titles 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.030
 dark ones that have appeared on the 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.770
 conference 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.660
 that have given him a little bit of wine 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.819
 because then we have also had a lot 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.380
 independent game many many besides 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.630
 a huge court has been given to 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.640
 example to antwain that of course has 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.290
 a very interesting pint but I do not know 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.390
 if this conference is the right place 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.010
 to present it 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.920
 The same thing has happened to us 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.569
 littlebigplanet 3 where also the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.670
 embarrassing moment until now 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.319
 stress without and their own creators have 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.140
 known to control well so far I'm going to 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.600
 his new three friends and he has made a 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.050
 presentation a bit cumbersome friends 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.090
 precious but ridiculous presentation 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.709
 another big question was whether they are going to support 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.180
 playstation vita that how it was 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.890
 watching lately for the had a little 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.170
 on the side and good has supported her but 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.030
 medias does not have access to playstation 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.250
 swim and have a series of games 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.140
 small although they have mentioned that there 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.040
 more than 100 titles in development for the 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.140
 laptop 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.420
 not only that talking about hardware are and 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.430
 they have also shown us well above 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.120
 what can playstation tv and 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.459
 projector face also most of 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.810
 the games that were shown were 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.140
 multiplatform were trailers that were 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.209
 they knew titles like mortal kombat e x 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.100
 metal gear solid 'that we said that 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.790
 yesterday the trailer had been filtered 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.290
 farcry 4x4 destiny to start it was 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.540
 a title that was known to be 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.240
 could open this conference I think what 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.120
 better has reached the end if in the end 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.729
 we have been able 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.160
 something that was not the desire of many and that 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.560
 it seems that gta 5 has been met in 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.389
 playstation 4 version what good is the 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.090
 same game exactly but today in 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.070
 often play game often and beats of 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.900
 drum for the work the nottie 2 that 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.870
 we were waiting for all 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.639
 uncharted 4 a very short teaser but in 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.800
 which we have already seen the model of 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.650
 nathan drake and the scenarios he has 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.690
 an unbeatable pint the end of a 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.060
 thief is the subtitle of that uncharted 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.590
 4 but it's really the beginning of a 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.639
 lots of adventures that are yet to come 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.639
 to see if lucky
