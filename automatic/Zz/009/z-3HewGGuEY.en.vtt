to dive deeper into that to understand
things<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.560> what<00:01:08.369> attaches<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.570> what<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.080> if

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
things like what attaches to what so if

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.230 
things like what attaches to what so if
somebody<00:01:10.680> buys<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.700> steak

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
somebody buys the steak

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.240 
somebody buys the steak
what<00:01:12.810> alcoholic<00:01:13.320> beverages<00:01:13.770> do<00:01:13.950> they<00:01:14.070> buy

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
what alcoholic beverages do they buy

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.359 
what alcoholic beverages do they buy
with<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:15.110> they<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.140> also<00:01:16.439> understand<00:01:17.040> things

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
with it they can also understand things

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.109 
with it they can also understand things
like<00:01:17.759> when<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.920> implement<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.040> program<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.850> test

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
like when I implement a program and test

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.859 
like when I implement a program and test
it<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.479> certain<00:01:21.659> locations<00:01:22.610> training<00:01:23.610> my<00:01:23.869> my

environment<00:01:29.090> what<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.509> actually

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689

happens<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.619> those<00:01:31.829> attachments<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:32.939> see<00:01:33.150> a

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
happens to those attachments do we see a

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.469 
happens to those attachments do we see a
boost<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.780> attachments<00:01:34.770> or<00:01:35.100> not<00:01:35.430> well<00:01:36.119> by

boost in attachments or not well by

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
analyzing the transaction level detail I

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.170 
analyzing the transaction level detail I
can<00:01:39.420> get<00:01:39.750> insights<00:01:40.140> around<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:41.040> the
