shot<00:01:35.759> look<00:01:36.210> at<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.420> curve<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.020> thing<00:01:37.380> it

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
shot look at that curve on that thing it

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.240 
shot look at that curve on that thing it
is<00:01:38.030> ridiculous<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.270> think<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> curve<00:01:40.530> was<00:01:40.740> 81

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
is ridiculous I think the curve was 81

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.910 
is ridiculous I think the curve was 81
in<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.000> game<00:01:42.210> stats<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.229> seems<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.680> lot

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
in the in game stats but it seems a lot

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.649 
in the in game stats but it seems a lot
better<00:01:43.950> than<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.270> said<00:01:45.329> he's<00:01:45.540> got

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
better than that like I said he's got

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.120 
better than that like I said he's got
that<00:01:45.750> five-star<00:01:46.110> weak<00:01:46.350> foot<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:46.680> he<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.890> curve

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
that five-star weak foot so he can curve

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.370 
that five-star weak foot so he can curve
it<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.399> whichever<00:01:48.180> foot<00:01:48.600> he<00:01:48.750> wants<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.290> as

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
it with whichever foot he wants and as

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.749 
it with whichever foot he wants and as
you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.649> see<00:01:49.680> there<00:01:49.979> right<00:01:50.430> off<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
you can see there right off the
