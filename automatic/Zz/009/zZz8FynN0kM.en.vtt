as<00:00:03.480> you<00:00:04.480> go<00:00:04.660> faster<00:00:05.399> especially<00:00:06.399> as<00:00:06.939> you

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.090 
as you go faster especially as you

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.910 
as you go faster especially as you
approach<00:00:07.569> the<00:00:07.870> speed<00:00:07.990> of<00:00:08.230> light<00:00:08.260> time<00:00:08.680> slows

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:08.920 
approach the speed of light time slows

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.150 
approach the speed of light time slows
down<00:00:09.309> and<00:00:09.850> yes<00:00:10.420> you<00:00:10.450> heard<00:00:10.720> me<00:00:10.780> correctly<00:00:11.160> not

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 
down and yes you heard me correctly not

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.000 
down and yes you heard me correctly not
only<00:00:12.400> this<00:00:12.640> time<00:00:13.000> speed<00:00:13.450> down<00:00:13.690> your<00:00:14.650> weight

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.010 
only this time speed down your weight

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.900 
only this time speed down your weight
increases<00:00:16.000> and<00:00:16.680> your<00:00:17.680> length<00:00:18.070> shortens<00:00:18.730> the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
increases and your length shortens the

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.540 
increases and your length shortens the
direction<00:00:19.419> that<00:00:19.689> you<00:00:19.990> travel<00:00:21.839> therefore<00:00:22.839> if

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
direction that you travel therefore if

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.009 
direction that you travel therefore if
you're<00:00:24.550> in<00:00:24.669> that<00:00:24.820> rocket<00:00:25.269> ship<00:00:25.419> I<00:00:25.539> was<00:00:25.570> talking

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:26.019 
you're in that rocket ship I was talking

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.349 
you're in that rocket ship I was talking
about<00:00:26.259> and<00:00:26.529> you<00:00:26.730> start<00:00:27.730> approaching<00:00:28.060> the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
about and you start approaching the

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.109 
about and you start approaching the
speed<00:00:28.569> of<00:00:28.720> light<00:00:28.749> the<00:00:29.619> rocket<00:00:30.189> ship<00:00:30.519> and<00:00:30.759> the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
speed of light the rocket ship and the

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.790 
speed of light the rocket ship and the
reason<00:00:31.419> why<00:00:31.569> nothing<00:00:32.050> can<00:00:32.230> go<00:00:32.349> the<00:00:32.500> speed<00:00:32.710> of

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
reason why nothing can go the speed of

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.440 
reason why nothing can go the speed of
light<00:00:32.829> is<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.430> rocket<00:00:33.850> ship<00:00:34.120> will<00:00:34.300> get

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
light is the rocket ship will get

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.170 
light is the rocket ship will get
heavier<00:00:34.810> and<00:00:34.930> heavier<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:36.370> will<00:00:36.760> approach

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
heavier and heavier and will approach

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.320 
heavier and heavier and will approach
infinite<00:00:38.110> wait<00:00:38.920> no<00:00:39.580> force<00:00:39.880> to<00:00:40.060> move<00:00:40.090> it

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
infinite wait no force to move it

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.470 
infinite wait no force to move it
forward<00:00:40.800> furthermore<00:00:41.800> that<00:00:42.280> rocket<00:00:43.210> ship

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
forward furthermore that rocket ship

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.380 
forward furthermore that rocket ship
will<00:00:43.780> shrink<00:00:44.320> in<00:00:44.590> length<00:00:44.980> in<00:00:45.310> the<00:00:45.390> direction

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
will shrink in length in the direction

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.170 
will shrink in length in the direction
and<00:00:47.040> you<00:00:48.040> may<00:00:48.250> say<00:00:48.280> yeah<00:00:48.610> but<00:00:48.940> can<00:00:49.120> the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
and you may say yeah but can the

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.510 
and you may say yeah but can the
scientists<00:00:49.750> measure<00:00:50.080> that<00:00:50.350> I<00:00:50.620> say<00:00:51.160> the<00:00:51.340> only

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
scientists measure that I say the only

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.490 
scientists measure that I say the only
problem<00:00:51.910> is<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.270> ruler<00:00:52.660> you<00:00:52.840> took<00:00:53.020> along<00:00:53.230> with

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
problem is the ruler you took along with

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.180 
problem is the ruler you took along with
you<00:00:53.650> also<00:00:53.950> shrunk<00:00:54.700> in<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:54.880> same<00:00:55.090> proportion

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
you also shrunk in the same proportion

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.680 
you also shrunk in the same proportion
science<00:00:57.190> has<00:00:57.540> calculated<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.970> following<00:01:01.540> to
