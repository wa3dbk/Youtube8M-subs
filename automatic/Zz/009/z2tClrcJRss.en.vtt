 those vicious like me who are 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.660
 addicted to the empires and I gave them and they guessed right 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.390
 of not being able to expand, well, the 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.760
 solution comes to you right now in this 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.490
 simple but meaningful video gives 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.640
 good boy I will teach you how to 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.430
 make free expansions of zero coins 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.960
 zero bonds infinite good until it 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.730
 they finish the map if they get fed up 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.859
 true so the first thing they 're going to 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.859
 to do is open your facebook account 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:43.350
 suddenly 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.760
 ok here and typical do not open your empires 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.570
 daily 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.910
 in what this thing charges we are going to have 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.760
 that open the 7 15 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.040
 nothing but then they have to execute the 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.110
 administrator mode to find in 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.559
 the tricks if it's on windows if you say in 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.290
 xp is not so much problem ok I'm 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.710
 using firefox so good we have to 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.250
 get us here to the east and search 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.770
 to firefox but it is more recommendable 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.210
 choose the pool moo jin container if not 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.900
 they have it on a low the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.900
 anaphylaxis 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:27.560
 since highlighting a scan type they put 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:31.610
 good is the value and it puts the text 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.500
 ok and here it is already then once 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.500
 here you have already loaded all this 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.840
 this cataract will be 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.600
 although there is a time that everything is here 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.600
 this 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.690
 they will open the check-in and in text 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.690
 they put 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.600
 xk 0 1 and they give you are k 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.220
 As you can see many values ​​come out and for not 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.920
 walk choosing one by one they will have 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:17.430
 to apply the shift key 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.219
 followed by the shift key on your keyboard 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.780
 with that they select all and give them this 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:26.080
 little red arrow so you can pass 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:30.620
 work down here repeat the same 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.100
 endless end and they give you enter once with 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.320
 the enter here let's modify the value 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.680
 to xk 0 1 and we are going to add five 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.680
 zeros 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.610
 3. 4. 5 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.400
 we give it ok and since it changes the value that 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.300
 would be the first step now the next 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.340
 step will be to give you news car and here in 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.200
 the text bar we are going to change the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.520
 x 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.520
 0 1 x 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.670
 x 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:10.340
 0 1 very different thing but you can 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.340
 confuse and the cool ones again 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.290
 we grab these that are tiny and 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.970
 we give others to the arrow note that no 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.110
 you have to erase nothing of what you already 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:27.280
 you had done here then east x 0 1 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.800
 same is selected by all those 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.900
 the selections of the people 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.880
 and nothing else you change for X 10 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.890
 okay 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.890
 and with that check here 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.350
 I give the button to build in 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.660
 expansion and already ask me for zero bonds now 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.730
 but he's still asking for coins and 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.320
 how we want to do it for free the only thing 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.110
 what we have to do here is check 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.110
 this new scan and this time 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.760
 and this time 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.760
 here they are going to put the number of 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:10.459
 coins that they ask in my case are 100 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.459
 thousand 168 then we put that number here 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:18.819
 and we give him poisonous fishing to carry 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.660
 we give you select the value that 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:26.759
 came out the little red arrow goes down here 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:30.250
 you double click to see I close this 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:35.430
 click and that value we will change it for 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:39.060
 0 we accept and as you see here 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.620
 but zero coins bonds and already with this 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.120
 you can build your expansion where 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.880
 want 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.880
 where he built it here 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.320
 to this and as you can see the expansion is already 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.940
 there done now if they want to do another what 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.280
 of the bonds are no longer going to ask 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.140
 but he is going to ask for more coins 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.480
 then nothing else we are going to repeat the 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.360
 step that we made a while ago we are going to 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.120
 change if this is the value we had 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.260
 but let's give it in ska and we're going to 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.360
 put 102 666 that are the number of 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.890
 coins that you are asking me are you going 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.350
 to have to put the number of coins 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.630
 Ask them for the game 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.650
 again from the ones we wait for 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.650
 load all this 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.840
 we grab this we grab the value that does not 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:34.230
 come out here 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:39.190
 the little red arrow 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:42.340
 double click here and we change it for 0 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.310
 note that nothing here has deleted this 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.960
 keep constant this is still 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.100
 showing up but if I close it and what 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.530
 I open again 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.090
 as if by magic it disappears 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.330
 I give them all to build 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.190
 here and confirm and so can you do 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.610
 the rest of his long life until he 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.440
 finish on the map which itself is something 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.710
 It seems that it is impossible but with 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.120
 this trick will be easy and simple 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.770
 this I think it would be all follow 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.350
 enjoying this great game that we 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:17.910
 advise adapted to many by much 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:20.880
 time and that has been all comment what if 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.410
 have any questions ask less me 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.090
 I always answer the questions the 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.370
 most of the time because it is me 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.460
 boring but good this has been all for 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.460
 today
