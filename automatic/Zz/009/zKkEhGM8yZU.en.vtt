00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.990 
setting you got you can just customize
changing<00:02:34.560> your<00:02:34.710> date<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.250> time<00:02:35.460> for<00:02:35.970> the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
phone so the time you get the time zone

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.960 
phone so the time you get the time zone
that<00:02:41.580> they<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.600> date<00:02:42.870> format<00:02:43.580> how<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.640> want

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
get either an analog clock or a digital

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.750 
get either an analog clock or a digital
clock<00:02:56.180> also<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.510> alarm<00:02:57.810> tone<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.340> snooze

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
clock also the alarm tone and the snooze

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.320 
clock also the alarm tone and the snooze
snooze<00:03:00.570> time<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.780> then<00:03:04.500> if<00:03:05.430> well<00:03:05.880> the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
snooze time and then if well the

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.060 
snooze time and then if well the
automatic<00:03:06.810> time<00:03:07.020> update<00:03:07.440> that's<00:03:07.710> just

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
automatic time update that's just

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.620 
automatic time update that's just
basically<00:03:08.430> on<00:03:08.700> carry<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.300> time<00:03:11.210> setting<00:03:12.210> so

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
basically on carry a time setting so

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.610 
basically on carry a time setting so
usually<00:03:13.080> that's<00:03:13.230> always<00:03:13.500> on<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:16.470> get<00:03:16.590> the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
usually that's always on you get the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.010 
usually that's always on you get the
speed<00:03:18.770> this<00:03:19.770> allows<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.340> set<00:03:20.780> what<00:03:21.780> kind

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
speed this allows you to set what kind

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.680 
speed this allows you to set what kind
of<00:03:22.110> voice<00:03:22.440> recognition<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.700> want<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.360> voice

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
of voice recognition you want a voice

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.430 
of voice recognition you want a voice
tone<00:03:25.110> do<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.380> want<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:26.840> think<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:28.020> is<00:03:28.170> also

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
tone do you want I think this is also

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.150 
tone do you want I think this is also
the<00:03:28.560> same<00:03:28.860> for<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.160> GPS<00:03:30.110> setting<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.830> the

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
the same for the GPS setting the the

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:39.530 
the same for the GPS setting the the
voice<00:03:32.370> that<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:32.640> want<00:03:33.920> okay<00:03:35.660> so<00:03:38.030> now<00:03:39.030> let's<00:03:39.330> go

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
voice that you want okay so now let's go

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.320 
voice that you want okay so now let's go
back<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.320> language<00:03:40.610> so<00:03:41.610> there<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.150> can

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
back to the language so there you can

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.100 
back to the language so there you can
just<00:03:43.050> set<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.560> languages<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.520> want<00:03:45.110> to

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
just set the languages that you want to

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.470 
just set the languages that you want to
use<00:03:46.260> on<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.500> phone<00:03:46.830> and<00:03:47.340> here<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.209> can<00:03:48.330> also

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
use on the phone and here you can also

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.330 
use on the phone and here you can also
set<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.989> predictive<00:03:49.440> text<00:03:49.770> but<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.220> can

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
set the predictive text but you can

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.979 
set the predictive text but you can
pretty<00:03:50.489> much<00:03:50.580> set<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.239> when<00:03:51.570> you're<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:51.750> dirt

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
pretty much set that when you're in dirt

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:58.570 
pretty much set that when you're in dirt
input<00:03:53.030> mode<00:03:55.610> you<00:03:56.610> get<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.910> display<00:03:57.510> setting

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
input mode you get the display setting

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.310 
input mode you get the display setting
you<00:03:59.580> got<00:03:59.790> your<00:04:00.060> light<00:04:00.270> sensitive<00:04:00.870> setting

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
you got your light sensitive setting

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.750 
you got your light sensitive setting
sensitivity<00:04:02.190> but<00:04:02.370> it's<00:04:02.520> pretty<00:04:02.640> much

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
sensitivity but it's pretty much

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.979 
sensitivity but it's pretty much
automatic<00:04:05.760> already<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.270> just<00:04:06.420> have<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.750> set

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
automatic already you just have to set

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.900 
automatic already you just have to set
the<00:04:07.560> sensitivity<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.370> it<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:10.290> font<00:04:10.560> size<00:04:10.910> the

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
the sensitivity of it the font size the

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.740 
the sensitivity of it the font size the
Welcome<00:04:12.480> logo<00:04:13.160> then<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:14.280> get<00:04:14.459> how<00:04:15.330> long<00:04:15.540> you

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
Welcome logo then you get how long you

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.170 
Welcome logo then you get how long you
want<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.459> backlight<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:17.669> be<00:04:17.820> on<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:20.190> I<00:04:20.220> usually

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
want the backlight to be on so I usually

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.500 
want the backlight to be on so I usually
set<00:04:21.390> it<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.750> little<00:04:22.440> bit<00:04:22.560> less<00:04:22.860> than

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
set it a little bit less than

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:31.030 
set it a little bit less than
the<00:04:25.330> automatic<00:04:26.330> blocking<00:04:28.990> okay<00:04:29.990> so<00:04:30.050> then<00:04:30.920> you

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
the automatic blocking okay so then you

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.310 
the automatic blocking okay so then you
get<00:04:31.160> to<00:04:31.310> voice<00:04:31.520> command<00:04:32.150> I'm<00:04:32.810> not<00:04:33.050> really

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
get to voice command I'm not really

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.810 
get to voice command I'm not really
going<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.620> go<00:04:33.740> into<00:04:33.980> that<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:35.270> sensor<00:04:36.020> setting

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
going to go into that the sensor setting

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.460 
going to go into that the sensor setting
so<00:04:37.820> within<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.180> sensitive<00:04:38.690> setting<00:04:39.170> you<00:04:39.320> get

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
so within the sensitive setting you get

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.180 
so within the sensitive setting you get
either<00:04:40.220> your<00:04:40.490> sensor<00:04:41.060> on<00:04:41.300> or<00:04:41.630> off<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:42.230> that's

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
either your sensor on or off and that's

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.040 
either your sensor on or off and that's
that's<00:04:43.580> this<00:04:43.910> this<00:04:44.300> sensor<00:04:44.690> is<00:04:44.720> pretty<00:04:44.990> much

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
that's this this sensor is pretty much

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:52.170 
that's this this sensor is pretty much
is<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:47.890> motion<00:04:48.890> sensor<00:04:49.340> and<00:04:49.720> then<00:04:50.720> you<00:04:50.870> get

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
is the motion sensor and then you get

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.530 
is the motion sensor and then you get
the<00:04:53.180> turning<00:04:53.570> control<00:04:54.110> so<00:04:55.040> if<00:04:55.370> you<00:04:55.520> turn<00:04:56.330> your

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
the turning control so if you turn your

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.980 
the turning control so if you turn your
phone<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:58.550> allows<00:04:58.970> you<00:04:59.240> to<00:04:59.270> either<00:04:59.480> to<00:04:59.750> style

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
phone it allows you to either to style

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.160 
phone it allows you to either to style
in<00:05:00.110> your<00:05:00.260> car<00:05:00.530> or<00:05:01.010> auto<00:05:01.340> rotate<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:02.330> screen<00:05:02.720> or

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
in your car or auto rotate the screen or

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.310 
in your car or auto rotate the screen or
listen<00:05:03.770> to<00:05:04.160> smooth<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.580> alarm<00:05:04.940> so<00:05:05.840> that's

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
listen to smooth the alarm so that's

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.780 
listen to smooth the alarm so that's
another<00:05:06.710> setting<00:05:07.280> on<00:05:07.520> here<00:05:09.400> so<00:05:10.400> if<00:05:10.490> you<00:05:10.610> go

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
another setting on here so if you go

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.030 
another setting on here so if you go
further<00:05:11.060> down<00:05:11.380> you<00:05:12.380> got<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.620> touch<00:05:13.130> input

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
further down you got the touch input

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.410 
further down you got the touch input
setting<00:05:16.120> so<00:05:17.120> you<00:05:17.150> want<00:05:17.660> to<00:05:17.960> do<00:05:18.380> a<00:05:18.410> handwriting

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
setting so you want to do a handwriting

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.720 
setting so you want to do a handwriting
training<00:05:20.500> so<00:05:21.500> you<00:05:21.560> get<00:05:21.770> more<00:05:21.920> accurate<00:05:22.130> when

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
training so you get more accurate when

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.050 
training so you get more accurate when
you<00:05:22.880> do<00:05:23.300> hand<00:05:23.600> recognition<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:25.610> language

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
you do hand recognition the language

Bluetooth headset or the TV out setting

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:05.590 
Bluetooth headset or the TV out setting
and<00:06:00.980> then<00:06:01.640> you<00:06:02.270> got<00:06:02.510> application<00:06:03.500> setting<00:06:04.600> so

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
and then you got application setting so

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.570 
and then you got application setting so
this<00:06:05.930> allows<00:06:06.230> you<00:06:06.440> to<00:06:06.470> set<00:06:06.860> all<00:06:07.070> the<00:06:07.220> different

this allows you to set all the different
applications<00:06:07.700> setting<00:06:08.660> which<00:06:09.310> is<00:06:10.310> kind<00:06:10.910> of

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
applications setting which is kind of

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.760 
applications setting which is kind of
helpful<00:06:11.240> because<00:06:11.600> they<00:06:11.720> kind<00:06:11.930> of<00:06:12.020> put<00:06:12.590> all

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
helpful because they kind of put all

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.520 
helpful because they kind of put all
this<00:06:12.920> together<00:06:13.810> instead<00:06:14.810> of<00:06:15.050> going<00:06:15.410> to

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
this together instead of going to

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.000 
this together instead of going to
individual<00:06:16.750> program<00:06:17.750> and<00:06:18.110> then<00:06:18.380> try<00:06:18.620> to<00:06:18.680> set

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
individual program and then try to set

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.950 
individual program and then try to set
it<00:06:19.130> there<00:06:19.400> you<00:06:19.580> can<00:06:19.700> just<00:06:19.850> pretty<00:06:20.450> much<00:06:20.510> do<00:06:20.930> all

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
it there you can just pretty much do all

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.610 
it there you can just pretty much do all
the<00:06:21.200> setting<00:06:21.500> in<00:06:21.650> here<00:06:21.680> all<00:06:22.250> at<00:06:22.670> one<00:06:22.850> time<00:06:24.940> then

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
the setting in here all at one time then

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.400 
the setting in here all at one time then
you<00:06:27.620> get<00:06:27.770> the<00:06:27.860> phone<00:06:28.100> management<00:06:29.080> so<00:06:30.080> this<00:06:30.260> is

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.410 
you get the phone management so this is

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.560 
you get the phone management so this is
the<00:06:30.530> Auto<00:06:30.680> key<00:06:31.040> guard

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
the Auto key guard

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.080 
the Auto key guard
so<00:06:32.570> I<00:06:32.960> set<00:06:33.200> this<00:06:33.410> one<00:06:33.620> to<00:06:33.800> one<00:06:34.040> minute<00:06:34.310> and<00:06:34.640> then

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
so I set this one to one minute and then

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.999 
so I set this one to one minute and then
when

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:36.009 
when

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:38.129 
when
set<00:06:36.189> the<00:06:36.309> fifty-second<00:06:36.999> on<00:06:37.119> to<00:06:37.629> turn<00:06:37.839> off<00:06:37.960> the

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
set the fifty-second on to turn off the

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.070 
set the fifty-second on to turn off the
back<00:06:38.289> light<00:06:38.339> on<00:06:39.339> the<00:06:39.699> phone<00:06:39.999> so<00:06:40.629> it<00:06:40.719> gives<00:06:40.930> me

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
back light on the phone so it gives me

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.809 
back light on the phone so it gives me
about<00:06:41.289> 10<00:06:41.499> seconds<00:06:41.949> just<00:06:42.039> in<00:06:42.309> case<00:06:42.460> I<00:06:42.610> want<00:06:42.699> to

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:42.819 
about 10 seconds just in case I want to

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.420 
about 10 seconds just in case I want to
turn<00:06:42.999> the<00:06:43.119> phone<00:06:43.300> back<00:06:43.330> on<00:06:43.830> without<00:06:44.830> having<00:06:45.159> to

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
turn the phone back on without having to

go to the the lock button slide setting

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:53.609 
go to the the lock button slide setting
this<00:06:52.029> is<00:06:52.180> when<00:06:52.330> you<00:06:52.449> when<00:06:52.899> you<00:06:53.020> close<00:06:53.289> the

put<00:07:12.699> it<00:07:12.729> back<00:07:12.969> into<00:07:13.120> this<00:07:13.330> factory<00:07:14.039> I'm<00:07:15.039> not

00:07:15.299 --> 00:07:15.309 
put it back into this factory I'm not

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:17.219 
put it back into this factory I'm not
sure<00:07:15.520> what's<00:07:15.729> a<00:07:15.849> download<00:07:16.389> studying<00:07:16.839> is<00:07:17.020> I

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:17.229 
sure what's a download studying is I

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:19.790 
sure what's a download studying is I
guess<00:07:17.379> that's<00:07:17.620> probably<00:07:18.009> just<00:07:18.399> where<00:07:18.849> you

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
guess that's probably just where you

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.049 
guess that's probably just where you
want<00:07:20.800> to<00:07:20.949> if<00:07:21.520> you<00:07:21.669> want<00:07:21.849> to<00:07:21.909> download

00:07:22.049 --> 00:07:22.059 
want to if you want to download

00:07:22.059 --> 00:07:24.739 
want to if you want to download
something<00:07:22.539> what<00:07:22.899> folder<00:07:23.319> is<00:07:23.379> going<00:07:23.499> into

00:07:24.739 --> 00:07:24.749 
something what folder is going into

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:30.600 
something what folder is going into
device<00:07:25.749> update<00:07:29.069> that<00:07:30.069> just<00:07:30.309> pretty<00:07:30.490> much<00:07:30.580> just

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:30.610 
device update that just pretty much just

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.519 
device update that just pretty much just
tell<00:07:30.879> you<00:07:31.089> the<00:07:31.209> firmware<00:07:31.509> and<00:07:32.020> I'm<00:07:32.199> sure<00:07:32.379> you

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:32.529 
tell you the firmware and I'm sure you

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:34.230 
tell you the firmware and I'm sure you
probably<00:07:32.709> can<00:07:33.039> do<00:07:33.159> it<00:07:33.279> over<00:07:33.550> the<00:07:33.580> air<00:07:33.759> update

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 
probably can do it over the air update

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.719 
probably can do it over the air update
in<00:07:34.479> the<00:07:34.959> future<00:07:35.439> or<00:07:35.680> I'm<00:07:36.099> not<00:07:36.309> sure<00:07:36.459> if<00:07:36.520> you<00:07:36.610> can

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:36.729 
in the future or I'm not sure if you can

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:42.059 
in the future or I'm not sure if you can
do<00:07:36.879> it<00:07:36.969> now<00:07:37.649> and<00:07:38.699> then<00:07:39.699> just<00:07:40.059> about<00:07:40.830> so<00:07:41.830> that's

00:07:42.059 --> 00:07:42.069 
do it now and then just about so that's

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:45.299 
do it now and then just about so that's
pretty<00:07:42.459> much<00:07:42.959> sort<00:07:43.959> of<00:07:44.139> setting<00:07:44.860> on<00:07:44.979> then<00:07:45.159> you

00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:45.309 
pretty much sort of setting on then you

00:07:45.309 --> 00:07:49.110 
pretty much sort of setting on then you
get<00:07:45.430> the<00:07:45.550> notification<00:07:45.879> lights<00:07:47.159> so<00:07:48.159> for<00:07:49.029> the

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 
get the notification lights so for the
