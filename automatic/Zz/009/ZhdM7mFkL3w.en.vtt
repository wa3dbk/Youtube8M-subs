00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
I'll start off with the blade first off

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.400 
I'll start off with the blade first off
this<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:48.120> your<00:00:48.300> carbon<00:00:48.719> basic<00:00:49.079> carbon

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
this is just your carbon basic carbon

high-density<00:00:52.770> foam<00:00:53.129> that's<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.460> here<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.120> help

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
high-density foam that's in here to help

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.680 
high-density foam that's in here to help
take<00:00:54.750> away<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.230> tininess<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.300> puck

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
take away the tininess of a of the puck

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.360 
take away the tininess of a of the puck
it<00:00:57.899> makes<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.170> feel<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.350> you're<00:00:58.590> using<00:00:58.800> more

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
it makes you feel like you're using more

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.779 
it makes you feel like you're using more
of<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.489> wooden<00:00:59.730> stick<00:01:00.350> type<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.530> feel<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:02.160> this

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
of a wooden stick type of feel this this

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.179 
of a wooden stick type of feel this this
stick<00:01:03.570> as<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.290> move<00:01:04.439> up<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> shaft<00:01:04.830> or<00:01:05.040> let's

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
stick as I move up the shaft or let's

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.140 
stick as I move up the shaft or let's
show<00:01:05.309> you're<00:01:05.519> not<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:05.970> any

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
show you're not going to see any

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.870 
show you're not going to see any
insertion<00:01:07.020> points<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.580> it's<00:01:08.580> really

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
insertion points on this it's really

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.330 
insertion points on this it's really
hard<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.210> tell<00:01:09.590> I'm<00:01:10.590> moving<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:10.979> here<00:01:11.100> closer

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
hard to tell I'm moving in here closer

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.070 
hard to tell I'm moving in here closer
if<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.610> see<00:01:11.729> if<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:12.570> they<00:01:12.689> have<00:01:12.869> what

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
if you see if you can but they have what

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.469 
if you see if you can but they have what
they<00:01:13.110> call<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.650> called<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.950> spear<00:01:14.479> design

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
they call this is called a spear design

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.090 
they call this is called a spear design
on<00:01:15.659> here<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.380> actually<00:01:16.500> feel<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:17.040> a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
on here you can actually feel just a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.620 
on here you can actually feel just a
little<00:01:17.130> bit<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.549> lump<00:01:17.700> because<00:01:18.000> what<00:01:18.509> this

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
little bit of a lump because what this

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.690 
little bit of a lump because what this
happens<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.650> shaft<00:01:20.070> tapers<00:01:20.670> down

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
happens is this this shaft tapers down

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.700 
happens is this this shaft tapers down
into<00:01:21.150> basically<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> point<00:01:22.259> almost<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
into basically a point almost like a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.399 
into basically a point almost like a
spear<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.280> when<00:01:24.180> they<00:01:24.270> put<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> blade<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
spear and when they put the blade on the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.170 
spear and when they put the blade on the
blade<00:01:25.619> then<00:01:25.830> gets<00:01:26.100> married<00:01:26.670> into<00:01:27.060> this

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
blade then gets married into this

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.300 
blade then gets married into this
section<00:01:27.540> here<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.259> basically<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:28.950> not<00:01:29.130> they

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
section here so basically it's not they

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.190 
section here so basically it's not they
cannot<00:01:29.670> call<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.390> pee<00:01:30.810> stick<00:01:31.049> because

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
cannot call this a to pee stick because

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.230 
cannot call this a to pee stick because
it's<00:01:31.470> not<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.619> blade<00:01:31.860> insertion<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
it's not a blade insertion this is a

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.450 
it's not a blade insertion this is a
narrow<00:01:34.110> design<00:01:34.530> which<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.920> which<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.220> pretty

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
narrow design which is which is pretty

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.130 
narrow design which is which is pretty
much<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.729> different<00:01:36.090> version<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.750> how<00:01:36.900> they<00:01:37.079> do

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140

this<00:02:12.880> stick<00:02:13.060> actually<00:02:13.390> has<00:02:13.570> a<00:02:13.600> really<00:02:14.140> cool

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
this stick actually has a really cool

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.150 
this stick actually has a really cool
feel<00:02:15.490> to<00:02:15.700> it<00:02:15.730> it's<00:02:16.000> got<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.740> coating<00:02:17.740> over<00:02:17.950> top

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
feel to it it's got a coating over top

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.520 
feel to it it's got a coating over top
of<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:19.360> they<00:02:19.510> call<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.840> soft<00:02:20.080> soft

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
of it that that they call the soft soft

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.930 
of it that that they call the soft soft
touch<00:02:20.800> coating<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:21.400> believe<00:02:21.610> this<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:21.790> a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
touch coating and I believe this is a

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.040 
touch coating and I believe this is a
dip<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.300> they're<00:02:22.450> putting<00:02:22.690> on<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.840> top<00:02:23.020> of

and<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:10.180> is<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.500> balanced<00:03:11.500> five<00:03:11.710> durability

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
and this is a balanced five durability

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.550 
and this is a balanced five durability
five<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:12.940> have<00:03:13.270> a<00:03:13.300> another<00:03:13.930> guy<00:03:14.140> that<00:03:14.290> I<00:03:14.350> played

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
five I have a another guy that I played

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.660 
five I have a another guy that I played
what<00:03:14.710> that<00:03:14.830> has<00:03:14.950> been<00:03:15.130> using<00:03:15.280> this<00:03:15.460> now<00:03:15.640> for

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
what that has been using this now for

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.220 
what that has been using this now for
about<00:03:15.910> three<00:03:16.210> months<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.570> hasn't<00:03:16.750> had<00:03:17.050> any

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
about three months and hasn't had any

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.410 
about three months and hasn't had any
problems<00:03:17.650> so<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.800> durability<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:19.060> guy<00:03:19.209> does

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
problems so the durability this guy does

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.510 
problems so the durability this guy does
play<00:03:19.630> three<00:03:19.900> four<00:03:20.080> times<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.500> week<00:03:20.740> plays<00:03:21.310> ice

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
play three four times a week plays ice

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.000 
play three four times a week plays ice
plays<00:03:21.820> roller<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.330> it's<00:03:23.290> been<00:03:23.440> lasting<00:03:23.770> him<00:03:23.920> a

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
plays roller and it's been lasting him a

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.190 
plays roller and it's been lasting him a
long<00:03:24.190> time<00:03:24.220> so<00:03:24.700> this<00:03:24.820> one<00:03:25.030> is<00:03:25.209> durability<00:03:25.990> in

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
long time so this one is durability in

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.260 
long time so this one is durability in
