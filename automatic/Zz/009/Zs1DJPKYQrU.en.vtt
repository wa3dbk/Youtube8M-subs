the next component of the sleeping
system<00:00:20.689> is<00:00:20.990> a<00:00:21.470> bag<00:00:22.279> liner<00:00:22.750> at<00:00:23.750> least<00:00:23.960> my<00:00:24.080> system

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
system is a bag liner at least my system

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.450 
system is a bag liner at least my system
which<00:00:25.070> is<00:00:25.220> what<00:00:25.340> I'm<00:00:25.430> talking<00:00:25.760> about<00:00:25.820> so<00:00:27.460> what

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
I got here is fleece okay and I have a

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.030 
I got here is fleece okay and I have a
my<00:00:34.130> liner<00:00:34.430> which<00:00:35.030> I<00:00:35.120> made<00:00:35.300> myself<00:00:35.680> that<00:00:36.680> fits

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
my liner which I made myself that fits

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.630 
my liner which I made myself that fits
over<00:00:37.570> this<00:00:38.570> bag<00:00:38.840> now<00:00:39.560> that's<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.220> key<00:00:40.399> part

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
over this bag now that's the key part

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.430 
over this bag now that's the key part
and<00:00:41.060> that's<00:00:41.420> kind<00:00:41.720> of<00:00:41.750> what<00:00:41.870> I<00:00:41.930> wanted<00:00:42.170> to<00:00:42.230> talk

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
and that's kind of what I wanted to talk

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.720 
and that's kind of what I wanted to talk
a<00:00:42.470> little<00:00:42.649> bit<00:00:42.769> about<00:00:42.920> was<00:00:44.260> some<00:00:45.260> of<00:00:45.350> the

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
a little bit about was some of the

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.990 
a little bit about was some of the
thinner<00:00:46.730> bag<00:00:47.539> liners<00:00:47.960> like<00:00:48.280> you<00:00:49.280> know<00:00:49.399> silk

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
thinner bag liners like you know silk

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
of your bag keep it from getting dirty

of your bag keep it from getting dirty
make<00:00:53.780> it<00:00:53.899> last<00:00:54.050> a<00:00:54.230> little<00:00:54.260> bit<00:00:54.469> longer<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:55.100> do

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
added some warmth to it which is

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.979 
added some warmth to it which is
fantastic<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:59.089> thing<00:00:59.269> that<00:00:59.449> a<00:00:59.480> lot<00:00:59.570> of<00:00:59.719> people

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
fantastic the thing that a lot of people

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.380 
fantastic the thing that a lot of people
don't<00:01:00.079> understand<00:01:00.710> though<00:01:00.949> is<00:01:01.239> you<00:01:02.239> know<00:01:02.329> you

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
don't understand though is you know you

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.680 
don't understand though is you know you
just<00:01:02.690> spent<00:01:03.019> all<00:01:03.379> that<00:01:03.440> money<00:01:03.769> on<00:01:04.129> a<00:01:05.000> down<00:01:05.300> bag

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
just spent all that money on a down bag

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.370 
just spent all that money on a down bag
or<00:01:06.050> a<00:01:06.110> really<00:01:06.980> good<00:01:07.250> synthetic<00:01:07.520> bag<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.840> you

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
or a really good synthetic bag and you

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.950 
or a really good synthetic bag and you
did<00:01:09.560> it<00:01:09.680> for<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:09.890> reason<00:01:09.950> at<00:01:10.820> least<00:01:11.030> I<00:01:11.210> did<00:01:11.390> it's

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
did it for a reason at least I did it's

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.050 
did it for a reason at least I did it's
because<00:01:12.350> it's<00:01:12.650> some<00:01:12.920> of<00:01:12.980> the<00:01:13.040> best<00:01:13.100> insulated

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
because it's some of the best insulated

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.380 
because it's some of the best insulated
material<00:01:14.180> there<00:01:14.690> is<00:01:14.720> and<00:01:15.260> so<00:01:16.010> you<00:01:17.000> want<00:01:17.180> it<00:01:17.240> to

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
material there is and so you want it to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.350 
material there is and so you want it to
do<00:01:17.480> its<00:01:17.660> job<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:18.610> if<00:01:19.610> you<00:01:19.910> put<00:01:20.210> your<00:01:21.310> liner

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
do its job and if you put your liner

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.090 
do its job and if you put your liner
inside<00:01:23.360> of<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.630> bag<00:01:23.830> you're<00:01:24.830> going<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.010> be

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
inside of the bag you're going to be

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.820 
inside of the bag you're going to be
warming<00:01:25.460> up<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:26.600> liner<00:01:26.810> first<00:01:27.140> then<00:01:27.710> the

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
warming up the liner first then the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.890 
warming up the liner first then the
heats<00:01:28.040> gonna<00:01:28.250> seep<00:01:28.490> through<00:01:28.760> to<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:28.970> bag<00:01:29.150> it's

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
heats gonna seep through to the bag it's

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.630 
heats gonna seep through to the bag it's
not<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.380> most<00:01:30.530> efficient<00:01:31.010> way<00:01:31.100> of<00:01:31.130> doing<00:01:31.250> it

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
not the most efficient way of doing it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.110 
not the most efficient way of doing it
that<00:01:31.790> I<00:01:32.030> found<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:32.690> found<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:34.070> putting<00:01:34.790> the

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
that I found I found the putting the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.840 
that I found I found the putting the
liner<00:01:35.330> over<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.230> bag<00:01:37.570> maximizes<00:01:38.570> the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
liner over the bag maximizes the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.460 
liner over the bag maximizes the
insulating<00:01:40.850> qualities<00:01:41.270> of<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.630> down<00:01:41.870> or<00:01:42.200> the

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
insulating qualities of the down or the

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.980 
insulating qualities of the down or the
synthetic<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.280> like<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.420> said<00:01:44.480> that<00:01:44.630> allows

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
synthetic and like I said that allows

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.290 
synthetic and like I said that allows
when<00:01:45.470> I<00:01:45.500> crawl<00:01:45.770> in<00:01:45.920> here<00:01:46.160> it<00:01:46.460> allows<00:01:46.670> my<00:01:47.060> body

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
when I crawl in here it allows my body

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.170 
when I crawl in here it allows my body
heat<00:01:47.660> to<00:01:47.900> warm<00:01:48.200> up<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.590> bag<00:01:48.800> itself<00:01:49.730> and<00:01:50.090> to

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
heat to warm up the bag itself and to

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.050 
heat to warm up the bag itself and to
warm<00:01:50.390> up<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:50.720> insulation<00:01:51.200> in<00:01:51.830> here<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.280> then

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
warm up the insulation in here and then

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.900 
warm up the insulation in here and then
if<00:01:54.020> I<00:01:54.200> need<00:01:54.230> if<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:54.770> weather<00:01:54.950> is<00:01:55.040> that<00:01:55.220> cold<00:01:55.580> I

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
if I need if the weather is that cold I

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.430 
if I need if the weather is that cold I
slipped<00:01:56.360> my<00:01:56.800> fleece<00:01:57.800> liner<00:01:58.160> over<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:59.480> bag<00:01:59.660> now

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
slipped my fleece liner over the bag now

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.970 
slipped my fleece liner over the bag now
that<00:02:01.100> allows<00:02:01.610> me<00:02:01.820> to<00:02:02.030> get<00:02:02.120> the<00:02:02.330> most<00:02:02.630> out<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.560> my

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
that allows me to get the most out of my

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.529 
that allows me to get the most out of my
filling<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:06.400> affords<00:02:07.400> me<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:07.580> lot<00:02:07.970> of<00:02:08.149> extra

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
filling and affords me a lot of extra

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.550 
filling and affords me a lot of extra
warmth<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:10.819> kind<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.120> keep<00:02:11.269> that<00:02:11.530> keep<00:02:12.530> that

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
warmth to kind of keep that keep that

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.140 
warmth to kind of keep that keep that
heat<00:02:12.950> in<00:02:13.129> there<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:13.489> it's<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.670> multi<00:02:13.970> layer

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
heat in there so it's a multi layer

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.640 
heat in there so it's a multi layer
system<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:15.230> works<00:02:15.440> well<00:02:16.930> when<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.349> weather<00:02:18.530> is

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
system it works well when the weather is

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.190 
system it works well when the weather is
not<00:02:18.800> as<00:02:19.100> cold<00:02:19.790> as<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.330> when<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:20.870> does<00:02:21.020> not

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
not as cold as that when it does not

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.570 
not as cold as that when it does not
call<00:02:21.530> for<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:22.930> liner<00:02:23.930> over<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.650> bag<00:02:24.800> what

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
call for that liner over the bag what

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.730 
call for that liner over the bag what
I'll<00:02:25.790> do<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.450> that's<00:02:26.660> I'm<00:02:27.290> actually<00:02:27.590> what<00:02:27.710> I

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
I'll do and that's I'm actually what I

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.990

good insulation under the bag is that

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.800 
good insulation under the bag is that

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.640 
the heat from escaping out of the bag
and<00:02:53.770> it<00:02:54.770> allows<00:02:55.010> me<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.190> cut<00:02:55.490> down<00:02:55.700> on<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.930> most

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
and it allows me to cut down on the most

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.280 
and it allows me to cut down on the most
amount<00:02:57.890> of<00:02:57.980> size<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.870> most<00:03:00.050> amount<00:03:00.200> of

shell<00:04:31.340> on<00:04:31.490> top<00:04:31.520> same<00:04:32.479> thing<00:04:33.190> I've<00:04:34.190> got<00:04:34.400> my<00:04:34.520> base

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
shell on top same thing I've got my base

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.990 
shell on top same thing I've got my base
layer<00:04:34.850> like<00:04:35.419> crawling<00:04:35.660> here

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
layer like crawling here

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.470 
layer like crawling here
with<00:04:36.560> got<00:04:37.560> my<00:04:37.650> outer<00:04:37.770> layer<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:38.490> then<00:04:39.360> I've

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
with got my outer layer and then I've

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.720 
with got my outer layer and then I've
got<00:04:39.600> my<00:04:39.630> shell<00:04:39.900> so<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.470> same<00:04:40.700> principle<00:04:41.700> to

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
got my shell so the same principle to

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.800 
got my shell so the same principle to
apply<00:04:41.820> there<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:44.270> this<00:04:45.270> is<00:04:45.510> about<00:04:45.690> the

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
apply there and this is about the

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.190 
apply there and this is about the
maximum<00:04:47.090> amount<00:04:48.090> of<00:04:48.240> clothing<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:48.960> I<00:04:49.050> want

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
maximum amount of clothing that I want

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.850 
maximum amount of clothing that I want
to<00:04:49.260> wear<00:04:49.410> in<00:04:49.800> here<00:04:50.130> like<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:50.730> said<00:04:50.760> I<00:04:51.000> want<00:04:51.450> this

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
to wear in here like I said I want this

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.090 
to wear in here like I said I want this
this<00:04:53.480> insulation<00:04:54.480> in<00:04:54.960> this<00:04:55.110> bag<00:04:55.380> this<00:04:55.860> is<00:04:55.920> my

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
this insulation in this bag this is my

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.100 
this insulation in this bag this is my
core<00:04:56.370> item<00:04:56.670> I<00:04:56.790> want<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.120> do<00:04:57.360> its<00:04:57.510> job<00:04:57.720> to<00:04:58.020> the

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
core item I want to do its job to the

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.250 
core item I want to do its job to the
fullest<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:58.980> so<00:04:59.600> this<00:05:00.600> keeps<00:05:00.840> me<00:05:00.960> a<00:05:01.020> little

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
fullest and so this keeps me a little

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.470 
fullest and so this keeps me a little
bit<00:05:01.410> warm<00:05:01.620> but<00:05:01.830> it<00:05:01.920> allows<00:05:02.130> enough<00:05:02.550> heat<00:05:03.210> to

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
bit warm but it allows enough heat to

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.020 
bit warm but it allows enough heat to
still<00:05:04.140> escape<00:05:04.440> my<00:05:04.590> body<00:05:04.830> Torm<00:05:05.250> up<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.640> bag<00:05:05.790> and

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
still escape my body Torm up the bag and

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.100 
still escape my body Torm up the bag and
let<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.210> bag<00:05:06.450> do<00:05:06.780> its<00:05:06.930> job<00:05:07.170> to<00:05:07.680> fullest<00:05:09.110> okay

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
let the bag do its job to fullest okay

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.630 
let the bag do its job to fullest okay
so<00:05:10.470> that's<00:05:10.680> pretty<00:05:10.919> much<00:05:11.010> it<00:05:11.160> on<00:05:11.640> the<00:05:12.240> you<00:05:13.020> know

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
so that's pretty much it on the you know

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.130 
so that's pretty much it on the you know
components<00:05:14.640> of<00:05:14.730> a<00:05:14.820> system<00:05:14.970> here<00:05:15.360> there<00:05:15.690> is<00:05:15.780> one

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
components of a system here there is one

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.900 
components of a system here there is one
last<00:05:16.500> thing<00:05:16.650> I<00:05:16.800> wanted<00:05:16.980> to<00:05:17.100> talk<00:05:17.310> about<00:05:17.340> and

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
last thing I wanted to talk about and

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.220 
last thing I wanted to talk about and
that<00:05:18.840> is<00:05:19.910> your<00:05:20.910> body<00:05:21.120> using<00:05:21.750> that<00:05:21.870> as<00:05:21.990> part<00:05:22.169> of

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
that is your body using that as part of

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.530 
that is your body using that as part of
the<00:05:22.320> system<00:05:22.680> and<00:05:23.330> specifically<00:05:24.330> what<00:05:24.450> I'm

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
the system and specifically what I'm

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.150 
the system and specifically what I'm
talking<00:05:24.840> about<00:05:24.900> is<00:05:25.320> your<00:05:26.250> metabolism<00:05:26.940> now

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
talking about is your metabolism now

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.680 
talking about is your metabolism now
what<00:05:29.160> I<00:05:29.190> do<00:05:29.310> like<00:05:29.760> said<00:05:29.940> I'm<00:05:30.030> a<00:05:30.090> little<00:05:30.240> sleeper

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
what I do like said I'm a little sleeper

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.930 
what I do like said I'm a little sleeper
and<00:05:30.930> it's<00:05:31.080> really<00:05:31.290> important<00:05:31.710> to<00:05:31.830> me<00:05:31.919> to<00:05:31.950> take

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
and it's really important to me to take

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.360 
and it's really important to me to take
all<00:05:33.180> these<00:05:33.360> factors<00:05:34.350> into<00:05:34.590> account<00:05:34.620> and<00:05:36.350> so

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
all these factors into account and so

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.770 
all these factors into account and so
knowing<00:05:38.370> my<00:05:38.520> body<00:05:38.880> knowing<00:05:39.240> that<00:05:39.450> I<00:05:39.510> sleep

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
knowing my body knowing that I sleep

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.110 
knowing my body knowing that I sleep
cool<00:05:40.080> I<00:05:40.410> want<00:05:40.680> to<00:05:42.410> maximize<00:05:43.610> the<00:05:44.610> heat<00:05:44.640> that<00:05:45.000> my

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
cool I want to maximize the heat that my

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.390 
cool I want to maximize the heat that my
body<00:05:45.300> is<00:05:45.419> producing<00:05:45.720> and<00:05:46.380> so<00:05:46.620> you<00:05:47.160> know<00:05:47.280> how<00:05:47.370> I

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
body is producing and so you know how I

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.950 
body is producing and so you know how I
do<00:05:47.550> that<00:05:47.790> is<00:05:48.000> just<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.330> eat<00:05:48.450> something

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
do that is just to eat something

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.130 
do that is just to eat something
high-calorie<00:05:49.910> something<00:05:50.910> warm<00:05:51.210> you<00:05:52.110> know

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
high-calorie something warm you know

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.620 
high-calorie something warm you know
right<00:05:52.350> before<00:05:52.470> bed<00:05:53.150> you<00:05:54.150> know<00:05:54.240> drink<00:05:54.479> a<00:05:54.540> nice

cup of hot chocolate whatever it is you
know<00:05:56.669> Snickers<00:05:57.240> just<00:05:57.630> something<00:05:58.669> you<00:05:59.669> know<00:05:59.760> to

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
know Snickers just something you know to

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.510 
know Snickers just something you know to
give<00:06:00.150> my<00:06:00.300> body<00:06:00.510> producing<00:06:01.229> that<00:06:01.710> energy<00:06:02.250> you

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
give my body producing that energy you

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.540 
give my body producing that energy you
know<00:06:02.610> keep<00:06:02.790> it<00:06:02.880> going<00:06:03.090> through<00:06:03.210> the<00:06:03.360> night<00:06:03.510> and

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
know keep it going through the night and

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.120 
know keep it going through the night and
you<00:06:05.550> know<00:06:05.640> since<00:06:05.940> that<00:06:06.030> is<00:06:06.570> what<00:06:07.110> provides<00:06:07.890> all

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
you know since that is what provides all

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.090 
you know since that is what provides all
this<00:06:08.250> warm<00:06:08.490> this<00:06:08.820> stuff's<00:06:09.120> all<00:06:09.300> just

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
this warm this stuff's all just

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.590 
this warm this stuff's all just
insulation<00:06:11.100> basically<00:06:11.669> and<00:06:11.970> it<00:06:12.120> keeps<00:06:12.360> it<00:06:12.540> in

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
insulation basically and it keeps it in

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.719 
insulation basically and it keeps it in
what<00:06:12.750> you're<00:06:12.900> producing<00:06:13.140> so<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:14.430> more<00:06:14.610> you're

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
what you're producing so the more you're

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:16.190 
what you're producing so the more you're
producing<00:06:15.030> the<00:06:15.479> warm<00:06:15.690> you're<00:06:15.810> going<00:06:15.960> to<00:06:16.020> sleep

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
producing the warm you're going to sleep

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.250 
producing the warm you're going to sleep
that's<00:06:17.070> funny<00:06:17.310> how<00:06:17.430> that<00:06:17.580> works

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
that's funny how that works

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.180 
that's funny how that works
another<00:06:19.260> thing<00:06:19.530> is<00:06:20.479> if<00:06:21.479> you<00:06:21.720> get<00:06:22.290> into<00:06:22.710> a<00:06:22.740> cold

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
another thing is if you get into a cold

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.340 
another thing is if you get into a cold
bag<00:06:23.460> it's<00:06:24.090> going<00:06:24.210> to<00:06:24.300> take<00:06:24.510> a<00:06:24.540> lot<00:06:24.750> more<00:06:24.780> energy

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
bag it's going to take a lot more energy

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.159 
bag it's going to take a lot more energy
to<00:06:25.380> warm<00:06:25.710> it<00:06:25.860> up<00:06:25.979> and<00:06:26.540> you<00:06:27.540> know<00:06:27.630> keep<00:06:27.840> it<00:06:27.960> warm

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
to warm it up and you know keep it warm

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.320 
to warm it up and you know keep it warm
and<00:06:28.440> so<00:06:29.040> prior<00:06:29.340> to<00:06:29.490> going<00:06:29.550> to<00:06:29.729> bed<00:06:29.850> you<00:06:30.300> know

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
and so prior to going to bed you know

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.170 
and so prior to going to bed you know
get<00:06:30.600> a<00:06:30.800> little<00:06:31.800> bit<00:06:31.890> of<00:06:31.979> exercise<00:06:32.220> to<00:06:32.669> warm

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
get a little bit of exercise to warm

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.310 
get a little bit of exercise to warm
yourself<00:06:33.270> up<00:06:33.600> a<00:06:33.750> little<00:06:33.900> bit

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
yourself up a little bit

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.710

jumping<00:06:35.070> jacks<00:06:35.340> or<00:06:35.669> some<00:06:35.880> push-ups<00:06:36.479> you<00:06:36.600> know

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
jumping jacks or some push-ups you know

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.020 
jumping jacks or some push-ups you know
whatever<00:06:37.229> some<00:06:38.160> camp<00:06:38.370> chores<00:06:38.640> wherever<00:06:38.970> you

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
whatever some camp chores wherever you

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.510 
whatever some camp chores wherever you
got<00:06:39.150> to<00:06:39.240> do<00:06:39.330> but<00:06:40.080> the<00:06:40.590> warmer<00:06:40.890> you<00:06:41.010> are<00:06:41.160> getting

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
got to do but the warmer you are getting

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.210 
got to do but the warmer you are getting
into<00:06:41.970> your<00:06:42.150> bag<00:06:42.330> the<00:06:42.840> faster<00:06:43.380> that<00:06:43.890> it's<00:06:44.070> going

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
into your bag the faster that it's going

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.100 
into your bag the faster that it's going
to<00:06:44.280> heat<00:06:44.729> it<00:06:44.849> up<00:06:44.970> and<00:06:45.150> allow<00:06:45.330> it<00:06:45.510> to<00:06:45.599> do<00:06:45.690> its<00:06:45.840> job

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
to heat it up and allow it to do its job

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.739 
to heat it up and allow it to do its job
so

00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:47.749 
so

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:49.899 
so
anyway<00:06:48.229> those<00:06:48.379> are<00:06:48.439> that's<00:06:49.099> just<00:06:49.309> another

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:49.909 
anyway those are that's just another

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.919 
anyway those are that's just another
factor<00:06:50.330> to<00:06:50.360> consider<00:06:51.610> okay<00:06:52.610> so<00:06:53.179> that's<00:06:53.839> pretty

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:53.929 
factor to consider okay so that's pretty

00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:56.049 
factor to consider okay so that's pretty
much<00:06:54.229> my<00:06:54.439> sleeping<00:06:55.159> system<00:06:55.459> this<00:06:55.610> is<00:06:55.759> how<00:06:55.789> I<00:06:55.909> do

00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:56.059 
much my sleeping system this is how I do

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:56.529 
much my sleeping system this is how I do
it

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:56.539

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:00.309 
it
and<00:06:56.809> like<00:06:57.559> I<00:06:57.679> said<00:06:57.919> it<00:06:58.419> allows<00:06:59.419> me<00:06:59.659> the<00:06:59.839> maximum

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 
and like I said it allows me the maximum

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.769 
and like I said it allows me the maximum
amount<00:07:00.589> of<00:07:00.709> versatility<00:07:01.429> allows<00:07:02.029> me<00:07:02.419> to<00:07:02.689> get

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:02.779
