00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hi honey, guess how good they are 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.420
 afternoons as well indicated in brief 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.490
 instants are going to announce that he had 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.190
 Venezuelan servando and Florentine go to 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.440
 get to our country and they will give a 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.379
 concert whose gains are partly going to 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.470
 be from alicante to help adrianito 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.020
 and this has undoubtedly raised some kind 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.180
 of speculation of what may happen 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.590
 with those gains and let's move on 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.570
 precisely with the producer the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.570
 organizer this event I could 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.420
 chat with Adrian's parents and if 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.090
 first the event was organized to 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.590
 help families that lost 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.050
 his daughters in the investment is the fair 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.790
 from home and when I saw the opportunity 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.300
 because I think it's the first event 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.969
 massive where people can go when the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.219
 huaralino summons many people to 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.289
 to be able to approve adrianito I am the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.719
 person that I have spoken with the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.100
 producers of the event with the same 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.989
 servando and florentino boys and them 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.719
 they happily accepted this event going to 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.010
 be for girls for families of 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.780
 the girls who died in the cold of 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.339
 home of Ghana that here goes a certain 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.390
 distrust of people to love 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.150
 help us is scary 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.610
 the event is organized by the lack 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.040
 of granite we are not artists that you 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.420
 you can see that they are people who live 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.460
 working and they know what is 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.520
 honesty they were not fixing the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.009
 event if they did not know that there was a 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.570
 error I am me too I am but I think 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.000
 who has been one of the few people 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.460
 that I grabbed the phone looking for the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.710
 ballots and the gil already happened I was talking 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.869
 with them yesterday quickly 3 hours I have 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.640
 seen the news with them from the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.530
 8 of the night of aesthetically seen 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.950
 all the news I've seen the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.410
 repentance of pain shame and 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.810
 especially when I ran and raul me 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.910
 they talked about how the voice was exported because 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.789
 what they do not want even though he is 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.250
 willing to leave the campaign look for a 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:58.259
 start of a company that ended and 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:01.080
 put the account terms whatever they want what 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.940
 healthiest possible some artists for 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.220
 that we can talk but nothing more 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.410
 little quickie plate for not going to 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.970
 extend the envelopes your impression nothing 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.769
 more than they think about this complaint that has 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.270
 come out and with this we go to the cut yes 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.490
 we want to ask you 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.280
 of everything that has been said of credit to 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.220
 a good chair first say hello to all 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.890
 the family of my family from america yes 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.520
 we are the artists we are 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.870
 supporting the cause of adriÃ¡n milestone here no 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.450
 they matter what mistakes we make 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.180
 committed we are all human beings and 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.550
 we have a solemn word for 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.780
 vindicate us and here the important thing in 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.240
 name of all the artists we are 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.160
 present is to support granite no matter 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.050
 if any problem has occurred 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.750
 while error very well that there is 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.950
 amend the error according to the child I 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.990
 I think the most important thing for everyone 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.830
 the Peruvians clear to put a hand in the 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.270
 heart and think about the child 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.010
 peeled but the most important thing is 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.010
 emiliano on behalf of the artists 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.930
 to be a teacher to look for a serious NGO 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.849
 can administer these funds and the 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.709
 parents as a result of what has happened have 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.330
 ceased to be have stopped having 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.459
 credibility and has ceased to be perhaps 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.560
 the right people to handle these 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.480
 arks that are for the following 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.099
 million weeks of transparency 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.769
 by cilia actually what 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.780
 it should happen is that it can be published 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.840
 how the funds are administered and how 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.840
 he has come
