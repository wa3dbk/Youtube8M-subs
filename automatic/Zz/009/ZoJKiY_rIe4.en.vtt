00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.130
 a new world 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.130

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.460
 I had engaged in the marines for 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.419
 drooling 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.609
 I thought I could face 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.359
 any test what I 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.340
 had always been looking for 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.300
 it was a good reason to fight 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.300
 Ladies and gentlemen

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.949
 before a population of natives we 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:40.600
 call the na'vi they are very 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.579
 difficult to kill 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.670
 that's why we're here this little 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.170
 gray pebble your 20 million kg it is 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.820
 finds that their village is planted on 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.129
 the largest deposit and we need to 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.789
 have places these wild threat any 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.250

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.199
 supposed to find a diplomatic solution 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.550

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.880
 distance called avatars 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.119
 they are made from human dna 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.039
 mixed with that of the natives the navy 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.110
 in a body of an avatar it's a 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:14.310
 taken mixture 106 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.630

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.060

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.409
 should not be too hard for you 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.870
 it is very simple 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.610
 you sail and know these savages 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.790
 from the inside and that you win their 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.790
 trust 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.220
 you would not make a woman 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.220
 apart 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.119

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.790
 remains that it happens but everything has changed 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.349
