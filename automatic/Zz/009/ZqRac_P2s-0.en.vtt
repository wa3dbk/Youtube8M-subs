00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.299
 oldi computer and I am Vladimir Smirnov 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.770
 Today we got a smartphone on the test 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.290
 very big smartphone 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.420
 just a giant ritmix rr-600 smartphone 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.259
 in spite of its dimensions relating to 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.299
 budget solution 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.010
 so let's understand how at all 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.990
 work with such a hybrid tablet and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.539
 smartphone 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.250
 smartphone is protective 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.990

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.039

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.230
 cable for charging and syncing with 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.350
 micro usb connector and carrying case 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.390
 smartphone is supposed to glue back 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.489

 built-in speaker back case itself 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.629
 quite easily removed and under it we 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.270
 see the memory card slot 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.910

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.329
 class two connectors under standard 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.010
 sim cards and a very large battery on 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.159
 top end is a connector for 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.659

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.369

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.670
 front panel here is a speech 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.070

 megapixels under it a screen with a diagonal of 6 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.439
 inches and a resolution of 854 by 480 pixels 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.060
 thus the number of dots per inch 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.880
 is 163 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.659
 under the screen three touch buttons back

 the beginning of the screen brightness and color 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.349
 quite good 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.360
 But the viewing angles are not enough work 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.310
 interface smoothly enough and and that 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.410
 very nice smartphone responds to 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.760
 just no instant touch 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.050
 reflections that unfortunately 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.870
 present in many budget 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.239
 the devices are now back again 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.590
 dimensions compare rhythmics we will 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.599
 samsung galaxy laptop 2 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.220
 I want to emphasize that we will compare 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.870
 exclusively on this parameter 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.040
 since other comparisons will be 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.530
 incorrect due to almost 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.819
 fourfold price difference and so with 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.370
 one side despite such 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.380
 gigantic dimensions no discomfort 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.150
 when applying smartphone to kitchens and 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.340
 test yes and in the pocket of jeans he 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.010
 fits without problems but if at i 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.000
 diagonal 5 55 inches by 0 2 still possible 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.980
 even partially 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.110
 control it with one hand then with a diagonal 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.269
 6 inches is almost completely 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.510
 excluded working with the interface can 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.049
 just two hands go to 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.390
 testing 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:18.530
 for the beginning of the quadrant and while there is a test 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.720
 talk about the test results 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.890
 battery life for this 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.760
 test we turned off all wireless 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.230
 interfaces 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.420
 set the screen brightness to medium 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.660
 position and started the movie in this mode 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.540
 smartphone lasted 14 hours 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:36.400
 great test result is completed and 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:40.549
 he put the system 2860 points 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.900
 The following test antutu benchmark set 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.420
 6450 system 6 points graphic test 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.500
 not until mark 2 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.060
 here the average number of frames in 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.680
 second was 23 2 multitouch test 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.950
 device simultaneously recognizes 5 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.459
 touches now the camera test here 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.750
 examples of shooting photos and videos 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.459
 original files you can download by 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.609
 the link specified in the description of this 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.470
 video sum up this smartphone 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.600
 suitable first of all for those to whom 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.579
 always a little diagonal and I want more 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.470
 Secondly, those who do not want much 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.329
 spend money on a new smartphone or for the same 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.979
 money to buy a tiny device in 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.789
 three and a half inches from the more famous 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.010
 manufacturer 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.990
 Well, finally, this device will interest 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.360
 those who have already decided on the platform but 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.699
 still can not decide what 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.909
 smartphone or tablet for such cases 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.909
 it's just the perfect solution bye
