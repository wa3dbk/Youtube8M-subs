00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
pod 700 I did the first video showing

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.820 
pod 700 I did the first video showing
the<00:00:14.730> unboxing<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:16.199> then<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.410> plugged<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.800> to

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
the unboxing and then I plugged it in to

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.320 
the unboxing and then I plugged it in to
charge<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.550> just<00:00:17.789> tell<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.000> what<00:00:18.090> happens

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
charge and just tell you what happens

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.670 
charge and just tell you what happens
when<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.510> charge<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.900> get<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> little<00:00:19.260> nice

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
when you charge you get a little nice

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.710 
when you charge you get a little nice
little<00:00:19.710> looking<00:00:20.160> battery<00:00:20.850> charging<00:00:21.359> symbol

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
little looking battery charging symbol

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.769 
little looking battery charging symbol
right<00:00:21.840> there<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.410> battery<00:00:22.800> charging<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.850> up

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
right there of a battery charging and up

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.679 
right there of a battery charging and up
in<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> corner<00:00:25.230> here<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.410> got<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> blue<00:00:25.859> light

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
in the corner here you got a blue light

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.120 
in the corner here you got a blue light
the<00:00:27.689> blue<00:00:27.869> light<00:00:28.050> eventually<00:00:28.260> turned<00:00:28.740> off<00:00:28.920> I'm

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the blue light eventually turned off I'm

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.529 
the blue light eventually turned off I'm
assuming<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.609> means<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.910> fully<00:00:30.119> charged

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
assuming that means it's fully charged

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.299 
assuming that means it's fully charged
really<00:00:31.199> wanted<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.500> record<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.890> first<00:00:32.099> time

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
really wanted to record the first time

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.010 
really wanted to record the first time
it<00:00:32.489> started<00:00:32.790> up<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.300> soon<00:00:33.390> as<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.570> unplug<00:00:33.899> it

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
it started up but as soon as I unplug it

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.220 
it started up but as soon as I unplug it
from<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.170> wall<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.649> booted<00:00:35.070> into<00:00:35.370> Android<00:00:36.230> so

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
from the wall it booted into Android so

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.200 
from the wall it booted into Android so
we'll<00:00:37.559> record<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.370> boot<00:00:38.520> time<00:00:38.730> again<00:00:39.120> at

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
we'll record the the boot time again at

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.930 
we'll record the the boot time again at
the<00:00:39.329> end<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.719> video<00:00:40.460> but<00:00:41.460> for<00:00:41.760> right<00:00:41.910> now

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
let's I just have a look at how it runs

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.330 
let's I just have a look at how it runs
tap<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> power<00:00:46.079> supply<00:00:46.379> turn<00:00:46.890> down<00:00:47.070> pretty

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
tap the power supply turn down pretty

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.750 
tap the power supply turn down pretty
fast<00:00:47.610> there<00:00:48.059> from<00:00:48.390> sleep<00:00:48.719> mode<00:00:49.309> drag<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.340> way

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
fast there from sleep mode drag that way

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.090 
fast there from sleep mode drag that way
ok<00:00:51.239> let's<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.660> responsiveness<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.800> going

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
ok let's see responsiveness so going

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.029 
ok let's see responsiveness so going
from<00:00:53.510> desktop<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.539> desktop<00:00:55.199> seems<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.860> be

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
from desktop to desktop seems to be

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.889 
from desktop to desktop seems to be

good<00:03:03.769> in<00:03:04.730> fact<00:03:04.940> it's<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.329> think<00:03:05.390> it's<00:03:05.540> bloating

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
good in fact it's I think it's bloating

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.229 
good in fact it's I think it's bloating
better<00:03:06.140> than<00:03:06.380> my<00:03:06.650> archos<00:03:07.040> tablet<00:03:07.099> which<00:03:08.030> was

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
better than my archos tablet which was

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.110 
better than my archos tablet which was
probably<00:03:08.630> twice<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.140> price<00:03:09.319> of<00:03:09.470> this<00:03:09.590> one<00:03:10.120> so

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
probably twice the price of this one so

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.789 
probably twice the price of this one so

with the performance of this see home
button<00:03:53.299> there<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:54.560> that's<00:03:54.739> it<00:03:54.920> I<00:03:55.010> just<00:03:55.190> wanted

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
button there and that's it I just wanted

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.800 
button there and that's it I just wanted
to<00:03:55.400> quickly<00:03:55.519> show<00:03:55.940> this<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:56.389> let's<00:03:56.569> let's

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
to quickly show this so let's let's

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.080 
to quickly show this so let's let's
actually<00:03:57.079> power<00:03:57.980> it<00:03:58.130> down<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:58.609> restart<00:03:58.790> and

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
actually power it down and restart and

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.960 
actually power it down and restart and
see<00:03:59.239> how<00:03:59.329> long<00:03:59.389> it<00:03:59.630> takes<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.930> do<00:04:00.139> that<00:04:00.970> would

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
see how long it takes to do that would

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.159 
see how long it takes to do that would
you<00:04:02.090> like<00:04:02.269> to<00:04:02.389> shut<00:04:02.599> down<00:04:02.630> okay<00:04:03.590> powering<00:04:04.579> off

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
you like to shut down okay powering off

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.770 
you like to shut down okay powering off
okay<00:04:06.489> seems<00:04:07.489> absurd<00:04:08.060> shut<00:04:08.359> off<00:04:08.450> pretty<00:04:08.690> fast

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
okay seems absurd shut off pretty fast

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.449 
okay seems absurd shut off pretty fast
let's<00:04:09.230> see<00:04:09.380> how<00:04:09.500> quickly<00:04:09.859> it<00:04:10.190> boots<00:04:12.459> while

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
let's see how quickly it boots while

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:14.649 
let's see how quickly it boots while
it's<00:04:13.609> booting<00:04:13.730> honest<00:04:14.030> I<00:04:14.150> didn't<00:04:14.390> notice<00:04:14.480> that

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
it's booting honest I didn't notice that

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.810 
it's booting honest I didn't notice that
a<00:04:14.840> lot<00:04:15.019> of<00:04:15.170> most<00:04:15.680> Android<00:04:15.980> devices<00:04:16.010> I've<00:04:16.549> used
