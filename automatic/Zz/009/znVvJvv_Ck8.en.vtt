00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
a right angle I quite prefer it like

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.060 
a right angle I quite prefer it like
that<00:04:40.450> for<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:42.160> products<00:04:42.580> that<00:04:42.640> I<00:04:42.760> use<00:04:42.820> it<00:04:43.120> with

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
that for the products that I use it with

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.140 
that for the products that I use it with
let's<00:04:45.070> see<00:04:46.060> if<00:04:46.120> you<00:04:46.210> can<00:04:46.300> see<00:04:47.140> that<00:04:48.150> sennheiser

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
let's see if you can see that sennheiser

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.670 
let's see if you can see that sennheiser
as<00:04:49.660> you<00:04:49.780> can<00:04:49.930> see<00:04:50.080> it's<00:04:50.620> gold-plated<00:04:50.950> yeah

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
as you can see it's gold-plated yeah

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.470 
as you can see it's gold-plated yeah
I've<00:04:53.680> forgotten<00:04:54.250> what<00:04:54.310> is<00:04:54.490> cooled<00:04:54.760> the<00:04:55.060> actual

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
I've forgotten what is cooled the actual

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.050 
I've forgotten what is cooled the actual
connection<00:04:56.220> it's<00:04:57.220> gold-plated<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:57.820> I<00:04:57.880> think

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
connection it's gold-plated so I think

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.710 
connection it's gold-plated so I think
it<00:04:58.150> means<00:04:58.390> it's<00:04:58.660> quick<00:04:58.950> response<00:04:59.950> time<00:05:00.720> which

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
it means it's quick response time which

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.670 
it means it's quick response time which
is<00:05:01.900> nice<00:05:02.700> as<00:05:03.700> you'd<00:05:04.000> expect<00:05:04.120> that<00:05:05.050> I<00:05:05.380> got<00:05:05.590> the

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
is nice as you'd expect that I got the

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.510 
is nice as you'd expect that I got the
product<00:05:05.950> for<00:05:06.310> 40<00:05:06.760> pounds<00:05:07.590> which<00:05:08.590> i<00:05:08.980> think<00:05:09.340> is

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
product for 40 pounds which i think is

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.670 
product for 40 pounds which i think is
quite<00:05:09.640> good<00:05:09.910> for<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:10.960> headphones<00:05:11.350> they've

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
quite good for the headphones they've

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.430 
quite good for the headphones they've
got<00:05:11.950> quite<00:05:12.190> a<00:05:12.220> nice<00:05:12.460> sound<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:13.600> base<00:05:14.110> is<00:05:14.140> quite

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
got quite a nice sound the base is quite

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.000 
got quite a nice sound the base is quite
good<00:05:14.620> on<00:05:14.680> them<00:05:16.230> for<00:05:17.230> I<00:05:17.260> say<00:05:17.560> you<00:05:17.620> could

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
good on them for I say you could

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.250 
good on them for I say you could
probably<00:05:18.370> get<00:05:18.700> a<00:05:18.880> bit<00:05:19.210> better<00:05:19.420> for<00:05:19.600> 40<00:05:19.930> pounds

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
probably get a bit better for 40 pounds

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.380 
probably get a bit better for 40 pounds
