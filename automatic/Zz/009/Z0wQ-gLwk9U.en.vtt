00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.420
 so we are now on the stand of 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.280
 panasonic with him who will introduce us 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.570
 a very small case but that very 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.950
 interesting then is what you can 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.320
 introduce us a little the concept of 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.730
 I like the concept it's simple it has 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.680
 exactly the same age as living room ago 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.300
 five years ago panasonic had said at the time 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.680
 hybrids did not exist we this 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.430
 we're going to make these super devices 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.260
 simple to use 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.250
 extensible interchangeable lenses and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.590
 cetera that take back what the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.199
 reflections well with an autofocus that 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.850
 really works and then it was 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.020
 gradually make the first models 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.120
 were perfectible then gradually 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.890
 we arrived at xo 7 where we 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.450
 most of his promises were held 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.370
 there was a promise left to 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.260
 to hold is that panasonic had said and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.309
 we can do it very small and that 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.110
 technically this is not possible and 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.360
 Manon saleh is all that it stands there 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.000
 in it's that it's smaller than 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.260
 that a compact is the same thing as 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.149
 the camera that we film is the same 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.530
 that but in a device that 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.520
 is smaller than a compact because 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.079
 what we have to say is that we can 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.190
 finally remove the goal we want 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.050
 up lens as felt by many that 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.430
 is better aware of the size if 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.290
 I put myself a classic goal by a 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.869
 blue the well-known 20 mm I have on 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.180
 my gx if I put it on this device there 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.350
 makes its goals huge 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.790
 here we really have a device that is 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.990
 smaller not only smaller 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.340
 that a smaller hybrid street is more 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.049
 small that a compact is smaller 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.220
 quintÃ© is from us for example more 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.330
 small than a number of others 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.860
 devices of my colleagues 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.960
 really that's really what happened 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.490
 smaller then it's a real one 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.140
 true rupture of the devices of rupture there 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.610
 every three years we knew 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.689
 started with the arrival of the giants who 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.890
 was it was the first time 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.409
 saw a detection autofocus 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.600
 contrast that worked properly 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.600
 now we go in and spectacular the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.040
 gx and the gm go down to the survey - 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.259
 4 that are practically in focus 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.640
 in complete darkness and and this is the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.780
 next break is to get to do 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.880
 hold everything all that price had been 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.119
 told as these five 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.290
 years in there is no difference 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.560
 technique between the two is the same 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.380
 cheap engine it's a microscopic 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.420
 6.7 you can show us even the same 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.130
 sensor cx a big cable happened 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.430
 exactly where to go it's the same 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.870
 thing 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.869
 I set his goals 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.760
 we have exactly the same thing exactly 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.069
 it's the the same loved or microscopic 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.200
 serves only to people in the clear the idea 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.459
 the idea of alley how the idea of these 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.690
 of this hybrid that as soon as the pana 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.770
 developing for five years commencing on 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.720
 really make sense 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.340
 it allows to have around the same engine 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.540
 bodies that correspond to the 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.380
 people who are very demanding about 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.270
 of photos they want and stuff 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.800
 extremely complicated with the two 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.540
 swiveling sight systems that can 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.130
 make 20 direct access buttons for 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.380
 all and then people who just want 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.370
 maximum quality but in a 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.370
 microscopic clutter
