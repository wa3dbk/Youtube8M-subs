 Doctor in the area is then the staff is before 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.400
 commenting on the video is a warning that the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.529
 channel which was written the name of 28 but 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.480
 now the channel I have changed his name now 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.580
 from droid beauty 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.439
 so today we will be there with a gameplay 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.640
 of the new game 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.620
 then this game is a fps futuristic msf 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.380
 asks for a kind of game of 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.160
 shot of the future so you have to 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.360
 the weapons 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.850
 well it's very foreign so we can 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.070
 yes you can throw at your enemy and it is 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.170
 a very cool very realistic game 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.000
 I also really liked his graphics. 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.100
 here in the main mote interface of 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.670
 campaign and multiplayer 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.980
 As a player you can play online with 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.840
 other people in the world and local wifi is 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.530

 a profile of new player no name of 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:22.110
 life is in normal game actions, do not 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.570
 language in Portuguese but only the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.299
 subtitles today is where in his reason it is 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.250
 entirely in English is that the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.020
 game information is this is where it's 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.720
 these achievements 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.360
 so, for example, I have to kill 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.509
 perform a thousand deaths I'll kill miu miu 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.490
 I'm going to win 1000 xp doll in there. 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.009
 my google account 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.329
 So guys, let's go to the campaign that's the 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.329
 what interests us 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:19.010
 Let's start with the collector 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.010
 garbage but we'll see how it is a 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:37.080
 Breath on map above there is ok 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:46.980
 the law that orders such power to be recorded now 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:52.610
 on the mother island that lived here the graphics 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.610
 of the sun to profit more style 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:24.910
 Manning is talking about the weather the 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:29.290
 enemy tests were going to kill them. 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.270
 Now they're trash from the planet. 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.890
 the staff on that part what 's going on 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.430
 give one of the neighbors 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:40.360
 that's what I'm playing in a race 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:44.020
 a lot of pee's but it did not work too much 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.450
 right here in this part or in the furniture and 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.440
 day or even if it was not legal until 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:04:07.630
 three to the same for devices inferior to 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:04:09.930
 1 x 1 but from here to the end game runs 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.930
 goal 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.400
 the opponent with the desire to want a little 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.260
 more wins than the constitution to damage 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.040
 business that appears with 11 on the 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:32.230
 screen looks like it looks a lot like a ps3 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.470
 for whom he played was out and do not know 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.470
 What I'm talking about 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:05:00.940
 then the game he weighs 1.4 gw personal is 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.700
 now it hangs because takata loading 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:11.140
 here is saving normal on that part 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:14.290
 if you 're playing it will also lock in 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.350
 1.4 Ghz but after installed 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:37.740
 I think he's going to roll 9 more. 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:37.740
 Tries a lot because the game is between use 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:53.610
 Here's the chorinho show with a note. 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.610
 9 for him 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:19.099
 in practice the person will find it is not since 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:26.339
 So it's personal, I'll leave the 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.889
 link for you to download in a game there by 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:31.559

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:37.759

 a resolution below for example 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:47.339

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:49.949
