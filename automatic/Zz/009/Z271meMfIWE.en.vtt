 the name of the child and well simply 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.230

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.140
 entrance to the car here where is the 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.030
 seat 10 are the years that meet and go 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.030

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.330
 they place the stars on top of him and that's 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.530
 everything practically here the let's say the 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.720
 luca the attractiveness of the cake is in 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.350
 the car because it carries nothing more and nothing 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.870
 more is a simple cake easy to make and 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.390

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.940
 also useful recipes that can be 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.900
 serve the cakes I do how to make 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.810
 the fondant and everything else this cake 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:59.400
 the car I did uses a structure 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:03.030
 of cereals and pee mixed with the 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.550
 clouds to link everything and then with that I gave 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.240
 the shape of the car and the car simply 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.130
 is covered with the fondant following 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.170
 the colors of the model that served me 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.350
 pattern and nothing else but the structure 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.540
 is made with these krispies with the 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.360
 clouds or more so that it does not weigh so much 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.700
 it is done in this way ok if not then 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.400
 it would weigh too good and that's it 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.010
