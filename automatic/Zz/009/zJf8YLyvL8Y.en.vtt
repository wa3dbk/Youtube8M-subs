very odd and surprising that there's

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.019 
very odd and surprising that there's

talking<00:00:24.750> about<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.619> new<00:00:25.800> biome<00:00:26.460> which<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
talking about the new biome which is the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.519 
talking about the new biome which is the
jungle<00:00:28.470> biome<00:00:28.859> at<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.369> glance<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.410> looked<00:00:31.410> more

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
jungle biome at a glance it looked more

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.560 
jungle biome at a glance it looked more
like<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.920> swamp<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.790> didn't<00:00:33.420> look<00:00:33.510> like

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
like a swamp it didn't look like

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.280 
like a swamp it didn't look like
anything<00:00:34.020> different<00:00:34.649> however<00:00:35.989> there<00:00:36.989> are<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
anything different however there are a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.250 
anything different however there are a
few<00:00:37.440> key<00:00:37.829> things<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.579> are<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> jungle

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
few key things that are in the jungle

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.040 
few key things that are in the jungle
and<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.860> think<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.250> gonna<00:00:41.370> be<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> really

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
and I think it's gonna be a really

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.440 
and I think it's gonna be a really
exciting<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.379> new<00:00:43.800> biome<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:45.149> think<00:00:45.329> it's

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
exciting and new biome and I think it's

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.389 
exciting and new biome and I think it's
going<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.660> be<00:00:45.719> pretty<00:00:45.899> cool<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.890> one<00:00:47.160> thing

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
that you might notice is the tree the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.650 
that you might notice is the tree the

trees are very very tall and that's

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.990 
trees are very very tall and that's

thing I just like to do in a game is go
to<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.450> highest<00:01:06.720> points<00:01:07.560> with<00:01:08.159> whether<00:01:08.460> it's

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
to the highest points with whether it's

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.580 
to the highest points with whether it's
on<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> mountain<00:01:09.330> or<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> tree<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.470> like

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
on a mountain or on a tree I just like

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.490 
on a mountain or on a tree I just like
to<00:01:10.799> look<00:01:11.100> at<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> entire<00:01:11.729> world<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.320> know

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
to look at the entire world so you know

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.499 
to look at the entire world so you know
that<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.310> little<00:01:14.700> thing<00:01:14.909> but<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.299> pretty

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
that it's a little thing but it's pretty

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.940 
that it's a little thing but it's pretty
cool<00:01:16.759> another<00:01:17.759> thing<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.270> defines<00:01:19.020> now

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
cool another thing is that defines now

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.350 
cool another thing is that defines now
you're<00:01:20.369> able<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.970> climb<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.110> vines<00:01:23.360> people

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
you're able to climb on the vines people

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.020 
you're able to climb on the vines people
who<00:01:24.659> may<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:24.900> used<00:01:25.470> vines<00:01:25.830> before<00:01:26.369> for<00:01:26.850> their

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
who may have used vines before for their

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.100 
who may have used vines before for their
buildings<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.140> all<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.520> maybe<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> mod<00:01:30.540> or

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
buildings and all that maybe on a mod or

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.730 
buildings and all that maybe on a mod or
mate<00:01:31.290> or<00:01:31.860> something<00:01:32.340> or<00:01:32.520> an<00:01:32.579> adventure<00:01:33.150> map

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
mate or something or an adventure map

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.810 
mate or something or an adventure map
well<00:01:34.740> they're<00:01:35.009> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.490> redesign

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
well they're going to have to redesign

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.260 
well they're going to have to redesign
it<00:01:36.180> because<00:01:36.829> you<00:01:37.829> can<00:01:38.009> now<00:01:38.130> climb<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.850> Divine's

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
it because you can now climb on Divine's

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.990 
it because you can now climb on Divine's
and<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.810> believe<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.350> climbs<00:01:40.650> similar<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.610> how<00:01:41.970> a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
and I believe it climbs similar to how a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.429 
and I believe it climbs similar to how a
ladder<00:01:42.450> how<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:42.960> would<00:01:43.290> climb<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> ladder

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
ladder how you would climb on the ladder

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.350 
ladder how you would climb on the ladder
another<00:01:46.439> thing<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.009> not<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.820> planning

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
another thing is that not just planning

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.310 
another thing is that not just planning
to<00:01:48.630> create<00:01:49.130> in<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.490> create<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> new<00:01:51.240> set<00:01:51.810> type<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
to create in to create a new set type of

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.359 
to create in to create a new set type of
animals<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:54.180> jungle<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.740> these<00:01:56.310> are

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
animals for the jungle so these are

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.850 
animals for the jungle so these are
going<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.759> animals<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:58.079> or<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.740> know

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
going to be animals that or you know

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.310 
going to be animals that or you know
he'd<00:01:59.070> even<00:01:59.159> say<00:01:59.520> animals<00:02:00.000> creatures<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:01.049> who

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
he'd even say animals creatures so who

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.830 
he'd even say animals creatures so who
knows<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.860> might<00:02:02.040> get<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.280> new<00:02:02.520> monster<00:02:03.240> to

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
knows we might get a new monster to

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.260 
knows we might get a new monster to
fight<00:02:04.110> as<00:02:04.380> well<00:02:04.790> so<00:02:05.790> that's<00:02:05.939> pretty

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
fight as well so that's pretty

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.469 
fight as well so that's pretty
interesting<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.910> you<00:02:08.910> know<00:02:08.970> overall<00:02:09.209> I

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
interesting and you know overall I

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.750 
interesting and you know overall I
