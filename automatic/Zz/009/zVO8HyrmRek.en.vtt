00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
four seasons kit that I have that's like

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.500 
four seasons kit that I have that's like
about<00:00:55.000> 35<00:00:55.750> pounds<00:00:55.989> 34<00:00:56.680> or<00:00:56.769> 35<00:00:56.979> pounds<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:59.100> it's

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
about 35 pounds 34 or 35 pounds and it's

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.860 
about 35 pounds 34 or 35 pounds and it's
all-inclusive<00:01:02.430> jump<00:01:03.430> in<00:01:03.640> and<00:01:03.760> go<00:01:03.909> and<00:01:04.750> that's

all-inclusive jump in and go and that's

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.440 
all-inclusive jump in and go and that's
great<00:01:05.190> but<00:01:07.020> even<00:01:08.020> 35<00:01:08.470> pounds<00:01:09.100> is<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:10.030> lot<00:01:10.330> to

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
great but even 35 pounds is a lot to

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.510 
great but even 35 pounds is a lot to
have<00:01:10.600> in<00:01:10.720> your<00:01:10.750> back<00:01:11.020> when<00:01:11.619> you're<00:01:11.950> trucking

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
have in your back when you're trucking

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.330 
have in your back when you're trucking
miles<00:01:12.940> and<00:01:13.240> miles<00:01:13.420> and<00:01:13.600> miles<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:14.260> I'd<00:01:15.070> rather

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
miles and miles and miles and I'd rather

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.770 
miles and miles and miles and I'd rather
have<00:01:15.580> a<00:01:16.150> rock<00:01:16.960> on<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.290> lighter<00:01:17.530> side<00:01:17.970> than<00:01:18.970> the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
have a rock on the lighter side than the

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.200 
have a rock on the lighter side than the
heavier<00:01:20.080> side<00:01:20.350> so<00:01:21.280> I've<00:01:21.490> been<00:01:21.610> taking<00:01:21.820> all<00:01:22.060> my

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
heavier side so I've been taking all my

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.430 
heavier side so I've been taking all my
rocks<00:01:22.450> and<00:01:22.660> measuring<00:01:22.930> that<00:01:23.050> way<00:01:23.170> with<00:01:23.350> this

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
rocks and measuring that way with this

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.300 
rocks and measuring that way with this
luggage<00:01:23.680> to<00:01:23.920> go<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.650> very<00:01:26.860> accurate

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
luggage to go it's a very accurate

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.570 
luggage to go it's a very accurate
reading<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:29.050> gets<00:01:29.200> it<00:01:29.320> down<00:01:29.470> to<00:01:29.530> an<00:01:30.340> ounce

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
reading and it gets it down to an ounce

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.870 
reading and it gets it down to an ounce
so<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.990> really<00:01:32.170> gives<00:01:32.320> me<00:01:32.440> a<00:01:32.530> chance<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.370> look

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
so it really gives me a chance to look

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.380 
so it really gives me a chance to look
at<00:01:34.090> what<00:01:34.750> actually<00:01:34.930> weighs<00:01:35.500> what<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:36.390> allows

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
at what actually weighs what and allows

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.470 
at what actually weighs what and allows
me<00:01:37.660> to<00:01:37.870> decide<00:01:38.680> what<00:01:38.890> rock<00:01:39.070> I<00:01:39.190> wanted<00:01:39.490> use<00:01:39.760> now

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
me to decide what rock I wanted use now

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.810 
me to decide what rock I wanted use now
I<00:01:40.510> have<00:01:40.840> about<00:01:41.140> six<00:01:41.710> different<00:01:41.830> backpacks<00:01:42.460> and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
I have about six different backpacks and

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.980 
I have about six different backpacks and
I've<00:01:43.720> been<00:01:43.900> checking<00:01:44.110> them<00:01:44.380> all<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:45.330> I<00:01:46.330> found

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
I've been checking them all and I found

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.660 
I've been checking them all and I found
the<00:01:47.110> one<00:01:47.350> that<00:01:47.770> is<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.040> lightest<00:01:48.370> which<00:01:48.550> I

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
the one that is the lightest which I

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.550 
the one that is the lightest which I
figured<00:01:49.030> would<00:01:49.150> be<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.330> lightest<00:01:49.660> and<00:01:50.050> I've

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
figured would be the lightest and I've

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.810 
figured would be the lightest and I've
already<00:01:50.710> started<00:01:50.920> doing<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.730> little

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
already started doing a little

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.940 
already started doing a little
modifications<00:01:52.659> to<00:01:52.930> it<00:01:53.080> to<00:01:53.500> lighten<00:01:53.770> that

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
modifications to it to lighten that

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.090 
modifications to it to lighten that
little<00:01:54.280> further<00:01:54.690> let's<00:01:55.690> take<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:55.930> look<00:01:56.170> okay

it just basically hangs there it's like
little<00:03:36.830> anchors<00:03:37.250> just<00:03:37.730> sitting<00:03:38.000> that<00:03:38.120> for<00:03:38.330> no

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
little anchors just sitting that for no

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.500 
little anchors just sitting that for no
reason<00:03:38.870> at<00:03:39.020> all<00:03:42.700> okay<00:03:43.700> so<00:03:43.730> as<00:03:44.000> you<00:03:44.120> can<00:03:44.209> see

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
reason at all okay so as you can see

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.800 
reason at all okay so as you can see
it's<00:03:44.959> fluttering<00:03:45.470> between<00:03:45.800> 0.2<00:03:46.640> and<00:03:46.810> 0.1

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
it's fluttering between 0.2 and 0.1

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.720 
it's fluttering between 0.2 and 0.1
pounds<00:03:49.030> little<00:03:50.030> straps<00:03:50.300> right<00:03:50.540> then<00:03:50.950> well<00:03:51.950> 0.1

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
pounds little straps right then well 0.1

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.910 
pounds little straps right then well 0.1
that's<00:03:53.239> 1/10<00:03:53.750> of<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.900> pound<00:03:54.140> that's<00:03:54.470> one<00:03:54.680> point

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
that's 1/10 of a pound that's one point

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.910 
that's 1/10 of a pound that's one point
six<00:03:55.160> ounces<00:03:55.550> so<00:03:56.480> zero<00:03:56.780> point<00:03:57.050> two<00:03:57.260> is<00:03:57.530> double

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
six ounces so zero point two is double

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.990 
six ounces so zero point two is double
that<00:03:58.720> so<00:03:59.720> that<00:03:59.900> would<00:04:00.050> be<00:04:00.340> let's<00:04:01.340> see<00:04:01.489> three

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
that so that would be let's see three

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.660 
that so that would be let's see three
point<00:04:02.239> two<00:04:02.480> ounces<00:04:03.250> so<00:04:04.250> seeing<00:04:04.550> I<00:04:04.640> was

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
point two ounces so seeing I was

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.370 
point two ounces so seeing I was
fluttering<00:04:05.090> between<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:05.660> two<00:04:05.840> it's<00:04:06.020> probably

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
fluttering between the two it's probably

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.990 
fluttering between the two it's probably
like<00:04:06.500> three<00:04:06.890> ounces<00:04:07.250> full<00:04:07.489> stuff<00:04:07.790> because

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
like three ounces full stuff because

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.720 
like three ounces full stuff because
it's<00:04:08.180> just<00:04:08.209> just<00:04:08.840> barely<00:04:09.170> shy<00:04:09.560> of<00:04:09.860> point<00:04:10.550> two

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
it's just just barely shy of point two

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.490 
it's just just barely shy of point two
that's<00:04:11.300> three<00:04:11.600> ounces<00:04:11.900> of<00:04:11.959> stuff<00:04:12.290> just

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
that's three ounces of stuff just

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.740 
that's three ounces of stuff just
sitting<00:04:12.769> on<00:04:12.800> my<00:04:12.860> bag<00:04:13.130> for<00:04:13.430> nothing<00:04:13.880> so<00:04:14.060> I<00:04:14.600> like

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
sitting on my bag for nothing so I like

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.390 
sitting on my bag for nothing so I like
to<00:04:14.780> make<00:04:14.870> informed<00:04:15.230> decisions<00:04:15.380> here's<00:04:16.100> the

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
to make informed decisions here's the

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.350 
to make informed decisions here's the
paracord<00:04:16.970> lacing<00:04:18.700> it's<00:04:19.700> only<00:04:19.910> on<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.239> side<00:04:20.510> of

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
paracord lacing it's only on the side of

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.900 
paracord lacing it's only on the side of
so<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:23.420> took<00:04:23.510> it<00:04:23.690> off<00:04:23.980> so<00:04:24.980> I<00:04:25.010> can<00:04:26.260> weigh<00:04:27.260> it

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
so I took it off so I can weigh it

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.120 
so I took it off so I can weigh it
measure<00:04:28.910> its<00:04:29.090> weight<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.480> see<00:04:29.690> if<00:04:29.810> it's

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
measure its weight and see if it's

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.210 
measure its weight and see if it's
really<00:04:31.360> worth<00:04:32.360> its<00:04:33.050> weight<00:04:33.350> you<00:04:33.920> know<00:04:34.010> I<00:04:34.070> mean

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
really worth its weight you know I mean

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.450 
really worth its weight you know I mean
how<00:04:34.370> heavy<00:04:34.580> is<00:04:34.790> this<00:04:34.820> lacing<00:04:35.360> really<00:04:35.660> I<00:04:36.460> don't

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
how heavy is this lacing really I don't

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.700 
how heavy is this lacing really I don't
know<00:04:37.520> maybe<00:04:38.000> one<00:04:38.360> ounce<00:04:38.510> I<00:04:38.900> have<00:04:39.680> no<00:04:39.830> idea

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
know maybe one ounce I have no idea

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.090 
know maybe one ounce I have no idea
then<00:04:42.710> I'll<00:04:43.070> take<00:04:43.340> that<00:04:43.550> number<00:04:43.790> and<00:04:44.080> I'll

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
then I'll take that number and I'll

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.940 
then I'll take that number and I'll
weigh<00:04:46.100> it<00:04:46.310> against<00:04:47.890> what<00:04:48.890> it<00:04:48.980> does<00:04:49.160> for<00:04:49.340> me<00:04:49.460> I

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950
