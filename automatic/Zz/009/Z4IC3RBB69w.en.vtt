00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.210
 look for a little something for when you 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.790
 are in the field to configure everything 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.070
 who steals and everything that steals more 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.290
 until the arrival you go that it 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.239
 must then by cons of relating to 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.520
