well<00:05:00.260> I<00:05:00.320> think<00:05:00.409> it's<00:05:00.680> going<00:05:00.770> to<00:05:00.860> ruin<00:05:01.039> the

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
well I think it's going to ruin the

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.659 
well I think it's going to ruin the
color<00:05:02.590> ok<00:05:03.590> so<00:05:03.650> I'm<00:05:04.010> going<00:05:04.159> to<00:05:04.280> throw<00:05:04.460> in<00:05:04.580> my

bath notes now well my massage barback
not<00:05:07.909> I<00:05:08.120> guess<00:05:08.300> a<00:05:09.669> little<00:05:10.669> bit<00:05:10.970> I'm<00:05:11.840> gonna<00:05:12.139> put

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
not I guess a little bit I'm gonna put

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:13.810 
not I guess a little bit I'm gonna put
that<00:05:12.440> in<00:05:12.740> and<00:05:12.979> that<00:05:13.039> should<00:05:13.280> take<00:05:13.400> a<00:05:13.460> really

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
that in and that should take a really

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.450 
that in and that should take a really
long<00:05:13.849> time<00:05:14.000> to<00:05:14.599> melt<00:05:14.979> that's<00:05:15.979> not<00:05:16.220> really

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
long time to melt that's not really

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.839 
long time to melt that's not really
going<00:05:16.580> to<00:05:16.669> change<00:05:16.880> the<00:05:17.120> color<00:05:17.360> or<00:05:17.479> anything<00:05:18.849> ok

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
going to change the color or anything ok

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.939 
going to change the color or anything ok
so<00:05:19.909> this<00:05:20.210> is<00:05:20.419> the<00:05:20.539> finishing<00:05:20.930> color<00:05:21.380> this<00:05:21.770> is

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949
