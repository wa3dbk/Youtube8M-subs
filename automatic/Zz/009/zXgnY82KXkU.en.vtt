00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
YouTube was of 1207 here bringing in a

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.999 
YouTube was of 1207 here bringing in a
comparison<00:00:12.570> video<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:13.349> time<00:00:13.410> it's<00:00:13.830> between

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
comparison video this time it's between

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.529 
comparison video this time it's between
the<00:00:14.849> end<00:00:15.179> strike<00:00:15.480> elite<00:00:15.719> fire<00:00:16.020> strike<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:17.539> the

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
the end strike elite fire strike and the

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.519 
the end strike elite fire strike and the
zombie<00:00:19.050> strike<00:00:19.260> side<00:00:20.189> strike<00:00:21.109> so<00:00:22.109> these<00:00:22.320> are

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
zombie strike side strike so these are

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.250 
zombie strike side strike so these are
both<00:00:22.650> essentially<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.220> same<00:00:23.400> girl<00:00:24.050> this<00:00:25.050> is

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
both essentially the same girl this is

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.050 
both essentially the same girl this is
an<00:00:25.350> elite<00:00:25.590> upgrade<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> night<00:00:26.369> finder<00:00:26.849> and

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
an elite upgrade to the night finder and

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.779 
an elite upgrade to the night finder and
the<00:00:28.019> air<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.650> basically<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.279> reshelve

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the air this is basically a reshelve

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.030 
the air this is basically a reshelve
fire<00:00:30.539> strike

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
fire strike

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.479 
fire strike
so<00:00:32.300> we'll<00:00:33.300> be<00:00:33.360> comparing<00:00:33.690> them<00:00:34.100> start<00:00:35.100> with

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
so we'll be comparing them start with

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.450 
so we'll be comparing them start with
the<00:00:35.670> fire<00:00:35.850> strike<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> fire<00:00:37.860> strike<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.190> an

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the fire strike so the fire strike is an

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.729 
the fire strike so the fire strike is an
elite<00:00:38.760> upgrade<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> old<00:00:39.870> Mike<00:00:40.079> finder<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
elite upgrade to the old Mike finder and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.310 
elite upgrade to the old Mike finder and
it's<00:00:41.640> much<00:00:41.910> smaller<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.809> song<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.200> use

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
it's much smaller I have a song to use

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.270 
it's much smaller I have a song to use
one<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.620> compare<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.070> to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
one to compare it to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.490 
one to compare it to
as<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:45.390> can<00:00:45.570> see<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:46.020> lot<00:00:46.170> shorter<00:00:46.379> and

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
as you can see a lot shorter and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.340 
as you can see a lot shorter and
everything<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.480> prime<00:00:50.449> so<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.629> lot<00:00:52.110> shorter

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
everything at the prime so a lot shorter

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.310 
everything at the prime so a lot shorter
as<00:00:52.559> well<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:53.010> high<00:00:53.670> five<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.539> hook<00:00:55.050> back

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
as well a high five it is here hook back

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.729 
as well a high five it is here hook back
a<00:00:56.280> dime<00:00:56.879> Jim<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.789> go<00:00:59.789> back<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.210> half

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
a dime Jim and like so go back in half

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.869 
a dime Jim and like so go back in half
instead<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.890> pressing<00:01:02.100> down<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> trigger

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
it's brown I'm guessing the given mega

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.960 
it's brown I'm guessing the given mega
wouldn't<00:02:31.890> affect<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:33.080> very<00:02:34.080> comfortable

zombies<00:03:05.640> right<00:03:05.790> darts<00:03:06.030> on<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.300> fly<00:03:06.480> here<00:03:06.630> we

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
zombies right darts on the fly here we

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:17.480 
zombies right darts on the fly here we
go<00:03:15.590> okay<00:03:16.590> let's<00:03:16.770> go<00:03:16.830> see<00:03:17.100> what<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.310> range

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
go okay let's go see what the range

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.700 
go okay let's go see what the range
difference<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.090> like<00:03:18.270> so<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.780> shot<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.500> from

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
difference is like so the shot is from

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.730 
difference is like so the shot is from
the<00:03:19.800> side<00:03:20.070> strike<00:03:20.400> next<00:03:21.270> two<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:21.960> the<00:03:22.350> lowest

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
the side strike next two is the lowest

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.350 
the side strike next two is the lowest
from<00:03:22.860> five<00:03:23.130> strike<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.880> next<00:03:24.180> side

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
from five strike and the next side

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.810 
from five strike and the next side
strike<00:03:24.630> one<00:03:24.870> next<00:03:25.770> one's<00:03:25.950> five<00:03:26.220> strike<00:03:26.550> and

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
strike one next one's five strike and

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.150 
strike one next one's five strike and
then<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.720> last<00:03:27.930> side<00:03:28.170> strike<00:03:28.500> Dart

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
then the last side strike Dart

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.950 
then the last side strike Dart
and<00:03:29.340> then<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:29.970> top<00:03:30.150> one<00:03:30.180> is<00:03:30.510> from<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.750> five

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
and then the top one is from the five

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.410 
and then the top one is from the five
strike<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:31.950> fire<00:03:32.460> strike<00:03:32.670> one<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.180> range

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
strike so a fire strike one the range

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.540 
strike so a fire strike one the range
comparison<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.140> fire<00:03:34.350> test<00:03:34.590> on<00:03:34.800> fire<00:03:35.250> strike

here we go that took five seconds us
we're<00:03:42.990> going<00:03:43.110> to<00:03:43.170> see<00:03:43.350> how<00:03:43.500> fast<00:03:43.740> I<00:03:43.890> can<00:03:43.980> choose

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
we're going to see how fast I can choose

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.970 
we're going to see how fast I can choose

that<00:04:12.819> took<00:04:13.150> six<00:04:13.629> seconds<00:04:14.349> so<00:04:14.709> overall<00:04:15.069> this

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
that took six seconds so overall this

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.220 
that took six seconds so overall this
test<00:04:15.670> was<00:04:15.849> the<00:04:15.879> draw<00:04:16.180> they<00:04:16.750> have<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:16.989> same

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
test was the draw they have the same

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.129 
test was the draw they have the same
rate<00:04:17.440> of<00:04:17.560> fire<00:04:17.769> the<00:04:18.130> same<00:04:18.370> range<00:04:18.840> but<00:04:19.840> if<00:04:19.959> I<00:04:20.079> the

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
rate of fire the same range but if I the

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.350 
rate of fire the same range but if I the
pick<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.680> would<00:04:20.799> go<00:04:20.919> for<00:04:21.100> side<00:04:21.310> strike<00:04:21.639> because

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
pick I would go for side strike because

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.689 
pick I would go for side strike because
it<00:04:22.510> has<00:04:22.630> this<00:04:22.780> very<00:04:22.870> nice<00:04:23.260> holder<00:04:23.680> and<00:04:23.860> it's
