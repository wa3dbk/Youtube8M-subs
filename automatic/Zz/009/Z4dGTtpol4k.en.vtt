00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.249 
there's actually a difference in the
surface<00:06:15.030> and<00:06:15.210> it's<00:06:15.330> really<00:06:15.660> affecting<00:06:16.169> the

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
surface and it's really affecting the

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.589 
surface and it's really affecting the
downline<00:06:16.740> motion<00:06:17.370> there's<00:06:17.880> a<00:06:17.970> lot<00:06:18.240> of<00:06:18.270> players

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
downline motion there's a lot of players

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:20.450 
downline motion there's a lot of players
who<00:06:18.900> are<00:06:18.960> feeling<00:06:19.410> the<00:06:19.440> left<00:06:19.800> lanes<00:06:20.069> a<00:06:20.250> little

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
who are feeling the left lanes a little

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.730 
who are feeling the left lanes a little
bit<00:06:20.580> tighter<00:06:20.880> it's<00:06:21.870> not<00:06:22.169> because<00:06:22.590> there's

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
bit tighter it's not because there's

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.830 
bit tighter it's not because there's
more<00:06:23.009> oil<00:06:23.370> because<00:06:23.819> the<00:06:23.940> Front's<00:06:24.330> do<00:06:24.539> hook

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
more oil because the Front's do hook

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.890 
more oil because the Front's do hook
it's<00:06:25.289> just<00:06:25.620> a<00:06:25.770> downline<00:06:26.400> it's<00:06:26.849> not<00:06:27.300> quite<00:06:27.870> the

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
it's just a downline it's not quite the

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.890 
it's just a downline it's not quite the
same<00:06:28.190> topography<00:06:29.190> so<00:06:29.430> the<00:06:29.819> ball<00:06:30.030> is<00:06:30.180> laboring

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900
