now<00:00:16.049> all<00:00:16.379> you'll<00:00:16.650> need<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.520> certain<00:00:18.000> tool<00:00:18.180> I

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
now all you'll need is a certain tool I

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.090 
now all you'll need is a certain tool I
wouldn't<00:00:18.750> use<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.020> One<00:00:19.199> X<00:00:19.439> because<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:20.070> a

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
wouldn't use the One X because that is a

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.820 
wouldn't use the One X because that is a
wand<00:00:20.430> or<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:21.170> wouldn't<00:00:22.170> use<00:00:22.320> like<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> bow<00:00:22.800> or

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
wand or I wouldn't use like a bow or

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.429 
wand or I wouldn't use like a bow or
sword<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:24.269> what<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.480> want<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.689> do<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.990> type<00:00:25.260> in

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
sword but what you want to do is type in

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.189 
sword but what you want to do is type in
slash<00:00:25.830> brush<00:00:26.330> sphere<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.480> then<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:27.990> want<00:00:28.140> to

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
slash brush sphere and then you want to

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.290 
slash brush sphere and then you want to
choose<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.470> block<00:00:28.800> types<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.460> want<00:00:29.490> so

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
choose the block types that you want so

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.459 
choose the block types that you want so
let's<00:00:30.539> say<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.840> want<00:00:31.199> 15%<00:00:32.870> regular<00:00:33.870> stone<00:00:34.230> and

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
let's say you want 15% regular stone and

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.370 
let's say you want 15% regular stone and
that<00:00:35.340> little<00:00:35.640> structure

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
that little structure

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.830 
that little structure
to<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.680> right<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.010> our<00:00:38.340> screen<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.480> could<00:00:39.629> see

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
to the right of our screen you could see

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.779 
to the right of our screen you could see
the<00:00:39.960> path<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.559> use<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.190> technique<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.350> 15%

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
the path and I use this technique so 15%

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.369 
the path and I use this technique so 15%
stone<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.059> type<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.360> stone<00:00:45.690> or<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.260> can

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
stone you can type in stone or you can

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.279 
stone you can type in stone or you can
type<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.649> 1<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.270> just<00:00:48.270> put<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> comma<00:00:48.719> because<00:00:49.020> 1

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
type in 1 and just put a comma because 1

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.380 
type in 1 and just put a comma because 1
is<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> block<00:00:49.770> ID<00:00:49.980> then<00:00:50.670> let's<00:00:50.969> say<00:00:51.149> 1<00:00:51.420> 15%<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
is the block ID then let's say 1 15% the

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.930 
is the block ID then let's say 1 15% the
cobblestone<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.539> that's<00:00:55.230> for<00:00:55.730> put<00:00:56.730> another

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
cobblestone and that's for put another

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.840 
cobblestone and that's for put another
comma<00:00:57.500> now<00:00:58.500> there's<00:00:58.710> 70<00:00:59.010> percent<00:00:59.370> left<00:00:59.579> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
comma now there's 70 percent left and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.979 
comma now there's 70 percent left and
make<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.390> grass<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.090> then<00:01:03.239> 2<00:01:03.510> 2<00:01:03.870> is

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
make that grass so that and then 2 2 is

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.020 
make that grass so that and then 2 2 is
the<00:01:04.080> block<00:01:04.260> 80<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.680> grass<00:01:04.860> now<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.729> want<00:01:05.970> to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the block 80 for grass now you want to

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.500 
the block 80 for grass now you want to
mask<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:07.320> actually<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.040> did<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.340> room

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
mask the actually I did that room

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.429 
mask the actually I did that room
because<00:01:09.510> after<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.110> want<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.260> put<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
because after that you want to put a

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.990 
because after that you want to put a
space<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:10.950> want<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.189> put<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.369> radius<00:01:11.729> 2

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
space and you want to put the radius 2

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.370 
space and you want to put the radius 2
is<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.299> minimum<00:01:12.600> that's<00:01:12.840> what<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.140> usually

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
is the minimum that's what it usually

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.550 
is the minimum that's what it usually
goes<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.310> let's<00:01:14.490> go<00:01:14.640> for<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> 5<00:01:15.229> now<00:01:16.229> we<00:01:16.290> want

goes for so let's go for a 5 now we want
a<00:01:16.619> slash<00:01:16.860> mask<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.790> grass<00:01:18.799> okay<00:01:19.799> let's<00:01:20.610> get

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
a slash mask the grass okay let's get

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.670 
a slash mask the grass okay let's get
some<00:01:21.000> bone<00:01:21.180> meal<00:01:21.390> ready<00:01:23.600> meal<00:01:24.600> there<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:25.590> go

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
nice medium sized one you can go to 3 so

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.219 
nice medium sized one you can go to 3 so
let's<00:01:37.110> go<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.470> 3<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.630> then<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.900> get<00:01:40.020> that

let's go to 3 and then you can get that

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.399 
let's go to 3 and then you can get that
that's<00:01:40.770> nice<00:01:41.009> as<00:01:41.490> well<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:42.030> can<00:01:42.150> also<00:01:42.299> go<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.600> 2

the largest one six and there you go

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.230 
the largest one six and there you go
that's<00:01:56.750> how<00:01:56.900> you<00:01:57.020> make<00:01:57.440> your<00:01:57.880> Minecraft<00:01:58.880> paths

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
that's how you make your Minecraft paths

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.150 
that's how you make your Minecraft paths
in<00:01:59.600> world<00:01:59.960> in<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.230> and<00:02:00.380> when<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:00.950> come<00:02:01.130> to

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
in world in it and when you come to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.950 
in world in it and when you come to
spots<00:02:01.490> like<00:02:01.700> these<00:02:01.910> you<00:02:02.270> don't<00:02:02.450> want<00:02:02.660> them<00:02:02.840> to

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
spots like these you don't want them to

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.469 
spots like these you don't want them to
have<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:03.650> much<00:02:03.800> just<00:02:04.070> go<00:02:04.520> like<00:02:04.670> this<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.180> put

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
have so much just go like this and put
