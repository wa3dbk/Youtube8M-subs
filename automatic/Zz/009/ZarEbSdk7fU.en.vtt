00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.600
 very good people the new video of the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.010
 section you decide here are you 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.300
 the ones that tell me what attacks I have to 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.279
 do I simply the only thing I do 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.110
 these deep four options area 2 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.910
 I propose to you two armies with 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.830
 each of the beaches and you in one 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.509
 You can survey which one you want 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.390
 see in the next video and well then 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:30.360
 reviewing here the last survey had 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.090
 as an option to see where he is was here 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.670
 as an option the village of which in jamal 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.739
 it's worth this here and the nests 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.720
 options to attack is this beach a 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.440
 was with warriors another with tanks and has 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.520
 won the option of warriors with 384 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.730
 votes carried at the moment in which 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.200
 I'm living seeing this the other 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.270
 option the second most voted was also 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.580
 this is this beach but instead of 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.080
 with warriors contacts good in the end is 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.940
 the one that has won seems to him that the village 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.830
 see no if you have not been interested in anything 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.540
 that there is not no problem but 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.160
 before I propose the survey for the 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.500
 good week for the week for when 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.060
 farm next the next video os 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.380
 I propose the following survey vale 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.840
 so what are we going to do 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.430
 Well, I was thinking about armies 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.800
 and skiing drawings are always the same 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.530
 so I say I'm going to make a 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.540
 the last the last times they have 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.280
 skipped my base I'm going to take those 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.770
 armies and are those that we are going to propose 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.770
 with villages that are in me on my map 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.320
 ok then this has been the last time 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.660
 highlighting very base 18 minutes ago has 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.150
 been all very sad and good as they have 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.920
 used bullies and sugar be worth bullies 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.570
 and you cash 16 thugs 24 zukas with what 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.090
 which one of the options is bullies and you 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.130
 house now we will share it is worth another 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.050
 the options would be this one that I have 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.270
 attacked with tanks and with and with doctors 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.040
 many doctors worth have nine tanks 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.600
 and eight medical level 8 tanks inmates 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.450
 whole with what good because I think 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.470
 that equated to me to my boats would be 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.440
 two doctors' boats and the rest 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.060
 tanks more or less I think that does not 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.710
 even up to three doctors' boats 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.960
 I would have to look at it okay but 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.490
 tanks and many doctors would be the other 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.220
 option worth here has let me loose 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.350
 the base of new tanks and doctors but 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.880
 this time many tanks and few doctors 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.040
 we will not distinguish what we are going to 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.080
 distinguish it well many tanks and few 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.700
 and few doctors would be this this 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.320
 option and the next thing to see when he has 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.630
 been the last time I have been returned to 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.030
 jump here with warriors worth 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.640
 Well, we have thugs and zukas 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.130
 many tanks and few doctors few 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.930
 tanks and many doctors and we would have 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.860
 then warriors then I the beaches 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.530
 in which he had thought are those of 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.330
 up is that I want I want stones 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.670
 I want defensive statues then 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.070
 I need stones from the villages that there are 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.390
 around here then well this is the one 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.680
 the last survey has come out not the 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.820
 I wanted to go with what this is going to 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.400
 let's leave it there 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.370
 then we will use the animax 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.990
 ok let's visit her and let's see what 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.370
 we have around here, this is the beach 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.260
 of level 41 wimax well 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.210
 affordable not in theory then I for 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.950
 attack this I propose and well a 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.720
 it has to be with tanks and doctors this 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.410
 will be with many tanks and few 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.120
 Doctors worth so and then backwards not 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.410
 is better upside down with few tanks and 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.580
 many doctors this is the one that have the 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.710
 I have to carry two or three 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.330
 medical boats worth and tanks and the 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.250
 another and the other alternative to pass me 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.800
 is this beach would be a bully and if you touch 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.720
 so we're going to do it and the other is 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.520
 is here in China is that 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.220
 I think I have never repeated it with her 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.010
 with one of their names is worth more 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.720
 bush 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.920
 This is hard because you have the 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.540
 how many cannons there are around here 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.610
 here close with which are the tanks 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.709
 they will deliver but good for this I 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.329
 decided to bring the one with many tanks and 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.040
 few doctors because if there are many 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.810
 tanks and few doctors why that's why 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.250
 has changed before because of course here but 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.690
 logically having many doctors do not 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.099
 it's worth nothing because here every cannon 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.390
 I blow a tank of truth 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.099
 I do not know very well what this would be like 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.950
 I believe that it would be a suicide 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.480
 but good in short many tanks few 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.620
 doctors for is for this base or if not 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.599
 warriors that I think is the easy thing 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.609
 you get here bomb graves the barracks 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.319
 general and it's over but good at last the 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.459
 decision is yours the survey is in 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.359
 the description do not forget about rule 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.239
 of calvillo before voting in the 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.970
 survey and we go with the attack that 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.650
 you have voted to attack this village 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.329
 we explore it first with warriors 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.310
 I think that simple of this basis with 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.950
 warriors, I'm just going to let them go 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.360
 around here and I do not know if I'm going to group here 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.980
 the veils I will bring directly here 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.620
 to see the difficulty that this base has 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.570
 young man that life bonus has not me 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.100
 I just gave an account right now 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.979
 piece of life bonus that they have health 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.330
 building 29% ok then you make a 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.740
 masterpiece and that one goes out because it said 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.960
 of masterpiece and people get a 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.639
 super masterpiece good in short I'm going to 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.930
 take the warriors around here I guess 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.120
 that I will have to cure them because here 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.889
 there are mines that man do 126 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.389
 walk eye with the mines 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.639
 eye with the mines in fact I think that 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.050
 I'm going to destroy these two with one of 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.180
 these three I'm going to load these two 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.919
 mine just in case and well then nothing 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.689
 I will bring them all here at headquarters the 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.159
 swear and destroy everything and what 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:51.990
 I'm going to do simply because there's no 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:53.490
 many defenses around here unique 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.590
 and I will exclusively devote to stun 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.090
 these three are worth especially 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.710
 servers the one that worries me the most because 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.240
 the stunned one can shoot me at 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.409
 group of warriors out there and to the 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.389
 final because they are warriors that are not going to 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:04.919
 are not going to be attacking come 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.509
 Let's go to Lillo, we're going to go 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.159
 everything okay please leave everything all right 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.760
 please I can not look bad in front of 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:14.420
 my subscribers are worth 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.890
 there we are going to break these two mines is not 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.290
 strictly necessary to do this but 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.200
 good is that they are 300 points of damage that 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.210
 I can avoid myself so I do not see why 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.660
 I was going to stop doing it come on let's go 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.340
 let's say let's smoke here 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.830
 we are going to release here all 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.820
 warriors and we go to as soon as 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.820
 they begin to gather there we go 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.680
 another here another 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.919
 and here we qualify as 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.780
 I do not want to lose him and warriors guachimán 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.759
 he has hunted me they have hunted me the dazed 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.030
 I have been hunted at a given moment 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:53.889
 there we can stun it again and I'm 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.389
 here receiving a lot of damage with everyone 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.190
 the warriors, because there I am going 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.110
 healing and prepared to launch another 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.550
 stunner good I think I think what 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.229
 I get it and I think I get it 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.850
 5 of energy that I will spend on a 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.460
 pepinazo to the headquarters already gives me 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.479
 I do not care just like all 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.180
 get 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:12.970
 voucher voucher voucher voucher good voucher 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.800
 there is no or bad despite that because in the 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.120
 horror me a little energy you know 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.229
 you know usually I usually throw a 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.210
 flare in the for example in flamethrower 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.560
 would be to throw smoke there is a flare and 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.120
 that all are grouped there so the 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.500
 I take them all together and then as they go 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.000
 direct to the headquarters by 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.599
 save me just that flare at 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.070
 final the stunned has got that 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:31.780
 make me a little group write it there 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.880
 because of the smoke a small group has caught me and I 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.199
 you could move but well I think that 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.090
 there have come a large part of the 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:38.500
 low and then others of the mines and that 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.610
 in the mines I do not know if they have reached me 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.870
 kill some but they have come super 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.430
 touched of life that is could have 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.570
 dead all because we would end up another 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.160
 level of precision I'm not able to 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.480
 control but good in any case 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.390
 in the end 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.950
 good news because I won 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.660
 won and also not not bad it is not 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.670
 Nor are many resources abided 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.080
 but but they are not not bad there they are 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.970
 the fireworks we released a 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.770
 little beach that is going to be giving me a 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.240
 little bit of gold every hour and well 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.620
 nothing guys remember canada with the 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.120
 description I will put the survey I hope 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.680
 that I do not forget, usually not anymore 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.260
 I forget that was part of the past 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.680
 so there you have all the options 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:14.440
 It is worth repeating that attack was to attack 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.150
 this beach is worth beach number 1 and 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.310
 options were to attack with few tanks and 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.800
 many doctors or attack with thugs and 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:23.260
 sugar is the other beach that would be the 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.330
 beach number 2 the first option the 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.010
 option would be to attack with very many 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.870
 tanks and few doctors or if not attack 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.460
 with warriors you decide 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.020

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.820
