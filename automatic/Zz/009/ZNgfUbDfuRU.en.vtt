00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 two 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.750
 if you want this and other fantastic 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.500
 figures visit big bad toy store in the 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.500
 link of the description 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.960
 how about friends trans fans is from strooper 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.900
 and I welcome you to another one 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.890
 video review this time I bring you 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.130
 a side planes of generation one in all 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.410
 its splendor in a very beautiful color 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.190
 purple purple decepticon 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:43.420
 and then a pretty pretty figure 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:47.590
 peculiar and this and well loved by 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.750
 the veterans because we already know that this 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.260
 cycle we came out initially in the 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.789
 movie of 86 and then from there 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.110
 followed in the following seasons of 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.320
 transformers 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.809
 then the second in command after 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.600
 galba troll 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:13.750
 the figure is already old and 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.850
 pretty loose out there is already going to 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.539
 give account in the transformation very 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.520
 pretty is very well preserved 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.850
 I bought already and already has while the 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.850
 I bought 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.460
 although you need some out there 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.390
 they are stickers but it is quite 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.390
 fairly good 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.780
 pretty big there we can see the 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.780
 let's compare it with 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:53.320
 let's compare it with this 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.759
 with fire line firefly generations and then 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.759
 how can you tell 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.250
 This guy is quite big 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.250
 take 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.390
 it's pretty big to those who do not 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.680
 let's put it here 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.470
 and then we are going to transform what they 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.069
 it seems what we are going to do first then 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:24.290
 is to close the landing gear here 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.290
 it's so simple 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.819
 work the feet and legs of this 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.120
 way 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:36.170
 we raise our feet 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:40.560
 from here back the panels were opened 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.520
 thus they give dimension to the legs 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.520
 after here 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.690
 we hear that back 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.090
 from here we are going to throw back the 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.030
 rooms and these are the pieces that 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:00.140
 I say they are pretty loose 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.910
 and that's why they took one of the 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.900
 reasons why they took the goal 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.140
 to the figures that is this 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.930
 metal and plastic as obviously 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.790
 the plastic in a joint is going to 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.870
 beat the plastic faster so 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.840
 for the passage of time passes this 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.510
 which is not something that does not happen with 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.540
 the pieces now that do not bring metal and 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.440
 therefore they last longer than here 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.400
 they have been missing 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.400
 turn this 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.640
 A) Yes 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.099
 we want this here 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.510
 we move though really 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:54.030
 these can be without start have 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.030
 to move or would have to be 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.460
 it is in the hands 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:07.280
 with everything and what is already transformed 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:11.480
 he looks extremely funny 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:15.819
 there is a pillar friend out there 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:19.180
 love cycling your bunny 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:22.919
 this little girl who's wearing apricots 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.919
 friends of this 21st century 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.319
 that all its splendor 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.740
 with joints obviously 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:36.389
 very limited but that does not mean that it is 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:39.210
 a beautiful figure because imagine 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.870
 for the new era that a power 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.370
 this 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:50.800
 to turn this spacecraft into a jet 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:53.620
 robot, how nice is this here? 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.700
 because his half-molded hands there are 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.700
 they can see half 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.639
 they do not have the shape of fingers but 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.310
 there they have a hole where we can 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.449
 put your gun that by the way for some 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.430
 reason not 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.830
 do not be 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.870
 He does not force, he does not grab him 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.300
 strength but the good thing is that I do not know 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.060
 you fall there at least you can 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.190
 hold it a little 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.129
 the joints of this figure then 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:27.759
 let's remove it here 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:31.659
 we already saw that they can move their arms in 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:34.300
 a fairly long long range 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:38.200
 quite big enough can turn the 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:41.790
 forearms has elbows 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.790
 it's fine I think that 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:49.659
 I do not think I do not know do not separate the 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:53.139
 arms up and this one does not have 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:56.289
 articulation in the neck for nothing the 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:59.180
 legs, if you can raise them 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:02.230
 it can be a little bit to the back 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.289
 Here's what else is 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:07.400
 listen 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:11.919
 the rope action and 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.919
 it's pretty nice this 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:20.029
 I can not bend my knees to a 

00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:22.780
 considerable range and you can put 

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:27.370
 that can be 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:28.389
 can do some pose is very very 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.650
 limited 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.720
 d 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.790
 there 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:38.580
 no casino 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.580
 well he almost tried 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:44.490
 and it feels really weird that all the 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.490
 pieces of loose medium good not all 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:51.349
 this but then there are friends and we are going to 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.349
 compare it in size 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.319
 let's put it there 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.270
 with a character from his character era 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.430
 not figurative 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:06.240
 there is this 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.240
 training 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.660
 aside from this power 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.969
 and then we see that it is not so good, 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:21.420
 It is so good plate 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:23.280
 It has a good size and this 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.230
 and look better for collectors 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:29.280
 veterans to have a site and those of the 

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:35.200
 collection is simply indispensable 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:37.830
 yes we are this collectors of yesteryear 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.900
 and then this was that a use of 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.650
 transformers that one I hope you have 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:48.040
 liked 

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:48.040
 see you next video cu√≠dense chau
