00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.339
 today we will learn to do our 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.799
 own accessories for the cell phone 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.799
 let's see the materials that we will need 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:19.270
 brushes and our acrylic paints 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.930
 liquid glue a cutter scissors 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.410
 a pencil 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.570
 and to give shine to our figure 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.420
 They can be varnish or some enamel 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.489
 transparent and also cold porcelain 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.650
 that if you do not know how to make it down you 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.320
 I will leave the link we will also need 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.330
 some hearing aids that we no longer use alone 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.730
 we are going to need the entrance of the 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.739
 hearing aids so we're going to remove it with 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.020
 very careful and with the help of our 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.540
 scissors or some extract let's start 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.210
 to withdraw what is left to leave the 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.400
 final the metallic something that you can now 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.079
 do in your trips is that you do not throw 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.090
 the headphones that give you in the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.520
 buses since now you will be able to 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.950
 recycle and make an extender me for your 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.259
 cell phone also in some stores 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.940
 crafts already see something like this 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.160
 but plastic I really have not 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.009
 found so I preferred to recycle 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.020
 you can or can not remove this black part that 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.350
 you see here everything depends on the figure that 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.290
 go to do now let's introduce it 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.630
 and we will see to what limit we have for 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.399
 put our figure we continue 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.380
 making a cold porcelain ball 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.870
 that will be the body of the rabbit 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.720
 we put liquid glue 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.880
 with some strong glue that prevents 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.980
 our figure comes off and then 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.980
 let's introduce the rabbit's body 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.420
 with the help of the exact one we will make 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.610
 small holes that this will help us 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.630
 to the rabbit legs adhere 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.630
 better with the glue 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.150
 with the help of some draft or even 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.340
 your finger we are going to crush a bit the 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.850
 top part and then we paste the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.850
 head 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.259
 it is important that we let a 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.759
 little figure every time we paste a 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.739
 piece 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.170
 for the part of the ears also 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.960
 we will make two holes and then the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.750
 we stick 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.570
 we will make a long strip we crush it 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.190
 little and now let's cut the size 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.190
 from the ears of our rabbit 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.350
 let's cut out the part of 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.240
 below the ears so that it 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.240
 can better adhere to the figure 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.400
 remember that you have to let it dry a bit 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.040
 the figure before continuing to hit more 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.170
 parts like that are not going to come off and 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.270
 here I have finished pasting everything we are going to 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.640
 let the figure dry for a day 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.340
 in this case we are going to paint the first 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.010
 White color 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.090
 we immediately painted his face and then 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.090
 some details 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.310
 to protect our figure we are going to 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.310
 use some clear varnish or enamel 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.380
 and well that's how we have our 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.900
 accessory finally I'm going to put you with 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.810
 You look at a scarf so you do not 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.360
 feel naked and a little varnish to 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.940
 that the knot is not undone we end 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.040
 our flirty bunny is already more than 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.590
 put to go out with us to where 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.810
 you want if you make certain or another figure 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.400
 below I will leave you in the links of our 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.830
 social networks to send me the 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.600
 photos and show me how you fit us 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.600
 we see in the next tutorial chao
