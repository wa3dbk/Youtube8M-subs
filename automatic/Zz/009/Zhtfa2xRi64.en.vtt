00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.740 
to use that have been created later than
2008<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.150> shouldn't<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.570> an<00:01:42.659> issue

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
2008 but that shouldn't be an issue

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.560 
2008 but that shouldn't be an issue
because<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.680> most<00:01:43.860> pcs<00:01:44.189> aren't<00:01:44.460> aren't<00:01:45.180> from

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
because the most pcs aren't aren't from

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.719 
because the most pcs aren't aren't from
that<00:01:45.750> time<00:01:45.990> period<00:01:46.020> anyway<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.070> we're<00:01:47.640> going

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
that time period anyway so we're going

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.760 
that time period anyway so we're going
to<00:01:47.820> start<00:01:48.090> off<00:01:48.240> with<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.689> actual<00:01:48.990> ps2<00:01:49.560> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
to start off with the actual ps2 and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.740 
to start off with the actual ps2 and
getting<00:01:50.340> rid<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.670> sensors<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.600> you

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
getting rid of the sensors so that you

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.580 
getting rid of the sensors so that you
can<00:01:51.930> do<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.320> swap<00:01:52.590> trick<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.579> mod<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.360> ps2<00:01:54.840> now

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
can do the swap trick to mod the ps2 now

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.109 
can do the swap trick to mod the ps2 now
to<00:01:55.680> start<00:01:55.860> off<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.130> basically<00:01:56.399> flip<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> ps2

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
to start off you basically flip the ps2

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.420 
to start off you basically flip the ps2
over<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.770> you're<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.920> notice<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.219> you

and again just I really recommend just
getting<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.370> doubles<00:02:54.700> have<00:02:54.850> an<00:02:54.940> agent<00:02:55.210> under

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
getting a doubles have an agent under

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.480 
getting a doubles have an agent under
fire<00:02:55.420> it's<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.440> easiest<00:02:56.860> game<00:02:57.070> to<00:02:57.250> do<00:02:57.370> this

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
fire it's the easiest game to do this

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.800 
fire it's the easiest game to do this
mod<00:02:57.760> with<00:02:58.470> just<00:02:59.470> because<00:02:59.880> it's<00:03:00.880> so<00:03:01.360> simple<00:03:01.630> to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
mod with just because it's so simple to

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.950 
mod with just because it's so simple to
do<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:03.480> exploit<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.660> you<00:03:04.750> do<00:03:04.840> with

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
do it and the exploit that you do with

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.290 
do it and the exploit that you do with
on<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.080> second<00:03:05.380> level<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.770> game<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.300> it's

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
on the second level of the game so it's

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:14.020 
on the second level of the game so it's
pretty<00:03:07.870> simple<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.260> get<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:11.250> any<00:03:12.250> nice

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
pretty simple to get to any nice

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.470 
pretty simple to get to any nice
it's<00:03:14.390> done<00:03:14.630> here

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.570 

so<00:03:18.140> you<00:03:18.200> take<00:03:18.349> it<00:03:18.440> off<00:03:18.560> now<00:03:19.160> what<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.370> do<00:03:19.459> is

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
so you take it off now what you do is

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.490 
so you take it off now what you do is
you<00:03:19.670> flip<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.970> ps2<00:03:20.330> over<00:03:20.599> make<00:03:21.230> sure<00:03:21.260> you

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
you flip the ps2 over make sure you

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.170 
you flip the ps2 over make sure you
don't<00:03:21.620> open<00:03:21.739> it<00:03:21.890> up<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.129> the<00:03:22.190> back<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.550> you

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
don't open it up in the back and you

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.550 
don't open it up in the back and you
just<00:03:23.209> basically<00:03:23.540> take<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.810> top<00:03:24.019> off<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.410> top

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
just basically take the top off the top

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.410 
just basically take the top off the top
half<00:03:24.739> it<00:03:24.980> may<00:03:25.459> feel<00:03:25.700> like<00:03:25.760> you're<00:03:26.000> breaking<00:03:26.120> it

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
half it may feel like you're breaking it

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.369 
half it may feel like you're breaking it
but<00:03:26.569> don't<00:03:26.720> worry<00:03:26.810> nothing's<00:03:27.230> going<00:03:27.349> to

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
but don't worry nothing's going to

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.540 
but don't worry nothing's going to
happen<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.739> your<00:03:27.830> ps2<00:03:28.300> it'll<00:03:29.300> be<00:03:29.390> just<00:03:29.599> fine

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
happen to your ps2 it'll be just fine

happen to your ps2 it'll be just fine
you<00:03:31.550> just<00:03:31.610> take<00:03:31.879> the<00:03:32.000> top<00:03:32.150> off<00:03:35.080> can<00:03:36.080> be<00:03:36.110> a

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
you just take the top off can be a

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.390 
you just take the top off can be a
little<00:03:37.269> off<00:03:38.590> as<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:39.830> can<00:03:40.040> see<00:03:40.190> there's<00:03:40.370> a

anyways<00:03:49.459> so<00:03:49.610> once<00:03:49.760> your<00:03:49.880> peers<00:03:50.090> 2<00:03:50.209> is<00:03:50.269> open<00:03:50.390> it

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
anyways so once your peers 2 is open it

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:51.490 
anyways so once your peers 2 is open it
should<00:03:50.690> look<00:03:50.810> at<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:50.989> should<00:03:51.140> look<00:03:51.230> like<00:03:51.260> this

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
should look at it should look like this

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.080 
should look at it should look like this
be<00:03:51.950> careful<00:03:51.980> of<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.400> power<00:03:52.610> cord<00:03:52.760> right<00:03:53.000> here

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
be careful of the power cord right here

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.210 
be careful of the power cord right here
I<00:03:53.390> kind<00:03:53.630> of<00:03:53.690> open<00:03:54.260> that<00:03:54.290> by<00:03:54.590> accident<00:03:54.739> when<00:03:55.190> I

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
I kind of open that by accident when I

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.890 
I kind of open that by accident when I
was<00:03:55.310> open<00:03:55.610> money<00:03:55.760> when<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.420> was<00:03:56.450> opening<00:03:56.720> mine

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
was open money when I was opening mine

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.410 
was open money when I was opening mine
up<00:03:57.160> okay<00:03:58.160> anyway<00:03:58.459> so<00:03:58.489> what<00:03:58.880> you<00:03:58.970> want<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.150> do<00:03:59.239> is

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
up okay anyway so what you want to do is

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.569 
up okay anyway so what you want to do is
you<00:03:59.989> want<00:04:00.140> to<00:04:00.170> get<00:04:00.319> to<00:04:00.500> this<00:04:00.620> sensor<00:04:01.370> right

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
you want to get to this sensor right

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.240 
you want to get to this sensor right
here<00:04:02.110> you<00:04:03.110> can<00:04:03.260> look<00:04:03.380> for<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:03.709> it's<00:04:03.890> on<00:04:04.069> the

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
here you can look for it it's on the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.130 
here you can look for it it's on the
back<00:04:04.430> end<00:04:04.640> of<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.790> ps2<00:04:05.000> it's<00:04:05.420> right<00:04:06.019> in

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
back end of the ps2 it's right in

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.960 
back end of the ps2 it's right in
between<00:04:06.260> this<00:04:06.590> little<00:04:06.799> screw<00:04:07.040> slot<00:04:07.430> here<00:04:07.790> and

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
between this little screw slot here and

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.030 
between this little screw slot here and
this<00:04:08.120> little<00:04:08.390> pin<00:04:08.870> here<00:04:09.110> there's<00:04:09.769> going<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:09.980> be

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
this little pin here there's going to be

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.890 
this little pin here there's going to be
a<00:04:10.099> sensor<00:04:10.400> right<00:04:10.519> here<00:04:10.579> what<00:04:11.299> it<00:04:11.390> basically<00:04:11.480> is

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
a sensor right here what it basically is

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.630 
a sensor right here what it basically is
it's<00:04:12.079> a<00:04:12.170> push<00:04:12.380> in<00:04:12.590> sensor<00:04:12.950> it's<00:04:13.190> like<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.340> button

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
it's a push in sensor it's like a button

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.789 
it's a push in sensor it's like a button
when<00:04:14.120> it's<00:04:14.239> pushed<00:04:14.480> in<00:04:14.690> it<00:04:14.930> thinks<00:04:15.620> that<00:04:15.650> the

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
when it's pushed in it thinks that the

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.190 
when it's pushed in it thinks that the
ps2<00:04:16.489> tray<00:04:16.820> is<00:04:16.970> closed<00:04:17.269> so<00:04:17.810> what<00:04:17.930> you<00:04:18.019> want<00:04:18.139> to

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
ps2 tray is closed so what you want to

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.879 
ps2 tray is closed so what you want to
do<00:04:18.260> is<00:04:18.320> you<00:04:18.380> want<00:04:18.500> take<00:04:18.590> a<00:04:18.620> little<00:04:18.739> bit<00:04:18.829> of

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
do is you want take a little bit of

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.800 
do is you want take a little bit of
sticky<00:04:19.040> tack<00:04:19.340> and<00:04:19.579> tack<00:04:19.970> that<00:04:20.000> on<00:04:20.329> right<00:04:20.600> there

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
sticky tack and tack that on right there

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.240 
sticky tack and tack that on right there
like<00:04:21.019> I<00:04:21.139> have<00:04:21.320> there<00:04:21.530> add<00:04:21.650> some<00:04:21.799> sticky<00:04:22.070> tack

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
like I have there add some sticky tack

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.340 
like I have there add some sticky tack
down<00:04:22.460> there<00:04:22.700> masking<00:04:23.479> tape<00:04:23.630> works<00:04:23.870> just<00:04:24.080> fine

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
down there masking tape works just fine

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.200 
down there masking tape works just fine
electrical<00:04:24.919> tape<00:04:24.950> works<00:04:25.250> just<00:04:25.430> fine<00:04:25.580> just

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
electrical tape works just fine just

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.150 
electrical tape works just fine just
make<00:04:26.389> sure<00:04:26.570> you<00:04:26.690> close<00:04:26.900> that<00:04:27.110> off<00:04:27.139> once<00:04:28.039> you

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
make sure you close that off once you

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.529 
make sure you close that off once you
have<00:04:28.340> that<00:04:28.520> closed<00:04:28.820> off<00:04:29.080> take<00:04:30.080> your<00:04:30.260> ps2<00:04:30.500> lid

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
have that closed off take your ps2 lid

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.960 
have that closed off take your ps2 lid
put<00:04:32.539> it<00:04:32.660> back<00:04:32.810> on<00:04:33.020> snap<00:04:33.979> on<00:04:34.220> in<00:04:34.340> place<00:04:34.580> like<00:04:35.270> so

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
put it back on snap on in place like so

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:52.499 
put it back on snap on in place like so
and<00:04:37.970> you<00:04:38.360> just<00:04:38.479> put<00:04:38.600> your<00:04:38.690> screws<00:04:38.960> back<00:04:39.200> in

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.730 

okay<00:04:53.509> so<00:04:53.750> now<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:53.930> next<00:04:54.110> two<00:04:54.289> sentences<00:04:54.620> you

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
okay so now the next two sentences you

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.790 
okay so now the next two sentences you
have<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:54.919> deal<00:04:55.069> with<00:04:55.250> are<00:04:55.460> right<00:04:55.970> here<00:04:56.419> and

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
have to deal with are right here and

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.610 
have to deal with are right here and
right<00:04:57.800> here<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:59.720> back<00:04:59.870> right<00:05:00.050> there<00:05:00.229> it's<00:05:00.500> a

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
right here the back right there it's a

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.619 
right here the back right there it's a
little<00:05:00.800> bit<00:05:00.889> of<00:05:00.979> a<00:05:01.039> push<00:05:01.220> sensor<00:05:01.610> as<00:05:01.789> you<00:05:02.479> can

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:02.629 
little bit of a push sensor as you can

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.100 
little bit of a push sensor as you can
see<00:05:02.840> it<00:05:03.169> pushes<00:05:03.830> up<00:05:04.009> when<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.849> limit<00:05:05.840> ray<00:05:05.990> is

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
see it pushes up when the limit ray is

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.930 
see it pushes up when the limit ray is
closed<00:05:06.379> so<00:05:07.129> what<00:05:07.280> you<00:05:07.370> basically<00:05:07.490> do<00:05:07.759> to<00:05:07.849> take

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
closed so what you basically do to take

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.369 
closed so what you basically do to take
care<00:05:08.060> of<00:05:08.150> these<00:05:08.270> sensors<00:05:08.629> is<00:05:08.720> you<00:05:09.169> take<00:05:09.349> a

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:09.379 
care of these sensors is you take a

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:11.320 
care of these sensors is you take a
little<00:05:09.560> piece<00:05:09.740> of<00:05:09.860> paper<00:05:10.009> and<00:05:10.340> you<00:05:10.909> just<00:05:11.090> wedge

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
little piece of paper and you just wedge

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.999 
little piece of paper and you just wedge
it<00:05:11.509> in<00:05:11.629> right<00:05:11.930> here<00:05:12.259> so<00:05:12.289> that<00:05:12.470> this<00:05:12.770> little

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
it in right here so that this little

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.100 
it in right here so that this little
piece<00:05:13.129> can't<00:05:13.610> come<00:05:13.879> back<00:05:14.030> down<00:05:14.270> to<00:05:14.479> stop<00:05:14.750> a<00:05:14.780> CD

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
piece can't come back down to stop a CD

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.070 
piece can't come back down to stop a CD
from<00:05:15.199> spinning<00:05:15.849> for<00:05:16.849> example<00:05:17.300> put<00:05:17.509> the<00:05:17.539> CD<00:05:17.870> and

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
from spinning for example put the CD and

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.200 
from spinning for example put the CD and
you'll<00:05:18.379> see<00:05:18.590> it's<00:05:19.220> down<00:05:19.550> right<00:05:19.789> here<00:05:20.000> right

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
you'll see it's down right here right

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.180 
you'll see it's down right here right
along<00:05:20.449> the<00:05:20.539> CDs<00:05:20.870> edge<00:05:21.110> so<00:05:21.530> it<00:05:21.650> stops<00:05:21.889> it<00:05:22.069> from

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
along the CDs edge so it stops it from

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.159 
along the CDs edge so it stops it from
spinning<00:05:22.430> however<00:05:23.360> if<00:05:23.569> you<00:05:23.659> have<00:05:23.810> it<00:05:23.930> closed

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
spinning however if you have it closed

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.870 
spinning however if you have it closed
like<00:05:24.380> that<00:05:24.530> and<00:05:24.770> wedged<00:05:25.190> open<00:05:25.370> like<00:05:25.639> that<00:05:25.669> the

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
like that and wedged open like that the

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.559 
like that and wedged open like that the
CD<00:05:26.120> can<00:05:26.240> spin<00:05:26.479> just<00:05:26.690> on<00:05:27.819> and<00:05:28.819> again<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.419> last

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:29.569 
CD can spin just on and again the last

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.719 
CD can spin just on and again the last
sensor<00:05:29.990> is<00:05:30.169> right<00:05:30.349> here<00:05:30.650> you<00:05:31.340> just<00:05:31.520> take<00:05:31.639> a

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
sensor is right here you just take a

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:33.580 
sensor is right here you just take a
little<00:05:31.940> bit<00:05:32.030> piece<00:05:32.389> of<00:05:32.509> paper<00:05:32.690> stick<00:05:33.349> it<00:05:33.470> in

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
little bit piece of paper stick it in

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.870 
little bit piece of paper stick it in
there<00:05:33.770> you<00:05:34.039> can<00:05:34.159> secure<00:05:34.460> it<00:05:34.490> down<00:05:34.580> with<00:05:34.759> some

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
there you can secure it down with some

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.969 
there you can secure it down with some
sticky<00:05:35.150> tack<00:05:35.330> if<00:05:35.479> you<00:05:35.569> want<00:05:35.780> or<00:05:36.380> some<00:05:36.590> tape<00:05:36.770> and

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
sticky tack if you want or some tape and

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.149 
sticky tack if you want or some tape and
you<00:05:37.610> just<00:05:37.789> close<00:05:38.030> the<00:05:38.060> tray<00:05:38.449> to<00:05:38.509> push<00:05:38.810> it<00:05:38.960> down

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
you just close the tray to push it down

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.260 
you just close the tray to push it down
open<00:05:40.159> the<00:05:40.190> tray<00:05:40.370> back<00:05:40.580> up<00:05:40.789> and<00:05:40.970> should<00:05:41.150> be

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
open the tray back up and should be

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.330 
open the tray back up and should be
pushed<00:05:41.509> down<00:05:41.599> like<00:05:42.139> mine<00:05:42.349> is<00:05:42.590> right<00:05:42.889> there<00:05:43.130> and

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
pushed down like mine is right there and

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.100 
pushed down like mine is right there and
then<00:05:44.240> that's<00:05:44.389> it<00:05:44.509> that's<00:05:44.599> all<00:05:44.780> you're<00:05:44.900> that's

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
then that's it that's all you're that's

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.140 
then that's it that's all you're that's
all<00:05:45.199> you<00:05:45.289> have<00:05:45.409> to<00:05:45.469> do<00:05:45.590> with<00:05:45.710> the<00:05:45.770> ps2<00:05:46.039> for<00:05:46.310> now

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.260 

okay

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
okay

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.249 
okay
so<00:05:50.389> that's<00:05:50.629> all<00:05:50.750> you<00:05:50.870> have<00:05:50.960> to<00:05:51.050> worry<00:05:51.199> about

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259 
so that's all you have to worry about

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:54.309 
so that's all you have to worry about
for<00:05:51.680> the<00:05:51.740> actual<00:05:51.979> ps2<00:05:52.460> part<00:05:52.699> now<00:05:53.210> the<00:05:53.990> rest<00:05:54.139> of

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 
for the actual ps2 part now the rest of

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:57.580 
for the actual ps2 part now the rest of
it<00:05:54.440> is<00:05:54.680> software<00:05:55.490> and<00:05:56.259> that<00:05:57.259> adds<00:05:57.469> a<00:05:57.500> little

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
it is software and that adds a little

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.730 
it is software and that adds a little
bit<00:05:57.710> more<00:05:57.919> tricky<00:05:58.130> so<00:05:58.880> just<00:05:59.840> click<00:05:59.960> on<00:06:00.110> the

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
bit more tricky so just click on the

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.209 
bit more tricky so just click on the
next<00:06:01.009> video<00:06:01.159> for<00:06:01.550> part<00:06:02.270> two<00:06:02.509> and<00:06:03.099> you<00:06:04.099> will

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:04.219 
next video for part two and you will

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:05.379 
next video for part two and you will
figure<00:06:04.400> out<00:06:04.520> how<00:06:04.580> to<00:06:04.639> do<00:06:04.789> the<00:06:04.880> software<00:06:05.240> stuff

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
figure out how to do the software stuff

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.149 
figure out how to do the software stuff
I'll<00:06:05.569> take<00:06:06.139> you<00:06:06.259> through<00:06:06.409> that<00:06:06.500> step<00:06:06.770> by<00:06:06.919> step

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159 
I'll take you through that step by step

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:09.909 
I'll take you through that step by step
Thanks
