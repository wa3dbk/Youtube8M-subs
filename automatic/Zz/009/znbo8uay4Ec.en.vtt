00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.970
 The teacher comes to the classroom greets 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.410
 and then says the board is not 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.730
 cleaned and what do you do then 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.390
 probably someone gets up and pulse the 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.269
 blackboard 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.860
 how come, after all, the teacher has yes 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.590
 not that he cleaned the blackboard 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.650
 but he should somehow mean that 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.300
 or 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.140
 Are you sure that you are your teacher 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.770
 Yes , I understand correctly 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.770
 yes not 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.440
 we humans are already a bit 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.330
 weirdly there are always misunderstandings 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.820
 when we talk 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.920
 how come that and why is that 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.370
 everything between man and woman so often the 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.010
 case 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.989
 This phenomenon has, among other things 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.150
 the psychologists paul watzlawick and 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.340
 dedicated to friedemann schulz of thun and 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.230
 the four ears model also like that 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.170
 Communication square is called 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.790
 developed under the designation four 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.650
 ears model is best 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.180
 Imagine misunderstandings 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.400
 coming 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.560
 if a person says something this can 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.570
 statement from another person 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.990
 conceived of four different types 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.750
 become 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.150
 that's why there are four ears there 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.850
 Sector level the self-disclosure level 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.310
 the relationship level and the holds off level 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.229
 and whichever we hear with 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.750
 we completely understand that 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.420
 wrong that happens between man and 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.040
 Woman so often because women mostly 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.750
 the appeal therefore a kind of 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.380
 to understand the request and the man 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.490
 often with the sachebene only hears 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.830
 The same applies when speaking 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.840
 So we speak on four levels 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.790
 that's hard for yourself 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.780
 comprehensible because you also 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.210
 only on one level hears and talks 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.970
 But what do the individual levels involve? 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.100
 because actually things should be level 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.409
 It is easy to be in 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.810
 principle exactly what a person says 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.190
 So your teacher says that the blackboard 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.110
 not cleaned then he poses 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.830
 factual that there is something else on it 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.410
 is written 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.360
 the self-disclosure level is in 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.730
 this example a bit more difficult 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.440
 on this level, all that moves 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.160
 the speaker of the sentence about itself 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.840
 reveals 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.670
 in our case that is not direct 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.920
 readable but we'll do it again soon 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.420
 better example of the teacher could be 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.130
 possibly express that he 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.130
 noticed that you do not care about them 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.140
 Keep the rules and do not clean the blackboard 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.940
 the relationship level includes what 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.980
 the other one holds and who else 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.690
 One is the teacher could be so 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.569
 be disappointed because you never got the blackboard 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.760
 dressing though you promised it and 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.650
 Last but not least, it will take off 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.180
 with this ear you hear what the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.660
 actually speaking of you 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.910
 That's because you want to clean the blackboard 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.560
 somehow already crazy one says 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.380
 the blackboard is not cleaned and the 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.140
 others understand the blackboard has said it 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.670
 but nobody if your teacher so pure 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.590
 comes and says the blackboard is not 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.000
 The boys are usually cleaned shortly 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.760
 look up and the teacher quietly 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.100
 agree jupp just right there is only 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.960
 what the girls will be 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.350
 jump up and quickly clean the blackboard 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.570
 want 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.430
 unless you are already in the 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.590
 puberty then he hears the appeal but 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.850
 pretend he's with something 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.300
 busy and hopes that someone 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.170
 but it has to clean with the other 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.460
 four ears absolutely nothing to do 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.160
 why am I actually telling you this? 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.750
 Now, on the one hand, the communication 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.880
 ready in German and psychology 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.470
 teaching in high school and taught 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.600
 on the other hand it provides you with the 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.890
 explanation why we sometimes easy 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.980
 do not understand what the other one 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.330
 actually a lesson wants us 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.250
 we do not forget our life 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.980
 should because she makes life with 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.660
 He believes that he is much simpler 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.210
 Do not look at the next one 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.190
 Example of the following scenario 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.800
 the woman cooked a delicious soup 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.040
 and now uses with her husband at the table he 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.900
 says there's something green in the soup that 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.750
 is the sachebene that is with man and 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.970
 Ms. same as much to the good ones 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.459
 News from my point of view she is 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.080
 even at the tree level following that 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.780
 I do not know 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.520
 the relationship level is completely logical 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.190
 that cooked you have to know what that is 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.799
 if it was not a soup of the day he was fine 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.590
 right and the appel level from the men 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.540
 sight is what the green is 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.970
 there 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.340
 and now we come to the woman's view 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.650
 the marriage crash pre-programmed because we 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.580
 Sometimes women just think a lot 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.650
 complicated yes that is so 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.439
 as I said the sachebene is here too 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.180
 as something green in the soup the woman 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:43.009
 Today, even at the bar level 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.169
 Now I do not want to know one with one 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.150
 does not taste 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.189
 the relationship level should be seen from the perspective of 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.270
 be good enough for a fight 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:53.330
 because she understands 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.129
 you can not cook and the appell 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.750
 which arrives at the wife is expected 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:59.509
 my view pretty stupid 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.409
 she will never hear this again 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.860
 green stuff in there so we have the 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.409
 salad 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.969
 The man just wants to know what that is 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.190
 Green is in the soup and the woman 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:13.069
 Feels like a lousy cook 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.190
 and serves you never never never again 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:18.610
 this green stuff though the man 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.680
 maybe it tastes very good 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.740
 the ears and everyone understands something 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.540
 other only on the edge noticed this 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.250
 model should also be a reason for this 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.590
 why recently after a dispute 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.760
 quickly get along and masturbate 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.710
 can not stand for years 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.630
 as I said on this communication 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.030
 You probably only meet square in 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.140
 the upper level and there it is not synonymous 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.000
 always on the curriculum 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.770
 but even if you are not always all 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.750
 can hear out flat so you know 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.870
 now at least that's not the spokesman 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.430
 always that means what you understand 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.260
 with increasing age you will always 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.360
 better in there with the right place too 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.160
 listen and set to formulate that 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.710
 the other Seehofer stands like you 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.600
 she means the tone in which you speak 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.280
 plays a big role and some 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.050
 words can be a sweet phrase 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.690
 quickly become an insult 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.630
 leave when you answer your teacher 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.220
 then you clean the blackboard but you come 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.420
 maybe with the punishment after 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.820
 home 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.710
 Oh, and while we're at it, this one 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.570
 Misunderstandings can be found increasingly in 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.940
 written language because you have the 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.680
 sound of the other does not stop all the more 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.970
 more important here is a suitable one 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.060
 to pay attention 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.570
 you do not want to know with which 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.600
 I sometimes have communication problems 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.160
 to fight under my videos 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.610
 to recognize sarcasm when in the comment 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.670
 just thanks is pretty much standing 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:41.010
 difficult but happens 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:43.110
 small tip who your next time yours 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.940
 teacher comes in and says the blackboard it 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.620
 not cleaned then ask him 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.170
 with which place should I now 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.760
 that was an appeal or talk 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.710
 you on the subject level 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.990
 I must only times now find out 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:07:00.990
 what that weird black thing in 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:03.560
 my potato porridge that's a stain 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.560
 on my glasses
