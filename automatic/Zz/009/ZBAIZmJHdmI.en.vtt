and the case i built totally out of
plexiglass<00:00:25.070> top<00:00:26.070> opens<00:00:26.519> up<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.060> i'll<00:00:27.150> close

plexiglass top opens up so i'll close
with<00:00:27.660> velcro<00:00:28.230> engines<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.369> all<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:29.880> you

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
with velcro engines and all that so you

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.860 
with velcro engines and all that so you
can<00:00:30.090> open<00:00:30.179> up<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.630> see<00:00:30.929> what's<00:00:31.109> inside<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:33.570> now

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
can open up and see what's inside so now

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.270 
can open up and see what's inside so now
i'm<00:00:34.079> going<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> hook<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.590> up<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.040> show<00:00:35.219> you
