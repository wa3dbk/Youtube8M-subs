Act<00:01:37.369> one<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:38.420> hold<00:01:38.630> down<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.899> d-pad<00:01:39.409> waiting

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
Act one you hold down the d-pad waiting

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.010 
Act one you hold down the d-pad waiting
for<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:40.219> screen<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.609> pan<00:01:40.850> then<00:01:41.479> let<00:01:41.749> go<00:01:41.780> of

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
for the screen to pan then let go of

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.559 
for the screen to pan then let go of
down<00:01:42.289> and<00:01:42.560> immediately<00:01:43.009> jump<00:01:43.579> the<00:01:44.210> camera

Spin Dash then let go and hold right you

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.309 
Spin Dash then let go and hold right you
need<00:01:52.999> to<00:01:53.119> do<00:01:53.240> this<00:01:53.359> set<00:01:53.539> of<00:01:53.630> actions<00:01:53.959> really

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
need to do this set of actions really

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:55.959 
need to do this set of actions really
fast<00:01:54.590> as<00:01:54.829> you<00:01:54.979> won't<00:01:55.159> have<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.369> lot<00:01:55.549> of<00:01:55.639> time<00:01:55.819> to

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
fast as you won't have a lot of time to

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.239 
fast as you won't have a lot of time to
perform<00:01:56.270> them<00:01:56.509> if<00:01:57.049> performed<00:01:57.499> correctly<00:01:57.530> you

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:58.249 
perform them if performed correctly you

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:59.830 
perform them if performed correctly you
should<00:01:58.429> now<00:01:58.609> be<00:01:58.670> inside<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.240> wall<00:01:59.420> once<00:01:59.719> the

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
should now be inside the wall once the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.319 
should now be inside the wall once the
camera<00:02:00.139> finds<00:02:00.499> you<00:02:00.590> again<00:02:00.889> the<00:02:01.490> next<00:02:01.880> step<00:02:02.119> is

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
camera finds you again the next step is

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.870 
camera finds you again the next step is
called<00:02:02.509> a<00:02:02.630> wall<00:02:02.899> ejection<00:02:03.609> basically<00:02:04.609> you

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
called a wall ejection basically you

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.789 
called a wall ejection basically you
want<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.149> press<00:02:05.450> left<00:02:05.810> which<00:02:06.289> will<00:02:06.439> push<00:02:06.619> you

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
want to press left which will push you

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.850 
want to press left which will push you
right<00:02:06.979> out<00:02:07.609> of<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:08.179> wall<00:02:08.300> when<00:02:09.170> inside<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.530> wall

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
right out of the wall when inside a wall

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.630 
right out of the wall when inside a wall
left<00:02:10.369> is<00:02:10.550> right<00:02:10.759> and<00:02:10.819> right<00:02:11.090> is

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
left is right and right is

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.090 
left is right and right is
simple<00:02:12.240> with<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:12.990> vertical<00:02:13.230> screen<00:02:13.860> rap

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
simple with this vertical screen rap

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.010 
simple with this vertical screen rap
just<00:02:14.640> managed<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.030> pass<00:02:15.330> through<00:02:15.630> this<00:02:15.780> wall

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
just managed to pass through this wall

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.530 
just managed to pass through this wall
and<00:02:16.290> cut<00:02:16.530> out<00:02:16.650> most<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.100> stage<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.730> what's

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
and cut out most of the stage so what's

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.880 
and cut out most of the stage so what's
really<00:02:19.020> going<00:02:19.320> on<00:02:19.440> here

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
really going on here

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.950 
really going on here
well<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:20.670> glitch<00:02:21.030> works<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:21.540> these<00:02:21.660> stages

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
well this glitch works in these stages

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.840 
well this glitch works in these stages
because<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.500> how<00:02:22.620> they're<00:02:22.800> structured<00:02:23.220> you

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
because of how they're structured you

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.490 
because of how they're structured you
can<00:02:24.000> see<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.330> regular<00:02:24.510> stage<00:02:24.900> how<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.350> has<00:02:25.470> a

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
can see in a regular stage how it has a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.710 
can see in a regular stage how it has a
definitive<00:02:26.130> top<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.610> bottom<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.480> three

definitive top and bottom the three
stages<00:02:27.960> this<00:02:28.260> trick<00:02:28.470> works<00:02:28.770> in<00:02:29.100> actually<00:02:29.640> rap

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
stages this trick works in actually rap

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.060 
stages this trick works in actually rap

there you go guys the vertical warp and
slow<00:05:43.469> glitch<00:05:43.740> all<00:05:43.979> right<00:05:44.520> can<00:05:45.300> we<00:05:45.330> do<00:05:45.569> it<00:05:45.690> in

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
slow glitch all right can we do it in

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.119 
slow glitch all right can we do it in
Sonic<00:05:46.139> 2<00:05:46.169> what<00:05:46.860> was<00:05:47.099> that<00:05:47.330> something<00:05:48.330> Sonic<00:05:48.599> 2

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:49.129

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
yeah you can do it inside to head to the

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.129 
yeah you can do it inside to head to the
metropolis<00:05:52.889> zone<00:05:53.430> this<00:05:54.060> stage<00:05:54.389> also<00:05:54.690> wraps

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
metropolis zone this stage also wraps

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.260 
metropolis zone this stage also wraps
vertically<00:05:55.770> meaning<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.310> vertical<00:05:56.759> warp<00:05:57.000> can

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
vertically meaning the vertical warp can

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.230 
vertically meaning the vertical warp can
be<00:05:57.389> used<00:05:57.599> here<00:05:57.840> to<00:05:58.129> enact<00:05:59.129> to<00:05:59.430> start<00:05:59.879> the<00:06:00.029> stage
