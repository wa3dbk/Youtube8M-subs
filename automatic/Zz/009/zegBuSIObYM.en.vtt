00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
I talked about like combining them a

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.649 
I talked about like combining them a
little<00:00:46.140> bit<00:00:46.409> earlier<00:00:46.769> and<00:00:47.369> I<00:00:47.850> decided<00:00:48.269> not<00:00:48.479> to

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
little bit earlier and I decided not to

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.060 
little bit earlier and I decided not to
do<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.619> way<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.860> they<00:00:50.040> look

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
do that I like the way that they look

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.820 
do that I like the way that they look
now<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:51.269> I<00:00:51.390> run<00:00:51.629> into<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.960> problem<00:00:52.199> down<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
now and if I run into a problem down the

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.289 
now and if I run into a problem down the
line<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.250> guess<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.790> take<00:00:53.970> the<00:00:54.089> necessary

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:54.299 
line I guess I can take the necessary

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.680 
line I guess I can take the necessary
precautions<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:55.940> as<00:00:56.940> opposed<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.390> right<00:00:57.540> now

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
precautions then as opposed to right now

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.299 
precautions then as opposed to right now
because<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> way<00:00:59.010> they<00:00:59.189> look<00:00:59.220> um
