lifting the bucket and here's your
linkage<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.549> said<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:06.780> kind<00:01:06.930> of

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
linkage like I said it's kind of

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.200 
linkage like I said it's kind of
interesting<00:01:07.500> setup<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.520> look<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:08.909> very

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
interesting setup if you look it's very

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.679 
interesting setup if you look it's very
old<00:01:09.470> we<00:01:10.470> see<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.920> cylinders<00:01:11.400> there<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.450> this

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
old we see the cylinders there and this

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.580 
old we see the cylinders there and this
this<00:01:13.430> connects<00:01:14.430> down<00:01:14.840> to<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:15.960> piece<00:01:16.259> right

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
this connects down to this piece right

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.609 
this connects down to this piece right
there<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.759> see<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> connection<00:01:18.619> and

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
there you can see the connection and

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.590 
there you can see the connection and
this<00:01:19.830> piece<00:01:20.100> would<00:01:20.340> move<00:01:20.520> back<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.360> forth

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
this piece would move back and forth

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.070 
this piece would move back and forth
with<00:01:22.140> assistance<00:01:22.710> from<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.810> can<00:01:24.810> get<00:01:24.960> my

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080

camera<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.770> freakin<00:01:26.130> focus<00:01:26.850> okay

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
camera to freakin focus okay

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.700 
camera to freakin focus okay
and<00:01:27.630> then<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.710> cylinder<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.579> there<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.780> it

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and then that cylinder up there and it

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.649 
and then that cylinder up there and it
would<00:01:31.829> move<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.220> bucket<00:01:32.369> up<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.060> down
