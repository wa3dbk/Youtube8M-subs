00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.289
 companies that mass-produce rifles

 warranty given one year first look 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.450
 what caught the eye is that the lantern from 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.620
 made of aluminum metal 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.739
 he's anodized sho and let's go 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.539
 according to the characteristics of 323 lantern lights in 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.370
 the arm is immediately visible quite heavy 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.340
 heavy for being packaged 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.260
 battery and 32 650 that is it 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.920
 non-standard tonics 8 from 650 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.980
 as on ordinary lanterns that give fat 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.870
 us these batteries are thick they have 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.510
 large capacity and 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.330
 again no one has experienced 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.060
 Manufacturer's retention keeps 5 hours 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.490
 mean easylink flashlight from 200 323 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.759
 Available in two types with heat 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.820
 Light 3500 Kelvin of warmth of light 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.869
 5000 kelvins with light 3500 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.720
 kelvin lantern 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.290
 gives out 840 tribes with the warmth of light 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.740
 Pirates of the members I will say now I donâ€™t remember 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.640
 not even 56,200 Kelvin gives 1200 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:41.720
 element now i will flashlight flashlight here 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:45.960
 here we are such a yellow light compare accent 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.130
 so here we see promises it is a little brighter 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.040
 but that's because here 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.619
 cold light i think if standing 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.079
 saint sweat and glass and they would be in 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.320
 equal strength 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:03.270
 that's the way we have regimes then 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:07.549
 lantern only 1 here well here such here 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.549
 lantern compare it to magic share 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.870
 so it is with us 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.810
 maximal yes and yes compared to 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:26.459
 our we see that the panel is clearly 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:29.459
 wins and Paul size and 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.220
 build quality, in principle, if the price is 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.220
 these lights will be quite adequate i 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.380
 I think it's worth considering 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.910
 Definitely better than peeling or trout 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.330
 new this in the event that the price be 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:47.180
 adequately and then I recall two colors 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:51.239
 the flow of 3500 Kelvin and 6200 killers 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:55.069
 respectively 840 alimony 1200 lumen and 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.190
 zelinka's second lantern looks like it 1 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.060
 324 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.470
 made in the same style of aluminum 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.959
 anodized he equipped with a diode 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:11.720
 mtg-2 previous flashlight tried 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:14.760
 diode xml 2 means again on the passport 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.299
 gives this flashlight to 3 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.819
 the heat of light 2500 Kelvin gives two 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.389
 100 lumens thousand on the heat of light 5000 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.430
 Kelvin produces 2,200 elements and has 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:33.590
 2 modes also completed with mom 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:36.060
 the end of 2 650 let's see how it shines 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.440
 so it is clear that we have the best over 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.910
 absent-minded but this is due to the fact that here 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.910
 whether the reflector is worth and more less mode 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.100
 compare it with share games 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.560
 Of course , water needs to be compared. 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:17.040
 Well, the usual picture of the principle, I'm up to you 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:19.410
 I bring well here's my flashlight 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.299
 personal reasons, the lights are not bad 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:26.160
 worthy again have to be in them 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:28.520
 quite adequate price thank you all 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.520
 kind
