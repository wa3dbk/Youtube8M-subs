00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.310 
meter the screw will either meter fuel
or<00:00:27.900> air<00:00:28.550> so<00:00:30.290> basically<00:00:31.290> let<00:00:31.530> me<00:00:31.590> go<00:00:31.740> over<00:00:32.059> some

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
or air so basically let me go over some

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.209 
or air so basically let me go over some
things<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.530> help<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.739> identify<00:00:37.039> where<00:00:38.039> to

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
things to help you identify where to

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.849 
things to help you identify where to
look<00:00:38.370> for<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:39.089> the<00:00:39.179> screw<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.780> whether<00:00:40.679> it

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
look for for the screw and whether it

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.029 
look for for the screw and whether it
meters<00:00:41.129> fuel<00:00:41.399> or<00:00:41.550> air<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.499> I'm<00:00:43.499> gonna<00:00:43.649> define

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
meters fuel or air so I'm gonna define

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.380 
meters fuel or air so I'm gonna define
this<00:00:45.469> line<00:00:46.469> here<00:00:46.859> as<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.460> parting<00:00:47.940> line<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
this line here as a parting line and

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.290 
this line here as a parting line and
that's<00:00:49.079> basically<00:00:49.530> where<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.249> slide<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.999> or

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
that's basically where the slide is or

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.180 
that's basically where the slide is or
in<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.109> case<00:00:52.319> there's<00:00:52.559> there's<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> butterfly

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
in this case there's there's a butterfly

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.559 
in this case there's there's a butterfly
here<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.879> then<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> CV<00:00:54.710> constant<00:00:55.710> velocity

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:56.569 
here and then the CV constant velocity

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:59.149 
here and then the CV constant velocity
carburetor<00:00:57.569> the<00:00:57.870> vacuum<00:00:58.229> actuated<00:00:58.409> slide<00:00:58.949> is

00:00:59.149 --> 00:00:59.159 
carburetor the vacuum actuated slide is

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.829 
carburetor the vacuum actuated slide is
right<00:00:59.339> here<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.579> let's<00:00:59.819> just<00:01:00.120> imagine<00:01:00.479> there's

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
right here so let's just imagine there's

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.930 
right here so let's just imagine there's
a<00:01:00.929> line<00:01:01.109> here<00:01:01.440> I'm<00:01:02.010> gonna<00:01:02.159> call<00:01:02.339> this<00:01:02.519> side<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
a line here I'm gonna call this side the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.780 
a line here I'm gonna call this side the
engine<00:01:03.269> side<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:05.190> airbox<00:01:05.460> side<00:01:06.409> now

meters fuel so when you turn it in it

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.359 
meters fuel so when you turn it in it
leans<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.960> mix<00:01:16.229> out<00:01:16.439> when<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.890> turn<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.219> out

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
leans the mix out when you turn it out

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.480 
leans the mix out when you turn it out
it<00:01:17.880> richens<00:01:18.329> it<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.039> vice-versa<00:01:20.039> for<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
it richens it and vice-versa for the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.980 
it richens it and vice-versa for the
pilot<00:01:20.880> air<00:01:20.939> screw<00:01:21.240> which<00:01:21.390> would<00:01:21.539> be<00:01:21.659> located

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
pilot air screw which would be located

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.270 
pilot air screw which would be located
on<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> airbox<00:01:22.530> side<00:01:22.829> you<00:01:23.549> turn<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.909> out<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:25.280> to

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
on the airbox side you turn it out to to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.399 
on the airbox side you turn it out to to
lean<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.640> turn<00:01:26.969> it<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.360> rich<00:01:27.539> in<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:28.939> so

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
lean it turn it in to rich in it up so

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.740 
lean it turn it in to rich in it up so

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
golden color so this one is located

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.980 
golden color so this one is located
right<00:01:36.689> here<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.310> lot<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.460> times<00:01:38.640> they're

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
right here a lot of times they're

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.889 
right here a lot of times they're
located<00:01:40.399> at<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.549> very<00:01:41.729> bottom<00:01:41.909> they<00:01:42.539> could<00:01:42.780> be

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
located at the very bottom they could be

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.950 
located at the very bottom they could be
on<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.109> top<00:01:43.320> they<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.090> all<00:01:45.090> types<00:01:45.810> of

on the top they can be in all types of

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.399 
on the top they can be in all types of
different<00:01:46.109> area<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:46.829> most<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.399> them<00:01:47.520> are

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
different area but most of them are

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.270 
different area but most of them are
located<00:01:49.409> under<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:51.679> so<00:01:52.679> this<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> fuel

don't damage the tip you're gonna back
it<00:02:20.940> out<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.239> factory<00:02:21.660> specs<00:02:21.959> if<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.680> don't

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
it out to factory specs if you don't

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.930 
it out to factory specs if you don't
know<00:02:22.920> what<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.459> can<00:02:23.580> start<00:02:23.819> at<00:02:23.910> one

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
know what that is you can start at one

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.940 
know what that is you can start at one
and<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.239> half<00:02:24.420> or<00:02:24.660> two<00:02:24.720> turns<00:02:25.140> or<00:02:25.380> whatever<00:02:25.650> and

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
and a half or two turns or whatever and

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.100 
and a half or two turns or whatever and
you<00:02:26.250> know<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.400> can<00:02:26.580> go<00:02:26.700> from<00:02:26.880> there

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
you know you can go from there

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.740 
you know you can go from there
but<00:02:28.860> basically<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.370> always<00:02:29.489> lightly<00:02:30.390> see<00:02:30.599> them

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
but basically I always lightly see them

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.449 
but basically I always lightly see them
to<00:02:30.900> see<00:02:30.930> where<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.260> was<00:02:31.380> at<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.860> then<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:34.459> know

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
to see where I was at and then you know

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.460 
to see where I was at and then you know
go<00:02:35.610> from<00:02:35.640> there<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:37.430> in<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:38.549> case<00:02:39.319> let's<00:02:40.319> see

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
go from there so in this case let's see

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:53.570 
go from there so in this case let's see
how<00:02:40.590> many<00:02:40.650> turns<00:02:41.010> out<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:41.430> is

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:07.260 

that<00:02:54.580> right<00:02:57.510> 1/2<00:02:59.010> to<00:03:02.730> f3<00:03:03.730> 2<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.300> 3/4<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:06.270> three

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
that right 1/2 to f3 2 and 3/4 and three

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.600 
that right 1/2 to f3 2 and 3/4 and three
turrets<00:03:07.450> ok<00:03:08.320> so<00:03:08.380> see<00:03:08.680> how<00:03:08.800> I<00:03:08.830> just<00:03:08.950> lightly<00:03:09.310> see

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
turrets ok so see how I just lightly see

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.830 
turrets ok so see how I just lightly see
that<00:03:09.820> it's<00:03:10.060> all<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.300> got<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.480> do<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.660> don't

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
that it's all you got to do you don't

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.760 
that it's all you got to do you don't
you<00:03:11.050> don't<00:03:11.110> have<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.350> crank<00:03:11.590> this<00:03:11.710> down

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
you don't have to crank this down

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.680 
you don't have to crank this down
because<00:03:12.070> you'll<00:03:12.280> probably<00:03:12.460> damage<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.480> tip

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
because you'll probably damage the tip

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.260 
because you'll probably damage the tip
or<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.960> seat<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.410> then<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.920> then<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:15.940> don't

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
or the seat and then and then I don't

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.410 
or the seat and then and then I don't
know<00:03:16.330> man<00:03:16.540> you're<00:03:16.660> screwed<00:03:16.960> but<00:03:17.170> anyway<00:03:18.420> I'm

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
know man you're screwed but anyway I'm

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.730 
know man you're screwed but anyway I'm
gonna<00:03:19.540> set<00:03:19.840> this<00:03:19.930> at<00:03:20.140> one<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.350> a<00:03:20.410> half<00:03:20.530> turns

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
gonna set this at one and a half turns

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:29.310 
gonna set this at one and a half turns
out<00:03:21.010> cuz<00:03:21.730> that's<00:03:21.880> Factory<00:03:27.990> okay<00:03:28.990> so<00:03:29.050> that's

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
out cuz that's Factory okay so that's

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.110 
out cuz that's Factory okay so that's
one<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.650> half<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.130> I'll<00:03:30.340> start<00:03:30.610> it<00:03:30.730> up<00:03:30.850> and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
one and a half and I'll start it up and

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.690 
one and a half and I'll start it up and
I'll<00:03:31.240> turn<00:03:31.990> it<00:03:32.170> in<00:03:32.310> until<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.400> starts<00:03:33.640> to

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
I'll turn it in until it starts to

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.670 
I'll turn it in until it starts to
stumble<00:03:34.000> I'll<00:03:34.300> turn<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.660> out<00:03:34.840> till<00:03:35.110> it<00:03:35.440> starts

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
stumble I'll turn it out till it starts

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.410 
stumble I'll turn it out till it starts
to<00:03:36.160> stumble<00:03:36.550> and<00:03:36.610> I'm<00:03:36.700> gonna<00:03:36.850> try<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.090> find<00:03:37.300> the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
to stumble and I'm gonna try to find the

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.500 
to stumble and I'm gonna try to find the
highest<00:03:37.600> rpm<00:03:38.020> and<00:03:38.980> when<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:39.970> engine<00:03:40.060> smoothes

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
highest rpm and when the engine smoothes

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.960 
highest rpm and when the engine smoothes
out<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:40.870> that's<00:03:41.020> when<00:03:41.350> that's<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.970> desired

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
out and that's when that's the desired

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.440 
out and that's when that's the desired
setting<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:44.950> also<00:03:45.310> have<00:03:45.520> a<00:03:45.580> blog<00:03:45.850> post<00:03:45.910> on<00:03:46.390> a

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
setting I also have a blog post on a

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.470 
setting I also have a blog post on a
pilot<00:03:47.140> jet<00:03:47.530> sizing<00:03:48.040> so<00:03:48.610> that'll<00:03:49.180> help<00:03:49.210> you

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
pilot jet sizing so that'll help you

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.300 
pilot jet sizing so that'll help you
determine<00:03:49.810> if<00:03:50.110> your<00:03:50.290> your<00:03:50.560> pilot<00:03:50.950> jet<00:03:51.160> is

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
determine if your your pilot jet is

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.800 
determine if your your pilot jet is
sized<00:03:51.910> correctly<00:03:52.180> if<00:03:53.050> your<00:03:53.410> under<00:03:56.070> one<00:03:57.070> turn

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
sized correctly if your under one turn

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.750 
sized correctly if your under one turn
you<00:03:58.810> need<00:03:58.989> to<00:03:59.110> change<00:03:59.980> it<00:04:00.220> if<00:04:00.340> you're<00:04:00.489> over

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
you need to change it if you're over

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.140 
you need to change it if you're over
three<00:04:01.000> you<00:04:01.120> also<00:04:01.239> need<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.540> change<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:02.820> on<00:04:03.820> this

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
three you also need to change it on this

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.320 
three you also need to change it on this
bike<00:04:04.420> here<00:04:04.750> I<00:04:05.050> had<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.830> I<00:04:06.040> turn<00:04:06.550> the<00:04:06.790> screw<00:04:07.090> all

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
bike here I had to I turn the screw all

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.380 
bike here I had to I turn the screw all
the<00:04:07.360> way<00:04:07.570> in<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.640> engine<00:04:09.910> did<00:04:10.090> not<00:04:10.120> die

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
the way in and it the engine did not die

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.790 
the way in and it the engine did not die
it<00:04:10.450> should<00:04:10.810> die<00:04:11.020> when<00:04:11.260> you<00:04:11.350> turn<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.680> all<00:04:11.770> the

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
it should die when you turn it all the

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.260 
it should die when you turn it all the
way<00:04:11.890> in<00:04:12.100> because<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.489> should<00:04:12.670> cut<00:04:12.880> off<00:04:13.000> all<00:04:13.150> the

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
way in because it should cut off all the

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.050 
way in because it should cut off all the
fuel<00:04:13.480> or<00:04:13.900> air<00:04:14.350> or<00:04:14.530> whatever<00:04:14.830> you<00:04:15.640> know<00:04:15.760> whether

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
fuel or air or whatever you know whether

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.370 
fuel or air or whatever you know whether
it's<00:04:16.270> a<00:04:16.299> fuel<00:04:16.510> or<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.720> pilot<00:04:17.080> but<00:04:17.169> in<00:04:17.290> this

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
it's a fuel or the pilot but in this

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.800 
it's a fuel or the pilot but in this
case<00:04:17.560> its<00:04:17.799> fuel<00:04:18.040> and<00:04:18.310> it<00:04:18.940> did<00:04:19.180> not<00:04:19.359> cut<00:04:19.690> the

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
case its fuel and it did not cut the

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.449 
case its fuel and it did not cut the
engine<00:04:20.080> out<00:04:20.200> so<00:04:20.380> I<00:04:20.410> knew<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:20.650> I<00:04:20.830> was<00:04:20.980> too<00:04:21.160> rich

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
engine out so I knew that I was too rich

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.840 
engine out so I knew that I was too rich
so<00:04:22.360> I<00:04:22.390> sighs<00:04:23.080> did<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.440> couple<00:04:23.620> three<00:04:24.550> or<00:04:24.669> four

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
so I sighs did a couple three or four

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.870 
so I sighs did a couple three or four
sizes<00:04:25.060> which<00:04:25.540> is<00:04:25.750> kind<00:04:26.620> of<00:04:26.710> abnormal<00:04:27.220> but<00:04:27.370> in

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
sizes which is kind of abnormal but in

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.340 
sizes which is kind of abnormal but in
any<00:04:28.060> case<00:04:28.120> now<00:04:28.390> I'm<00:04:28.450> at<00:04:28.600> three<00:04:28.840> turns<00:04:29.080> out

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
any case now I'm at three turns out

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.190 
any case now I'm at three turns out
which<00:04:29.530> is<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.770> maximum<00:04:30.340> you<00:04:30.870> want<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:31.930> be<00:04:32.020> out

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
which is the maximum you want to be out

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.220 
which is the maximum you want to be out
so<00:04:32.470> I<00:04:32.590> really<00:04:32.980> could<00:04:33.400> go<00:04:33.580> one<00:04:33.910> size<00:04:34.270> richer<00:04:35.050> but

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
so I really could go one size richer but

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.470 
so I really could go one size richer but
it<00:04:35.350> seems<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.220> run<00:04:36.370> really<00:04:36.610> good<00:04:36.790> so<00:04:37.090> I'm<00:04:37.300> gonna

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
it seems to run really good so I'm gonna

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.420 
it seems to run really good so I'm gonna
leave<00:04:37.630> it<00:04:37.750> at<00:04:37.840> that

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
leave it at that

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.090 
leave it at that
so<00:04:39.760> yeah<00:04:39.940> let's<00:04:40.120> start<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.480> up<00:04:40.600> in<00:04:40.810> and<00:04:41.230> go<00:04:41.950> from

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
so yeah let's start it up in and go from

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:49.180 
so yeah let's start it up in and go from
there

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.470 

okay<00:04:50.190> so<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.520> know<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.910> know<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.270> perfect

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
okay so I know I know the perfect

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.150 
okay so I know I know the perfect
settings<00:04:52.050> at<00:04:53.450> 3:00<00:04:54.500> but<00:04:55.500> let's<00:04:55.680> turn<00:04:55.860> it<00:04:56.040> in

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
settings at 3:00 but let's turn it in

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.950 
settings at 3:00 but let's turn it in
what<00:04:56.490> happens<00:04:58.310> he<00:04:59.310> begins<00:04:59.610> to<00:04:59.670> stumble<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:00.870> if

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
what happens he begins to stumble and if

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.590 
what happens he begins to stumble and if
I<00:05:01.050> continue<00:05:01.410> to<00:05:01.620> turn<00:05:01.800> it<00:05:02.040> I<00:05:02.240> should<00:05:03.240> kill<00:05:03.480> the

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
I continue to turn it I should kill the

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.260 
I continue to turn it I should kill the
motor<00:05:07.370> so<00:05:08.370> I'm<00:05:08.430> gonna<00:05:08.520> go<00:05:08.640> back<00:05:08.790> to<00:05:08.820> one<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:09.240> a

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
motor so I'm gonna go back to one and a

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.570 
motor so I'm gonna go back to one and a
half<00:05:09.300> and<00:05:09.660> start<00:05:09.870> it<00:05:10.020> up<00:05:13.100> let's<00:05:14.100> turn<00:05:14.370> it<00:05:14.460> out

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
half and start it up let's turn it out

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.760 
half and start it up let's turn it out
and<00:05:14.610> see<00:05:14.850> what<00:05:14.970> answers<00:05:15.270> so<00:05:16.260> I'm<00:05:16.320> at<00:05:16.440> one<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:16.740> a

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
and see what answers so I'm at one and a

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
and see what answers so I'm at one and a
half<00:05:17.360> to<00:05:18.860> notice<00:05:19.860> how<00:05:19.950> the<00:05:20.010> engines<00:05:20.370> sped<00:05:20.910> up

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
half to notice how the engines sped up

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.890 
half to notice how the engines sped up
do<00:05:23.090> it<00:05:23.210> a<00:05:23.240> half

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.260 

but<00:05:28.440> three<00:05:28.740> were<00:05:28.889> really<00:05:29.070> it<00:05:29.790> sounds<00:05:30.090> pretty

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
but three were really it sounds pretty

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.720 
but three were really it sounds pretty
damn<00:05:30.449> good

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.580 

the<00:05:34.270> three<00:05:34.570> and<00:05:34.690> a<00:05:34.720> half<00:05:34.930> you<00:05:35.260> really<00:05:35.470> don't

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
the three and a half you really don't

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.230 
the three and a half you really don't
change<00:05:35.740> it<00:05:36.130> and<00:05:36.310> I<00:05:36.370> didn't<00:05:36.550> hear<00:05:36.760> anything<00:05:36.940> so

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
change it and I didn't hear anything so

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:48.060 
change it and I didn't hear anything so
I'm<00:05:37.300> gonna<00:05:37.390> go<00:05:37.570> back<00:05:37.600> to<00:05:37.930> three

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.560 

so<00:05:49.070> it<00:05:49.160> sounds<00:05:49.400> pretty<00:05:49.550> good<00:05:49.760> at<00:05:49.880> three<00:05:50.060> it's

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
so it sounds pretty good at three it's

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.670 
so it sounds pretty good at three it's
got<00:05:50.720> a<00:05:50.750> nice<00:05:52.750> nice<00:05:53.750> title<00:05:54.170> the<00:05:54.260> plugs<00:05:54.500> look

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
got a nice nice title the plugs look

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.360 
got a nice nice title the plugs look
good

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
good

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.050 
good
there's<00:05:55.820> no<00:05:55.970> stumble<00:05:56.390> off<00:05:56.600> idle<00:05:57.670> and<00:05:58.670> whatnot

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
there's no stumble off idle and whatnot

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.180 
there's no stumble off idle and whatnot
so<00:05:59.300> let<00:06:00.080> me<00:06:00.140> go<00:06:00.260> over<00:06:00.350> by<00:06:00.500> the<00:06:00.530> workbench<00:06:00.950> and

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
so let me go over by the workbench and

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.800 
so let me go over by the workbench and
I'll<00:06:01.280> show<00:06:01.520> you<00:06:01.580> what<00:06:02.060> I'm<00:06:02.270> gonna<00:06:02.360> take<00:06:02.630> this

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
I'll show you what I'm gonna take this

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.550 
I'll show you what I'm gonna take this
throughout<00:06:03.170> and<00:06:03.650> I'm<00:06:04.640> gonna<00:06:05.230> compare<00:06:06.230> it<00:06:06.410> to

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
throughout and I'm gonna compare it to

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.710 
throughout and I'm gonna compare it to
pilot<00:06:07.100> air<00:06:07.580> screw<00:06:07.910> just<00:06:08.150> so<00:06:08.210> you<00:06:08.300> get<00:06:08.390> an<00:06:08.480> idea

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
pilot air screw just so you get an idea

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.790 
pilot air screw just so you get an idea
of<00:06:08.810> what<00:06:08.960> it<00:06:09.050> looks<00:06:09.200> like<00:06:11.260> alright<00:06:12.260> so<00:06:12.500> here<00:06:12.680> on

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
of what it looks like alright so here on

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.700 
of what it looks like alright so here on
the<00:06:12.890> right<00:06:13.450> see<00:06:14.450> how<00:06:14.570> it's<00:06:14.750> very<00:06:14.810> this<00:06:15.320> needle

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
the right see how it's very this needle

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.510 
the right see how it's very this needle
is<00:06:15.860> very<00:06:16.100> pointy<00:06:16.430> well<00:06:16.820> this<00:06:16.970> is<00:06:17.120> a<00:06:17.150> fuel<00:06:17.510> screw

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
is very pointy well this is a fuel screw

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.160 
is very pointy well this is a fuel screw
and<00:06:19.520> this<00:06:19.640> one<00:06:19.820> on<00:06:19.940> the<00:06:20.030> left<00:06:20.240> here<00:06:20.420> see<00:06:21.080> how

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
and this one on the left here see how

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.410 
and this one on the left here see how
see<00:06:21.620> that<00:06:21.770> blunt<00:06:22.040> tip<00:06:22.250> right<00:06:22.460> there<00:06:22.490> that's<00:06:23.270> a

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:23.420 
see that blunt tip right there that's a

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.780 
see that blunt tip right there that's a
pilot<00:06:23.840> air<00:06:23.960> screw<00:06:24.230> so<00:06:24.380> this<00:06:24.530> meters<00:06:24.860> air<00:06:25.070> this

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790 
pilot air screw so this meters air this

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.420 
pilot air screw so this meters air this
meters<00:06:26.150> fuel<00:06:26.450> so<00:06:26.690> whenever<00:06:26.870> in<00:06:27.140> doubt<00:06:27.280> you<00:06:28.280> can

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
meters fuel so whenever in doubt you can

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.650 
meters fuel so whenever in doubt you can
pull<00:06:28.760> the<00:06:29.000> screw<00:06:29.330> and<00:06:29.600> and<00:06:31.420> determine<00:06:32.420> what

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
pull the screw and and determine what

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.640 
pull the screw and and determine what
what<00:06:33.260> it<00:06:33.410> meters<00:06:34.330> so<00:06:35.330> you<00:06:35.360> can<00:06:35.570> see<00:06:35.750> that<00:06:35.960> you

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
what it meters so you can see that you

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.890 
what it meters so you can see that you
know<00:06:36.740> this<00:06:36.890> this<00:06:37.160> is<00:06:37.220> very<00:06:37.520> sharp<00:06:38.210> pointy<00:06:38.750> and

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
know this this is very sharp pointy and

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.510 
know this this is very sharp pointy and
if<00:06:39.080> you<00:06:39.520> use<00:06:40.520> excess<00:06:41.450> force<00:06:42.190> that'll<00:06:43.190> snap

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
if you use excess force that'll snap

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.760 
if you use excess force that'll snap
right<00:06:43.760> in<00:06:43.910> there<00:06:44.060> I've<00:06:44.210> I<00:06:44.570> was<00:06:45.350> working<00:06:45.650> on<00:06:45.710> a

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
right in there I've I was working on a

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.070 
right in there I've I was working on a
friend's<00:06:46.130> bike<00:06:46.340> once<00:06:46.640> actually<00:06:47.510> he<00:06:47.630> was<00:06:47.780> doing

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
friend's bike once actually he was doing

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.770 
friend's bike once actually he was doing
the<00:06:48.170> work<00:06:48.320> I<00:06:48.440> said<00:06:48.620> hey<00:06:48.740> lightly<00:06:49.130> sedum<00:06:49.520> and

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 
the work I said hey lightly sedum and

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.350 
the work I said hey lightly sedum and
the<00:06:50.780> tip<00:06:50.990> snapped<00:06:51.320> off<00:06:51.560> so<00:06:51.980> the<00:06:52.850> bike<00:06:53.060> never

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
the tip snapped off so the bike never

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.270 
the tip snapped off so the bike never
ran<00:06:53.720> after<00:06:54.080> that<00:06:54.260> I<00:06:54.290> mean<00:06:54.530> I<00:06:54.560> think<00:06:54.860> I<00:06:54.950> think<00:06:55.160> we

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 
ran after that I mean I think I think we

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.650 
ran after that I mean I think I think we
drilled<00:06:55.580> it<00:06:55.700> out<00:06:55.790> and<00:06:58.090> you<00:06:59.090> know<00:06:59.180> it<00:06:59.270> just<00:06:59.300> it

00:06:59.650 --> 00:06:59.660 
drilled it out and you know it just it
