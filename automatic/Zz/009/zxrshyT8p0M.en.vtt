under I think a from Porto she's doing

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.450 
under I think a from Porto she's doing
really<00:01:42.960> well<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.170> Portuguese<00:01:43.740> football<00:01:44.189> I

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
really well in Portuguese football I

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.160 
really well in Portuguese football I
could<00:01:44.850> see<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> Sun<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.420> someone<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.840> are<00:01:46.049> in

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
seems to be a move that definitely if

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.960 
seems to be a move that definitely if
people<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:49.979> thoughts<00:01:50.220> about<00:01:50.340> one<00:01:50.729> or<00:01:50.850> three
