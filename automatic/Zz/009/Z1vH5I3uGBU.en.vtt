00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.239
 book ends it by marking too much but 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.730
 then they start finding themselves in a 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.289
 mystery the king's author because if at 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.719
 seem the author the mysterious and the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.300
 look like the doctor died years ago but 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.489
 as your books so wrapped in 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.430
 a bigger mystery who did not expect 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.570
 the books of this author are 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.640
 disappearing some mysterious name 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.220

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.229
 is burning Julian's face books 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.840
 then this book has many 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.270
 also literary references and is a 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.220
 book for reading lovers is 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.680
 our books that the whole reader 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.750
 he should read because he is going to fascinate 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:27.990
 this plot the only problem that I saw is 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.420
 who can guess the end 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.070
 this mysterious man who will be and 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.290
 then he gave me an idea of who the man 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.570
 of mysteries could be and in the end it 's 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.460
 for the mysterious if I end up being the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.770
 person that I thought was 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.020
 just what I wanted to guess the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.479
 final that should not be good but 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.789
 equally enjoy this novel Carlos 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.460
 in this way like that the way in 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.890
 what he writes catches you in a way this 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.240
 book is a little too thick but not 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.799
 had to keep grabbing and keep 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.500
 reading page after page after page 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.509
 to solve the mystery and then 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.340
 also to know more about the 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.380
 story of this author and this book 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.299
 mystery touch daniel found in the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.039
 cemetery of the books but it is a 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.200
 mystery but it also has jet in 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.720
 integrated plot and this book has a 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.239
 stream of phrases pajín before I had 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.549
 that more coal is that reading I will read a 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.080
 which is I think I do not know if it's my favorite 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.090
 because all the lines are great 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.980
 every time a book changed hands 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.980
 every time someone slides their eyes 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.020
 by its pages your spirit grows and you 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.150
 makes them strong read them this class 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.820
 I did not know the pleasure of reading from exploding 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.220
 doors that open to you in the soul of 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.650
 abandon yourself to the imagination to the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.110
 beauty and the mystery of fiction and 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.090
 of language then that is a bit of 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.240
 how the story is told is 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.220
 narrated a very simple way and it's easy 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.350
 to understand but the plot is very 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.360
 complex because they are several stories that 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.050
 are connecting in several different 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.940
 times there is a present history of 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.160
 past 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.040
 is the story of the shadow the wind 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.590
 then like they were connecting 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.480
 all the stories and they are integrated 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.580
 to create a very big climax in the 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.890
 I could not stop reading because 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.590
 I got to this point so high that I did not know 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.370
 what it was though to predict who the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:21.450
 mysterious man then if they want the 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.870
 a very mysterious book that will hold them 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.300
 and have them held by a 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.860
 thread all the time I recommend that 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.690
 go to your nearest bookstore and 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.610
 get the shadow of the wind is a 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.620
 trilogy and this is the first book and the 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.260
 second book is the angel game 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.440
 also here and look great 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.690
 difference in size 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.360
 I hope you enjoyed this 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.380
 video and they will see me very soon and 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.670
 then goodbye 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.670
 ay ay 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.700
 for me 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.020
 to 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.280
 to me
