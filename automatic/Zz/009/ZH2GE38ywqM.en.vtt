gonna be producing yeah yeah well you
know<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> secret<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:40.020> good<00:00:40.260> soil<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.860> its

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
know the secret to this good soil is its

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.020 
know the secret to this good soil is its
compost<00:00:41.850> worm<00:00:42.420> casting<00:00:43.020> ratio<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.190> well<00:00:44.850> as

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
compost worm casting ratio as well as

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.570 
compost worm casting ratio as well as
it's<00:00:45.239> got<00:00:45.420> coconut<00:00:46.140> fiber<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.680> there<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.430> got

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
it's got coconut fiber in there it's got

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.979 
it's got coconut fiber in there it's got
pine<00:00:47.850> bark<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.300> there<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.839> a<00:00:48.870> little

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
pine bark in there for a little

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.750 
pine bark in there for a little
chunkiness<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.739> get<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.010> drainage<00:00:50.280> going

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
chunkiness to get that drainage going

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.200 
chunkiness to get that drainage going
the<00:00:51.629> coconut<00:00:52.110> fiber<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.769> the<00:00:52.920> compost<00:00:53.489> really

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the coconut fiber and the compost really

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.329 
the coconut fiber and the compost really
helped<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.570> retain<00:00:54.930> moisture<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:56.129> worm

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
helped to retain moisture the worm

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.579 
helped to retain moisture the worm
castings<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> compost<00:00:57.720> themselves<00:00:58.410> at<00:00:58.559> a

this potting soil compost and the worm
casting<00:01:17.670> biology<00:01:18.440> once<00:01:19.440> they<00:01:19.590> get<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.860> there

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
casting biology once they get in there

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.100 
casting biology once they get in there
and<00:01:20.040> set<00:01:20.400> up<00:01:20.520> shop<00:01:20.600> they<00:01:21.600> start<00:01:21.870> producing

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and set up shop they start producing

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.350 
and set up shop they start producing
these<00:01:22.440> polysaccharides<00:01:23.190> it's<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.880> sticky

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
these polysaccharides it's a sticky

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.090 
these polysaccharides it's a sticky
coating<00:01:24.620> binding<00:01:25.620> to<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.770> different

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
coating binding to the different

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.770 
coating binding to the different
particles<00:01:26.550> pulling<00:01:27.030> them<00:01:27.180> together<00:01:27.300> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
particles pulling them together and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.200 
particles pulling them together and
creating<00:01:28.410> these<00:01:28.500> macro<00:01:29.250> pores<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.670> cold

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
creating these macro pores the cold

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.900 
creating these macro pores the cold
water<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.900> it'll<00:01:31.650> hold<00:01:31.950> water<00:01:32.280> through<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
water so it'll hold water through the

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.310 
water so it'll hold water through the
macro<00:01:33.180> pores<00:01:33.330> as<00:01:33.600> well<00:01:33.780> as<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.960> tiny<00:01:34.170> little

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
macro pores as well as a tiny little

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.620 
macro pores as well as a tiny little
micro<00:01:34.710> pores<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.220> are<00:01:35.370> created<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:35.940> more<00:01:36.510> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
micro pores that are created as more and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.630 
micro pores that are created as more and
more<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.050> biology<00:01:37.680> kind<00:01:37.980> of<00:01:38.040> sets<00:01:38.460> up

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
more that biology kind of sets up

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.390 
more that biology kind of sets up
alright<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.780> let's<00:01:40.050> check<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.950> soil

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
alright so let's check out this soil

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.550 
alright so let's check out this soil
alright<00:01:44.400> I<00:01:44.430> can<00:01:44.730> see<00:01:44.910> these<00:01:45.060> are<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.330> little

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
alright I can see these are the little

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.890 
alright I can see these are the little
coconut<00:01:46.560> fibers<00:01:47.550> in<00:01:47.670> there<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.240> got<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.630> yep

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
coconut fibers in there you got it yep

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.140 
coconut fibers in there you got it yep
and<00:01:49.140> then<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.800> white<00:01:50.070> things<00:01:50.400> are<00:01:50.760> the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
and then the white things are the

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.890 
and then the white things are the
pearlite<00:01:51.810> that's<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.260> pearlite

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
pearlite that's the pearlite

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.690 
pearlite that's the pearlite
and<00:01:54.050> then<00:01:54.350> I<00:01:54.560> think<00:01:54.800> I<00:01:54.890> can<00:01:55.040> see<00:01:55.190> like<00:01:55.370> those

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
and then I think I can see like those

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.480 
and then I think I can see like those
are<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:55.940> little<00:01:56.060> sort<00:01:56.690> of<00:01:56.750> pine<00:01:57.070> bark<00:01:58.070> pine

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
are the little sort of pine bark pine

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.580 
are the little sort of pine bark pine
bark<00:01:58.760> nuggets<00:01:59.150> yeah<00:01:59.420> any<00:02:00.020> kind<00:02:00.320> of<00:02:00.380> little

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
bark nuggets yeah any kind of little

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.740 
bark nuggets yeah any kind of little
woody<00:02:00.830> specs<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.460> you<00:02:01.550> would<00:02:01.670> see<00:02:01.910> those<00:02:02.510> are

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
woody specs that you would see those are

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.590 
woody specs that you would see those are
the<00:02:02.900> pine<00:02:03.440> bark<00:02:03.620> yep<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:04.310> then<00:02:04.610> just<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.060> dark

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
the pine bark yep and then just the dark

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.750 
the pine bark yep and then just the dark
stuff<00:02:05.960> that's<00:02:06.290> basically<00:02:06.710> your<00:02:06.800> compost<00:02:07.460> and

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
stuff that's basically your compost and

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.080 
stuff that's basically your compost and
your<00:02:07.910> worm<00:02:08.300> castings<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.640> your<00:02:10.640> coconut

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
your worm castings and your coconut

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.750
