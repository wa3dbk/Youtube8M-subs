00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.690
 the second part of one of the 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.209
 most downloaded games of this 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.860
 generation in evolution trailers go to 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.710
 find pure fun 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.779
 fast and direct and challenges that no 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.840
 another game can equal I've thrown a 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.840
 glance 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.829
 the operation of evolution is 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.590
 exactly the same as we saw a few ago 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.660
 years now enter the site of you are a pilot 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.220
 of motocross and your only need 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.079
 is to reach the end of a track 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.390
 unidirectional in the shortest time 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.300
 possible and with the least number of failures 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.430
 possible so easy depending on what 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.830
 good or bad that you do, you will receive a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.290
 medal or other knowing that a single 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.940
 Failure is to lose gold I assure you that 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.900
 It is a very difficult task to complete this 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.900
 one hundred percent game 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.530
 you will also receive money to spend 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.750
 'aces' in clothes for the pilot or in sheet 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.480
 and paint for your bike and something 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.070
 interesting is that during the tour 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.390
 there will be mobile indicators that will serve 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.130
 so you can see how well they have done it 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.470
 your friends from xbox live in that 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.210
 circuit at each moment something that is 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.980
 sure will be an incentive to 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.980
 retry the circuits over and over again 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.670
 the control does not move away from simplicity 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.320
 of the operation just a trigger with 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.480
 the one that accelerate and the one with which to brake 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.610
 the rest depends on how sensitive they are 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.840
 be with the direction of the motorcycle that 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.090
 It serves two directions for 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.420
 stabilize the left and right nothing 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.090
 plus 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.950
 the other button that you are going to use is 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.720
 the one that restarts from the last point 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.110
 of control after a shock or a 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.110
 drop 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.450
 The main difference between evolution 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.100
 and brings the safety resides in the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.720
 complexity of the circuits and the 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.090
 variety of environments and elements that 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.010
 you will find in them the garages and 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.800
 industrial warehouses are behind 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.510
 and they give way to incredible scenarios that 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.610
 they make infinitely more pleasant the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.410
 time that is dedicated to the game the 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.600
 inspiration has not known limits in the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.540
 conception of this game from environments 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.860
 that revive the Normandy landings 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.440
 going through the hills and huts of 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.060
 alan wake up some very elegant wink 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.060
 as the tribute given to the limbo 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.040
 the evolution offer has also known 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.990
 exceed what we had in the first 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.300
 delivery beyond the challenge that supposes 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.820
 get it on all circuits something 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.520
 that seems almost impossible has been included 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.590
 a local or online multiplayer mode and a 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.030
 complete circuit editor that you 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.890
 allows to unleash the 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.890
 imagination to design your 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.270
 tours those tours are published and 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.880
 are available to all 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.310
 players and believe me you can do 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.290
 authentic wonders visually and 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.540
 authentic follies for those who seek 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.520
 difficulty no doubt attracts the pse 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.620
 volution is one of the most important purchases 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.400
 recommended of the bazaar of xbox live in 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.400
 these moments 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.090
 yes 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.140
 ah
