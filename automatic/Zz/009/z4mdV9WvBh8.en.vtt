00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.009
 bank hockey league season

 It starts on the 8th of September in the finale 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.749
 Although the wiener had the last time 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.670
 kac hit it anyway 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:41.100
 For a long time the most successful season 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.170
 the cracks will join it 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.179
 not easy the others 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.800
 teams have reinforced that 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.749
 will hang like that what in the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.059
 It will not be easy to come to a final 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:53.550
 be and that will be very many

 give exciting games and are after 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.339
 in my opinion five candidate for the title 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.679
 realistic here present 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.870
 the european trophy still ahead of 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.649
 is held at championship is 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.869
 so much ambition the ideal preparation 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.880
 a total of six new players are running in 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.439
 the fight team of cracks on the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.289
 is not too much was marielle in her 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.579
 Team and that's where I played 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:21.149
 or seen 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.909
 three weeks how fast to integrate 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.880
 then these games can be 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.030
 from the help of the game where 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.050
 previously played the new game 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.680
 gives as good characters 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.470
 where make a great hero for his team 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.270
 and for his organization and for that 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.460
 have also individual quality 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.990
 Property has then looked for too 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.090
 again and again players from their own 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.670
 put their way into the fight team 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.560
 the yuppies find them vienna capitals 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.320
 this is due to the good junior work 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.460
 have the so-called silver caps 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.020
 last year completely new player at the 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.460
 professionals peter weber capitals 1 to 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.290
 team up 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.960
 that is true, no one could approximate 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.190
 I hope and hope for that 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.480
 Of course , step by step 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.790
 expand we can not wait 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.440
 that every year ten young players 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.810
 offspring if every year a two 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.610
 Players follow us then we are already 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.220
 very well prepared for the future 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.100
 Incidentally, the silver caps will be sold this year 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.470
 the first time with a 18 u team on 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.560
 point hunting in the first bank 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.140
 junior sleek the fresh wind that sets 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.360
 also in the fan work away next to 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.550
 a new yearbook will be the social 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.390
 media range of caps continues 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.830
 expanded 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.150
 The future is simply in these 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.940
 areas the knowledge we have 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.830
 more invested in these areas 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.780
 and work put in as he 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.180
 we are in the ebel number 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.950
 One thing about the twitter follower 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.800
 He'll take over in the newsletter 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.630
 this seemed by the facebook 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.010
 Classic things and I believe one 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.390
 Fair work in this area is 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.580
 simply inevitable ours 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.680
 For the first time, the focus was on those 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.530
 two years later, albert schultz converted 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.100
 hall in kagran 200,000 visitors in 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.530
 one season a new record and occasion 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.630
 hoping that it would go with the fan 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.170
 so on is that if this year still 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.030
 my position had to that extent 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.600
 5200 spectators on average in so many 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.630
 play is already a sign that we 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.470
 new fans have won and I am 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.980
 optimistic enough to say that we 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.140
 that we all see signs that this 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.870
 will continue on until the 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.390
 Finale it is still a long way the 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.870
 first swimmer than those are anyway 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.870
 made
