00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.889
 pilots 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.809
 we've already seen how we can print lay off we answer we're missing 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.419
 using the 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:15.549
 function to the pri will include in the gdp is the fourth point 2 that will see the light to 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.449
 early September 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.839
 the pivot that we can print from any infant printer from person 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.769
 special in cultivating the printer sharing option 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.430
 through our excellent framework we cited the version 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.690
 16 5 to be able to use 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.320
 or explain another option 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.059
 agreement through an expo 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.280
 with which it will not be necessary 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.260
 in which he lit the jackie team 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.880
 the bases will be sharing your printer this function already works if 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.590
 we use for example any of the applications available in the protest 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.550
 for example bhp the pri is able to detect the printer that is 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.930
 connected through d showed acp 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.980
 skin how to configure hoffman person well it is very simple 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.070
 any of our bases agreement disaster in the dams was so much its network 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.390
 lets connect a judge 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.210
 we will see the normal configuration 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.210
 raven we access the configuration of our base 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.270
 we have an efe network connected to a wifi network we have with the configuration 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.260
 and we have 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.890
 to printers 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.040
 settler here we could connect in person cd because not 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.990
 and this shared belief through the von glÃ¼ck network 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.490
 with the airport express 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.310
 according to whether there are suspensions we would have the same option 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.920
 if we agree to manual verification agreement as you can see here we have 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.090
 the new music option 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.120
 but we have here 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.130
 the printer if we connect with printer 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.939
 we also have the possibility to print agreement using the print and 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.190
 without having connected to the world 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.630
 we access 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.390
 in this case, however, it assumes that we will have a printer 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.169
 and we do the same step 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.169
 manual configuration the device configuration is read 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:18.529
 and if we go in three hours 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:21.229
 it is automatically weakened 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:22.849
 our machine 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.280
 such agreement with which we can already use 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.029
 I decided person 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:30.999
 ea the pri in any of our devices 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.049
 if we want it to be able to intensify 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.889
 this printer 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.889
 agreement the best way we can remove the name 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:44.599
 with which we select the machine in question we click on it to avoid 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.849
 and we can 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.279
 young people printed 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:53.859
 lottomatically mind when we go to use the pri 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:03:00.249
 we will see what is that machine to be connected Atlanta was because men 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:01.559
 and women 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.660
 as you see in that sense 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.790
 another way we have to be able to use any printer 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:12.769
 the function d to the pri included in the uncle that 4 points 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.769
 well then this is all we see in a next vi 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.969
