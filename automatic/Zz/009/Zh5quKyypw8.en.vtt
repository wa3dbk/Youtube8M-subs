one x benchmark video if you've not seen
that<00:00:17.039> one<00:00:17.310> already<00:00:17.460> I'll<00:00:18.119> put<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> lot<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.750> a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
that one already I'll put a lot just a

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.990 
that one already I'll put a lot just a
little<00:00:18.930> link<00:00:19.289> here<00:00:19.470> up<00:00:20.220> maybe<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.640> other<00:00:20.789> side

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
little link here up maybe the other side

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.790 
little link here up maybe the other side
I'll<00:00:21.300> put<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> link<00:00:21.720> on<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.260> actual<00:00:22.560> video

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
I'll put a link on in this actual video

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.009 
I'll put a link on in this actual video
right<00:00:22.980> now<00:00:23.010> anyway<00:00:23.970> it's<00:00:24.060> time<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.210> do<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.449> HTC

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
right now anyway it's time to do the HTC

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.050 
right now anyway it's time to do the HTC
one<00:00:25.170> s<00:00:25.289> benchmark<00:00:25.500> let's<00:00:26.490> say<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.670> bad<00:00:26.910> boy

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
one s benchmark let's say this bad boy

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.470 
one s benchmark let's say this bad boy
performs<00:00:27.920> so<00:00:28.920> let's<00:00:29.189> turn<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.580> as<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:30.390> can

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
performs so let's turn it on as you can

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.939 
performs so let's turn it on as you can
see<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.750> get<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> ass<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.349> lock<00:00:31.470> screen<00:00:31.529> once

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
see you get a ass on lock screen once

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.549 
see you get a ass on lock screen once
again<00:00:32.420> so<00:00:33.420> all<00:00:33.540> those<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.719> drum<00:00:33.960> strength<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
again so all those a drum strength the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.630 
again so all those a drum strength the
benchmarking<00:00:35.100> we're<00:00:35.340> going<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.520> do<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
benchmarking we're going to do a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.170

quadrant<00:00:36.059> first<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.450> all<00:00:37.579> so<00:00:38.579> here<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:38.969> r<00:00:39.000> Gus

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
quadrant first of all so here we r Gus

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.220 
quadrant first of all so here we r Gus
what<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.570> do<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.719> we're<00:00:39.809> going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> do

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
what going to do is we're going to do

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.440 
what going to do is we're going to do
the<00:00:40.410> full<00:00:40.559> benchmark<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.879> what<00:00:42.090> others<00:00:42.300> will

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
the full benchmark and what others will

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.850 
the full benchmark and what others will
let<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.629> do<00:00:42.870> its<00:00:43.020> test<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.469> we'll<00:00:43.530> come<00:00:43.710> back

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
let it do its test and we'll come back

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.110 
let it do its test and we'll come back
to<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.250> moment<00:00:44.489> our<00:00:44.550> tip<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:44.910> stay

what<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.300> jewel<00:01:04.540> on<00:01:04.780> pulling<00:01:05.050> let's

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
what the jewel on pulling let's

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.830 
what the jewel on pulling let's
Swilley<00:01:06.220> get<00:01:06.460> high<00:01:06.790> benchmarking<00:01:07.390> test<00:01:07.690> or

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
Swilley get high benchmarking test or

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.010 
Swilley get high benchmarking test or
will<00:01:07.930> it<00:01:07.990> be<00:01:08.050> lower<00:01:08.290> and<00:01:09.420> look<00:01:10.420> at<00:01:10.570> that<00:01:11.610> 5,000

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
will it be lower and look at that 5,000

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.890 
will it be lower and look at that 5,000
198<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:15.130> if<00:01:15.250> you've<00:01:15.400> not<00:01:15.520> seen<00:01:15.760> my<00:01:15.910> HTC<00:01:16.479> One<00:01:16.750> X

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
198 so if you've not seen my HTC One X

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.590 
198 so if you've not seen my HTC One X
benchmarking<00:01:17.740> video<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.970> actually<00:01:19.119> beats

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
benchmarking video this actually beats

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.960 
benchmarking video this actually beats
that<00:01:19.840> in<00:01:19.990> terms<00:01:20.200> of<00:01:20.440> the<00:01:20.740> overall<00:01:20.770> score<00:01:21.580> and

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
that in terms of the overall score and

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.390 
that in terms of the overall score and
it<00:01:22.810> completely<00:01:23.200> strides<00:01:23.590> Oliver<00:01:23.950> competition

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
it completely strides Oliver competition

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.830 
it completely strides Oliver competition
as<00:01:24.490> well<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:24.880> remember<00:01:25.330> this<00:01:25.510> is<00:01:25.570> really<00:01:25.750> a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
as well and remember this is really a

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.570 
as well and remember this is really a
jewel<00:01:26.140> car<00:01:26.380> this<00:01:26.860> is<00:01:26.920> not<00:01:27.130> running<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.400> quad

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
jewel car this is not running a quad

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.999 
jewel car this is not running a quad
core<00:01:27.760> processor<00:01:28.360> though<00:01:29.320> obviously<00:01:29.470> i<00:01:29.710> forgot

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
core processor though obviously i forgot

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.740 
core processor though obviously i forgot
the<00:01:30.040> run<00:01:30.250> advantage<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.149> disadvantages

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
the run advantage and disadvantages

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.200 
the run advantage and disadvantages
one's<00:01:32.020> got<00:01:32.229> a<00:01:32.259> stronger<00:01:32.590> cpu<00:01:33.160> one's<00:01:33.880> got<00:01:33.970> more

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
one's got a stronger cpu one's got more

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.200 
one's got a stronger cpu one's got more
but<00:01:34.869> there's<00:01:35.200> more<00:01:35.410> equal<00:01:35.770> better<00:01:36.210> obviously

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
but there's more equal better obviously

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.969 
but there's more equal better obviously
well<00:01:37.570> so<00:01:37.869> we'll<00:01:38.110> come<00:01:38.259> see<00:01:38.470> that<00:01:38.590> in<00:01:38.710> a<00:01:38.770> future

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
well so we'll come see that in a future

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.490 
well so we'll come see that in a future
video<00:01:39.160> i<00:01:39.550> will<00:01:40.420> see<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.780> actual<00:01:40.899> scars<00:01:41.350> at<00:01:41.470> the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
video i will see the actual scars at the

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.010 
video i will see the actual scars at the
bottom<00:01:41.710> there<00:01:42.270> now<00:01:43.270> if<00:01:43.450> you've<00:01:43.570> seen<00:01:43.780> my

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
bottom there now if you've seen my

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.950 
bottom there now if you've seen my
that's<00:01:45.009> World<00:01:45.220> War<00:01:45.369> next<00:01:45.750> comparison<00:01:46.750> video

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
that's World War next comparison video

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.469 
that's World War next comparison video
1x<00:01:47.500> benchmark<00:01:48.009> you'll<00:01:48.670> see<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:48.940> CPUs

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
1x benchmark you'll see the CPUs

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.749 
1x benchmark you'll see the CPUs
actually<00:01:49.899> you<00:01:50.440> know<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.770> gets<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:51.070> higher<00:01:51.340> a

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
actually you know it gets a higher a

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.719 
actually you know it gets a higher a
higher<00:01:51.850> number<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:53.320> it's<00:01:54.220> actually<00:01:54.580> over

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
higher number so it's actually over

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.279 
higher number so it's actually over
things<00:01:55.000> that<00:01:55.090> are<00:01:55.300> you<00:01:55.509> know<00:01:55.600> giving<00:01:55.930> it<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.050> bit

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
things that are you know giving it a bit

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.889 
things that are you know giving it a bit
give<00:01:56.830> it<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:57.039> better<00:01:57.160> actual<00:01:57.550> scar<00:01:57.850> so<00:01:58.509> again

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
give it a better actual scar so again

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.060 
give it a better actual scar so again
I'll<00:01:59.050> cover<00:01:59.289> off<00:01:59.440> that<00:01:59.590> in<00:01:59.649> a<00:01:59.710> future<00:01:59.920> video

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
I'll cover off that in a future video

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.020 
I'll cover off that in a future video
I'm<00:02:00.280> going<00:02:00.369> to<00:02:00.430> be<00:02:00.490> doing<00:02:00.580> a<00:02:00.700> head-to-head

I'm going to be doing a head-to-head

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.030 
I'm going to be doing a head-to-head
with<00:02:01.149> this<00:02:01.270> under<00:02:01.510> one<00:02:01.659> x<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:02.710> no<00:02:02.799> way<00:02:02.860> that's

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
with this under one x so no way that's

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.539 
with this under one x so no way that's
the<00:02:03.130> 1s<00:02:03.520> in<00:02:03.729> terms<00:02:03.970> of<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.450> quadrant<00:02:04.930> scars

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
the 1s in terms of the quadrant scars

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.950 
the 1s in terms of the quadrant scars
work<00:02:06.549> we're<00:02:06.820> going<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:06.970> do<00:02:07.119> is<00:02:07.330> we<00:02:07.689> will<00:02:07.780> pull

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
work we're going to do is we will pull

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.570 
work we're going to do is we will pull
up<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.110> limb<00:02:08.320> pack<00:02:10.260> so<00:02:11.260> i<00:02:11.290> will<00:02:11.799> impact<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.489> the

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
up a limb pack so i will impact to the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.330 
up a limb pack so i will impact to the
door<00:02:12.760> here<00:02:13.480> we<00:02:13.600> go<00:02:14.280> get<00:02:15.280> rid<00:02:15.430> of<00:02:15.489> that<00:02:17.340> once

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
door here we go get rid of that once

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.310 
door here we go get rid of that once
again<00:02:18.610> we'll<00:02:18.970> zoom<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:19.360> classifier<00:02:22.200> here<00:02:23.200> we

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
again we'll zoom in classifier here we

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.699 
again we'll zoom in classifier here we
go<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:24.400> I'll<00:02:24.519> do<00:02:24.640> now<00:02:24.850> is<00:02:24.880> we'll<00:02:25.150> do<00:02:25.269> a<00:02:25.299> quick

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
go so I'll do now is we'll do a quick

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.380 
go so I'll do now is we'll do a quick
benchmarking<00:02:26.709> on<00:02:26.829> the<00:02:26.890> limb<00:02:27.010> pack<00:02:27.220> or<00:02:27.760> zoo<00:02:28.030> to

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
benchmarking on the limb pack or zoo to

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.850 
benchmarking on the limb pack or zoo to
that<00:02:28.600> looks<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.840> little<00:02:29.019> brown<00:02:29.260> screen<00:02:29.680> right

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
that looks a little brown screen right

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.050 
that looks a little brown screen right
now<00:02:29.890> so<00:02:30.070> it's<00:02:30.280> too<00:02:30.400> much<00:02:30.579> with<00:02:30.760> screen

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
now so it's too much with screen

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.790 
now so it's too much with screen
brownish<00:02:31.360> down<00:02:31.570> a<00:02:31.600> tiny<00:02:31.900> bit

as<00:03:54.140> I<00:03:54.290> said<00:03:54.320> previously<00:03:54.470> benchmarks<00:03:55.310> door

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
as I said previously benchmarks door

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.030 
as I said previously benchmarks door
mean<00:03:55.640> everything<00:03:56.030> but<00:03:56.900> while<00:03:57.500> we're<00:03:57.620> here<00:03:57.770> we

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
mean everything but while we're here we

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.740 
mean everything but while we're here we
will<00:03:58.250> run<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:58.700> all-important<00:03:59.480> third

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
will run the all-important third

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.680 
will run the all-important third
benchmark<00:04:00.520> which<00:04:01.520> as<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.209> probably<00:04:02.270> know<00:04:02.540> by

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
benchmark which as you probably know by

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.990 
benchmark which as you probably know by
now<00:04:02.720> is<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.320> antutu<00:04:03.800> benchmark<00:04:06.820> so<00:04:07.820> once

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
now is the antutu benchmark so once

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.880 
now is the antutu benchmark so once
again<00:04:08.120> we'll<00:04:08.900> do<00:04:09.020> a<00:04:09.050> benchmark<00:04:09.500> on<00:04:09.620> this<00:04:09.709> one

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
again we'll do a benchmark on this one

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.830 
again we'll do a benchmark on this one
so<00:04:10.010> I'm<00:04:10.070> just<00:04:10.190> going<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.370> start<00:04:10.610> a<00:04:10.700> test<00:04:10.940> so

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
so I'm just going to start a test so

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.140 
so I'm just going to start a test so
stay<00:04:12.020> tuned<00:04:12.260> from<00:04:12.470> our<00:04:12.620> iron<00:04:12.920> once<00:04:13.070> again<00:04:13.310> I'll

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
stay tuned from our iron once again I'll

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:22.590 
stay tuned from our iron once again I'll
be<00:04:14.360> right<00:04:14.510> back

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:35.580

not so much in antutu so it really
