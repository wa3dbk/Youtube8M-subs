00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:25.560
 already heated by gas 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:25.560
 electrical cables done sewage 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.290
 there is a 10 circular metal barrel 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.239
 which is tied to the stove waited 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:51.570
 so who probably not less than plus me 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.570
 20 even by 22 degrees 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:03.370
 so screaming lighting cable comes in 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:06.720
 here you are completely on the food boiler so 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.720
 boiler room 11 meters 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:13.460
 electric boiler gas meter and 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:22.950
 gas boiler proterm 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:26.119
 23 kilowatt well house she comes in 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.119
 never change 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.840
 so here is a corridor of the order of ten 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.830
 meters bathroom 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.830
 6 meters 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.960
 living room and kitchen 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.149

00:01:49.960 --> 00:02:01.030
 kitchen 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:02:03.030
 opposite the terrace is a terrace of 9 meters and 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.229
 this left side 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.950
 usually organize a living room ie a sofa 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.799
 put 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:17.910
 and opposite the TV stairs on the second 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:21.760
 the floor is also quite a large hall 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:28.379
 8 square meters here you can 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:32.829
 make a closet put a bathroom 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:35.879
 five and a half meters this loop 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:39.370
 made for towel warmer 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:45.050
 mounted heating in the house 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:48.250
 here is this room 18 meters away 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.250
 16 meters 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.530
 the ceiling of the second floor is better to do 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.530
 stretch ceiling 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:12.310
 future owner already bikes with so from 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.830
 the window is visible to the pond but more precisely now it 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:21.280
 snow field and in summer will be enough 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.560
 a large reservoir a kilometer in diameter at once 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.510
 there are six settlements behind him 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.150
 or seven 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:37.120
 on the contrary this is our home there people already 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:41.910
 live stopped here looks like this house 128 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.200
 square meters this year we will 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.190
 some houses do plaster 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.570
 electrical wiring 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:55.140
 and exterior finish partially in some 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:58.570
 homes now left about 7 houses 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:02.010
 But if years remain, it means 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.010
 some of them plastered
