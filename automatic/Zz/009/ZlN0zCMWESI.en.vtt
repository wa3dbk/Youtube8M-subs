for 12 hours straight and the entire

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.889 
for 12 hours straight and the entire
farm<00:01:02.070> had<00:01:02.340> an<00:01:02.460> inch<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.789> water<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.780> was

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
farm had an inch of water and I was

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.870 
farm had an inch of water and I was
happy<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.470> chickens<00:01:04.799> were<00:01:04.890> inside

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
happy that the chickens were inside

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.050 
happy that the chickens were inside
under<00:01:06.210> cover<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> greenhouse<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:08.060> their

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
under cover of the greenhouse and their

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.810 
under cover of the greenhouse and their
bedding<00:01:09.299> stayed<00:01:09.750> dry<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.159> did<00:01:11.400> notice

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
bedding stayed dry what I did notice

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.280 
bedding stayed dry what I did notice
though<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> greenhouse

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
though is that with the greenhouse

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.219 
though is that with the greenhouse
having<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.950> much<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.310> roof<00:01:14.549> if<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.420> figure<00:01:15.840> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
having so much of a roof if you figure a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.230 
having so much of a roof if you figure a
I<00:01:16.380> think<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.950> hundred<00:01:17.250> square<00:01:17.460> feet<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
I think it's a hundred square feet and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.090 
I think it's a hundred square feet and
an<00:01:18.360> inch<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.630> rain<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.990> sixty<00:01:19.470> gallons<00:01:19.950> of

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
an inch of rain is sixty gallons of

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.999 
an inch of rain is sixty gallons of
water<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.540> math<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> 96<00:01:22.830> by

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
water so if you do that math for a 96 by

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.340 
water so if you do that math for a 96 by
36<00:01:23.580> greenhouse<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.570> lot<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.930> displaced

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
36 greenhouse it's a lot of displaced

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.039 
36 greenhouse it's a lot of displaced
water<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.060> outside<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.299> greenhouse<00:01:27.780> on

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
water and outside of the greenhouse on

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.530 
water and outside of the greenhouse on
either<00:01:28.200> side<00:01:28.560> started<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> really<00:01:29.970> pull<00:01:30.299> up

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
either side started to really pull up

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.179 
either side started to really pull up
with<00:01:30.720> water<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.170> didn't<00:01:31.439> come<00:01:31.560> inside

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
with water it didn't come inside

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.910 
with water it didn't come inside
but<00:01:32.490> outside<00:01:32.820> was<00:01:33.060> kind<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.509> mess<00:01:33.890> what<00:01:34.890> I

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
but outside was kind of a mess what I

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.340 
but outside was kind of a mess what I
did<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.579> there<00:01:35.759> run<00:01:36.090> was<00:01:36.509> added<00:01:36.869> about<00:01:37.020> six

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
did in there run was added about six

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.170 
did in there run was added about six
inches<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.829> topsoil<00:01:38.040> because<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.759> had<00:01:38.939> some

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180

of that and then a trench either going
towards<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> back<00:01:46.290> or<00:01:46.560> towards<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.860> front<00:01:47.100> of

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
towards the back or towards the front of

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.499 
towards the back or towards the front of
the<00:01:47.220> greenhouse<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.820> helped<00:01:47.970> drain<00:01:48.240> some<00:01:48.479> of

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
the greenhouse that helped drain some of

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.840 
the greenhouse that helped drain some of
that<00:01:48.630> water<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.890> future<00:01:50.130> I'm<00:01:50.490> gonna<00:01:50.640> dig

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
that water in the future I'm gonna dig

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.550 
that water in the future I'm gonna dig
out<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> trench<00:01:51.090> put<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> drainage<00:01:52.049> pipe<00:01:52.079> some

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
out a trench put a drainage pipe some

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.319 
out a trench put a drainage pipe some
gravel<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.100> then<00:01:53.280> put<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.520> soil<00:01:53.880> back<00:01:54.119> down

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
gravel and then put that soil back down

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.990 
gravel and then put that soil back down
so<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.409> has<00:01:55.560> even<00:01:55.740> better<00:01:56.009> drainage<00:01:56.430> because

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
so it has even better drainage because

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.819 
so it has even better drainage because
where<00:01:57.329> they're<00:01:57.509> run<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.110> between<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.590> in

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
where they're run is in between is in

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.530 
where they're run is in between is in
between<00:01:58.950> two<00:01:59.280> greenhouses<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.390> this

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
between two greenhouses so I have this

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.480 
between two greenhouses so I have this
greenhouse<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.259> greenhouse<00:02:01.500> dumping

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
greenhouse in this greenhouse dumping

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.249 
greenhouse in this greenhouse dumping
water<00:02:02.729> right<00:02:03.030> into<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.329> middle<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.049> lot

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
water right into the middle it's a lot

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.410 
water right into the middle it's a lot
of<00:02:04.439> water<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.130> not<00:02:05.369> draining<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.149> well

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
of water and it's not draining so well

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.290 
of water and it's not draining so well
that's<00:02:07.290> very<00:02:07.469> specific<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.340> me<00:02:08.520> though<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:08.970> you

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
that's very specific to me though so you

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.630 
that's very specific to me though so you
might<00:02:09.539> not<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.140> problem<00:02:10.430> the<00:02:11.430> only

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
might not have that problem the only

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.110 
might not have that problem the only
other<00:02:11.790> thing<00:02:12.120> that's<00:02:12.390> been<00:02:12.540> kind<00:02:12.840> of

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
other thing that's been kind of

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.149 
other thing that's been kind of
knowing<00:02:13.360> is<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.620> chickens<00:02:14.980> are

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
knowing is that the chickens are

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.920 
knowing is that the chickens are
roosting<00:02:15.370> on<00:02:15.909> the<00:02:16.510> nest<00:02:16.750> boxes<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:19.420> the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
roosting on the nest boxes and the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.930 
roosting on the nest boxes and the
evenings<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:20.500> they're<00:02:20.950> pooping<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.730> nest

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
evenings and they're pooping in the nest

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.990 
evenings and they're pooping in the nest
boxes<00:02:22.440> we<00:02:23.440> fix<00:02:23.830> this<00:02:24.010> in<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:24.250> summer<00:02:24.459> by<00:02:24.670> closing

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
boxes we fix this in a summer by closing

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.880 
boxes we fix this in a summer by closing
the<00:02:25.239> nest<00:02:25.420> boxes<00:02:25.840> but<00:02:26.080> because<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.530> sunlight

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
the nest boxes but because the sunlight

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.339 
the nest boxes but because the sunlight
is<00:02:27.040> so<00:02:27.220> wonky<00:02:27.670> in<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:27.940> winter<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:29.019> short

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
is so wonky in the winter and so short

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.140 
is so wonky in the winter and so short
we're<00:02:29.709> leaving<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.099> boxes<00:02:30.459> open<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.909> give<00:02:31.030> the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
we're leaving the boxes open to give the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.990 
we're leaving the boxes open to give the
chickens<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:32.560> most<00:02:32.799> time<00:02:33.069> possible<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.849> lay

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
chickens the most time possible to lay

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.729
