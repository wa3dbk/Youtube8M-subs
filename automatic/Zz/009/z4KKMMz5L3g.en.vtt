00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.059
 hello I will explain how to assemble a 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.400
 additional hard drive in a super ps3 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.469
 those of 12 gb of the other can 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.709
 exit now as you see is the one that has 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:19.190
 the window opening system 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.720
 sliding and good although they say that makes 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.970
 a lot of noise really the hector makes a 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.010
 little noise but what is the console 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.930
 it's much quieter and it 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.650
 it heats a lot less 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.890
 we will need then as honorable the ps3 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.550
 a hard drive and the official support of 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.550
 sound 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.360
 for the price I think it's worth it 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.830
 use the official since they are only 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.470
 nine euros with 90 in a large 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.630
 surface and good we know that fits 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.120
 perfectly circular air 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.520
 correctly 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.590
 and well it does not have either very 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.989
 Complications what a craftsman 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:05.050
 Well, I'm a little more complex 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.050
 we will need what is the support 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.510
 has therefore the accommodations for 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.400
 screws 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.400
 they are our four tiny screws 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.800
 a blue like the one that had the previous 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.840
 ps3 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.840
 and then it 's the hard drive system 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.650
 what is the hard drive fits 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:50.950
 perfectly this is from a ps3 of 60 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.950
 gigas who died by the yellow lights 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.420
 5400 revolutions and the capacity then 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.340
 are these 60 gigs 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.659
 simply because you have to look for 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.080
 face the holes in the 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.080
 screws 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.670
 the screws come what is the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.280
 screw holder comes with a 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.959
 small a small rubber washer 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.959
 I imagine it will be to avoid vibrations 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.710
 As you can see, it fits perfectly 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.460
 It has some small holes I can not imagine 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.460
 which will be for ventilation 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.950
 in the previous ones the hard drive was in 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:54.230
 the bottom and here in the part 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.890
 lower is to place the stand 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.890
 official 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.210
 in this is at the top 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.270
 just then pushing through here by 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.350
 this tab a little bit to the right 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.650
 from left to right 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.450
 what is the plate comes out 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.019
 as you see and has a hole one 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.019
 accommodation 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.209
 at the bottom is the support 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.209
 hard disk lace 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.890
 when you go to mount the hard drive 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.530
 be careful 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.800
 these two screws from here on 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.650
 OK 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.570
 tighten them as little as possible because the 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.900
 housing the bottom is a 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.390
 little offset of the connectors 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.569
 then it costs a lot to fit in 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.300
 place it 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.950
 oh what 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.420
 download it and when it comes to this 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.580
 position you have to put pressure with this 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.050
 pin up is saying doing 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.920
 a reverse lever so that the part of 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:59.770
 go up and look for the position costs a 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.340
 little but until it is not 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.340
 the position 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.940
 with the lever raised you have to 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.980
 press with the pin that is 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.490
 displace you have to press with your fingers 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.490
 down 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:33.699
 and press and you see that now it is 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.699
 perfectly placed 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:39.119
 it's an important point because if you do not 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.300
 it will happen like me that the first of this 

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:43.430
 you think it is well placed 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.250
 When installing, you do not recognize the 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.120
 hard disk once you see life 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.120
 completely flat 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.470
 already what is the lid 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.940
 fits perfectly in its place and remains 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.860
 perfectly mounted 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.860
 in the plane and in that
