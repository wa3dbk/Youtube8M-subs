00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:11.490
 the first great performance of the team of 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.019
 general way and reached the interval 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.400
 losing forget I talk to 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.470
 true to you 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.090
 in a tone of voice until a little more 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.900
 strong 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.830
 they took me look through before 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.019
 They want me to talk but I really wanted to. 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.050
 be playing a lot 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.820
 is playing a lot but this is a step 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.219
 You'll have to look in the plastic. 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.840
 confirm in the second half continued in the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:43.079
 second time had 29 finalizations 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.600
 believe the degree of accuracy is that 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.399
 fell a little bit in this we are one 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.430
 a little bit more calm one 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.059
 a little more and the best choices and 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.520
 of the sea ​​in a larger 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.260
 translated and no mistake is not is not 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.890
 So we can say the Portuguese 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.330
 No, that's not it, it's not because 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.770
 He played very well and could have been having 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.020
 built a bigger board 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.210
 the merit of the attackers' jet for 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.150
 Kleber 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.799
 dodo fernando do cariri and all of 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.290
 a general way is that when people 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.659
 It's okay to give this job, they're 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.549
 receptive to this when we show 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.400
 in the video you have to bring in 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.479
 the banana to hit the goal they they 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.340
 They look convinced and go to work, right? 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.650
 When we say that it leaves a lot to 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.150
 inside attack little swing and leave a 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.479
 on the outside also that the opponent will 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.909
 staying is in doubt which side is going 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.280
 leaving makes you unpredictable too 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.899
 seek this improvement not only in this 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.460
 but the header of the defender in the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.280
 an interception ball leg 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.350
 left or in the case today of a 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.049
 improvisation and how important it is 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.149
 petros a function where not we have 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.600
 and operates on a limited number of 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.600
 of inscriptions
