00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.830
 good morning good morning dear 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.050
 TV viewers are coming which time 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.330
 literally half a century ago was described 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.429
 Imagine fiction they wrote 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.560
 I will need no future 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.330
 industry all the necessary things 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.699
 a person will be able to print at home 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.680
 on the advanced printer about the appearance of the first 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.410
 Russian 3d printers we will tell 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.359
 today in russia my first who started 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.560
 do it seriously 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.300
 scale and first who got 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.550
 investments well and actually on that 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.090
 the level that we have now left 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.160
 I hope we can and we can 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.989
 compete for then a great idea 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.399
 came to mind then another student 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.940
 Moscow Institute of Electronic 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.460
 technology 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.980
 Andrew iesuit 1 3d printer can 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.379
 print on already invented 3d 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.570
 printer and improve it guys 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.340
 ordered only appeared plywood 3d 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.199
 printer in america and started work 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.210
 they first created several models 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.190
 prototypes of this machine then came to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.860
 a decision that fundamentally changed 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.810
 All this decision was casting silicone 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.350
 when we pour silicone already 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.049
 exit 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.930
 beautiful finished products and do not need 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.390
 almost no need to refine them 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.409
 strong principle fully fit 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.090
 and it also gave a very strong push to 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.890
 exterior paint in appearance 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.840
 the shape is the result 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.700
 such printers which are worth pretty 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.710
 cheap and you can afford any 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.750
 family of average wealth and quality 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.420
 printing and precision parts 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.460
 quite acceptable here you will see the national team 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.799
 the eiffel tower the whole of it was printed 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.520
 on Russian 3d printer made in 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.619
 Zelenograd 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.320
 now there are seals of exclusive shah 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.149
 created for three players on any 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.610
 the head is printed out darkness behind 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.470
 and here it is additional details in order 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.390
 same 3d printer which occasionally 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.340
 need to change there are experts who 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.799
 back patience waiting for the appearance of such 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.579
 magic fixture like 3d printer 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.400
 midway course architect example 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.770
 can see 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.290
 here is such a layout 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.800
 printed it has two floors 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.030
 fully collapsible here and there you can 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.520
 arrange the furniture everything else 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.310
 see how it will all be outwardly 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.450
 look well here it was the most certain 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.680
 our biggest prince let's say it 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.970
 a small troll was printed out 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.040
 a large number of parts 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:30.470
 I will tell 237 parts and further we will glue together 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.210
 enthusiastically to the advent of 3d printers 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.390
 also treat the doctors they can now 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.120
 scan which organ for example the skull 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.620
 on 3d scanner and then print this 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.170
 full-size skull and 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.670
 thoroughly plan the operation on 3d 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.500
 the printer can also create any 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.510
 designer things to try new 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.250
 technology and also just create 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.709
 toys little baby can now 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.120
 start invent your own 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.740
 constructor because draw in the details in 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.930
 three-dimensional view using the graphic 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.880
 programs and print it out on a printer 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.040
 but the most amazing thing that started 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.380
 Russian history of 3d printers with 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.330
 boys enthusiast from grapes who 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.190
 able to make competitive 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.590
 product is the hardest moment for us 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.400
 it was catch up on what was done on 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.920
 west and not be late but go ahead 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.290
 this proves once again that our powder 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.090
 technological powders still there and 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.590
 transition from pipe economy to economy 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.590
 knowledge is still possible
