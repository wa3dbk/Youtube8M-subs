school and and I'm pretty unhappy with

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.300 
school and and I'm pretty unhappy with
the<00:00:20.039> English<00:00:20.939> system<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.510> will<00:00:21.660> explain

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
the English system and I will explain

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.259 
the English system and I will explain
why<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.730> mean<00:00:24.449> basically<00:00:25.760> what's<00:00:26.760> wrong<00:00:27.029> with

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
why I mean basically what's wrong with

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.040 
why I mean basically what's wrong with
it<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.630> high<00:00:28.080> school<00:00:28.470> as<00:00:28.680> we<00:00:28.859> know<00:00:29.039> it

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
it is that high school as we know it

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.290 
it is that high school as we know it
ends<00:00:31.050> when<00:00:32.030> people<00:00:33.030> are<00:00:34.160> when<00:00:35.160> people<00:00:35.489> are<00:00:35.670> 16

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
ends when people are when people are 16

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.920 
ends when people are when people are 16
years<00:00:37.190> old<00:00:38.190> that's<00:00:38.969> one<00:00:39.180> high<00:00:39.360> school<00:00:39.390> ends

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
years old that's one high school ends

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.799 
years old that's one high school ends

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
after that comes College which are the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.170 
after that comes College which are the
two<00:00:43.020> last<00:00:43.260> year<00:00:43.590> last<00:00:44.460> years<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.910> high<00:00:45.149> school

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
two last year last years of high school

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.900 
two last year last years of high school
I<00:00:45.690> really<00:00:46.020> college<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.579> college

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
I really college and it's a college

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.910 
I really college and it's a college
system<00:00:48.120> which<00:00:48.539> like<00:00:49.079> my<00:00:49.289> daughter<00:00:49.530> she<00:00:49.800> only

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
system which like my daughter she only

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.150 
system which like my daughter she only
studies<00:00:50.370> four<00:00:50.760> subjects<00:00:51.829> history<00:00:52.829> chemistry

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
studies four subjects history chemistry

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.630 
studies four subjects history chemistry
physics<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.940> mathematics<00:00:54.590> at<00:00:55.590> college<00:00:56.160> level

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
physics and mathematics at college level

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.369 
physics and mathematics at college level
so<00:00:57.329> she<00:00:57.390> studies<00:00:57.870> college<00:00:58.230> level<00:01:00.170> subjects<00:01:01.170> at

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
so she studies college level subjects at

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.310 
so she studies college level subjects at
the<00:01:01.530> age<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.800> 16<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.489> when<00:01:03.359> college<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.899> over

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the age of 16 and when college is over

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.130 
the age of 16 and when college is over
at<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> age<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.159> 18<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:06.570> start<00:01:06.840> University

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
at the age of 18 they start University

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.539 
at the age of 18 they start University
and<00:01:07.890> they<00:01:08.610> go<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> degree<00:01:10.040> so<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.220> British

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
and they go for a degree so the British

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.020 
and they go for a degree so the British
system<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> American<00:01:12.840> system<00:01:13.020> but

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
system is like the American system but

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.990 
system is like the American system but
ahead<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.240> time<00:01:15.630> which<00:01:16.259> we

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
ahead in time which we

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.080 
ahead in time which we
kid<00:01:18.000> said<00:01:18.270> 16<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.710> decide<00:01:20.640> what<00:01:20.970> they

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
kid said 16 have to decide what they

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.990 
kid said 16 have to decide what they
want<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.450> study<00:01:21.720> more<00:01:22.080> or<00:01:22.200> less<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.640> find

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
want to study more or less and I find

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.790 
want to study more or less and I find
that<00:01:24.090> pretty<00:01:24.860> bad<00:01:25.860> because<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:27.560> studied<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
that pretty bad because I studied in the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.350 
that pretty bad because I studied in the
States<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.369> had<00:01:29.640> no<00:01:29.820> clue<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.119> what<00:01:30.330> I

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
States and I had no clue of what I

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.969 
States and I had no clue of what I
wanted<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.750> study<00:01:30.930> even<00:01:31.170> after<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> second

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
wanted to study even after the second

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.410 
wanted to study even after the second
year<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.220> college<00:01:32.340> when<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.970> was<00:01:33.119> kind<00:01:33.300> of

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
year of college when I was kind of

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.300 
year of college when I was kind of
forced<00:01:33.690> to<00:01:33.900> choose<00:01:34.080> a<00:01:34.140> major<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:34.830> I<00:01:34.860> still<00:01:35.130> had

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
forced to choose a major but I still had

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.670 
forced to choose a major but I still had
the<00:01:35.400> opportunity<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.000> doing<00:01:36.149> a<00:01:36.390> minor<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.649> I

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
the opportunity of doing a minor so I

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.700 
the opportunity of doing a minor so I
did<00:01:37.979> philosophy<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.940> economics<00:01:39.590> then<00:01:40.590> I

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
did philosophy and economics then I

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.740 
did philosophy and economics then I
studied<00:01:41.100> also<00:01:41.430> chemistry<00:01:42.060> physics<00:01:43.070> ite<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:45.509> my

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
studied also chemistry physics ite so my

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.480 
studied also chemistry physics ite so my
favorite<00:01:46.200> system<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.680> really<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:47.009> American

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
favorite system is really the American

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.120 
favorite system is really the American
system<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.810> i<00:01:49.259> hope<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.649> British<00:01:49.950> system

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
system and i hope the British system

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.830 
system and i hope the British system
evolves<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:51.679> something<00:01:52.679> more<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.039> the<00:01:53.250> IB

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
evolves to something more like the IB

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.020 
evolves to something more like the IB
international<00:01:54.840> baccala<00:01:55.369> which<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:56.910> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
international baccala which is like the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.990 
international baccala which is like the
French<00:01:57.300> system<00:01:57.750> or<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.289> German<00:01:59.000> system

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
French system or the German system

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.660 
French system or the German system
Spanish<00:02:00.450> system<00:02:00.840> Italian<00:02:01.289> system<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:02.460> which

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
Spanish system Italian system in which

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.490 
Spanish system Italian system in which
kids<00:02:02.970> in<00:02:03.149> high<00:02:03.300> school<00:02:03.330> still<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:04.080> to<00:02:04.229> study

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
kids in high school still have to study

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.810 
kids in high school still have to study
11<00:02:04.860> subjects<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.770> they<00:02:07.920> spend<00:02:08.070> more<00:02:08.489> time

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
11 subjects and so they spend more time

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.170 
11 subjects and so they spend more time
learning<00:02:09.209> about<00:02:09.509> everything
