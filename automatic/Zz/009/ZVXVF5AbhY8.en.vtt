00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.750 

err<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:27.740> think<00:03:28.130> you<00:03:28.220> could<00:03:28.340> probably<00:03:28.400> get<00:03:28.670> an

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
err I think you could probably get an

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.890 
err I think you could probably get an
idea<00:03:28.970> of<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.180> noise<00:03:29.360> sounds<00:03:29.750> like<00:03:29.870> a

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
idea of the noise sounds like a

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.750 
idea of the noise sounds like a
lawnmower<00:03:30.140> but<00:03:31.100> it's<00:03:31.220> relatively<00:03:31.490> quiet

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
lawnmower but it's relatively quiet

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.600 
lawnmower but it's relatively quiet
compared<00:03:32.330> to<00:03:32.390> this<00:03:32.480> one<00:03:33.160> this<00:03:34.160> is<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.460> old

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
compared to this one this is the old
