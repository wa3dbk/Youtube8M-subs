00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.780
 Official selectionfestival of dogs 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.700
 Oh, is it a bit sad in the end do not you think? 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.560
 She was very intelligent 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.020
 The smartest person I've ever met 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.300
 It was so authentic 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.720
 Amy, smile and then turn off the camera 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.120
 You promise? 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.560
 I had an emotional relationship with the huge music 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.500
 You are becoming a public figure 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.640
 The more people see me, they realize that the only thing I serve is making music 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.820
 And the grammy is for 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.220
 Amy Winehouse 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.240
 She was one of the most real artists I've ever met 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.820
 The world wanted a bit of it 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.240
 Amy was a girl who just wanted to be loved 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.240
 I fell in love with someone I would have died for 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.860
 And love is like a drug, is not it? 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.540
 It was just someone who wanted to disappear 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.900
 A masterpiece 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.440
 The thing is, I do not think it's going to be anything 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.240
 Touching 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.720
 An extraordinary work 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.160
 A journey of joy and pain 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.780
 A star has been reborn 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.320
 I'm not a girl trying to be a star 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.100
 Only a girl who sings
