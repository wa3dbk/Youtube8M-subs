00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.790
 hello what is and welcome to the episode of 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.200
 this series called value feel 4 in the 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.050
 which today I am here of 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.750
 come back playing really here in the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.279
 Other resort map puts a little bit of 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.860
 dye more really is that I have been 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.900
 not much this way you take a 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.489
 Rest of playing in real vehicles 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.200
 they will only happen when in 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.820
 vehicles before bringing peace and 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.980
 playing in vehicles deals rest 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.800
 must use the vehicles also put a 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.190
 little here of what weapons are not 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.190
 so 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.780
 perfect 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.860
 as open fellows like everything in 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.380
 song 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.730
 x 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.730
 but they do not know again 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.190
 perfect and when killing 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.700
 how can you see this map that I am 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.939
 playing 64 contrasta 32 32 people 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.060
 local easy large 32 with 32 people 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.429
 in a ticket match is practically a 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.149
 Butchery in this video is what they are going to 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:26.640
 see are going to see how is the chaos of a 32 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.049
 with 32 on a map as small as is the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.590
 small note in quotation marks but in a 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.869
 map like this one that immersed is 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.549
 practically impossible to try 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.070
 many kilos at the same time due to 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.210
 what is good about life that 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.210
 there are many people 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.280
 there are a lot of people and this in that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.240
 It influences gamers very simple the more 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.520
 people have 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.990
 it's easier for us to find out easier 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.090
 that someone sees them easier than 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.740
 someone makes them sporting therefore 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:04.200
 it's much easier for someone to kill them 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.200
 in this case however this is normal 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.540
 it's difficult, it's difficult, it's difficult 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.489
 dv 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.780
 inspector 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.969
 while she discovered me in which 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.560
 I prefer now because it is already 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:28.609
 shooting a sniper gamers things that 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.000
 obviously it's going to mortify me a lot 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:33.930
 success 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.930
 locate it 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.740
 to kill him something that is not going to be 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.740
 simple 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.750
 hauser 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.689
 and that's how we manage to be effect 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.989
 we destabilize that they are changing 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:57.549
 now what we can do for 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.069
 avoid this kind of situations is very 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.890
 simple that you see here nothing comes 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.629
 I have a flashback which has proven 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.970
 do although not very valuable will be 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.260
 mention to free people that when 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.140
 they see you out of practice when 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.739
 I really do not want to worry much 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.930
 for throwing perfect grenades what 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.299
 I do that is that I grab they did not stop seeing what 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.010
 are the flashes for nights which 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.910
 make your enemy go blind 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.670
 a quantity of time 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.260
 very short always and short but what 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.510
 powerful enough to 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.700
 make you can enter running and 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.950
 you can kill him in the few shots 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.050
 on the face, including the chest 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.050
 then it 's a set shit 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.019
 It is incredibly easy to use gamers 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.019
 they have 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:52.969
 and I will risk the truth this maternal 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.980
 sniper from a distance with a rifle that 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:56.900
 move is my 3 is a waste of time 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.380
 gamers do not try it the truth is that 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.350
 it's not worth what it is that 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.030
 that kind of thing destroys the for the 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.120
 enemies of the back after you 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.980
 start hunting as we already know team 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.500
 deathmatch is not like domination 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.780
 internal has certain patterns of 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.920
 Respawn from enemies pretty much 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.910
 considerable 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.370
 and very predictable in this case we have 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.990
 this pattern in which yes all and all 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.520
 the complexes are on one side the 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.010
 enemies knows the other side answers 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.200
 This is a rule tend fuller 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.170
 because it's like a certain balance that 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.740
 act in the game more because obviously 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.740
 not all 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.180
 okay 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.000
 be 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.370
 all make it make it make it 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:58.930
 purely perfect in champion 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.850
 but it was always dark one day 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.380
 can see how we are here now if 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.750
 my colleagues are getting from 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.100
 this side and they are starting to 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.740
 do is where the other side of the 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:12.490
 optionally you understand more map puts 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:17.390
 one or two teams on the opposite side to 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:25.790
 a 34 sorry later to avoid 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:28.010
 that all the equipment from time to time 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.960
 so why is it that when I 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.990
 you kill shit when there are eight bullets left 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.870
 of ammunition 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.550
 nothing better than a small friend stand 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.550
 that has a curse when you need it 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.270
 I would stay here until I have all the 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.670
 interned but this is going to take 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.920
 a lot of time I do not have time to 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.920
 that and not several seasons so 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.470
 from here I always have our 80's 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.470
 and how to kill after 10 people 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.930
 and not schemes and styles to look very 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:05.300
 well on the map 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.300
 the most important sporting 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:12.669
 perfect 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.680
 at least 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.899
 almost another less 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:32.000
 and it is over 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:34.940
 as you could see this was a 32 against 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.220
 32 of 300 kits which is going 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.750
 incredibly fast from everest this 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.940
 match what we did not get it like all 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.950
 the champions thank you and obviously to 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.410
 our team in the long run we were 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.820
 using the reals that was regular was not 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.330
 excellently good but I was regular 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.220
 with my score team which 64 nothing 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.500
 bad the truth nothing bad nothing bad 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.240
 as long as there are no negative gamer 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.250
 King subtle are only seen for 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.930
 up and it will be improving that is very 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.030
 important but as always my 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.220
 Dear winks you already know that 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.580
 my name is bad and we see each other until 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.580
 next 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.510
 and 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.420
 um 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.590
 at
