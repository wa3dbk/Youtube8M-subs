00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
the carpet was cheap there's more of the

insulation<00:00:41.079> in<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.200> carpet<00:00:41.559> that's<00:00:41.710> a<00:00:41.800> better

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
insulation in the carpet that's a better

insulation in the carpet that's a better
view<00:00:42.250> but<00:00:44.550> real<00:00:45.550> easy<00:00:45.760> to<00:00:45.879> do<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.750> floor<00:00:47.020> I

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
view but real easy to do the floor I

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.619 
view but real easy to do the floor I
ended<00:00:47.440> up<00:00:47.559> leaving<00:00:47.770> in<00:00:48.039> two<00:00:48.219> pieces<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:49.420> meats

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
ended up leaving in two pieces the meats

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.420 
ended up leaving in two pieces the meats
right<00:00:49.840> there<00:00:50.050> in<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.289> center<00:00:50.530> I<00:00:50.860> had<00:00:51.160> planned

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
right there in the center I had planned

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.689 
right there in the center I had planned
on<00:00:51.550> putting<00:00:52.059> hinges<00:00:52.629> on<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.840> backside<00:00:53.289> of<00:00:53.469> it

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
on putting hinges on the backside of it

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.939 
on putting hinges on the backside of it
to<00:00:54.699> make<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.180> collapse<00:00:55.780> but<00:00:56.199> with<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.590> PVC

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
to make the collapse but with the PVC

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.650 
to make the collapse but with the PVC
that<00:00:57.340> I<00:00:57.370> have<00:00:57.640> underneath<00:00:58.059> it<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.300> floor<00:00:58.510> is

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
that I have underneath it the floor is

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.170 
that I have underneath it the floor is
rigid<00:00:59.140> enough<00:00:59.410> that<00:00:59.620> it<00:00:59.739> doesn't<00:00:59.920> buckle<00:01:00.309> when

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
rigid enough that it doesn't buckle when

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.790 
rigid enough that it doesn't buckle when
you<00:01:01.300> stand<00:01:01.570> in<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:01.809> middle<00:01:01.989> you<00:01:02.320> can<00:01:02.379> stay<00:01:02.739> and

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
you stand in the middle you can stay and

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.619 
you stand in the middle you can stay and
literally<00:01:03.250> one<00:01:03.489> foot<00:01:03.730> on<00:01:03.850> one<00:01:04.030> piece<00:01:04.210> one<00:01:04.510> on

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
literally one foot on one piece one on

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.050 
literally one foot on one piece one on
the<00:01:04.720> other<00:01:04.869> and<00:01:05.340> it<00:01:06.340> will<00:01:06.460> not<00:01:06.640> buckle<00:01:06.820> down

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
the other and it will not buckle down

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.429 
the other and it will not buckle down
into<00:01:07.299> the<00:01:07.390> center<00:01:07.689> so<00:01:07.869> I<00:01:07.900> think<00:01:08.020> I'm<00:01:08.320> gonna

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
into the center so I think I'm gonna

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.679 
into the center so I think I'm gonna
leave<00:01:08.680> it<00:01:08.830> at<00:01:08.979> two<00:01:09.189> pieces<00:01:09.700> without<00:01:10.119> hinges

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
leave it at two pieces without hinges

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.399 
leave it at two pieces without hinges
just<00:01:11.850> for<00:01:12.850> to<00:01:13.420> keep<00:01:13.570> it<00:01:13.689> lightweight<00:01:13.869> it's

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
just for to keep it lightweight it's

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.240 
just for to keep it lightweight it's
even<00:01:14.770> that<00:01:14.950> much<00:01:15.189> easier<00:01:15.549> to<00:01:15.780> transport

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
even that much easier to transport

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.580 
even that much easier to transport
moving<00:01:18.250> on<00:01:18.369> to<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.580> back<00:01:18.759> I<00:01:18.970> finally<00:01:19.299> have<00:01:19.450> my

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
moving on to the back I finally have my

the seat instead of the plywood
constructed<00:01:24.159> bench<00:01:24.400> I<00:01:24.549> had<00:01:24.729> in<00:01:24.909> there<00:01:25.119> that's

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:47.960 
I have the handle extended works real
nice<00:02:41.849> real<00:02:42.180> quiet<00:02:44.780> can't<00:02:45.780> see<00:02:46.609> but<00:02:47.609> as<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.819> can

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
nice real quiet can't see but as you can

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.140 
nice real quiet can't see but as you can
hear<00:02:48.889> that's<00:02:49.889> one<00:02:50.010> speed<00:02:50.250> five<00:02:50.579> and<00:02:50.879> it<00:02:50.970> makes

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
hear that's one speed five and it makes

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.000 
hear that's one speed five and it makes
almost<00:02:51.359> no<00:02:51.659> noise<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.500> that's<00:02:52.650> going<00:02:52.829> to<00:02:52.919> be

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
almost no noise so that's going to be

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.110 
almost no noise so that's going to be
real<00:02:53.189> nice<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.959> think<00:02:54.959> that'll<00:02:55.200> be<00:02:55.230> easy<00:02:56.159> to<00:02:56.489> get

real nice I think that'll be easy to get
around<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.750> fish<00:02:58.319> with<00:03:01.099> walking<00:03:02.099> around<00:03:02.430> the

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
around and fish with walking around the

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.500 
around and fish with walking around the
backside<00:03:04.099> nothing<00:03:05.099> really<00:03:05.250> different<00:03:05.579> just

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
depending on how often I would actually

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.250 
depending on how often I would actually
have<00:03:22.620> someone<00:03:23.099> outside<00:03:23.280> on<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.669> boat<00:03:23.819> with<00:03:24.000> me
