I'm Scott Jurek and I'm super stoked

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.000 
I'm Scott Jurek and I'm super stoked
about<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.550> response<00:00:21.910> of<00:00:22.150> the<00:00:22.240> ultra<00:00:22.510> vest

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
about the response of the ultra vest

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.840 
about the response of the ultra vest
working<00:00:24.010> closely<00:00:24.220> with<00:00:24.400> the<00:00:24.550> design<00:00:24.820> team

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
working closely with the design team

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.179 
working closely with the design team
we've<00:00:25.240> made<00:00:25.360> some<00:00:25.570> key<00:00:25.980> adjustments<00:00:26.980> and

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
we've made some key adjustments and

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.920 
we've made some key adjustments and
updates<00:00:27.790> to<00:00:28.119> version<00:00:28.330> 2.0<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:30.310> the<00:00:30.520> side

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
updates to version 2.0 on the side

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.840 
updates to version 2.0 on the side
pocket<00:00:31.930> we've<00:00:32.380> incorporated<00:00:32.680> a<00:00:33.309> lateral

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
pocket we've incorporated a lateral

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.490 
pocket we've incorporated a lateral
adjustment<00:00:34.120> strap<00:00:34.630> and<00:00:34.900> so<00:00:35.110> where<00:00:35.260> you're<00:00:35.379> not

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
adjustment strap and so where you're not

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.080 
adjustment strap and so where you're not
going<00:00:35.680> to<00:00:35.739> have<00:00:35.920> individuals<00:00:36.550> basically

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
going to have individuals basically

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.450 
going to have individuals basically
being<00:00:37.420> in<00:00:37.510> between<00:00:37.809> sizes<00:00:38.129> one<00:00:39.129> of<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.280> things

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
being in between sizes one of the things

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.280 
being in between sizes one of the things
that<00:00:39.610> I<00:00:39.670> found<00:00:39.910> in<00:00:40.030> using<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.720> first<00:00:40.900> version

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
that I found in using the first version

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.560 
that I found in using the first version
is<00:00:41.440> that<00:00:41.650> we<00:00:42.309> needed<00:00:42.489> to<00:00:42.699> reinforce<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.449> edge

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
is that we needed to reinforce the edge

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.540 
is that we needed to reinforce the edge
banding<00:00:44.020> and<00:00:44.199> stronger<00:00:44.620> elastic<00:00:45.040> banding<00:00:45.370> so

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
banding and stronger elastic banding so

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.040 
banding and stronger elastic banding so
you<00:00:45.610> don't<00:00:45.910> have<00:00:46.090> anything<00:00:46.300> popping<00:00:46.690> out<00:00:46.930> of

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
you don't have anything popping out of

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.350 
you don't have anything popping out of
the<00:00:47.110> side<00:00:47.320> pockets<00:00:47.820> including<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:49.150> large

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
the side pockets including the large

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.160 
the side pockets including the large
pockets<00:00:49.780> up<00:00:49.930> front<00:00:50.230> above<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.890> bottles<00:00:52.170> new

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
pockets up front above the bottles new

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.500 
pockets up front above the bottles new
on<00:00:53.290> the<00:00:53.379> materials<00:00:53.860> side<00:00:54.100> for<00:00:54.460> version<00:00:54.699> 2.0<00:00:55.330> is

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
on the materials side for version 2.0 is

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.930 
on the materials side for version 2.0 is
the<00:00:55.629> SIL<00:00:56.199> nylon<00:00:56.680> we've<00:00:57.370> switched<00:00:57.640> out<00:00:57.909> the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
the SIL nylon we've switched out the

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.119 
the SIL nylon we've switched out the
Cuban<00:00:58.390> fiber<00:00:58.690> just<00:00:59.170> so<00:00:59.320> we<00:00:59.440> get<00:00:59.680> a<00:00:59.710> little<00:00:59.949> bit

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
Cuban fiber just so we get a little bit

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.960 
Cuban fiber just so we get a little bit
better<00:01:00.370> and<00:01:00.729> stronger<00:01:01.440> seam<00:01:02.440> strength<00:01:02.970> we've

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
better and stronger seam strength we've

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.930 
better and stronger seam strength we've
added<00:01:04.210> now<00:01:04.600> a340<00:01:05.530> ground<00:01:05.950> materials<00:01:06.700> so<00:01:06.909> that

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
added now a340 ground materials so that

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.030 
added now a340 ground materials so that
the<00:01:07.120> power<00:01:07.330> mesh<00:01:07.570> is<00:01:07.720> even<00:01:07.960> stronger<00:01:08.290> I<00:01:08.710> love

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
the power mesh is even stronger I love

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.770 
the power mesh is even stronger I love
to<00:01:09.159> pack<00:01:09.430> a<00:01:09.460> lot<00:01:09.760> of<00:01:09.820> stuff<00:01:10.210> in<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.630> back

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
to pack a lot of stuff in the back

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.170 
to pack a lot of stuff in the back
compartment<00:01:11.110> and<00:01:11.650> it<00:01:12.070> gives<00:01:12.280> it<00:01:12.520> that<00:01:12.549> expand

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
compartment and it gives it that expand

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.910 
compartment and it gives it that expand
ability<00:01:13.600> as<00:01:13.750> well<00:01:13.780> as<00:01:14.080> keeping<00:01:14.440> it<00:01:14.530> close<00:01:14.770> to

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
ability as well as keeping it close to

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.360 
ability as well as keeping it close to
the<00:01:15.010> body

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
the body

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.390 
the body
so<00:01:15.640> using<00:01:16.240> this<00:01:16.570> new<00:01:17.080> heavier<00:01:17.470> stretch<00:01:18.100> mesh

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
so using this new heavier stretch mesh

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.219 
so using this new heavier stretch mesh
doesn't<00:01:19.060> really<00:01:19.270> add<00:01:19.450> too<00:01:19.630> much<00:01:19.720> weight<00:01:20.020> but

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
doesn't really add too much weight but

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.719 
doesn't really add too much weight but
adds<00:01:20.440> to<00:01:20.650> the<00:01:20.740> durability<00:01:20.920> so<00:01:21.430> that<00:01:21.520> you<00:01:21.610> can

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
adds to the durability so that you can

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.910 
adds to the durability so that you can
use<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.090> pack<00:01:22.270> for<00:01:22.570> years<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:22.960> come<00:01:23.170> we've

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
use the pack for years to come we've

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.610 
use the pack for years to come we've
also<00:01:24.100> added<00:01:24.400> a<00:01:24.880> new<00:01:25.360> edge<00:01:25.720> banding<00:01:26.170> material

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
also added a new edge banding material

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.260 
also added a new edge banding material
that's<00:01:26.800> even<00:01:27.010> softer<00:01:27.550> we're<00:01:27.940> getting<00:01:28.120> a<00:01:28.150> lot

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
that's even softer we're getting a lot

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.820 
that's even softer we're getting a lot
of<00:01:28.420> feedback<00:01:28.600> from<00:01:28.780> individuals<00:01:29.530> who<00:01:29.800> use

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
of feedback from individuals who use

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.520 
of feedback from individuals who use
bladders<00:01:30.790> and<00:01:31.090> you<00:01:31.570> know<00:01:31.630> coming<00:01:31.870> into<00:01:32.110> an<00:01:32.350> aid

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
bladders and you know coming into an aid

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.890 
bladders and you know coming into an aid
station<00:01:32.560> I'm<00:01:33.520> just<00:01:33.850> having<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.210> two<00:01:34.420> access

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
station I'm just having the two access

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.220 
station I'm just having the two access
pockets<00:01:35.440> wasn't<00:01:36.220> issue<00:01:36.400> so<00:01:36.910> we<00:01:37.540> added<00:01:37.690> a<00:01:37.870> third

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
pockets wasn't issue so we added a third

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.130 
pockets wasn't issue so we added a third
reservoir<00:01:39.160> bladder<00:01:39.640> pocket<00:01:40.240> just<00:01:40.750> makes<00:01:40.960> that

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
reservoir bladder pocket just makes that

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.940 
reservoir bladder pocket just makes that
access<00:01:41.680> a<00:01:41.950> lot<00:01:42.400> a<00:01:42.730> lot<00:01:42.880> better<00:01:43.120> a<00:01:43.210> lot<00:01:43.390> smoother

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
access a lot a lot better a lot smoother

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.140 
access a lot a lot better a lot smoother
