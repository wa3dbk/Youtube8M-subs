them together find it we've now got
these<00:02:41.340> tubes<00:02:41.670> we're<00:02:41.940> going<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.150> do<00:02:42.240> is<00:02:42.390> wrap

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
these tubes we're going to do is wrap

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.630 
these tubes we're going to do is wrap
them<00:02:42.900> around<00:02:43.020> there<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.070> then<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.250> little<00:02:44.520> bit

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
them around there and then a little bit

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.670 
them around there and then a little bit
of<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.760> egg<00:02:45.000> just<00:02:45.900> dab<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.320> there<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.590> that

of a egg just dab it on there and that
acts<00:02:46.830> as<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> glue<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.760> seal<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.690> in<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:50.190> these

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
acts as the glue to seal it in and these

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.350 
acts as the glue to seal it in and these
are<00:02:50.430> beautiful

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
are beautiful

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.930 
are beautiful
you<00:02:51.510> rolled<00:02:51.750> those<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.989> treat<00:02:52.350> Thanks<00:02:53.340> what<00:02:53.850> we

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
you rolled those a treat Thanks what we

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.250 
you rolled those a treat Thanks what we
can<00:02:54.060> do<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.360> lower<00:02:54.540> them<00:02:54.750> into<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.930> oil<00:02:55.020> the

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
can do is lower them into the oil the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.070 
can do is lower them into the oil the
oil<00:02:55.290> should<00:02:55.620> be<00:02:55.770> about<00:02:55.950> 170<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.940> 180<00:02:57.660> degrees

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
oil should be about 170 to 180 degrees

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.199 
oil should be about 170 to 180 degrees
Celsius<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:58.860> will<00:02:59.550> be<00:02:59.640> enough<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.060> cook

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
Celsius and that will be enough to cook

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.699 
Celsius and that will be enough to cook
them<00:03:00.360> in<00:03:00.480> maybe<00:03:00.690> two<00:03:01.020> or<00:03:01.170> three<00:03:01.200> mijin<00:03:01.590> and

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
them in maybe two or three mijin and

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.250 
them in maybe two or three mijin and
don't<00:03:02.100> overfill<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.940> pan<00:03:03.180> three<00:03:03.630> is<00:03:03.780> plenty

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
don't overfill the pan three is plenty

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.240 
don't overfill the pan three is plenty
three<00:03:04.530> because<00:03:04.770> we've<00:03:04.860> only<00:03:04.950> got<00:03:05.070> three

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
three because we've only got three

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.020 
three because we've only got three
choose<00:03:05.550> we<00:03:05.940> can<00:03:05.970> only<00:03:06.330> do<00:03:06.690> three<00:03:07.050> at<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.200> time<00:03:08.030> as

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
choose we can only do three at a time as

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.880 
choose we can only do three at a time as
you<00:03:09.360> lift<00:03:09.540> them<00:03:09.660> out<00:03:09.810> be<00:03:10.170> very<00:03:10.440> very<00:03:10.650> careful

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
you lift them out be very very careful

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.090 
you lift them out be very very careful
make<00:03:11.220> sure<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.459> tubes<00:03:11.730> aren't<00:03:12.090> full<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.540> oil

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
make sure the tubes aren't full of oil

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.429 
make sure the tubes aren't full of oil
and<00:03:14.100> then<00:03:14.340> just<00:03:14.610> rest<00:03:14.970> them

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:17.439 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.050
