00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
project now this is really simple it's

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.720 
project now this is really simple it's
probably<00:00:22.619> one<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> easier<00:00:23.220> things<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.609> do

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
probably one of the easier things to do

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.890 
probably one of the easier things to do
because<00:00:23.910> all<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.359> do<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:24.750> let

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
because all you have to do is just let

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.200 
because all you have to do is just let
it<00:00:25.019> go<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.170> seed<00:00:25.500> let<00:00:25.859> nature<00:00:26.070> run<00:00:26.490> its<00:00:26.760> course

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
it go to seed let nature run its course

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.080 
it go to seed let nature run its course
don't<00:00:28.050> harvest<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.010> it'll<00:00:29.519> naturally<00:00:29.730> do

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
don't harvest it and it'll naturally do

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.120 
don't harvest it and it'll naturally do
its<00:00:30.240> own<00:00:30.330> thing<00:00:30.390> now<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.710> things<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.070> don't

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130

early the seeds will not be mature and

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.530 
early the seeds will not be mature and
they<00:04:06.930> won't<00:04:07.200> come<00:04:07.410> out<00:04:08.209> you<00:04:09.209> need<00:04:09.300> to<00:04:09.420> wait

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
they won't come out you need to wait

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.860 
they won't come out you need to wait
till<00:04:09.690> they're<00:04:09.810> brown<00:04:10.170> as<00:04:10.500> you<00:04:10.890> can<00:04:11.010> see<00:04:11.370> very

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
till they're brown as you can see very

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.630 
till they're brown as you can see very
brown<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.260> very<00:04:13.560> brittle<00:04:14.010> they're<00:04:14.520> almost

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
brown and very brittle they're almost

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.699 
brown and very brittle they're almost
like<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:15.030> little<00:04:15.120> paper<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.780> then<00:04:16.410> all<00:04:16.560> you're

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
like a little paper and then all you're

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.110 
like a little paper and then all you're
going<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.890> do<00:04:17.010> is<00:04:17.220> just<00:04:17.520> simply<00:04:17.730> take<00:04:18.209> it

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
going to do is just simply take it

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.439 
going to do is just simply take it
and<00:04:19.209> shake<00:04:19.959> it<00:04:21.180> just<00:04:22.180> shake<00:04:22.419> it<00:04:22.830> shake<00:04:23.830> it<00:04:23.889> up

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
and shake it just shake it shake it up

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:32.430 
and shake it just shake it shake it up
and<00:04:27.990> naturally<00:04:29.370> by<00:04:30.370> breaking<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.440> by

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
and naturally by breaking the by

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.879 
and naturally by breaking the by
breaking<00:04:32.919> the<00:04:33.070> seed<00:04:33.400> pod<00:04:33.970> open<00:04:34.680> you're<00:04:35.680> going

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
breaking the seed pod open you're going

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.580 
breaking the seed pod open you're going
to<00:04:36.040> allow<00:04:36.419> the<00:04:37.419> seed<00:04:37.720> to<00:04:37.840> fall<00:04:38.110> out<00:04:38.350> and<00:04:38.880> then

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
to allow the seed to fall out and then

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.129 
to allow the seed to fall out and then
once<00:04:41.590> you<00:04:41.740> shake<00:04:42.010> it<00:04:42.040> the<00:04:42.600> seeds<00:04:43.600> weigh<00:04:43.900> more

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
once you shake it the seeds weigh more

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:51.689 
once you shake it the seeds weigh more
than<00:04:44.199> the<00:04:44.410> little<00:04:45.100> silk<00:04:47.669> and<00:04:50.220> then<00:04:51.220> as<00:04:51.430> you<00:04:51.580> can

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
than the little silk and then as you can

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.460 
than the little silk and then as you can
see<00:04:52.979> those<00:04:53.979> are<00:04:54.190> all<00:04:54.400> your<00:04:54.729> seeds<00:04:55.199> so<00:04:56.199> I<00:04:56.229> want

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
see those are all your seeds so I want

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.020 
see those are all your seeds so I want
to<00:04:56.530> separate<00:04:56.919> those<00:04:57.160> out<00:04:57.400> and<00:04:57.669> I'll<00:04:57.789> show<00:04:58.000> you

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
to separate those out and I'll show you

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.600 
to separate those out and I'll show you
what<00:04:58.210> the<00:04:58.330> seeds<00:04:58.570> look<00:04:58.720> like<00:04:59.220> all<00:05:00.220> right<00:05:00.370> so<00:05:00.550> as

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
what the seeds look like all right so as

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.850 
what the seeds look like all right so as
you<00:05:00.669> can<00:05:00.789> see<00:05:00.940> I<00:05:00.970> got<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.389> silk<00:05:01.930> stuff<00:05:02.530> out<00:05:02.830> of

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
you can see I got the silk stuff out of

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.900 
you can see I got the silk stuff out of
the<00:05:03.160> seed<00:05:03.430> coating<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:05.050> left<00:05:05.590> with<00:05:05.830> just<00:05:06.280> some

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
the seed coating and left with just some

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.529 
the seed coating and left with just some
very<00:05:07.449> fine<00:05:08.169> little<00:05:08.530> particles<00:05:09.280> of<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.669> seed

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
very fine little particles of the seed

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.240 
very fine little particles of the seed
coating<00:05:10.960> it<00:05:11.410> can<00:05:11.590> be<00:05:11.710> further<00:05:11.979> refined

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
coating it can be further refined

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.120 
coating it can be further refined
obviously<00:05:13.120> if<00:05:13.240> you<00:05:13.389> want<00:05:13.600> to<00:05:13.690> you<00:05:14.470> know<00:05:14.590> just
