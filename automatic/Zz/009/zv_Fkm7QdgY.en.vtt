00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 good to all boys coar gasmi who are 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.299
 finally back with a scud builder 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.400
 as promised there will be the scud builder 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.340
 of the championship that is or better in the 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.500
 African continent a team 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.330
 really strong I really tell you with 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.740
 heart really strong 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.779
 I am perhaps the team with which I am 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.570
 best found in this mode for 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.930
 how much I used it but I have to say 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.550
 that I have never lost always won indeed 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.820
 this gave me so much satisfaction 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.329
 team always marks is a team that 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.280
 takes not too many goals is very solid and 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.170
 however, it is hilarious from 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.750
 use however I would say to go 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.640
 immediately to see the goalkeeper entered m 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.910
 confederation africa to the goalkeeper perhaps 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.649
 one of the only negative things 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.579
 of the team because it is in the AA but 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.620
 it is undoubtedly a goalkeeper who has excellent players 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.629
 reflexes when you are excellent a great one 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.030
 referral by the way made me an assist 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.309
 however for the rest it is really scarce in 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.469
 square chin dip is taken the tonnages 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.090
 they seem much less than those 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.979
 really written on paper 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.799
 player unfortunately when a comes 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.820
 Angled shot does not even move for 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.100
 pick her up 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.420
 so for this it is unfortunately not there 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.570
 they are not even other goalkeepers from 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.210
 use are all below 74 if not 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.000
 I don't remember now though 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.220
 however he is not the best though 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.570
 however we must be satisfied however 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.869
 with the defense in front of it 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.060
 I assure you that you feel little here 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.070
 this is this thing 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.380
 let's go with the central defender of 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.850
 right I used to the right yes 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.439
 it's matip matip great player 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.409
 a goal already made on a football head 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.600
 in the corner the defense is very good 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.960
 especially of the head therefore it takes few 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.220
 goal and therefore excellent good speed 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.899
 values ​​of defense header if 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.479
 put a few months restyle becomes 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.869
 even stronger central defender in 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.090
 half is very great jesus player mi 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.009
 really like it a lot because it is one 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.600
 good speed but not very high 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.360
 however to go in the middle it also goes 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.770
 well it is a very good and excellent defense 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.960
 above all a great header 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.110
 this player 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.380
 baccini and hardly move it o 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.530
 however it is to jump over defender 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.350
 on the left instead is kolo tourè kolo 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.500
 touré is another very good defender 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.990
 very similar to what is called jesus though 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.180
 has greater speed and 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.890
 come if a little poorer though anyway 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.770
 both are very similar players this 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.090
 I swear defense is solid takes 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.760
 very few goals also helped by 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.550
 midfield later we will see better indeed 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.150
 we will see immediately with the midfielder of 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.990
 right which is esseen therefore sm is a 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.450
 great recovers balls and good work 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.580
 very defensive as a player also a 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.560
 good shot and a good pass though to a 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.540
 really poor ball control e 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.430
 what I noticed when that 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.730
 given the ball it takes really long 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.800
 to revise it or otherwise to control it 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.900
 the same argument is worth a little less perhaps 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.250
 for the one on the left, that is, me 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.810
 which I have already dealt with in another of yours 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.610
 builder that is definitely faster than 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.740
 esseen but a clear passage 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.140
 lower among other things chronically made two 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.490
 assist oh well is a good player and a 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.680
 excellent retrieves balls with a 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.780
 great physical strength of the head perhaps 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.400
 it could be better anyway too 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.830
 he or high defense word these 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.780
 players form a front wall there is 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.750
 in front of the doorman these are a wall 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.490
 and in fact all the other players are 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.590
 offensive players let's go straight with 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.570
 indexes with the outside of the right it comes 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.030
 of muse that I finally found in a 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.700
 pack musa that is very fast in 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.290
 counter-attacks is truly lethal even a 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.200
 good shot if for that work at that 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.270
 allows you to really attack a lot 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.250
 unfortunately as the outside we will see of 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.780
 left has a single counter that is the 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.610
 physical strength for the rest is a big one 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.660
 player 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.210
 in fact we go to see the outside of 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.320
 left it is gervinho which is a 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.290
 great player too 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.940
 unfortunately it has a really poor shot 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.250
 and the passage is not great either 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.370
 so he basically goes on 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.860
 just band but on the band because a 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.620
 cross them wrong to pull does a little 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.540
 disgust but otherwise is not great 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.530
 because you can really discard i 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.060
 players with his great 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.989
 dribbling and its four stars 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.539
 ability and then try to do 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.380
 an assist or a throw, however, these are 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.430
 two players 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.930
 muse and gervinho on the break anyway 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.840
 both when they have to run I really am 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.759
 of the trains stop them we go with the coc 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.370
 that I found myself really very well 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.229
 boateng prince big boateng 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.729
 offensive midfielder because he is 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.590
 always makes ready 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.780
 is always ready to enter to do 12 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.340
 enter the area to score goals or assist 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.199
 in fact four games 2 goals and two 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.060
 assist and really thumb up for 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.729
 I really liked boateng 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.819
 unfortunately so many are three-star abilities 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.650
 I remember that he was in fifa 12 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.729
 four if I'm not mistaken touched here 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.550
 it has 3 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.199
 I don't know not last year's tests 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.759
 let's go with the right-wing striker 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:12.860
 treats and enemies the beast emenike 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:15.389
 excellent striker often marks warcraft 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.550
 lethal for someone like him physical strength 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.380
 unfortunately the head of the Madonna is not 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.449
 a lot of it doesn't have a big jump and it's not 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.069
 really strong of head though anyway 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.690
 both an excellent and excellent finalization 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:27.150
 shot from a good speed but 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.650
 above all a beastly and physical strength 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.599
 the other attacker another 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.909
 it really surprised me a lot and you 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.860
 eto'o surprised me a lot for 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:37.199
 what reason in the meantime there is a net down 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.389
 grade of speed however he is 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:42.180
 really strong because the balloons there 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.430
 It keeps all warcraft worse 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.039
 to the version of other teams but not yes 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.380
 hear of the truth 4s the skill marks 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.389
 always excellent finalization and also of 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.440
 head is not bad and therefore really 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.259
 strong 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.650
 if you wish you could change it or you 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:06:00.300
 I do not know the same by placing drugs or 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.380
 or another to another player 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:07.770
 strong to try without doubt is ideas 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.789
 ideas and much like emenike pro anymore 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.159
 strong of head 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.599
 so try it because he is 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:14.580
 really then if you have it you don't have 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.770
 mini that for example nevertheless loosens it 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.659
 scooter was this I recommend if you have 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.889
 the players to try it with this 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:22.620
 module because I really found myself 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:26.009
 to the really strong big team e 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.780
 solid and lethal in front therefore raga like 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:30.270
 as usual I invite you to leave a nice me 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.919
 like 300 i like a new video will come out 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.909
 write me in the comments what you think 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.220
 of this team 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:36.780
 maybe or what your expenses were 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.520
 nothing concerns an African team that 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.380
 I'm interested also in the last 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.600
 comments which video I would like you to see 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.520
