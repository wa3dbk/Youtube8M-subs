in<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.830> package<00:00:17.130> like<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:18.270> we're

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
in a package like this and so we're

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.830 
in a package like this and so we're
going<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.600> kind<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.410> show<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.650> how<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.310> works

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
installs same place take your screw feed

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.200 
installs same place take your screw feed
it<00:01:33.299> from<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.540> outside<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.229> end<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:36.060> that

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
it from the outside to the end so that

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.859 
it from the outside to the end so that
the<00:01:36.420> nut<00:01:37.340> ends<00:01:38.340> up<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> inside<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.540> the

the nut ends up on the inside of the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.120 
the nut ends up on the inside of the
frame<00:01:40.880> do<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.119> with<00:01:42.540> both<00:01:42.750> sides<00:01:43.130> serrated

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
frame do that with both sides serrated

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.800 
frame do that with both sides serrated
flange<00:01:44.520> nuts<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.210> shouldn't<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.689> put

flange nuts so you shouldn't have to put

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.200 
flange nuts so you shouldn't have to put
a<00:01:45.840> wrench<00:01:45.990> on<00:01:46.200> those<00:01:46.350> nuts<00:01:46.759> ok<00:01:47.759> once<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.119> do

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
a wrench on those nuts ok once you do

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.200 
a wrench on those nuts ok once you do
that<00:01:48.240> then<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:49.229> want<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> take<00:01:50.030> one<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.520 
the pre-installed screw from it you may
might<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.600> be<00:01:57.719> finger<00:01:57.960> tight<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.380> just

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
might just be finger tight you can just

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.709 
might just be finger tight you can just
probably<00:01:58.710> loosen<00:01:59.189> those<00:01:59.280> out<00:01:59.540> we're<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.659> to

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
probably loosen those out we're going to

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.200 
probably loosen those out we're going to
do<00:02:00.899> then<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.799> wheel<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.820> tapered

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
do then is on the wheel it's a tapered

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.940 
do then is on the wheel it's a tapered
wheel<00:02:03.600> one<00:02:03.930> side<00:02:04.140> sticks<00:02:04.439> out<00:02:04.590> further<00:02:04.799> than

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
wheel one side sticks out further than

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.429 
wheel one side sticks out further than
the<00:02:05.159> other<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.430> got<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> concave<00:02:06.060> side<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.439> one

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
the other you got a concave side and one

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.919 
the other you got a concave side and one
that<00:02:07.649> sticks<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.879> want<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.119> insert<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
that sticks out you want to insert the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.240 
that sticks out you want to insert the
axle<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.679> concave<00:02:11.160> side

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
axle on the concave side

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.950 
axle on the concave side
the<00:02:12.430> part<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.850> sticks<00:02:13.060> out<00:02:13.300> will<00:02:13.660> then<00:02:13.810> go

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
the part that sticks out will then go

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.670 
the part that sticks out will then go
against<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:15.070> frame<00:02:15.900> feed<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:16.930> into<00:02:17.320> the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
against the frame feed that into the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.290 
against the frame feed that into the
large<00:02:18.250> hole<00:02:19.170> take<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.350> screw<00:02:21.180> actually<00:02:22.180> it's

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
large hole take the screw actually it's

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.190 
large hole take the screw actually it's
easiest<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:23.130> if<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.460> put<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:25.020> screw<00:02:26.020> on<00:02:26.050> the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
easiest to if you put the screw on the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.760 
easiest to if you put the screw on the
end<00:02:26.380> of<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.530> hex<00:02:26.770> key<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:28.270> get<00:02:28.420> that<00:02:28.510> lined<00:02:28.780> up

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.210 

there<00:02:32.770> we<00:02:32.890> go<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:34.560> just<00:02:35.560> found<00:02:35.709> that's<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.040> little

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
there we go I just found that's a little

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.680 
there we go I just found that's a little
bit<00:02:36.310> easier<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:37.720> get<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:37.959> screw<00:02:38.260> started<00:02:39.420> and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.030 

basically<00:02:43.690> do<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:43.930> same<00:02:44.050> for<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.650> other<00:02:44.770> tire

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
basically do the same for the other tire

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.100 
basically do the same for the other tire
tighten<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.820> all<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.209> way<00:02:46.270> down<00:02:46.480> tighten

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
tighten that all the way down tighten

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.430 
tighten that all the way down tighten
both<00:02:47.230> of<00:02:47.410> them<00:02:47.500> firmly<00:02:48.150> okay<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.690> that's

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
both of them firmly okay and that's

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.170 
both of them firmly okay and that's
pretty<00:02:50.650> much<00:02:50.770> it<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:51.250> just<00:02:51.430> installed<00:02:51.910> the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
pretty much it you just installed the

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.820 
pretty much it you just installed the
quad<00:02:52.720> wheel<00:02:52.959> kit<00:02:53.260> onto<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.900> model<00:02:55.900> 1043<00:02:56.410> cart

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
quad wheel kit onto the model 1043 cart

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.750 
quad wheel kit onto the model 1043 cart
and<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:58.030> took<00:02:58.150> about<00:02:58.270> four<00:02:58.570> minutes
