how well the application is able to pick
up<00:02:58.420> different<00:02:58.780> file<00:02:59.560> format<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.780> that's

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
up different file format and that's

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.860 
up different file format and that's
another<00:03:02.590> cute<00:03:02.980> little<00:03:03.190> bird<00:03:03.600> okay<00:03:04.600> hopefully

quickly things are picked up and
performances<00:03:11.860> on<00:03:12.220> this<00:03:12.790> application<00:03:13.380> now

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
performances on this application now

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.740 
performances on this application now
let's<00:03:14.620> quickly<00:03:14.890> move<00:03:15.430> back<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.030> see<00:03:16.420> we<00:03:16.600> can

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
let's quickly move back and see we can

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.340 
let's quickly move back and see we can
do<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.079> same<00:03:17.290> thing<00:03:17.560> with<00:03:17.739> some<00:03:17.950> mp3<00:03:18.790> files

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:38.140 

ok<00:03:36.469> now<00:03:36.620> let's<00:03:36.650> perform<00:03:37.249> the<00:03:37.340> same<00:03:37.519> test<00:03:37.819> we're

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
ok now let's perform the same test we're

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:49.720 
ok now let's perform the same test we're
going<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.359> stop<00:03:39.040> move<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.249> file<00:03:40.489> forward<00:03:48.730> and

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
going to stop move the file forward and

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.020 
going to stop move the file forward and
stop<00:03:50.329> again<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:52.069> move<00:03:52.400> it<00:03:52.549> back<00:03:52.670> once<00:03:52.909> more

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
stop again and move it back once more

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:00.459 
stop again and move it back once more
time<00:03:53.420> and<00:03:54.370> let<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.459> play<00:03:58.840> now<00:03:59.840> I<00:03:59.870> know<00:04:00.019> it<00:04:00.319> looks

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:00.469 
time and let it play now I know it looks

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:01.479 
time and let it play now I know it looks
like<00:04:00.620> we're<00:04:00.829> just<00:04:01.010> playing<00:04:01.250> with<00:04:01.340> the

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
like we're just playing with the

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.369 
like we're just playing with the
application<00:04:02.150> moving<00:04:02.569> it<00:04:02.659> forward<00:04:02.840> and<00:04:03.169> back

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
application moving it forward and back

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.649 
application moving it forward and back
but<00:04:03.950> I<00:04:03.980> really<00:04:04.249> think<00:04:04.280> this<00:04:04.549> is<00:04:04.609> a<00:04:04.760> great<00:04:04.879> way

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
but I really think this is a great way

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.629 
but I really think this is a great way
of<00:04:05.689> showing<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:06.290> how<00:04:06.530> quickly<00:04:07.069> and<00:04:07.430> how<00:04:07.459> it

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
of showing you how quickly and how it

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:13.270 
of showing you how quickly and how it
will<00:04:07.760> great<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.269> application<00:04:08.870> performs<00:04:12.280> now

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
will great the application performs now

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.039 
will great the application performs now
if<00:04:13.430> you're<00:04:13.549> looking<00:04:13.819> to<00:04:13.909> stream<00:04:14.150> a<00:04:14.180> lot<00:04:14.419> of<00:04:14.540> mp3
