tagine is often a long slow cook it's a

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.959 
tagine is often a long slow cook it's a
really<00:00:34.620> speedy<00:00:34.950> version<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.790> same

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
really speedy version of that the same

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:36.889 
really speedy version of that the same
place<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.300> how<00:00:36.420> long<00:00:36.510> do<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.600> reckon<00:00:36.840> this
