00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:12.699 
I forgot that before we put the

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.809 
I forgot that before we put the
substrate<00:04:12.940> in<00:04:13.299> we<00:04:13.780> just<00:04:13.930> put<00:04:14.109> the<00:04:14.819> background

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
substrate in we just put the background

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.750 
substrate in we just put the background
in<00:04:16.060> and<00:04:16.829> before<00:04:17.829> we<00:04:17.919> put<00:04:18.010> the<00:04:18.160> background<00:04:18.370> in

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:21.969 
we have to put the pump in because the

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:25.710 
we have to put the pump in because the
cord<00:04:22.270> goes<00:04:22.510> behind<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:23.250> background<00:04:24.250> sup

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
cord goes behind the background sup
