00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.570
 hello again and dear friends 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.390
 lovers of the world of tanks with you crayons and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.720
 today I wanted to show you literate 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.040
 behavior on the super light tank of the seventh 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.630
 the level of the American development branch m41 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.270
 bulldog well let's go now 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.730
 directly to the fight and I would like to 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.550
 notice what the hero of our video 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.420
 is the hero of the past video ragnar 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.059
 dodbrok 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.340
 and read the first time remarkably in 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.710
 last time I did not succeed well 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.710
 and as it should be, we know that tvinki 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.929
 always hiding behind allies and 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.690
 shoots damage chick from the bushes and but 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:57.719
 This player but did not like it 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.210
 let's move on with our aggressive game 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.399
 directly to the battle itself and trace 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.030
 for his behavior as you see a 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.010
 the leopard and our hero went ahead on 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.320
 of course they have life 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.800
 fireflies light tanks they should 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.009
 shine and please note that the choice 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.579
 This player has already become a typewriter 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.170
 drum loading for 10 shells and 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.540
 potential damage from this drum 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.189
 one and a half thousand is obtained as well 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.649
 I would like to note that he will not 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.140
 a gold well, I do not really 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:36.229
 profitable and if you count that each 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.640
 projectile costs 5600 silver then 10 shells 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.070
 56,000 of this is not at all 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.950
 profitable and how we see appears here 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.930
 Our collect from, too, M41 bulldog and 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.180
 and we capture the king rolling out on 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.880
 him despite the fact that he has left 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.369
 help as a t-34 85 and there still 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.479
 Peteshechka will appear and we still risk 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.490
 and pick it up and 48 we have just 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.049
 still not on us and us but here science 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.420
 lucky but still we continue 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.280
 hide behind the corpse as you see with us 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.429
 already 910 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.569
 on and on the drums we shot a 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.180
 the remarkableness of this tank besides 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.880
 gun selection is still his 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.340
 the maximum speed is 72 kilometers in 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.310
 an hour we can spin our 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.140
 rivals lonely goals are simply doomed 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.420
 when come across to our field of vision 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.170
 because we can call on them to collect 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.600
 to get back 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.120
 yes no one can twist us 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.670
 rather get out of us when we 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.069
 anyone twists here we see su 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.130
 150 second just in from the lowest tank 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.260
 who flies on a ram for a leopard he 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.650
 already in principle doomed take again 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.330
 capture the target and shoot 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.060
 now let's shoot a shot 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.880
 some sort of thingy and now 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.550
 We begin to inflict damage su 150 which 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.340
 how do you see the goals average alpha 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.459
 150 but so far we have a minimum 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.690
 now he's back to us on his and 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.670
 front part and we had to 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.050
 disconnect from avtopritsel in order 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.720
 not to fall 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.970
 a gun to Moscow weapons here too 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.180
 also some remarkable leave 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.000
 however dkd this tank have 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.440
 It turns out 30 seconds rough half a minute 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.820
 someone more less someone all 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.579
 depends on what perks are 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.750
 crews and what we already have 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.870
 additional modules 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.570
 guided average of half a minute and 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.940
 further here are just the smartest goals this 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.640
 four already almost dismantled it to us as 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.010
 times for 2 drum projectiles t 25 us as 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.120
 times how many turns on 4 drums 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.829
 and projectile and already the most dangerous target goes 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.489
 I talk a little bit from us 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.380
 forgiveness and how we see the mood and their 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.829
 twins by the way already 62 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.980
 I did not want to show here so to speak 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:56.700
 some kind of game that was dangerous there 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.030
 we were the only ones who were dragged here 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.520
 some share of the visa 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.050
 not but also the share of professionalism 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.060
 here, of course, was also present 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.810
 This player has taken advantage of weakness. 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.450
 team and was able to get the smartest 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.480
 results in terms of damage and in terms of 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.419
 frags and here is very well shown 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.480
 game when a goal gets lonely 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.500
 how can they take almost 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.230
 with impunity 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.400
 but now we are headed we can say 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.300
 that this is the direction we have 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.889
 get us all the same rush 4 and here we are 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.200
 a little slow down because our 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.780
 the drum is still not recharged and jumping out 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.590
 so here is a well rival without charged 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:42.190
 guns it certainly will be suicide 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.960
 Here we see two arts do not know why 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.000
 seized a target if she cares for 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:51.550
 here we get well 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.100
 hygiene wichka and and drying the dryer we take 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.229
 we already have 5 frags five 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.530
 frags for the firefly is the smartest 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:02.830
 the result will ricochet bagi ve 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.890
 In principle, the damage is now excellent. 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.800
 and we took him as you see from us already 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.350
 two and a half thousand damage 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.919
 a rival team and two and a half 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:17.289
 thousands for a firefly like me once more 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.360
 I repeat this is a gorgeous result after 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.050
 how we shot our drum but 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.690
 it makes sense to go somewhere else and 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:29.470
 hide out of the light of otpishit 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:33.610
 our hero don't want don't know what he wanted 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:37.090
 these say apparently it is some kind of easy 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.070
 trolling on twink tongue back 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.140
 back to the battle were lit missing here 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.640
 here's tank payments as we remember it 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:47.350
 The little Lena and grains of sand glowed here 3 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.930
 Now we aim our magic sight 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.700
 on you card and it disappears from 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.100
 Zhenya chenini for fly just play 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.950
 here pay attention from 3 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:06:00.140
 now goes to shoot down the capture and 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.020
 already perry charged drum but we 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.420
 continue to target 3 four and after 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.700
 Moreover, as the pike perch 3 shot out 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.640
 discharged turned in the opposite 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.610
 we call him to the side tets bar and 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.650
 shoots all targets no she here 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.110
 let's say so competently and behavior by 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.540
 picking up 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.850
 single goals in principle very very 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.400
 even hope for and tactics and further 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.040
 back to what we got in 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.470
 glare left naturally we need it 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.510
 also pick up as you see we already have two 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.100
 thousand seven hundred ninety one points 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.770
 strength selected in their team 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:40.040
 rivals a and another interesting fashion 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:45.560
 which shows our vn8 we see that 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.610
 we already have a factor of 10,000 is 11,700 but 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.030
 still hit 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:52.340
 but okay, we ’ll dwell on the 11700 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.830
 for damage without considering the coefficient 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.840
 multiplication for frags and we have seven of them 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.090
 well who liked this video 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.880
 put likes 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:05.470
 dislikes and good luck on the battlefield with 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.470
 you were shallow bye
