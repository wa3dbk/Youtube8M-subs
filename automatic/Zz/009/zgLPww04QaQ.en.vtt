yeah talk about new and pretty specific
who's<00:00:13.049> heard<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.349> microsoft<00:00:13.980> surface<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:15.150> it

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
who's heard of microsoft surface and it

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.820 
who's heard of microsoft surface and it
all<00:00:15.450> who's<00:00:15.690> heard<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:15.929> multi-touch<00:00:16.590> in

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
all who's heard of multi-touch in

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.500 
all who's heard of multi-touch in
general<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.670> you've<00:00:17.789> all<00:00:17.910> pretty<00:00:18.150> much<00:00:18.210> heard

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
general so you've all pretty much heard

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.769 
general so you've all pretty much heard
of<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.529> won't<00:00:19.800> worry<00:00:20.039> about<00:00:20.779> necessary

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
of that I won't worry about necessary

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.630 
of that I won't worry about necessary
running<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.260> video<00:00:22.560> then<00:00:22.769> for<00:00:23.039> time<00:00:23.279> because

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
running that video then for time because

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.830 
running that video then for time because
I<00:00:23.670> want<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.880> show<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.029> something<00:00:24.180> else<00:00:24.390> so

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
I want to show you something else so

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.519 
I want to show you something else so
who's<00:00:25.470> actually<00:00:25.619> played<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> surface<00:00:26.460> oh

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
who's actually played with a surface oh

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.870 
who's actually played with a surface oh
just<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:29.869> 120<00:00:30.869> coupled<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:32.099> most<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.759> us

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
just the 120 coupled so most of us

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.250 
just the 120 coupled so most of us
haven't<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.660> that's<00:00:33.930> not<00:00:34.110> surprising

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
haven't and that's not surprising

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.830 
haven't and that's not surprising
because<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:34.950> ten<00:00:35.250> thousand<00:00:35.790> dollar<00:00:36.210> piece

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
because it's ten thousand dollar piece

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.090 
because it's ten thousand dollar piece
of<00:00:36.960> equipment<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:37.469> pretty<00:00:37.649> big<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
of equipment it's pretty big and

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.940 
of equipment it's pretty big and
specialist<00:00:39.410> but<00:00:40.410> wouldn't<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.649> be<00:00:40.710> good<00:00:40.890> if

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
specialist but wouldn't it be good if

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.530 
specialist but wouldn't it be good if
you<00:00:41.040> could<00:00:41.129> play<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.790> multi-touch<00:00:42.120> device

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
you could play with multi-touch device

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.139 
you could play with multi-touch device
to<00:00:42.750> see<00:00:42.899> what's<00:00:43.050> coming<00:00:43.230> yeah<00:00:44.149> pretty

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
to see what's coming yeah pretty

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.490 
to see what's coming yeah pretty
interesting<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.719> could<00:00:45.870> play<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
interesting you could play with the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.200 
interesting you could play with the
environment<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.340> could<00:00:47.460> write<00:00:47.760> some<00:00:47.969> code

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
environment you could write some code

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.510 
environment you could write some code
maybe<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.750> explore<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.289> well<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.010> thought<00:00:50.460> it

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
maybe to explore it well I thought it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.560 
maybe to explore it well I thought it
would<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.700> pretty<00:00:50.850> good<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.239> looked<00:00:51.449> into

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
would be pretty good so I looked into

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.380 
would be pretty good so I looked into
building<00:00:52.050> my<00:00:52.199> own<00:00:52.230> one<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.800> i<00:00:53.730> found<00:00:54.030> out<00:00:54.180> that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
building my own one and i found out that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.090 
building my own one and i found out that
most<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.960> its<00:00:55.079> around<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.469> technology

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
most of its around this technology

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.420 
most of its around this technology
that's<00:00:56.309> aggravated<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> be<00:00:57.239> ftir<00:00:58.050> or

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
that's aggravated to be ftir or

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.010 
that's aggravated to be ftir or
frustrated<00:00:59.430> total<00:00:59.850> internal<00:01:00.210> reflection<00:01:00.390> now

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
frustrated total internal reflection now

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.410 
frustrated total internal reflection now
well<00:01:01.440> that's<00:01:01.590> basically<00:01:02.070> talking<00:01:03.059> about<00:01:03.300> how

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
well that's basically talking about how

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.450 
well that's basically talking about how
problem<00:01:03.690> bits<00:01:04.199> here<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.500> well<00:01:05.369> that

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
problem bits here and well that

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.620 
problem bits here and well that
basically<00:01:05.760> flowing<00:01:06.060> about<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.270> if<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.479> a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
basically flowing about is if you have a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.960 
basically flowing about is if you have a
piece<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.930> perspex<00:01:07.460> like<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.909> you

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
piece of perspex like this and you

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.120 
piece of perspex like this and you
polish<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.390> edges<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.710> actually<00:01:10.860> embed

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
polish the edges you can actually embed

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.270 
polish the edges you can actually embed
it<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.729> frame<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.540> put<00:01:13.280> infrared

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
it in a frame and you can put infrared

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.429 
it in a frame and you can put infrared
LEDs<00:01:14.729> down<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.180> side<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:16.020> infrared

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
LEDs down the side and that infrared

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.219 
LEDs down the side and that infrared
like<00:01:17.009> pretty<00:01:17.490> much<00:01:17.580> stay<00:01:18.060> with<00:01:18.330> inside<00:01:18.780> that

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
like pretty much stay with inside that

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.929 
like pretty much stay with inside that
piece<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.500> perspective<00:01:20.130> until<00:01:20.490> something's

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
piece of perspective until something's

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.460 
piece of perspective until something's
put<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> top<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.750> then<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.960> causes<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
put on the top and then it causes the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.130 
put on the top and then it causes the
light<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.860> scatter<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.729> reflect<00:01:24.570> downwards

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
light to scatter and reflect downwards

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.420 
light to scatter and reflect downwards
from<00:01:25.200> what<00:01:25.470> you're<00:01:25.619> actually<00:01:25.799> putting<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.280> an

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
from what you're actually putting on an

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.719 
from what you're actually putting on an
that<00:01:26.580> what<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.540> camera<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.110> looking<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
that what the camera is looking up in a

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.330 
that what the camera is looking up in a
service<00:01:30.060> device<00:01:30.270> actually<00:01:30.450> pick<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:32.070> they

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
service device actually pick up and they

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.690 
service device actually pick up and they
then<00:01:33.090> turn<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.659> into<00:01:33.900> identifying<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.579> know

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
then turn that into identifying you know

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.340 
then turn that into identifying you know
multiple<00:01:36.119> touches<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.990> write<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
multiple touches and then you write the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.560 
multiple touches and then you write the
program<00:01:37.799> code<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.250> top<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.670> now<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.509> turns

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
program code on top of that now it turns

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.590 
program code on top of that now it turns
out<00:01:40.130> it's<00:01:41.130> relatively<00:01:41.549> easy<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.240> build

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
out it's relatively easy to do to build

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.840 
out it's relatively easy to do to build
a<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.590> know<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> multi-touch<00:01:44.369> device<00:01:44.640> and

get the gist of what I'm doing they're

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.070 
get the gist of what I'm doing they're
just<00:03:56.670> going<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.850> change<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:57.630> one<00:03:57.900> other

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
just going to change that one other

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.330 
just going to change that one other
piece<00:03:58.350> because<00:03:58.620> then<00:03:58.770> what<00:03:58.890> I'm<00:03:58.980> going<00:03:59.100> to<00:03:59.160> do

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
piece because then what I'm going to do

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.040 
piece because then what I'm going to do
is<00:03:59.580> just<00:03:59.640> run<00:04:00.120> some<00:04:00.300> software<00:04:00.750> is<00:04:00.930> available

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
is just run some software is available

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.200 
is just run some software is available
from<00:04:01.740> the<00:04:01.980> natural<00:04:02.130> user<00:04:02.460> interface<00:04:02.880> group

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
from the natural user interface group

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.260 
from the natural user interface group
okay<00:04:04.110> so<00:04:04.170> we're<00:04:05.040> pretty<00:04:05.280> much<00:04:05.490> there<00:04:05.550> I<00:04:06.000> wanted

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
okay so we're pretty much there I wanted

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.090 
okay so we're pretty much there I wanted
it<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.450> be<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.540> little<00:04:06.600> close<00:04:07.170> for<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:08.070> a

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
it to be a little close for that a

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.680 
it to be a little close for that a
full-size<00:04:08.700> should've<00:04:09.180> got<00:04:09.270> a<00:04:09.300> bigger<00:04:09.510> sheet

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
full-size should've got a bigger sheet

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.840 
full-size should've got a bigger sheet
of<00:04:09.780> paper<00:04:09.930> okay<00:04:10.860> so<00:04:11.340> now<00:04:11.490> what<00:04:11.610> I'm<00:04:11.700> going<00:04:11.790> to

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
of paper okay so now what I'm going to

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.060 
of paper okay so now what I'm going to
do<00:04:11.970> is<00:04:12.090> just<00:04:12.240> run<00:04:12.570> up<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:13.070> configuration

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
do is just run up a configuration

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.830 
do is just run up a configuration
utility<00:04:14.190> so<00:04:14.580> this<00:04:14.730> quite<00:04:15.000> literally<00:04:15.600> is<00:04:15.810> the

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
utility so this quite literally is the

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.010 
utility so this quite literally is the
software<00:04:16.440> that<00:04:16.739> they've<00:04:17.280> then<00:04:18.020> they've

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
software that they've then they've

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.680 
software that they've then they've
bought<00:04:19.290> out<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.850> it<00:04:20.850> sees<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.239> right<00:04:21.420> camera

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
bought out and it sees the right camera

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.620 
bought out and it sees the right camera
so<00:04:22.020> I<00:04:22.080> can<00:04:22.109> say<00:04:22.380> okay<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:23.540> what<00:04:24.540> we

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
so I can say okay to that and what we

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.770 
so I can say okay to that and what we
should<00:04:24.810> see<00:04:25.050> very<00:04:25.770> shortly

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
should see very shortly

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.129 
should see very shortly
is<00:04:26.990> many<00:04:27.950> different<00:04:28.250> views<00:04:28.580> now<00:04:29.420> those<00:04:29.690> views

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
is many different views now those views

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.170 
is many different views now those views
are<00:04:30.620> in<00:04:30.920> fact<00:04:31.190> what<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.550> cameras<00:04:31.940> seeing

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
are in fact what the cameras seeing

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.080 
are in fact what the cameras seeing
we're<00:04:32.389> applying<00:04:32.600> different<00:04:32.900> filter<00:04:33.500> grass

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
we're applying different filter grass

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.430 
we're applying different filter grass
actually<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.240> show<00:04:35.450> it<00:04:35.600> so<00:04:35.750> some<00:04:35.960> wherever

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
actually to show it so some wherever

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.400 
actually to show it so some wherever
I've<00:04:36.710> got<00:04:37.330> obviously<00:04:38.330> some<00:04:38.540> light<00:04:38.930> leakage

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
I've got obviously some light leakage

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.290 
I've got obviously some light leakage
from<00:04:39.590> my<00:04:39.800> bot<00:04:40.220> camera<00:04:40.639> so<00:04:40.760> let<00:04:40.880> me<00:04:40.970> just<00:04:41.120> open

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
from my bot camera so let me just open

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.800 
from my bot camera so let me just open
that<00:04:41.600> up<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.100> turn<00:04:43.100> my<00:04:43.280> camera<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.790> little<00:04:46.810> try

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
that up and turn my camera a little try

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.020 
that up and turn my camera a little try
and<00:04:48.020> hide<00:04:48.230> that<00:04:48.530> little<00:04:48.889> light<00:04:49.130> leakage<00:04:49.760> I've

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
and hide that little light leakage I've

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.110 
and hide that little light leakage I've
got<00:04:50.270> there<00:04:54.430> question<00:04:55.430> is<00:04:55.520> where<00:04:55.700> is<00:04:55.760> that

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
got there question is where is that

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.760 
got there question is where is that
light<00:04:56.360> leakage<00:04:56.750> probably<00:04:57.290> coming<00:04:57.530> in<00:04:57.620> from

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
light leakage probably coming in from

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.350 
light leakage probably coming in from
the<00:04:57.860> side<00:04:58.040> so<00:04:58.400> you<00:04:58.430> do<00:04:58.669> need<00:04:58.820> to<00:04:58.880> have<00:04:59.150> some

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
the side so you do need to have some

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.870 
the side so you do need to have some
consistent<00:04:59.990> lighting<00:05:00.530> from<00:05:00.710> above<00:05:03.580> no<00:05:04.580> no<00:05:04.730> no

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
consistent lighting from above no no no

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.420 
consistent lighting from above no no no
I<00:05:04.910> think<00:05:05.180> we'll<00:05:06.169> see<00:05:06.380> i<00:05:06.410> can<00:05:06.890> flavor<00:05:07.100> it<00:05:07.250> so

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
I think we'll see i can flavor it so

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.890 
I think we'll see i can flavor it so
basically<00:05:07.760> you<00:05:08.000> cancer<00:05:08.330> now<00:05:08.540> what<00:05:08.720> it's<00:05:08.840> doing

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
basically you cancer now what it's doing

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.940 
basically you cancer now what it's doing
this<00:05:09.290> this<00:05:09.830> window<00:05:10.310> in<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.960> in<00:05:11.960> this<00:05:12.530> corner

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
this this window in the in this corner

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.760 
this this window in the in this corner
here<00:05:13.340> it<00:05:14.300> is<00:05:14.510> actually<00:05:14.720> the<00:05:15.050> final<00:05:15.530> image

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
here it is actually the final image

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.730 
here it is actually the final image
windows<00:05:16.370> you<00:05:16.640> can<00:05:16.669> t<00:05:17.000> see<00:05:17.300> you<00:05:17.900> know<00:05:18.020> my<00:05:18.200> points

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
windows you can t see you know my points

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.560 
windows you can t see you know my points
and<00:05:18.979> my<00:05:19.100> camera<00:05:19.520> is<00:05:19.580> actually<00:05:19.700> pointing<00:05:20.300> up<00:05:20.450> a

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
and my camera is actually pointing up a

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.890 
and my camera is actually pointing up a
little<00:05:20.810> bit<00:05:20.960> so<00:05:21.290> i<00:05:22.070> need<00:05:22.790> to<00:05:22.820> just<00:05:23.180> raise<00:05:23.510> that

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
little bit so i need to just raise that

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.500 
little bit so i need to just raise that
probably<00:05:24.290> a<00:05:24.610> little<00:05:25.610> bit<00:05:25.820> there<00:05:26.030> we<00:05:26.180> go<00:05:26.300> let's

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
probably a little bit there we go let's

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.510 
probably a little bit there we go let's
change<00:05:26.780> that<00:05:27.080> there<00:05:27.620> we<00:05:27.800> go<00:05:27.919> that's<00:05:28.160> bit<00:05:28.340> more

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
change that there we go that's bit more

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.750 
change that there we go that's bit more
like<00:05:28.700> it<00:05:29.350> and<00:05:30.350> just<00:05:30.530> alter<00:05:30.950> those<00:05:31.100> pieces<00:05:31.460> so

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
like it and just alter those pieces so

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.760 
like it and just alter those pieces so
we<00:05:31.790> know<00:05:32.120> we<00:05:32.240> get<00:05:32.690> the<00:05:32.810> general<00:05:33.140> gist<00:05:33.350> also<00:05:33.650> you

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
we know we get the general gist also you

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.830 
we know we get the general gist also you
need<00:05:33.860> to<00:05:33.919> do<00:05:34.640> your<00:05:34.760> fit<00:05:34.970> and<00:05:35.120> finish<00:05:35.270> for<00:05:35.810> a

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
need to do your fit and finish for a

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.810 
need to do your fit and finish for a
little<00:05:35.930> bit<00:05:36.140> as<00:05:36.380> they<00:05:36.560> say<00:05:36.770> so<00:05:37.400> i<00:05:37.430> know<00:05:37.550> i<00:05:37.669> could

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
little bit as they say so i know i could

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.450 
little bit as they say so i know i could
just<00:05:37.940> hit<00:05:38.479> the<00:05:38.660> key<00:05:39.200> on<00:05:39.229> that<00:05:39.500> one<00:05:39.680> and<00:05:39.950> dive

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
just hit the key on that one and dive

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.650 
just hit the key on that one and dive
down<00:05:40.760> into<00:05:40.820> a<00:05:41.270> very<00:05:41.630> quick<00:05:41.900> demo<00:05:43.120> and<00:05:44.120> just<00:05:44.479> run

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
down into a very quick demo and just run

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.409 
down into a very quick demo and just run
up<00:05:44.810> a<00:05:45.080> demo<00:05:45.800> so<00:05:46.310> we're<00:05:46.460> using<00:05:46.669> those<00:05:47.000> different

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
up a demo so we're using those different

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.230 
up a demo so we're using those different
filters<00:05:47.930> in<00:05:48.500> that<00:05:49.340> filter<00:05:49.669> graph<00:05:49.850> to<00:05:50.000> be<00:05:50.120> able

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
filters in that filter graph to be able

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.790 
filters in that filter graph to be able
to<00:05:50.390> invert<00:05:50.840> the<00:05:50.990> image<00:05:51.020> take<00:05:51.500> out<00:05:51.680> the

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
to invert the image take out the

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.550 
to invert the image take out the
background<00:05:52.250> and<00:05:52.430> things<00:05:52.669> like<00:05:52.820> that<00:05:53.229> and<00:05:54.229> then

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
background and things like that and then

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.210 
background and things like that and then
we<00:05:55.070> can<00:05:55.220> run<00:05:55.430> up<00:05:55.610> their<00:05:55.970> software<00:05:56.530> so<00:05:57.530> that's

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
we can run up their software so that's

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.490 
we can run up their software so that's
obviously<00:05:58.760> I'm<00:05:59.479> interference<00:06:00.289> because<00:06:00.350> I

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
obviously I'm interference because I

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.110 
obviously I'm interference because I
haven't<00:06:00.680> closed<00:06:00.950> the<00:06:01.039> shape<00:06:01.280> if<00:06:01.520> I<00:06:01.610> now<00:06:01.760> put<00:06:01.970> my

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
haven't closed the shape if I now put my

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.210 
haven't closed the shape if I now put my
hand<00:06:02.330> on<00:06:02.450> you<00:06:02.630> can<00:06:02.750> see<00:06:03.050> you<00:06:03.650> know<00:06:03.770> the<00:06:03.860> various
