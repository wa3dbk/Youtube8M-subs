00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
mark surprised it came out and i think

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.539 
mark surprised it came out and i think
that<00:01:06.869> i<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.350> i<00:01:07.500> remember<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> store

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that i can i remember going to the store

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.690 
that i can i remember going to the store
and<00:01:08.640> getting<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.210> was<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.479> jealous<00:01:10.700> so

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
and getting it and I was so jealous so

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.070 
and getting it and I was so jealous so
that<00:01:11.820> was<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:11.939> let's<00:01:12.330> way<00:01:12.570> better<00:01:12.810> than<00:01:12.960> I

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
that was like let's way better than I

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.719 
that was like let's way better than I
hoped<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.500> would<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.650> he<00:01:14.130> had<00:01:14.369> heat<00:01:14.580> added

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
hoped it would be he had heat added

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.460 
hoped it would be he had heat added
experiments<00:01:15.450> something<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.930> Helen<00:01:16.200> hadn't

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
experiments something that Helen hadn't

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.020 
experiments something that Helen hadn't
had<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> was<00:01:17.040> really<00:01:17.159> more<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.640> hands-on

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
had so it was really more of a hands-on

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.399 
had so it was really more of a hands-on
actually<00:01:18.509> see<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> way<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> system<00:01:19.259> works

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
actually see the way the system works

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.460 
actually see the way the system works
not<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:19.820> reason<00:01:20.820> theory<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.360> which<00:01:21.900> was<00:01:22.080> I

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
not just reason theory of it which was I

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.230 
not just reason theory of it which was I
think<00:01:22.560> really<00:01:22.920> cool<00:01:23.670> addition<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.150> it's

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
think really cool addition and it's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.460 
think really cool addition and it's
something<00:01:24.479> he<00:01:24.630> obviously<00:01:24.659> spent<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.290> lot<00:01:25.439> of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
something he obviously spent a lot of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.140 
something he obviously spent a lot of
time<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.920> with<00:01:26.070> sysinternals<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.850> that's<00:01:27.030> how

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
time on with sysinternals and that's how

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.850 
time on with sysinternals and that's how
you<00:01:27.210> really<00:01:27.479> learn<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.320> use<00:01:28.530> some<00:01:28.829> of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
you really learn like you use some of

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.050 
you really learn like you use some of
the<00:01:29.009> tools<00:01:29.040> he<00:01:29.340> often<00:01:29.700> sysinternals

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the tools he often sysinternals

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.090 
the tools he often sysinternals
hillsborough<00:01:30.630> first<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.500> mark<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.920> had<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
hillsborough first but mark and I had a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.340 
hillsborough first but mark and I had a
pretty<00:01:32.310> distant<00:01:32.759> relationship<00:01:33.390> he<00:01:33.869> was<00:01:34.049> sort

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
pretty distant relationship he was sort

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.050 
pretty distant relationship he was sort

is kind of funny yeah well Rick says he
invented<00:03:43.340> it<00:03:43.489> I<00:03:43.579> mean<00:03:43.700> it<00:03:43.880> as<00:03:43.970> are<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.299> can

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
invented it I mean it as are you can

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.240 
invented it I mean it as are you can
argue<00:03:44.570> about<00:03:44.780> that<00:03:45.140> but<00:03:45.410> that's<00:03:45.620> that's<00:03:45.890> so

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
argue about that but that's that's so

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.340 
argue about that but that's that's so
anyway<00:03:46.910> I<00:03:46.940> had<00:03:47.390> this<00:03:47.510> unix<00:03:47.840> background<00:03:48.200> but

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
anyway I had this unix background but

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.640 
anyway I had this unix background but
then<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:48.950> started<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:49.940> get<00:03:50.030> into<00:03:50.269> pc<00:03:50.750> technology

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
then I started to get into pc technology

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.550 
then I started to get into pc technology
and<00:03:51.829> window

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
and window

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.210

3031<00:03:53.560> were<00:03:53.950> out<00:03:54.130> and<00:03:54.370> then<00:03:55.150> windows<00:03:55.540> NT<00:03:56.050> 31<00:03:56.710> was

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
3031 were out and then windows NT 31 was

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.740 
3031 were out and then windows NT 31 was
coming<00:03:57.490> out<00:03:57.580> matching<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.450> version<00:03:58.720> number

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
coming out matching the version number

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.480 
coming out matching the version number
and<00:03:59.020> actually<00:03:59.530> having<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.830> same<00:03:59.980> look<00:04:00.310> and

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490

that<00:04:25.030> builds<00:04:25.360> up<00:04:25.450> around<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:25.780> they're<00:04:25.870> going

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
that builds up around and they're going

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.180 
that builds up around and they're going
to<00:04:26.080> want<00:04:26.140> to<00:04:26.260> take<00:04:26.350> that<00:04:26.500> stuff<00:04:26.680> into<00:04:26.920> work<00:04:27.040> and

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
to want to take that stuff into work and

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.100 
to want to take that stuff into work and
so<00:04:27.310> that's<00:04:27.480> what<00:04:28.480> i<00:04:28.510> thought<00:04:28.720> was<00:04:28.840> going<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.050> be

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
so that's what i thought was going to be

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.540 
so that's what i thought was going to be
the<00:04:29.230> future<00:04:29.410> and<00:04:29.590> it<00:04:29.710> turns<00:04:30.100> out<00:04:30.220> that<00:04:30.280> it

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
the future and it turns out that it

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.250 
the future and it turns out that it
pretty<00:04:30.760> much<00:04:30.910> a<00:04:31.150> weirdest<00:04:31.810> thing<00:04:31.960> for<00:04:32.170> me

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
pretty much a weirdest thing for me

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.010 
pretty much a weirdest thing for me
though<00:04:32.440> is<00:04:32.650> that<00:04:33.280> now<00:04:34.120> i<00:04:34.150> can<00:04:34.720> get<00:04:34.870> my

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
though is that now i can get my

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.490 
though is that now i can get my
