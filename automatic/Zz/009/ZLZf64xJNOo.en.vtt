 And, folks, it's the hair to start the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:14.370
 new channel and thinking about some things 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.400
 here we can do is is some 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:24.660
 thing we can do is stay and only 200 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:32.059
 is at stake here is Nuno O Adecor ok a 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:37.170
 map water and a hardcore and I will leave 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:48.840
 leave 200 in a game or play a year 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:50.280
 where it runs a year a co-defendant 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:01:00.140
 online 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:00.140

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.750
 split shows that there is nothing to craft 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:32.759
 1.712 all the same 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:37.530
 I think this version 1.7 because it has 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:46.229
 people who say that when he gives a 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:53.640
 error is not craft and 200 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:59.369
 The reason is because I read something there in the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:03.180
 internet that I got to see the 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:08.830
