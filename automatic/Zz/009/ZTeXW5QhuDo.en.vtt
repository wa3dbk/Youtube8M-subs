00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
special there it's a battery operated so

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.649 
special there it's a battery operated so
it<00:01:55.950> isn't<00:01:56.250> automatic<00:01:57.119> or<00:01:57.240> anything<00:01:57.509> well

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
it isn't automatic or anything well

you'll<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.110> moving<00:01:58.320> parts<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.920> you

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
you'll have the moving parts like you

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.800 
you'll have the moving parts like you
would<00:01:59.159> normally<00:01:59.490> see<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.909> some<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.719> those

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
would normally see in some of those

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.069 
would normally see in some of those
other<00:02:00.930> one<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.700> overall<00:02:03.090> very<00:02:03.270> nice<00:02:03.780> watch

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
other one so overall very nice watch

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.240 
other one so overall very nice watch
very<00:02:04.500> happy<00:02:04.860> with<00:02:04.979> that

very happy with that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.580 
very happy with that
hopefully<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.299> movement<00:02:06.899> works<00:02:07.079> out<00:02:07.380> and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
hopefully the movement works out and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.669
