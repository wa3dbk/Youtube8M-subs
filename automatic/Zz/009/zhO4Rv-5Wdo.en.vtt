hey guys so today's tutorial is on

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.650 
hey guys so today's tutorial is on
spinning<00:00:12.809> under<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.769> legs<00:00:14.009> or<00:00:14.370> UTL<00:00:15.179> as<00:00:15.480> it's

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
spinning under the legs or UTL as it's

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.980 
spinning under the legs or UTL as it's
sometimes<00:00:15.839> abbreviated<00:00:17.240> it's<00:00:18.240> not<00:00:18.630> terribly

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
sometimes abbreviated it's not terribly

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.250 
sometimes abbreviated it's not terribly
difficult<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.619> fact<00:00:20.010> if<00:00:20.369> if<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.869> can<00:00:22.020> do<00:00:22.140> these

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
difficult in fact if if you can do these

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.200 
difficult in fact if if you can do these
kind<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.590> real<00:00:22.800> turns<00:00:23.100> where<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> poi<00:00:23.730> rotate

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
kind of real turns where the poi rotate

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.670 
kind of real turns where the poi rotate
behind<00:00:24.570> your<00:00:24.720> head<00:00:24.869> for<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> second<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.590> then

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
behind your head for a second and then

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.150 
behind your head for a second and then
back<00:00:25.890> out<00:00:26.269> behind<00:00:27.269> your<00:00:27.599> back<00:00:27.920> you've<00:00:28.920> already

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
back out behind your back you've already

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.679 
back out behind your back you've already
done<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.490> whole<00:00:29.760> lot<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.150> training<00:00:30.390> for

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
done a whole lot of the training for

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.049 
done a whole lot of the training for
this<00:00:31.309> essentially<00:00:32.309> under<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.610> legs<00:00:32.820> moves

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
this essentially under the legs moves

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.000 
this essentially under the legs moves
are<00:00:33.270> exactly<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.870> same<00:00:33.899> thing<00:00:34.140> as<00:00:34.649> those

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
are exactly the same thing as those

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.889 
are exactly the same thing as those
turns<00:00:35.370> where<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> poi<00:00:35.910> rotates<00:00:36.390> behind<00:00:36.750> your

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
turns where the poi rotates behind your

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.350 
turns where the poi rotates behind your
head<00:00:37.110> right<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.520> matter<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.940> putting

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
head right it's just a matter of putting

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.209 
head right it's just a matter of putting
them<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.809> different<00:00:40.110> spot<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.860> spot

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
them in a different spot and that spot

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.190 
them in a different spot and that spot
just<00:00:41.670> happens<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.059> be<00:00:42.149> narrower<00:00:42.690> than<00:00:42.809> all<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
just happens to be narrower than all the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.500 
just happens to be narrower than all the
other<00:00:43.320> spots<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.860> you've<00:00:43.980> used<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.460> far<00:00:44.700> so

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
other spots that you've used so far so

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.850 
other spots that you've used so far so
you<00:00:45.570> got<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.870> train<00:00:46.050> yourself<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.530> use<00:00:46.649> that

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
you got to train yourself to use that

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.799 
you got to train yourself to use that
spot<00:00:47.190> here's<00:00:47.820> how<00:00:47.969> we're<00:00:48.090> gonna<00:00:48.149> go<00:00:48.390> about<00:00:48.420> it

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
spot here's how we're gonna go about it

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.479 
spot here's how we're gonna go about it
you're<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.590> start<00:00:49.829> off<00:00:49.980> with<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.309> poi

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
you're going to start off with the poi

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.160 
you're going to start off with the poi
rotating<00:00:51.300> forwards<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.230> wheel<00:00:52.800> plane<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:54.170> as

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
rotating forwards in wheel plane and as

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.689 
rotating forwards in wheel plane and as
it's<00:00:55.379> rotating<00:00:55.770> forwards<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.219> wheel<00:00:56.399> plane

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
it's rotating forwards in wheel plane

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.639 
it's rotating forwards in wheel plane
you're<00:00:57.300> gonna<00:00:57.420> reach<00:00:57.719> down<00:00:58.020> between<00:00:58.050> your

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
you're gonna reach down between your

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.920 
you're gonna reach down between your
legs<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.219> you're<00:00:59.850> gonna<00:00:59.940> catch<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.420> poi<00:01:00.629> head

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
legs and you're gonna catch the poi head

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.660 
legs and you're gonna catch the poi head
behind<00:01:01.320> your<00:01:01.500> back<00:01:01.739> you're<00:01:02.309> gonna<00:01:02.399> want<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
behind your back you're gonna want to

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.219 
behind your back you're gonna want to
try<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.000> get<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.300> high<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.809> small<00:01:04.080> of

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
try and get it as high as the small of

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.190 
try and get it as high as the small of
your<00:01:04.260> back<00:01:04.379> right<00:01:06.770> if<00:01:07.770> your<00:01:08.280> poi<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.580> shorter

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
your back right if your poi is shorter

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.810 
your back right if your poi is shorter
you<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.350> catch<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.740> slightly<00:01:11.070> lower<00:01:11.430> but<00:01:11.790> I

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
you can catch it slightly lower but I

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.570 
you can catch it slightly lower but I
would<00:01:12.060> say<00:01:12.360> no<00:01:12.630> no<00:01:13.590> lower<00:01:13.860> than<00:01:14.010> about<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
would say no no lower than about the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.990 
would say no no lower than about the
nape<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.000> small<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:15.540> back<00:01:15.600> right<00:01:16.020> and

nape of the small of your back right and

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.510 
nape of the small of your back right and
I<00:01:18.000> know<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.210> know<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.810> way<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.049> looks<00:01:19.369> there<00:01:20.369> are

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
I know I know the way it looks there are

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.130 
I know I know the way it looks there are
some<00:01:20.759> those<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.299> impossible<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.900> learn

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
some those that it's impossible to learn

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.660 
some those that it's impossible to learn
without<00:01:22.530> exposing<00:01:22.890> yourself<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.580> little

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670

bit of laughter here so after a few
times<00:01:26.640> getting<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.090> through<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.420> being

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
times getting it through and being

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.819 
times getting it through and being
pretty<00:01:27.750> comfortable<00:01:28.229> about<00:01:28.380> making<00:01:28.710> that

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
pretty comfortable about making that

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.830 
pretty comfortable about making that
target<00:01:29.189> every<00:01:29.369> time<00:01:29.400> you're<00:01:30.329> then<00:01:30.509> going<00:01:30.750> to

target every time you're then going to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.510 
target every time you're then going to
take<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.110> step<00:01:31.409> with<00:01:31.560> your<00:01:31.680> right<00:01:31.950> foot<00:01:31.979> and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.730 
you're going to swing around pivoting on
your<00:01:34.439> left<00:01:34.680> foot<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.659> such<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.990> you'll<00:01:37.500> note

your left foot as such and you'll note

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.160 
your left foot as such and you'll note
that<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.130> poi<00:01:38.310> rotated<00:01:38.970> behind<00:01:39.420> my<00:01:39.570> back<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.140> I

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
that the poi rotated behind my back is I

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.580 
that the poi rotated behind my back is I
made<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.680> turn<00:01:40.920> again<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.150> let<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.049> go<00:01:43.140> up<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
made that turn again I let it go up and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.679 
made that turn again I let it go up and
the<00:01:44.070> moment<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.490> goes<00:01:44.610> between<00:01:44.820> my<00:01:45.000> legs<00:01:45.390> I've

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
the moment it goes between my legs I've

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.899 
the moment it goes between my legs I've
taken<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.140> step<00:01:46.380> with<00:01:46.560> my<00:01:46.710> right<00:01:46.740> foot<00:01:46.950> now

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
taken this step with my right foot now

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.310 
taken this step with my right foot now
my<00:01:48.119> right<00:01:48.299> foot<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.659> facing<00:01:48.810> towards<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
my right foot is facing towards the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.080 
my right foot is facing towards the
camera<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.280> poi<00:01:50.430> appears<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.880> be<00:01:50.939> going

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
camera and the poi appears to be going

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.020 
camera and the poi appears to be going
reverse<00:01:52.250> according<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.310> my<00:01:53.399> perspective<00:01:53.700> at

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
reverse according to my perspective at

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.709 
reverse according to my perspective at
least<00:01:54.180> right<00:01:54.829> now<00:01:55.829> what<00:01:55.950> about<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.340> back

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
least right now what about going back

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.990 
least right now what about going back
well<00:01:57.740> let's<00:01:58.740> try<00:01:58.890> taking<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> same<00:01:59.670> steps

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
well let's try taking the same steps

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.230 
well let's try taking the same steps
except<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.600> time<00:02:00.869> instead<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.560> reaching

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
except this time instead of reaching

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.190 
except this time instead of reaching
forwards<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.329> under<00:02:03.570> we're<00:02:03.780> gonna<00:02:03.930> reach

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
forwards and under we're gonna reach

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.310 
forwards and under we're gonna reach
behind<00:02:04.439> ourselves<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.640> under<00:02:06.450> once<00:02:06.990> again

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
behind ourselves and under once again

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.980 
behind ourselves and under once again
catch<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.979> poi<00:02:08.160> head<00:02:08.429> as<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:09.539> does<00:02:09.720> this

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.150 

you<00:02:12.990> want<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.290> be<00:02:13.380> about<00:02:13.590> even<00:02:13.890> with<00:02:13.980> your

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
you want to be about even with your

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.010 
you want to be about even with your
belly<00:02:14.310> button<00:02:14.640> when<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.850> catch<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:17.810> this<00:02:18.810> will

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
belly button when you catch it this will

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.330 
belly button when you catch it this will
ensure<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.440> you've<00:02:19.560> got<00:02:19.590> enough<00:02:19.830> line<00:02:20.160> to

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
ensure that you've got enough line to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.120 
ensure that you've got enough line to
get<00:02:20.490> through<00:02:20.990> reasonably<00:02:21.990> well<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.290> again

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
get through reasonably well and again

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.010 
get through reasonably well and again
that<00:02:23.610> moment<00:02:24.090> right<00:02:24.300> when<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.600> enters<00:02:24.900> that

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
that moment right when it enters that

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.140 
that moment right when it enters that
space<00:02:25.290> between<00:02:25.500> your<00:02:25.800> legs<00:02:25.980> you're<00:02:26.790> going<00:02:26.820> to

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
space between your legs you're going to

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.670 
space between your legs you're going to
rotate<00:02:28.080> around<00:02:28.580> and<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:31.320> poor<00:02:31.500> should

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
rotate around and the poor should

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.320 
rotate around and the poor should
automatically<00:02:32.190> rotate<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.500> drop<00:02:34.500> back<00:02:34.740> out

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
automatically rotate and drop back out

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.390 
automatically rotate and drop back out
go<00:02:36.330> in<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.540> other<00:02:36.600> direction<00:02:36.720> yeah<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:38.100> now

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
go in the other direction yeah so now

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.990 
go in the other direction yeah so now
we've<00:02:38.580> got<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:39.030> forwards<00:02:40.310> rotation<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.550> a

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
we've got a forwards rotation and a

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.930 
we've got a forwards rotation and a
reverse<00:02:43.010> rotation<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.370> bear<00:02:44.520> in<00:02:44.610> mind<00:02:44.760> it

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
reverse rotation and bear in mind it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.970 
reverse rotation and bear in mind it
doesn't<00:02:45.090> matter<00:02:45.240> which<00:02:45.690> foot<00:02:46.080> you're<00:02:46.440> doing

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
doesn't matter which foot you're doing

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.380 
doesn't matter which foot you're doing
the<00:02:47.040> pivot<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.460> could<00:02:47.700> just<00:02:47.880> as<00:02:47.970> easily<00:02:48.000> be

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
the pivot on I could just as easily be

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.410 
the pivot on I could just as easily be
doing<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.750> on<00:02:48.960> my<00:02:49.470> right<00:02:49.860> foot<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.430> then<00:02:51.270> back

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
doing it on my right foot and then back

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.240 
doing it on my right foot and then back
again<00:02:51.740> on<00:02:52.740> my<00:02:53.040> right<00:02:53.220> foot<00:02:53.430> yeah<00:02:54.230> cool<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:55.950> now

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
again on my right foot yeah cool so now

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.730 
again on my right foot yeah cool so now
that<00:02:56.640> you've<00:02:57.060> worked<00:02:57.960> out<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.320> basics<00:02:58.620> of

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
that you've worked out the basics of

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.470 
that you've worked out the basics of
that<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.100> honestly<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.520> really<00:03:00.000> recommend

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
that and honestly I really recommend

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.270 
that and honestly I really recommend
just<00:03:00.690> drilling<00:03:00.990> going<00:03:01.350> back<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.770> forth<00:03:02.100> with

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
just drilling going back and forth with

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.940 
just drilling going back and forth with
these<00:03:02.430> turns<00:03:05.960> see<00:03:06.960> how<00:03:07.110> few<00:03:07.320> of<00:03:07.380> steps<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.830> can

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
these turns see how few of steps you can

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.690 
these turns see how few of steps you can
do<00:03:08.130> this<00:03:08.310> in<00:03:09.920> going<00:03:10.920> back<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.310> other<00:03:11.370> way<00:03:11.520> of

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
do this in going back the other way of

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.370 
do this in going back the other way of
course

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.970 

sorry<00:03:16.100> I'm<00:03:16.220> on<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.340> hilltop<00:03:16.670> here<00:03:17.860> after<00:03:18.860> you've

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
sorry I'm on a hilltop here after you've

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.290 
sorry I'm on a hilltop here after you've
done<00:03:19.070> that<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.310> whole<00:03:19.490> bunch<00:03:19.520> it's<00:03:19.970> time<00:03:20.180> to

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
done that a whole bunch it's time to

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.960 
done that a whole bunch it's time to
start<00:03:20.570> taking<00:03:20.840> this<00:03:21.080> into<00:03:21.710> a<00:03:22.010> wall<00:03:22.430> plane<00:03:22.700> kind

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
start taking this into a wall plane kind

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.320 
start taking this into a wall plane kind
of<00:03:23.060> place<00:03:23.300> now<00:03:24.130> if<00:03:25.130> it<00:03:25.430> still<00:03:25.670> fundamentally<00:03:26.300> a

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
of place now if it still fundamentally a

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.050 
of place now if it still fundamentally a
turn<00:03:26.720> in<00:03:27.110> wall<00:03:27.560> plane<00:03:27.920> but<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:28.700> difference

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
turn in wall plane but the difference

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.050 
turn in wall plane but the difference
here<00:03:29.120> is<00:03:29.330> that<00:03:29.540> you're<00:03:30.290> going<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:31.060> be

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
here is that you're going to be

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.520 
here is that you're going to be
switching<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.630> orientation<00:03:33.110> of<00:03:33.170> your<00:03:33.350> feet

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
switching the orientation of your feet

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.780 
switching the orientation of your feet
as<00:03:33.710> you're<00:03:33.890> doing<00:03:34.130> it<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.310> this<00:03:34.400> is<00:03:34.550> kind<00:03:34.670> of

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
as you're doing it and this is kind of

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.040 
as you're doing it and this is kind of
tricky<00:03:36.220> start<00:03:37.220> off<00:03:37.430> with<00:03:38.000> your<00:03:38.450> right<00:03:38.990> foot

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
tricky start off with your right foot

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.410 
tricky start off with your right foot
forward<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:39.860> turn<00:03:40.790> your<00:03:40.970> entire<00:03:41.240> body

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
forward and turn your entire body

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.690 
forward and turn your entire body
towards<00:03:41.810> your<00:03:41.930> right<00:03:42.050> foot<00:03:42.350> yeah<00:03:42.610> now<00:03:43.610> the

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
towards your right foot yeah now the

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.030 
towards your right foot yeah now the
easy<00:03:43.970> way<00:03:44.210> to<00:03:44.270> do<00:03:44.480> this<00:03:44.660> would<00:03:45.290> be<00:03:45.470> to<00:03:45.590> pop<00:03:45.800> up

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
easy way to do this would be to pop up

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.440 
easy way to do this would be to pop up
through<00:03:46.310> your<00:03:46.400> legs<00:03:46.580> and<00:03:46.910> take<00:03:47.150> a<00:03:47.180> step

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
through your legs and take a step

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.370 
through your legs and take a step
forward<00:03:47.720> with<00:03:47.750> your<00:03:47.870> left<00:03:47.990> foot

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
forward with your left foot

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.020 
forward with your left foot
right<00:03:48.560> that's<00:03:49.220> always<00:03:49.460> going<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.730> displace

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
right that's always going to displace

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.710 
right that's always going to displace
you<00:03:50.300> in<00:03:50.420> space<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:52.730> other<00:03:52.760> way<00:03:53.210> you<00:03:53.270> can<00:03:53.510> do<00:03:53.690> it

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
you in space the other way you can do it

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.540 
you in space the other way you can do it
and<00:03:54.020> this<00:03:54.140> take<00:03:54.620> and<00:03:54.860> this<00:03:55.040> takes<00:03:55.280> being

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
and this take and this takes being

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.610 
and this take and this takes being
really<00:03:56.000> really<00:03:56.390> really<00:03:56.660> fast<00:03:57.170> on<00:03:57.470> your<00:03:57.560> feet

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
really really really fast on your feet

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.450 
really really really fast on your feet

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
forward and the poi should fall straight

forward and the poi should fall straight
back<00:04:11.810> out<00:04:11.990> again<00:04:12.320> yeah<00:04:12.940> so<00:04:14.140> poi<00:04:15.140> goes<00:04:15.410> up<00:04:15.880> we

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
gotten down with both hands because of

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.500 
gotten down with both hands because of
course<00:04:49.370> you've<00:04:49.550> been<00:04:49.580> practicing<00:04:50.330> it<00:04:50.420> with

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
course you've been practicing it with

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.200 
course you've been practicing it with
both<00:04:50.660> hands<00:04:50.930> right<00:04:51.230> you<00:04:52.070> can<00:04:52.250> try<00:04:52.460> doing<00:04:52.520> funky

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
both hands right you can try doing funky

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.660 
both hands right you can try doing funky
things<00:04:53.510> like<00:04:53.780> thread<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.200> needles<00:04:54.670> that

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
things like thread the needles that

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.160 
things like thread the needles that
involve<00:04:56.030> going<00:04:56.210> back<00:04:56.510> and<00:04:56.690> forth<00:04:56.990> between

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
involve going back and forth between

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.500 
involve going back and forth between
your<00:04:57.500> legs<00:04:57.680> you<00:04:59.230> could<00:05:00.230> also<00:05:00.380> try<00:05:00.650> doing

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
your legs you could also try doing

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.640 
your legs you could also try doing
weaves<00:05:02.510> that<00:05:02.900> go<00:05:03.020> underneath<00:05:03.260> your<00:05:03.350> legs

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
weaves that go underneath your legs

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.230 
weaves that go underneath your legs
which<00:05:03.830> I'm<00:05:03.980> terrible<00:05:04.610> at<00:05:04.760> so<00:05:04.910> I'm<00:05:05.000> not<00:05:05.120> going

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
which I'm terrible at so I'm not going

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.060 
which I'm terrible at so I'm not going
to<00:05:05.330> bother<00:05:05.420> demonstrating<00:05:06.140> them<00:05:06.290> but

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
to bother demonstrating them but

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.950 
to bother demonstrating them but
essentially<00:05:08.030> you'll<00:05:08.330> just<00:05:08.510> find<00:05:08.750> that

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
essentially you'll just find that

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.810 
essentially you'll just find that
there's<00:05:09.230> all<00:05:09.530> kinds<00:05:09.830> of<00:05:09.890> things<00:05:09.950> like<00:05:10.310> say<00:05:10.580> if

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
there's all kinds of things like say if

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.150 
there's all kinds of things like say if
you're<00:05:11.390> playing<00:05:11.660> around<00:05:11.960> with<00:05:12.170> flowers

you're playing around with flowers
you'll<00:05:13.580> find<00:05:13.970> moments<00:05:14.420> when<00:05:14.600> you<00:05:14.720> can<00:05:15.340> get<00:05:16.340> the

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
you'll find moments when you can get the

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.850 
you'll find moments when you can get the
poi<00:05:16.760> I<00:05:16.790> under<00:05:17.120> Neath<00:05:17.270> your<00:05:17.300> legs<00:05:17.780> as<00:05:18.140> you're
