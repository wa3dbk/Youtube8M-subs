00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
at the settings and then we'll do a few

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.580 
at the settings and then we'll do a few
benchmarks<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:34.780> here<00:02:35.050> in<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.200> settings<00:02:35.380> you

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
benchmarks so here in the settings you

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.110 
benchmarks so here in the settings you
can<00:02:35.770> see<00:02:35.920> it's<00:02:36.040> got<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.280> option<00:02:36.640> for<00:02:36.820> screen

can see it's got the option for screen

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.610 
can see it's got the option for screen
captures<00:02:37.600> also<00:02:38.020> I<00:02:38.050> like<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.350> way<00:02:38.440> the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
change of pace and here in storage you

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.949 
change of pace and here in storage you
can<00:02:45.160> see<00:02:45.340> it's<00:02:45.459> got<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.640> gig<00:02:46.000> for<00:02:46.270> app<00:02:46.450> storage

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
can see it's got a gig for app storage

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.449 
can see it's got a gig for app storage
and<00:02:47.170> then<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.380> rest<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.770> space<00:02:48.010> is<00:02:48.250> going

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
and then the rest of the space is going

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.360 
and then the rest of the space is going
for<00:02:48.790> your<00:02:48.940> data<00:02:49.209> storage<00:02:49.720> so<00:02:50.020> about<00:02:50.260> almost<00:02:51.100> 6

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
for your data storage so about almost 6

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.240 
for your data storage so about almost 6
gigs<00:02:51.610> for<00:02:51.820> data<00:02:51.970> storage<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.920> version<00:02:54.070> of

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
put information about 4.2 and 4.1 in the

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.120 
put information about 4.2 and 4.1 in the
video<00:03:02.020> description<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.770> which<00:03:02.890> one<00:03:03.040> I<00:03:03.070> think

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
video description and which one I think

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.509 
video description and which one I think
is<00:03:03.370> better<00:03:03.550> so<00:03:04.300> check<00:03:04.540> down<00:03:04.690> there<00:03:05.250> ok<00:03:06.250> time<00:03:06.489> to

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
is better so check down there ok time to

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.180 
is better so check down there ok time to
run<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.820> few<00:03:07.090> tests<00:03:07.480> I'm<00:03:07.630> here<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.140> just<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:08.890> quick

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
run a few tests I'm here so just a quick

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.060 
run a few tests I'm here so just a quick
CPU<00:03:10.060> info<00:03:11.610> so<00:03:12.610> CPU<00:03:13.090> is<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.390> rock<00:03:13.630> chip<00:03:14.070> quad-core

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
CPU info so CPU is a rock chip quad-core

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.040 
CPU info so CPU is a rock chip quad-core
you<00:03:15.130> can<00:03:15.370> see<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.580> four<00:03:15.790> cores<00:03:16.030> there<00:03:16.360> 1.6

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
you can see the four cores there 1.6

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
though it kind of depends what you want

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.900 
though it kind of depends what you want
but<00:03:32.440> root<00:03:32.650> is<00:03:32.769> not<00:03:32.890> really<00:03:33.190> necessary<00:03:33.730> it's

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
but root is not really necessary it's

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.890 
but root is not really necessary it's
nice<00:03:34.120> sometimes<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.660> install<00:03:34.989> certain<00:03:35.230> apps

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
nice sometimes to install certain apps

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.649 
nice sometimes to install certain apps
next<00:03:36.799> up<00:03:36.920> is<00:03:37.069> the<00:03:37.250> Linpack<00:03:37.459> test<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.180> this<00:03:38.420> guy

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
next up is the Linpack test and this guy

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.300 
next up is the Linpack test and this guy
has<00:03:38.870> been<00:03:39.019> running<00:03:39.290> really<00:03:39.500> fast<00:03:39.650> for<00:03:40.190> me

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
has been running really fast for me

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.720 
has been running really fast for me
anywhere<00:03:40.549> from<00:03:40.610> 120<00:03:41.390> s<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.989> 130<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:42.980> one<00:03:43.580> of<00:03:43.610> the

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
anywhere from 120 s to 130 so one of the

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.460 
anywhere from 120 s to 130 so one of the
fastest<00:03:44.180> ones<00:03:44.390> I've<00:03:44.569> tested<00:03:44.989> actually<00:03:45.440> I

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
fastest ones I've tested actually I

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.080 
fastest ones I've tested actually I
think<00:03:45.590> it's<00:03:45.830> got<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.040> really<00:03:46.250> good<00:03:46.549> ROM<00:03:46.790> on<00:03:46.819> it

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
think it's got a really good ROM on it

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.330 
think it's got a really good ROM on it
as<00:03:47.330> far<00:03:47.510> as<00:03:47.629> speed<00:03:48.409> goes<00:03:48.440> it's<00:03:48.890> nice<00:03:49.099> and

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
as far as speed goes it's nice and

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.589 
as far as speed goes it's nice and
snappy<00:03:49.580> and<00:03:51.159> finally<00:03:52.159> I<00:03:52.190> ran<00:03:52.459> antutu<00:03:52.940> on<00:03:53.269> here

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
snappy and finally I ran antutu on here

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.899 
snappy and finally I ran antutu on here
and<00:03:53.750> it<00:03:54.379> got<00:03:54.470> about<00:03:54.709> an<00:03:54.890> average<00:03:55.040> score<00:03:55.579> for<00:03:55.610> a

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
and it got about an average score for a

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.210 
and it got about an average score for a
quad-core<00:03:56.299> Rockchip<00:03:56.780> CPU<00:03:57.319> it's<00:03:57.920> still<00:03:58.069> pretty

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
quad-core Rockchip CPU it's still pretty

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.860 
quad-core Rockchip CPU it's still pretty
good<00:03:58.430> for<00:03:58.640> a<00:03:58.670> stock<00:03:58.909> rom<00:03:59.209> though<00:03:59.420> maybe<00:03:59.659> one

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
good for a stock rom though maybe one

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.390 
good for a stock rom though maybe one
component<00:04:00.319> on<00:04:00.409> there<00:04:00.560> like<00:04:00.709> say<00:04:00.829> the<00:04:00.980> NAND<00:04:01.190> is

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
component on there like say the NAND is

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.979 
component on there like say the NAND is
slow<00:04:01.670> cuz<00:04:01.909> you<00:04:02.000> tests<00:04:02.329> all<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.480> components

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
slow cuz you tests all the components

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.149 
slow cuz you tests all the components
and<00:04:03.049> if<00:04:03.140> one<00:04:03.349> is<00:04:03.500> slow<00:04:03.709> it<00:04:03.829> will<00:04:03.890> bring<00:04:04.040> the

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
and if one is slow it will bring the

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.220 
and if one is slow it will bring the
whole<00:04:04.310> score<00:04:04.579> down<00:04:04.879> anyways<00:04:05.810> it's<00:04:05.989> a<00:04:06.079> nice

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
whole score down anyways it's a nice

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.059 
whole score down anyways it's a nice
