00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
to be jotted down and so what you can do

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.260 
to be jotted down and so what you can do
is<00:04:19.090> take<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.720> fabrics<00:04:20.290> and<00:04:20.590> bind<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.700> ends

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
is take the fabrics and bind the ends

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.200 
is take the fabrics and bind the ends
just<00:04:22.810> loop<00:04:23.260> it<00:04:23.380> around<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:24.190> then<00:04:24.220> that<00:04:25.030> will

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
just loop it around and then that will

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.480 
just loop it around and then that will
hold<00:04:25.450> this<00:04:25.930> together<00:04:28.080> this<00:04:29.080> one<00:04:29.290> has<00:04:29.590> that

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
hold this together this one has that

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.150 
hold this together this one has that
hexagon<00:04:31.139> honeycomb<00:04:32.139> pattern<00:04:32.590> it's<00:04:33.010> kind<00:04:33.130> of

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
hexagon honeycomb pattern it's kind of

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.219 
hexagon honeycomb pattern it's kind of
hard<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.400> see<00:04:33.639> I'm<00:04:33.760> sure<00:04:33.940> on<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.210> video<00:04:34.510> but

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
hard to see I'm sure on the video but

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.820 
hard to see I'm sure on the video but
this<00:04:35.380> is<00:04:35.560> 4<00:04:36.310> by<00:04:36.460> 8<00:04:36.490> inch<00:04:36.940> size<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.720> then<00:04:38.650> this

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
this is 4 by 8 inch size and then this

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.100 
this is 4 by 8 inch size and then this
one<00:04:39.010> is<00:04:39.040> an<00:04:39.280> 8<00:04:39.460> by<00:04:39.669> 10<00:04:39.910> inch<00:04:40.180> size<00:04:40.419> which<00:04:40.690> is<00:04:40.870> new

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
one is an 8 by 10 inch size which is new

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.590 
one is an 8 by 10 inch size which is new
and<00:04:41.500> I<00:04:41.889> love<00:04:42.130> those<00:04:42.340> zigzag<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:43.120> chevron

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
and I love those zigzag the chevron

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.879 
and I love those zigzag the chevron
pattern<00:04:43.930> on<00:04:44.229> the<00:04:44.350> front<00:04:44.820> so<00:04:45.820> this<00:04:45.970> is<00:04:46.000> a

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
pattern on the front so this is a

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.909 
pattern on the front so this is a
nice-sized<00:04:47.889> journal<00:04:48.550> and<00:04:49.440> then<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.860> course

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
nice-sized journal and then of course

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.860 
nice-sized journal and then of course

the different people shapes in different
sizes<00:04:57.910> there<00:04:58.479> 63<00:04:58.979> would<00:04:59.979> die<00:05:00.460> cut<00:05:00.760> pieces<00:05:01.060> here

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
sizes there 63 would die cut pieces here

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.190
