the glass and this is because the gels
might<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.670> thirsty<00:00:41.870> it's<00:00:42.870> best<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.110> check<00:00:43.320> that

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
might be thirsty it's best to check that

every<00:00:46.710> day<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:47.460> they<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.850> even<00:00:48.090> with<00:00:48.239> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
every day but they do it even with it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.450 
every day but they do it even with it
and<00:00:49.170> that's<00:00:49.350> because<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.829> their<00:00:49.980> tunnels<00:00:50.340> in

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and that's because in their tunnels in

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.130 
and that's because in their tunnels in
the<00:00:50.550> wild<00:00:50.820> they<00:00:51.239> would<00:00:51.360> let<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> condensation

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
the wild they would let the condensation

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.979 
the wild they would let the condensation
off<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.980> cooler<00:00:53.160> parts<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.760> their<00:00:53.910> borås<00:00:54.270> the

this<00:01:53.450> is<00:01:53.600> a<00:01:53.630> hundred<00:01:53.990> sin<00:01:54.110> no<00:01:54.260> more<00:01:54.410> especially

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
this is a hundred sin no more especially

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.200 
this is a hundred sin no more especially
in<00:01:55.190> young<00:01:55.370> jurors<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:57.520> basically<00:01:58.520> it's<00:01:58.760> not

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
in young jurors and basically it's not

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.180 
in young jurors and basically it's not
massively<00:01:59.690> freaking<00:02:00.110> pretty<00:02:00.530> but<00:02:00.770> they<00:02:01.040> will

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
massively freaking pretty but they will

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.920 
massively freaking pretty but they will
have<00:02:01.340> short<00:02:02.060> periods<00:02:02.360> of<00:02:02.450> time<00:02:02.600> where<00:02:02.840> they'll

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
have short periods of time where they'll

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
have short periods of time where they'll
have<00:02:03.050> a<00:02:03.080> little<00:02:03.290> bit<00:02:03.440> of<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:04.240> hostile<00:02:05.240> intent

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
have a little bit of a hostile intent

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.919 
have a little bit of a hostile intent
but<00:02:06.950> don't<00:02:07.910> mistake<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.240> for<00:02:08.360> actual<00:02:08.750> fighting

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
but don't mistake it for actual fighting

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.990 
but don't mistake it for actual fighting
where<00:02:09.380> regularly<00:02:10.070> for<00:02:10.280> prolonged<00:02:10.610> periods<00:02:10.729> of

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
where regularly for prolonged periods of

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.830 
where regularly for prolonged periods of
time<00:02:11.060> they're<00:02:11.360> actually<00:02:12.220> properly<00:02:13.840> tearing

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
time they're actually properly tearing

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.600 
time they're actually properly tearing
each<00:02:14.930> other<00:02:15.230> because<00:02:15.590> Diablos<00:02:16.040> will<00:02:16.250> fight<00:02:16.490> to

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
each other because Diablos will fight to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.630 
each other because Diablos will fight to
the<00:02:16.700> death<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.540> need<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.810> separate<00:02:18.170> and

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
the death and you need to separate and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.440 
the death and you need to separate and
obviously<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.790> know<00:02:19.820> that<00:02:20.090> if<00:02:20.180> you're<00:02:20.270> trying

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
obviously you know that if you're trying

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.790 
obviously you know that if you're trying
to<00:02:20.480> introduce<00:02:20.870> two<00:02:21.020> doubles<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.530> should<00:02:21.680> be

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
to introduce two doubles you should be

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.770 
to introduce two doubles you should be
using<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.130> split<00:02:22.310> caging<00:02:22.670> method<00:02:22.970> definitely

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
using the split caging method definitely

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.180 
using the split caging method definitely
not<00:02:23.930> putting<00:02:24.050> them<00:02:24.260> straight<00:02:24.590> together

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
not putting them straight together

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.100 
not putting them straight together
because<00:02:25.640> they<00:02:25.730> won't<00:02:25.820> get<00:02:26.000> on<00:02:26.180> okay<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:26.870> deal

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
because they won't get on okay so deal

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.650 
because they won't get on okay so deal
with<00:02:27.320> both<00:02:27.440> active<00:02:27.830> in<00:02:27.920> day<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.370> night<00:02:28.660> but

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
with both active in day and night but

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.690 
with both active in day and night but
just<00:02:30.110> before<00:02:30.350> dawn<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.860> just<00:02:31.070> after<00:02:31.370> dusk<00:02:31.459> is

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
just before dawn and just after dusk is

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.940 
just before dawn and just after dusk is
when<00:02:31.820> they're<00:02:31.940> most<00:02:31.970> active<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.950> that's

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
when they're most active and that's

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.320 
when they're most active and that's
about<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.400> so<00:02:34.670> if<00:02:34.820> you<00:02:34.910> enjoyed<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.209> video
