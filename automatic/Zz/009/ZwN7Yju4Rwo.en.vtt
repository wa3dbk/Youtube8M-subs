00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.379
 hi friends this is a headphone review 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.840
 philips model s hl 3000 let's now 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.550
 print these headphones look at their 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.519
 let's see what material they are from 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:20.210
 made to listen and put in the first 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.210
 impressed with headphones felix drove 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.960
 so let's open these headphones with me 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.730
 there is such a knife 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.730
 which we will hide the headphones 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:57.300
 the first thing we see is a guide 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:57.300
 user in English yes to 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:08.520
 different languages ​​but there is no Russian themselves 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.530
 headphones 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.410
 so here they are here so here philips 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.700
 This can be thrown here such 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.940
 philips headphones 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.940
 let's get them out 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.440
 it's possible 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.440
 got out 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.210
 so let's consider the philips headphones 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.190
 philips sh f3000 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.410
 these are overhead headphones with pretty 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.440
 big hours that will be a couple even 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.080
 for large auricles headphones 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.130
 made entirely of plastic and does not have 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.650
 no 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.340
 subway and wiry therefore use 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.430
 their strength I do not recommend headphones 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.930
 have a very bright cool design i 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.840
 I saw several color headphones 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.740
 shades it is dark blue turquoise 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.930
 blue 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.459
 like my standard white 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.230
 standard black here are ear cushions 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.530
 the headphones are very high quality 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.070
 they are very soft quite thin 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:24.239
 practical and no different from the skin 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.880
 but for those users who 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.340
 have more expensive headphone models 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.830
 Of course we feel the difference 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.530
 nothing remains but to listen to the sound 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:39.560
 these headphones and lay down your first 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.560
 impression of philips headphones 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.500
 philips headphones 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.510
 great headphones but they fit more 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.200
 for home use since 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.900
 have poor sound insulation from the pros i 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.819
 I can say a stylish design excellent 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.370
 bass and treble comfortable 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.810
 design and pleasant to the touch 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.880
 materials from the flaws this 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.190
 insufficient sound insulation flexible wire 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.140
 and a hard headband that can 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.190
 cause discomfort over time 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.410
 for the ears and the crown of the head well in general 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.099
 speaking philips headphones are great 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.829
 headphones 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.170
