00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.880
 holiday auteuil gate 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.460
 we are going to leave 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.880
 when we know what we have to do a little scared we have to look at what is left 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.599
 in the fridge my meeting with mick kinane green tomato jam 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:15.209
 you accompany lemon 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.880
 it seems that it's not bad at all the runner only has to make himself small 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.769
 bobos 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.739
 it serves very well 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.739
 go i'm going to get this man albert nanga parbat 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.909
 it had not looked at his destiny 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.840
 and again I took a few simple words 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.060
 so normally we'll have something to do 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.090
 I put them in the boiling water all in the air that plunges them into a bath 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.090
 of ice water and so we can take off easily 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.240
 I want to start with peeled tomatoes 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.890
 mbour for thursday 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.500
 Tuesday in the surface 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.270
 cold directly made then 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.670
 everyone is happy neighborhood and a year with a little spoon of glitch 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.290
 by the lemon 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.890
 we will cut into thin slices 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.270
 and we will use it like that by mixing with them goosebumps we go 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.180
 put that back 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.250
 so our lime 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.250
 nine time young people to lose with lemon 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.520
 in a bowl the jam dish that added 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.900
 for a kilo of fruit 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.790
 a kilogram of sugar gelling his cousins â€‹â€‹in Toulouse and then it goes away again 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.790
 is unifying sugar I guess this jam five minutes was enough 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.469
 not yet else it is necessary to count double investigation 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.860
 we are to be congratulated for peace 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.090
 while 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.210
 this minute 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.400
 we reached 35% and 5% 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.740
 it's this limit 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.810
 this minute 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.770
 it will be done 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.270
 so this year 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.920
 to see if the jam was successful he will do a test of the plate yes you 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.869
 commit 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.869
 here is a spoon in the plate 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.560
 we wait a little bit that it cool 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.600
 but when we plank 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.060
 it flows relatively slowly 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.680
 anyway it's not new 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.649
 taking into account the premises we will put in jars 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.649
 tomorrow 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.729
 been fulfilled 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.019
 up to two centimeters from the edge 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.019
 small to respect small drawings that come 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.529
 gfr 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:27.529
 and then we go back directly 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:32.459
 it was convenient what the site our misfortune + before traveling during the 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.040
 vacation 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.320
 but we can do it also at the end of the season you need more sun collar 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.389
 it smells like tomatoes do not lose weight 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.419
 everyone can get the tomatoes 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:41.959
 his failure
