 something we see often that tells us 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.620

 thyroid is taking a medication that 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.829
 it's called levothyroxine that in the USA 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.230
 called zinc troy of the same thing this your

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.490
 hypothyroidism I'm taking 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.330
 levothyroxine I have some months taking 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.780
 the chronicle of it keeps falling 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.760
 and my lack of motivation keeps telling me 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.980
 doctor who will regulate in a few months 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.380
 but I'm desperate can you 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.450
 help 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.130
 to friend Marta and all the people 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.229
 who suffer from the thyroid 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.509
 the problem of hypothyroidism is a 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.610
 epidemic , especially among women 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.829
 there are eight women there is statistics there 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.509
 eight women with thyroid problems 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.310
 for every man who has problems of 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.860
 thyroid so it's a problem 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.530
 mainly that affects women 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.020
 in previous episodes we talked about 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.200
 why it affects women more but but 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.520
 It is important that you know that the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.120
 medication that they are giving 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.280
 levothyroxine or without troy in the USA is a 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.000
 medication that is definitely going to 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.590
 fix the laboratories of what comes out 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.510
 in the laboratory test but it's not going to 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.399
 Fix hair loss and many times 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.560
 does not fix the depression and neither does 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.810
 helps to lose weight in explaining why 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.390
 it's like that think 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.370
 the problem of the thyroid when the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.260
 medicine treats it 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.849
 Well, what we have seen afterwards 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.379
 of many years of working with people 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:29.090
 who have problems of overweight is the 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.090
 hypothyroidism hypothyroidism 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.730
 it has to do with the thyroid gland 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.120
 the thyroid gland is here is a 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.230
 gland that produces 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.470
 a hormone called t4 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.640
 and that hormone t4 the body converts 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.680
 then on hormone t3 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:54.470
 the t4 is called t4 because it has four 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:58.710
 iodine atoms that are united 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.370
 well for an amino acid that is called 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.200
 tyrosine 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.660
 and it's called four because it has four 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.180
 atoms 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:12.760
 there is an enzyme called diaz and it is born 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.240
 an enzyme of the body that comes and it 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.240
 cut a piece to the t4 and converts it 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.090
 in 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.370
 of 3 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.239
 I already had three iodine atoms and now 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.370
 has three the t4 is an inactive hormone 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.319
 is a storage hormone is a 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.910
 hormone that produces the thyroid but that 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.430
 It is not a hormone that makes you lose weight 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.780
 to make her hair grow, so if 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.780
 you put your body on 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.750
 is not the active hormone is a hormone 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.780
 that could be active could be 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.060
 active if your body has the enzyme of 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.939
 audouin makes the converts of this 4 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.939
 t3 that passes the levothyroxine 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.400
 the belt 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.680
 these are synthetic medications that 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.310
 does the pharmaceutical drugs for 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.680
 the thyroid the only thing they are is hormones 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.549
 of 4 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.500
 they are not t3 and the doctor gives it to the 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.769
 person who has hypothyroidism under the 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.289
 hope that by giving the t4 the 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.090
 body somehow produce the 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.550
 ac audouin enzyme and convert it into 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.470
 t3 that activates when a person mona 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.419
 you have thyroid problems you are 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.949
 begins to fall hair and comb isle 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.020
 that there are lots of hair and goes to the bathroom and 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.240
 Dawn hair down and hands are 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.600
 cold the person gets depressed walks 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.639
 canada sleeps badly goes bad to the bathroom 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.410
 hands are cold which are cold the 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.330
 skin is dry loses interest in the 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.199
 sex and the person walks in general 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:50.740
 reluctant because the thyroid controls 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:52.090
 all thyroid body energy 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.830
 You could say it 's like the pedal 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.770
 body accelerator when he pulled her 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.660
 is loose is weak or the body spends 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.729
 the derby then when a person 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.650
 has hyperthyroidism and goes to the doctor and 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.110
 they detect hypothyroidism and they give 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.440
 levothyroxine without troy what are you 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.630
 giving the hormone medications t4 never 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.850
 this 3 this 4 synthetic 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.520
 and so low in the hope that his body 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.970
 can produce the audouin enzyme makes 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.650
 that turns 7 4 to 3 unfortunately 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.600
 that part is what does not happen in the 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.010
 most of the cases the experience that 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.900
 we have had with the book of 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.510
 Paul 's metabolism is that there is a 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.460
 chapter here that explains you the 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.570
 epidemic that there are with the problems of the 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.610
 Thyroid gland problems 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.680
 thyroid is called the chapter you will 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.500
 explains that what you feed the 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.720
 body has an effect on the thyroid 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.940
 and about your body's ability to 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.530
 produce that of audouin makes 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.300
 convert from 4 t3 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.100
 we have thousands and thousands of 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.040
 people who were taking 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.690
 levothyroxine or without troy they changed their 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.220
 nutrition to diet 2 for one to the 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.750
 diet three for one take we started to 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.420
 drink water instead of soda instead of 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.300
 juice and automatically the body is 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:05.390
 heated automatically the doctor had 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.490
 that reduce the dose of levothyroxine or 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.690
 of sintrom because because for now the 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.550
 ordinas enzyme has started to 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.560
 work when you feed your 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.780
 body your body has the ability to 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.390
 produce what you have to produce for 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.960
 convert the t4t 3 medication but 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.569
 with his body is wrong 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.150
 for more levothyroxine I intro and you 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:27.030
 that synthetic hormone is not going to 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.280
 convert to t 3 so that that tells you 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.580
 your doctor to wait a few months 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.409
 plus 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.080
 it's only for you to get tired of 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:37.750
 wait because there's hope in that 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.900
 That's why your hair is falling because nothing 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:45.770
 goes through nothing said the friend albert 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:48.229
 einstein said that stupidity 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.379
 and expect something to happen without one having 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:52.849
 changed nothing and I am very much 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:55.400
 according to that definition of stupidity 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:56.930
 that is, you can not expect to be left 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.759
 of falling hair to a person with 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.590
 problem of hypothyroidism if you have not 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:02.060
 changed nothing if you have not changed the 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.830
 nutrition if the 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.169
 hydration if you have not changed the 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.940
 vitamin deficiency there is no way to 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:10.819
 the body to produce biotin 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:15.340
 to convert from 4 t3 and this is what 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:15.340
 I comment because the truth always triumphs
