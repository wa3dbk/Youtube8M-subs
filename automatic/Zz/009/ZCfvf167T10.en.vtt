boy destroys a monster about it gets for
someone<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.560> despots<00:02:38.010> from<00:02:38.340> different<00:02:38.670> levels

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
someone to despots from different levels

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.990 
someone to despots from different levels
from<00:02:39.120> your<00:02:39.270> graveyard<00:02:39.510> or<00:02:39.810> hand<00:02:40.640> this<00:02:41.640> one<00:02:41.880> is

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
from your graveyard or hand this one is

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.490 
from your graveyard or hand this one is
a<00:02:42.030> pendulum<00:02:42.540> which<00:02:42.840> I'm<00:02:42.990> assuming<00:02:43.140> we're

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
a pendulum which I'm assuming we're

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.330 
a pendulum which I'm assuming we're
going<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.680> get<00:02:43.860> 006<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.120> other<00:02:45.300> pendulum

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
going to get 006 is the other pendulum

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.760 
going to get 006 is the other pendulum
and<00:02:47.340> then<00:02:47.490> mashina<00:02:47.910> lineup<00:02:48.810> basically<00:02:49.320> it

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
and then mashina lineup basically it

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.710 
and then mashina lineup basically it
works<00:02:50.100> really<00:02:50.430> well<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.850> dosbox<00:02:51.060> because<00:02:51.690> a

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
works really well the dosbox because a

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.510 
works really well the dosbox because a
lot<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:51.930> them<00:02:52.050> power<00:02:52.290> up<00:02:52.560> machines<00:02:53.160> and

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
lot of them power up machines and

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.060 
lot of them power up machines and
pushing<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.090> portrait<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.480> machine<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.230> lot<00:02:55.920> of

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
pushing a portrait of machine a lot of

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.910 
pushing a portrait of machine a lot of
times<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:57.150> just<00:02:57.330> have<00:02:57.510> desk<00:02:57.780> dead<00:02:58.200> dust<00:02:58.650> spots

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
times you just have desk dead dust spots

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.880 
times you just have desk dead dust spots
in<00:02:59.310> your<00:02:59.489> hands<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.530> you're<00:03:01.530> just<00:03:01.620> going<00:03:01.800> to

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
in your hands and you're just going to

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.680 
in your hands and you're just going to
discard<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.340> for<00:03:02.580> 2500<00:03:03.570> Peter<00:03:05.690> machine

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
discard it for 2500 Peter machine

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.570 
discard it for 2500 Peter machine
duplication<00:03:06.870> as<00:03:07.440> i<00:03:07.470> said<00:03:07.769> is<00:03:07.890> crazy<00:03:08.130> all<00:03:08.370> of

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
duplication as i said is crazy all of

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.020 
duplication as i said is crazy all of
them<00:03:08.640> are<00:03:08.790> 500<00:03:09.420> or<00:03:09.510> below<00:03:10.310> so<00:03:11.310> let's<00:03:11.670> just<00:03:11.760> say

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
them are 500 or below so let's just say

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.600 
them are 500 or below so let's just say
you<00:03:12.090> summoned<00:03:12.660> out<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.840> spot<00:03:13.260> 002<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.160> played

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
you summoned out a spot 002 and played

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.880 
you summoned out a spot 002 and played
machine<00:03:14.910> Duke<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.450> special<00:03:16.110> summon<00:03:16.440> two<00:03:16.680> more

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
machine Duke and special summon two more

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.750 
machine Duke and special summon two more
you<00:03:17.760> get<00:03:17.930> machine<00:03:18.930> dupe<00:03:19.320> which<00:03:20.160> would<00:03:20.459> summon

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
you get machine dupe which would summon

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.800 
you get machine dupe which would summon
the<00:03:20.850> other<00:03:21.000> two<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.390> then<00:03:21.510> when<00:03:21.630> there's

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
the other two and then when there's

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.420 
the other two and then when there's
special<00:03:22.170> summon<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.620> can<00:03:22.769> add<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:22.950> tough<00:03:23.190> spot

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
special summon you can add a tough spot

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.650 
special summon you can add a tough spot
so<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:23.970> get<00:03:24.060> two<00:03:24.330> searches<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:25.110> all<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.890> them

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
so you get two searches and all of them

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.560 
so you get two searches and all of them
all<00:03:27.660> other<00:03:28.019> machine-type<00:03:28.739> monsters<00:03:29.160> gain

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
all other machine-type monsters gain

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.730 
all other machine-type monsters gain
1000<00:03:30.570> because<00:03:30.750> if<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:30.989> have

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
1000 because if you have

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.910 
1000 because if you have
two<00:03:32.740> other<00:03:32.950> ones<00:03:33.280> so<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:35.260> DECA<00:03:35.470> is<00:03:35.650> really

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
two other ones so the DECA is really

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.090 
two other ones so the DECA is really
crazy<00:03:36.160> especially<00:03:37.020> say<00:03:38.020> you<00:03:38.080> just<00:03:38.410> go<00:03:38.560> machine

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
crazy especially say you just go machine

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.720 
crazy especially say you just go machine
do<00:03:39.400> desk<00:03:40.150> by<00:03:40.360> zero<00:03:40.630> zero<00:03:40.870> two<00:03:41.490> especially<00:03:42.490> when

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
do desk by zero zero two especially when

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.940 
do desk by zero zero two especially when
all<00:03:42.880> three<00:03:43.270> of<00:03:43.300> them<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:44.110> they<00:03:44.200> all<00:03:44.320> had<00:03:44.440> 15<00:03:44.770> or

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
all three of them and they all had 15 or

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.320 
all three of them and they all had 15 or
attack<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.550> you<00:03:45.670> play<00:03:45.850> limiter<00:03:46.210> removal

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
attack and you play limiter removal

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.430 
attack and you play limiter removal
that's<00:03:47.140> 3,000<00:03:47.710> 3,000<00:03:48.130> 3,000<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:48.850> a<00:03:49.630> total<00:03:50.200> of

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
that's 3,000 3,000 3,000 and a total of

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.750 
that's 3,000 3,000 3,000 and a total of
nine<00:03:52.500> thousand<00:03:53.500> so<00:03:53.740> that<00:03:54.100> alone<00:03:54.340> is<00:03:54.550> pretty

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
nine thousand so that alone is pretty

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.580 
nine thousand so that alone is pretty
crazy<00:03:55.060> so<00:03:55.930> tell<00:03:56.080> me<00:03:56.110> what<00:03:56.290> you<00:03:56.350> think<00:03:56.560> about

despots if you like it enough I'll do

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.930 
despots if you like it enough I'll do
some<00:03:59.110> duel<00:03:59.350> videos<00:03:59.740> with<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.130> it's<00:04:00.400> pretty<00:04:00.580> fun
