00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
didn't even realize there's based off of

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.569 
didn't even realize there's based off of
old<00:00:44.910> stuff<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> while<00:00:45.620> the<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:47.190> guys

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
old stuff for a while the you guys

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.160 
old stuff for a while the you guys
probably<00:00:47.969> told<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> ebony<00:00:48.629> helmet<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
probably told the ebony helmet the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.049 
probably told the ebony helmet the
fastest<00:00:49.590> that's<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.160> helmet<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:50.820> based

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
fastest that's what the helmet was based

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.590 
fastest that's what the helmet was based
off<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.300> before<00:00:52.170> being<00:00:52.469> read<00:00:52.739> textured<00:00:53.219> but

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
off of before being read textured but

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.970 
off of before being read textured but
now<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.629> know<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.110> was<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.469> took<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> longest

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
now I know that I was I took the longest

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.439 
now I know that I was I took the longest
to<00:00:56.250> realize<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.910> which<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.120> kind<00:00:57.420> of

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
to realize that that which is kind of

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.910 
to realize that that which is kind of
embarrassing<00:00:57.570> I'm<00:00:58.109> not<00:00:58.350> gonna<00:00:58.469> point<00:00:58.680> out<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
embarrassing I'm not gonna point out the
