right<00:00:22.140> now<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.320> iphone<00:00:22.740> 3gs<00:00:23.520> comes<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.570> at<00:00:24.750> 16

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
right now the iphone 3gs comes and at 16

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.150 
right now the iphone 3gs comes and at 16
gigabytes<00:00:25.739> or<00:00:26.009> 32<00:00:26.790> gigabytes<00:00:27.239> now<00:00:28.169> this<00:00:28.980> would

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
gigabytes or 32 gigabytes now this would

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.580 
gigabytes or 32 gigabytes now this would
bump<00:00:29.790> it<00:00:29.939> up<00:00:30.029> twice<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.660> capacity<00:00:30.779> i<00:00:31.140> think<00:00:31.470> we

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
bump it up twice the capacity i think we

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.130 
bump it up twice the capacity i think we
lose<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.919> 16<00:00:32.310> gig<00:00:32.460> mint<00:00:32.730> model<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.720> have<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
lose the 16 gig mint model so we have a

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.979 
lose the 16 gig mint model so we have a
lower<00:00:34.590> end<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:35.010> 32<00:00:35.850> gigabytes<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.480> higher<00:00:36.810> in

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
that were 120 gigabytes think about that

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.530

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
amount of storage and again think about

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.960 
amount of storage and again think about

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
rumor is might we see the screen of the

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.300 
rumor is might we see the screen of the
ipod<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.260> the<00:01:58.440> ipod<00:01:59.010> touch<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.820> stretched<00:02:00.390> to

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
ipod in the ipod touch be stretched to

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.890 
ipod in the ipod touch be stretched to
consume<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.490> entire<00:02:02.520> face<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.990> ipod<00:02:04.880> I

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
consume the entire face of the ipod I

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.559 
consume the entire face of the ipod I
think<00:02:06.900> that's<00:02:07.080> possibility<00:02:07.910> but<00:02:08.910> then<00:02:09.479> again

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
think that's possibility but then again

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.630 
think that's possibility but then again
the<00:02:09.810> home<00:02:09.989> button<00:02:10.200> would<00:02:10.379> be<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.459> don't

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the home button would be on and I don't

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.619 
the home button would be on and I don't
think<00:02:11.819> people<00:02:11.940> would<00:02:12.090> like<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.480> because

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
think people would like that because

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.050 
think people would like that because
that's<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.900> trademark<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.530> an<00:02:13.980> ipod<00:02:14.640> touch<00:02:14.880> or

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
that's a trademark of an ipod touch or

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.320 
that's a trademark of an ipod touch or
iphone<00:02:16.190> final<00:02:17.190> question<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.760> do<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.270> think

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
iphone final question is do you think

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.170 
iphone final question is do you think
we'll<00:02:18.570> see<00:02:18.780> these

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
we'll see these

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.649 
we'll see these
the<00:02:19.299> first<00:02:19.689> quarter<00:02:19.959> I<00:02:21.120> don't<00:02:22.120> personally

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
the first quarter I don't personally

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.520 
the first quarter I don't personally
think<00:02:23.019> so<00:02:23.879> Apple<00:02:24.879> usually<00:02:25.269> holds<00:02:25.629> their<00:02:25.900> ipod

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
think so Apple usually holds their ipod

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.089 
think so Apple usually holds their ipod
events<00:02:27.400> in<00:02:27.579> October<00:02:28.329> and<00:02:28.620> they<00:02:29.620> just<00:02:29.920> a

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
events in October and they just a

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.309 
events in October and they just a
updated<00:02:30.790> their<00:02:30.879> ipod<00:02:31.150> touches<00:02:31.510> in<00:02:31.599> October<00:02:32.079> so
