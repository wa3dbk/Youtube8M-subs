and you have to press left to crouch

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.770 
and you have to press left to crouch
because<00:01:08.870> you<00:01:08.930> automatically<00:01:09.560> walk<00:01:10.780> that's

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
because you automatically walk that's

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.030 
because you automatically walk that's
from<00:01:11.960> why<00:01:12.110> I<00:01:12.140> remember<00:01:12.290> you<00:01:12.530> automatically

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
from why I remember you automatically

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.410 
from why I remember you automatically
walk<00:01:13.340> or<00:01:13.490> something<00:01:13.610> like<00:01:13.910> that<00:01:13.970> if<00:01:14.330> i

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
walk or something like that if i

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.880 
walk or something like that if i
remember<00:01:14.570> right<00:01:14.840> it<00:01:15.110> doesn't<00:01:15.590> really<00:01:15.770> make

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
remember right it doesn't really make

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.920 
remember right it doesn't really make
much<00:01:15.950> sense<00:01:16.130> all<00:01:17.120> right<00:01:17.240> as<00:01:17.330> you<00:01:17.360> can't<00:01:17.780> I

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
much sense all right as you can't I

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.150 
much sense all right as you can't I
guess<00:01:18.080> you<00:01:18.200> can't<00:01:18.410> move<00:01:18.470> backwards<00:01:18.980> and

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
guess you can't move backwards and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.500 
guess you can't move backwards and
that's<00:01:19.280> what<00:01:19.430> it<00:01:19.520> is<00:01:19.550> yeah<00:01:20.120> you<00:01:20.180> can't<00:01:20.420> move

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
that's what it is yeah you can't move

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.720 
that's what it is yeah you can't move
backwards<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:21.260> that's<00:01:21.440> why<00:01:21.560> they<00:01:21.680> did<00:01:21.830> that<00:01:21.860> so

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
backwards so that's why they did that so

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.130 
backwards so that's why they did that so
yeah<00:01:22.970> but<00:01:23.180> just<00:01:23.330> look<00:01:23.450> at<00:01:23.540> all<00:01:23.570> this<00:01:23.780> shit<00:01:24.020> that

pick that up but only if you actually
crouch<00:01:47.930> to<00:01:48.110> pick<00:01:48.230> it<00:01:48.320> up<00:01:48.410> which<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.680> game

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
crouch to pick it up which the game

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.970 
crouch to pick it up which the game
doesn't<00:01:48.980> tell<00:01:49.190> you<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.500> let<00:01:51.710> me<00:01:51.830> try<00:01:51.950> this

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
doesn't tell you and you let me try this

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.830 
doesn't tell you and you let me try this
shield<00:01:52.340> here

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.270 

because<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.560> shield<00:01:58.799> does<00:01:58.890> not<00:01:59.039> protect

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
because the shield does not protect

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.200 
because the shield does not protect
against<00:01:59.549> well<00:02:00.590> yeah<00:02:01.789> if<00:02:02.789> she'll<00:02:02.969> doesn't

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
against well yeah if she'll doesn't

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:11.390 
against well yeah if she'll doesn't
protect<00:02:03.450> against<00:02:03.719> getting<00:02:03.929> hit<00:02:04.079> by<00:02:04.109> ships<00:02:10.400> so

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
protect against getting hit by ships so

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.680 
protect against getting hit by ships so
it<00:02:11.489> does<00:02:11.640> work<00:02:11.670> for<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> short<00:02:12.360> period<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.599> time

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
it does work for a short period of time

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.180 
it does work for a short period of time
then<00:02:13.019> but<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.530> can't<00:02:13.739> activate<00:02:14.069> it

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
then but you can't activate it

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.229 
then but you can't activate it
constantly<00:02:14.549> you<00:02:14.640> can<00:02:14.730> only<00:02:14.819> activate<00:02:15.060> it

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
constantly you can only activate it

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.710 
constantly you can only activate it
every<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.510> often<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.730> these<00:02:18.120> kind<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.510> Auto

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
every so often and these kind of Auto

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.940 
every so often and these kind of Auto
track<00:02:19.080> as<00:02:19.200> long<00:02:19.319> as<00:02:19.410> you're<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.650> general

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.770 
track as long as you're in the general
area<00:02:20.099> which<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.730> guess<00:02:20.879> makes<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.299> at<00:02:21.450> least<00:02:21.599> a

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
area which I guess makes that at least a

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.020 
area which I guess makes that at least a
little<00:02:21.900> bit<00:02:22.049> easier<00:02:22.200> but<00:02:22.950> still<00:02:23.220> it's<00:02:23.879> wait

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
little bit easier but still it's wait

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.580 
little bit easier but still it's wait
till<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.209> get<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.450> actual<00:02:24.720> dual<00:02:25.049> levels

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
till I get to the actual dual levels

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.380
