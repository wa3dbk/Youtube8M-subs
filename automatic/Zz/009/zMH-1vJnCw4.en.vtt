00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
little story that happened a long time

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.210 
little story that happened a long time
ago<00:00:05.130> it<00:00:05.700> was<00:00:06.000> actually<00:00:06.330> four<00:00:06.569> years<00:00:06.600> ago<00:00:06.899> and

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
ago it was actually four years ago and

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.799 
ago it was actually four years ago and
yeah<00:00:08.220> so<00:00:08.460> this<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.970> runescape<00:00:09.240> memories

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
yeah so this is the runescape memories

yeah so this is the runescape memories
number<00:00:10.170> five<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.559> believe<00:00:10.769> so<00:00:11.250> yeah<00:00:11.400> it's

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
number five I believe so yeah it's

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.150 
number five I believe so yeah it's
basically<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:12.120> memory<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:13.110> burn<00:00:13.679> scape<00:00:13.950> of

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
basically a memory of a burn scape of

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.910 
basically a memory of a burn scape of
when<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.849> got<00:00:15.059> my<00:00:15.179> first<00:00:15.360> rare<00:00:15.690> drop<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.470> my

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
when I got my first rare drop in my

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.800 
when I got my first rare drop in my
entire<00:00:17.190> career<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:18.029> game<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.330> guess<00:00:18.630> you

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
entire career on this game I guess you

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.140 
entire career on this game I guess you
could<00:00:18.960> say<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.170> career<00:00:19.619> but<00:00:20.160> playtime<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.029> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
could say a career but playtime and the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.490 
could say a career but playtime and the
reason<00:00:21.359> why<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.480> thought<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.900> doing<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.230> video

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
reason why I thought of doing this video

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.410 
reason why I thought of doing this video
is<00:00:22.710> because<00:00:23.070> my<00:00:23.220> friend<00:00:23.490> JJ<00:00:23.730> rocker<00:00:24.119> who's

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
is because my friend JJ rocker who's

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.080 
is because my friend JJ rocker who's
actually<00:00:24.600> panning<00:00:25.170> me<00:00:25.260> right<00:00:25.439> now<00:00:25.560> or<00:00:25.710> was<00:00:26.090> he

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
actually panning me right now or was he

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.820 
actually panning me right now or was he
got<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> dragon<00:00:27.570> pickaxe<00:00:27.990> earlier<00:00:28.380> that

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
just get my own and I was kind of

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.859 
just get my own and I was kind of
confident<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.770> could<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.220> eventually

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
confident that I could get it eventually

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.850 
confident that I could get it eventually
so<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.930> did<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.200> quest<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.740> was

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
so I did that quest and that was

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.880 
so I did that quest and that was
forgiveness<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.610> cast<00:01:33.030> worth<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:34.740> was

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
forgiveness of a cast worth and that was

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.440 
forgiveness of a cast worth and that was
actually<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.250> really<00:01:35.369> high<00:01:35.549> requirement<00:01:36.210> quest

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
actually a really high requirement quest

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.030 
actually a really high requirement quest
at<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> time<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.049> was<00:01:37.170> pretty<00:01:37.350> new<00:01:37.530> like

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
at the time that was pretty new like

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.039 
at the time that was pretty new like
that<00:01:38.070> quest<00:01:38.490> came<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.850> think<00:01:39.240> September<00:01:39.509> 20

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
that quest came out I think September 20

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.940 
that quest came out I think September 20
or<00:01:40.680> 2009<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:42.329> January<00:01:42.840> 2<00:01:43.049> 2010<00:01:43.740> so

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
or 2009 and this was January 2 2010 so

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.190 
or 2009 and this was January 2 2010 so

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
it was only a few months old so I did

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.260 
it was only a few months old so I did
manage<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.530> do<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.579> went<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> Chaos

Bandos<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.619> wasn't<00:02:04.979> extremely<00:02:05.399> rich<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.700> mean

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
Bandos so I wasn't extremely rich I mean

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.270 
Bandos so I wasn't extremely rich I mean
that<00:02:05.969> was<00:02:06.119> okay<00:02:06.810> money<00:02:07.020> back<00:02:07.229> then<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:07.680> I

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that was okay money back then but I

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.919 
that was okay money back then but I
wasn't<00:02:08.819> like<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.060> richest<00:02:09.330> person<00:02:09.450> ever<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:09.899> I

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
wasn't like the richest person ever so I

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.420 
wasn't like the richest person ever so I
couldn't<00:02:10.259> even<00:02:10.349> afford<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.800> dragon<00:02:11.099> pickaxe

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
couldn't even afford a dragon pickaxe

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.930 
couldn't even afford a dragon pickaxe
and<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.790> was<00:02:11.879> twelve<00:02:12.150> mil<00:02:12.360> at<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.569> time<00:02:12.750> I

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
and it was twelve mil at the time I

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.110 
and it was twelve mil at the time I
remember<00:02:13.180> was<00:02:13.330> 12.1<00:02:14.050> nil<00:02:14.320> on<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:15.040> GE<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.850> was

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
remember was 12.1 nil on the GE so I was

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.120 
remember was 12.1 nil on the GE so I was
quite<00:02:16.360> determined<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:17.110> actually<00:02:17.890> get<00:02:18.040> that

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
quite determined to actually get that

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.160 
quite determined to actually get that
job<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.700> was<00:02:18.820> there<00:02:19.120> for<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.330> good<00:02:19.480> 5<00:02:19.780> hours

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
job so I was there for a good 5 hours

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.660 
job so I was there for a good 5 hours
the<00:02:20.200> first<00:02:20.530> day<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:20.740> finished<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.190> quest<00:02:21.430> I

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
the first day I finished the quest I

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.850 
the first day I finished the quest I
didn't<00:02:22.270> get<00:02:22.360> anything<00:02:22.570> I<00:02:22.810> got<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.960> few<00:02:23.200> hit<00:02:23.230> hand

didn't get anything I got a few hit hand
cannons<00:02:24.220> back<00:02:24.400> then<00:02:24.580> they<00:02:24.730> were<00:02:24.790> like<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.120> few

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
cannons back then they were like a few

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.720 
cannons back then they were like a few
hundred<00:02:25.690> K<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:25.870> they<00:02:26.530> were<00:02:26.590> still<00:02:26.860> cool<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.580> get

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
hundred K so they were still cool to get

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.480 
hundred K so they were still cool to get
but<00:02:28.420> no<00:02:29.110> luck<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.500> pickaxe<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.130> I<00:02:30.160> just

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
but no luck in the pickaxe so I just

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.440 
but no luck in the pickaxe so I just
gave<00:02:31.090> up

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
gave up

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.020 
gave up
and<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:31.780> came<00:02:31.990> back<00:02:32.020> a<00:02:32.200> few<00:02:32.590> days<00:02:32.710> later<00:02:32.770> and<00:02:33.250> I

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
and I came back a few days later and I

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.670 
and I came back a few days later and I
was<00:02:34.300> very<00:02:34.510> very<00:02:34.690> confident<00:02:35.380> that<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.530> would

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
was very very confident that I would

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.620 
was very very confident that I would
finally<00:02:35.920> get<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:36.850> kept<00:02:37.210> on<00:02:37.330> staying

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
finally get it so I kept on staying

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.570

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
there for more hours and I think it was

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.090 
there for more hours and I think it was
another<00:02:39.850> 6<00:02:40.300> hours<00:02:40.510> until<00:02:40.990> I<00:02:41.170> finally<00:02:41.590> got<00:02:41.950> the

weapons<00:04:31.180> maybe<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:31.720> God<00:04:31.930> sword<00:04:32.230> or<00:04:32.440> two<00:04:32.590> well

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
weapons maybe a God sword or two well

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.130 
weapons maybe a God sword or two well
not<00:04:33.610> two<00:04:33.790> probably<00:04:34.180> like<00:04:34.450> half<00:04:34.630> of<00:04:34.780> God's<00:04:34.960> or

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
not two probably like half of God's or

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.690 
not two probably like half of God's or
back<00:04:35.380> then<00:04:35.590> I<00:04:35.620> mean<00:04:35.740> you<00:04:36.070> got<00:04:36.460> to<00:04:36.580> consider

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
back then I mean you got to consider

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.690 
back then I mean you got to consider
back<00:04:37.060> then<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.860> banjo<00:04:38.860> Scott<00:04:39.100> sword<00:04:39.370> was<00:04:39.550> like

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
back then a banjo Scott sword was like

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.910 
back then a banjo Scott sword was like
28<00:04:40.150> mil<00:04:40.480> at<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.780> time<00:04:40.990> so<00:04:41.260> that<00:04:41.530> just<00:04:41.740> shows

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
28 mil at the time so that just shows

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.500 
28 mil at the time so that just shows
how<00:04:42.070> much<00:04:42.210> different<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.300> prices<00:04:43.660> were<00:04:43.780> so<00:04:44.620> I

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
how much different the prices were so I

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.820 
how much different the prices were so I
was<00:04:46.510> gonna<00:04:46.630> put<00:04:46.870> it<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:47.140> good<00:04:47.170> use<00:04:47.290> and<00:04:47.710> maybe

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
was gonna put it to good use and maybe

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.540 
was gonna put it to good use and maybe
get<00:04:48.130> like<00:04:48.550> a<00:04:48.790> banjo<00:04:49.120> Scott<00:04:49.450> sword<00:04:49.750> and

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
get like a banjo Scott sword and

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.740 
get like a banjo Scott sword and
eventually<00:04:51.550> upgrade<00:04:51.850> to<00:04:52.060> maybe<00:04:52.300> a<00:04:52.420> saradomin

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
eventually upgrade to maybe a saradomin

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.180 
eventually upgrade to maybe a saradomin

and I mined the gem rocks for a good
week<00:05:07.120> straight<00:05:07.510> and<00:05:07.720> I<00:05:07.870> made<00:05:08.080> like<00:05:08.320> a<00:05:08.380> lot<00:05:08.710> of

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
week straight and I made like a lot of

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.800

was pretty cool to get that drop and I

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.630 
was pretty cool to get that drop and I
still<00:05:32.590> remember<00:05:32.710> that<00:05:32.890> drop<00:05:33.220> because<00:05:33.430> it<00:05:33.550> was

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
still remember that drop because it was

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.450 
still remember that drop because it was
my<00:05:33.970> first<00:05:34.150> like<00:05:34.390> rare<00:05:34.660> drop<00:05:34.960> that<00:05:35.110> was<00:05:35.460> really

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
my first like rare drop that was really

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.340 
my first like rare drop that was really
expensive<00:05:36.760> like<00:05:37.180> granted<00:05:37.900> I've<00:05:38.020> I've<00:05:38.320> had

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
expensive like granted I've I've had

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.980 
expensive like granted I've I've had
whips<00:05:38.740> at<00:05:38.980> that<00:05:39.250> point<00:05:39.520> before<00:05:39.730> because<00:05:40.600> there

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
whips at that point before because there

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.210 
whips at that point before because there
might<00:05:41.170> be<00:05:41.200> another<00:05:41.470> story<00:05:41.770> I<00:05:41.830> might<00:05:42.040> talk

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
might be another story I might talk

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.790 
might be another story I might talk
about<00:05:42.250> to<00:05:42.640> where<00:05:42.880> I<00:05:43.150> camped<00:05:43.900> abyssal<00:05:44.500> demons

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
about to where I camped abyssal demons

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.230 
about to where I camped abyssal demons
for<00:05:45.040> like<00:05:45.190> I<00:05:45.400> don't<00:05:45.550> really<00:05:45.700> know<00:05:45.880> how<00:05:46.060> many

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
for like I don't really know how many

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.940 
for like I don't really know how many
kills<00:05:46.450> but<00:05:46.630> maybe<00:05:46.780> for<00:05:47.050> four<00:05:47.650> or<00:05:47.800> five

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
kills but maybe for four or five

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.070 
kills but maybe for four or five
thousand<00:05:48.460> it<00:05:48.910> was<00:05:48.970> before<00:05:49.180> infernal<00:05:49.750> ashes

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
thousand it was before infernal ashes

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.510 
thousand it was before infernal ashes
even<00:05:50.170> came<00:05:50.500> out<00:05:50.650> and<00:05:50.860> I<00:05:50.950> think<00:05:51.010> I<00:05:51.220> got<00:05:51.370> like

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
even came out and I think I got like

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.550 
even came out and I think I got like
nine<00:05:51.880> whips<00:05:52.180> or<00:05:52.390> something<00:05:52.750> so<00:05:53.020> obviously

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
nine whips or something so obviously

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.440 
nine whips or something so obviously
those<00:05:53.830> drops<00:05:54.190> added<00:05:54.550> up<00:05:54.670> to<00:05:54.850> be<00:05:54.880> more<00:05:55.240> than

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
those drops added up to be more than

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.030 
those drops added up to be more than
dragon<00:05:55.780> pickaxes<00:05:56.320> but<00:05:56.530> it<00:05:56.650> wasn't<00:05:56.920> like<00:05:57.010> a

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
dragon pickaxes but it wasn't like a

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.650 
dragon pickaxes but it wasn't like a
single<00:05:57.310> drop<00:05:57.610> that<00:05:57.790> was<00:05:57.910> like<00:05:58.030> 12<00:05:58.270> mil<00:05:58.480> that's

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
single drop that was like 12 mil that's

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.810 
single drop that was like 12 mil that's
why<00:05:58.810> I<00:05:58.840> remember<00:05:59.380> I<00:05:59.440> remembered<00:05:59.950> it<00:06:00.100> and<00:06:00.280> in

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
why I remember I remembered it and in

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.400 
why I remember I remembered it and in
the<00:06:00.940> comments<00:06:01.360> I<00:06:01.480> want<00:06:01.720> to<00:06:01.810> have<00:06:02.110> you<00:06:02.230> guys

you know stuck with me yeah I think that

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.120 
you know stuck with me yeah I think that

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
concludes that memory but before I go

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.740 
concludes that memory but before I go
the<00:06:24.490> reason<00:06:24.700> why<00:06:24.820> I'm<00:06:24.910> doing<00:06:24.970> Ivy<00:06:25.420> right<00:06:25.600> now<00:06:25.720> I

the reason why I'm doing Ivy right now I

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.850 
the reason why I'm doing Ivy right now I
don't<00:06:25.900> think<00:06:26.020> I<00:06:26.170> discussed<00:06:26.590> this<00:06:26.710> in<00:06:26.830> the

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
don't think I discussed this in the

the first statue so I do have the comp
requirement<00:06:33.430> done<00:06:33.580> but<00:06:34.300> you<00:06:34.480> have<00:06:34.630> to<00:06:34.780> do<00:06:34.870> 32

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
requirement done but you have to do 32

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.950 
requirement done but you have to do 32
weeks<00:06:35.680> apparently<00:06:36.490> for<00:06:36.700> trim<00:06:36.910> but<00:06:37.570> the<00:06:37.810> thing

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
weeks apparently for trim but the thing

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.080 
weeks apparently for trim but the thing
is<00:06:38.110> you<00:06:38.290> don't<00:06:38.380> have<00:06:38.560> to<00:06:38.710> wait<00:06:38.890> weekly<00:06:39.340> at<00:06:39.520> the

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
is you don't have to wait weekly at the

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.930 
is you don't have to wait weekly at the
point<00:06:40.360> so<00:06:40.930> you<00:06:40.990> could<00:06:41.199> do<00:06:41.350> like<00:06:41.650> 32<00:06:42.280> statues<00:06:42.790> in

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
point so you could do like 32 statues in

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.129 
point so you could do like 32 statues in
a<00:06:43.000> week<00:06:43.150> if<00:06:43.300> you<00:06:43.330> really<00:06:43.630> wanted<00:06:43.870> to<00:06:43.960> and
