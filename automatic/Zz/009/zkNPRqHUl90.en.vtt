 new nail design for you and that of 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.600
 the essence tradition fairytale 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.900
 very much inspired with dust 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.120
 very sparkling yes just totally 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.000
 beautiful in the sunlight that sparkles 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.860
 really really great just that 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.540
 Pictures below in the infobox then you 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.550
 I have them extra for you 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.930
 made 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.520
 it is also very easy and very 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.129
 very fast it is not great now 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.280
 creative or resourceful but for that 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.080
 very effective and easy too 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.140
 a bit so wintery so now so im 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.659
 winter is fairy tale time really great 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.460
 and I just hope you enjoy it 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.800
 This nail design I would be happy 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.690
 if you stay tuned right up 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.400
 it will be done when it's done 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.530
 also relatively fast 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.920
 we do not need much tools for that 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.960
 you just have to think about that 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.510
 spend ten minutes applying the nail polish 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.369
 Dries relatively quickly through the is 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.140
 one of my favorite nail polishes with 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.149
 which I have corrected here for a long time 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.020
 lost in my box 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:30.270
 that is such a flier kram fits find 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.549
 I am now wonderful in the wind 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.640
 very covered but still such a small one 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.250
 color with it I have the nails 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.960
 already painted two layers then is 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.479
 the whole covering and also wonderful 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.109
 dried quickly and then take 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.950
 I take this cliff lake from the fairy tale 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:51.179
 essence limited edition the exact 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.520
 product list what i have used 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:58.079
 you can find it again in the infobox below 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.719
 linked and the light I take now 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.100
 and peel it off well on the bottle 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.039
 So it's hardly supposed to be 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.469
 nail polish on the brush are really very 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.890
 very little and then I take the 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.410
 just and dab the or 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.840
 because down here just up to 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.240
 middle down and spread the so on 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.370
 So a little bit should be just like that 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.500
 be of glitter so that's what I do 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.840
 Now I'm back in the songs 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.130
 bottle purely touches as a bit off 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.290
 but really 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.920
 still very little on the brush is like 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.840
 you see here then I start again from 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.680
 downstairs and she does that a bit 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.270
 high and spread that so that one 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.280
 really just such a light clips 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.750
 effect and the nail polish is not great 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.490
 is covering because that is actually 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.950
 cover relatively well 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.300
 so it would look from I do now 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.920
 again as he really is with everyone 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.900
 again in the nail polish bottle 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.510
 because of course he never goes that much 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.050
 I've got it back on my nail 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.790
 above 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.100
 it was a bit more like that now 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.620
 You see, that's not so bad 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.120
 many scatter their glitter dust 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.590
 I do not think so regularly 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.750
 you know how great that shimmers so 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.120
 I think that's really great that the 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.710
 Nail polishes are very nice on completely 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.240
 I did not like her finger but me 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.640
 I already used it for earrings 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.200
 to decorate with that you'll see soon 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:31.940
 I 've already seen that I still remember 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.940
 Not at all, here we do that too 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.990
 and then we are almost done with 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.480
 then we do the first shift 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.490
 the same again with this darker one 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.410
 nail polish the first a bit of skiing 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.770
 Radien sets are now almost once again 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:54.470
 as a staircase down here exactly 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:04:00.990
 Strike the same principle well on the nail 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:02.520
 on the nail at the bottle and then easy 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.030
 top up a bit down here 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.130
 but not quite as high as the bright one 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.780
 but a little less 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.180
 you see now is it here still such a 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.580
 a little bit darker it should just be one 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.290
 beautiful grid pattern emerge 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.290
 We'll do that here too 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.540
 and in the sun I already have it 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.960
 in the sun the others take pictures 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.170
 already done is the sparkles wonderful 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.440
 So that's really nice 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.880
 really so much dust you have to be moderate 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.010
 be sure to look at the pictures 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.670
 So I totally put on the blog 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.510
 Great 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:46.240
 that's what we already have 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:50.650
 So that crisp is far enough here 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.890
 your sparkle sparkle are pretty good now 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.190
 yes in valve motiv songs very nice if 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.810
 I like stars like that here 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.120
 they are in such a round 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.670
 Ding in it I mean at theben 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.190
 I bought and we put it now 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.960
 still on here I have her on the 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.000
 on the right side here I will take you to the 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.420
 we put the left side for that 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.300
 Clear varnish and brush over the fingers 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:21.600
 And we also need a toothpick 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:25.480
 to take in the stars here they are 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:31.680
 so you just paint with the clear lacquer 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.680
 with the top coat over the nail cloudy 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:39.130
 take a star with our fans week 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:43.300
 on and put the top on the left 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.950
 page and then we go with the top 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:50.170
 coat over the nail again 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:51.700
 fix and then it is almost 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.010
 finished and still has to go through a while 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.220
 dry the paints but all dry 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.780
 very fast that I used so 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.060
 that is a relatively easy fast 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:05.580
 But it is a very effective nail 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.580
 unite here again the same 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:18.240
 on top of that press a little bit firmly 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.599
 over and over again clear over it 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.240
 that is sealed well 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:26.839
 So what are we doing the last 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.839
 two fingers 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.490
 That may not be very creative 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.919
 or now the super mega demanding 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:50.900
 nail design but it is really total 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:52.340
 nice as the last finger and then are 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.919
 we already finished so I have to 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.949
 say that was really ratzeputz now 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:59.870
 I do not even have you all else 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:02.630
 I'm always just showing you 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:07.040
 I made a nail almost 4 now 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:14.180
 and I'm done faster than when 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:15.650
 I only once so thumb I have 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.979
 here already done because that always one 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:21.560
 it's a bit difficult so my dear 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:22.970
 the nail design done it i hope so 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.430
 I liked it I think it's totally 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:28.250
 nice sparkles I have sparkles 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.810
