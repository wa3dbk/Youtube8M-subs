00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
 good two others my name is rami and 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.830
 welcome to another video 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.190
 I bring you a round of a game 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.220
 fast 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.980
 but good news as you see the 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.510
 title let's talk about the movie 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.949
 lake word for those who do not know it 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:23.060
 there is a movie still or rather a 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:26.190
 project since 2007 on about 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.110
 the movie of gears of war 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.990
 what happens is that unfortunately 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.740
 there were a lot of problems about this 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.010
 peli for example in 2007 the company new 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.110
 line cinema that he left and left aside the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.660
 project vale left aside that software 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.770
 so to focus on the hobbit of 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.750
 Peter Jackson The Hobbit is the prequel 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.110
 of the Lord of the Rings' in case you do not 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.890
 you knew then in new line cinema then 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:00.089
 left aside here is the movie equal and 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.110
 well that happened in 2007 but in the 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.659
 year 2010 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.120
 there was another problem was that he in 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.340
 wissmann the person who was in charge of 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.580
 the address then also decided 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.140
 abandon the gears of war project 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.820
 so good now with this little 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.700
 news that I have read 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.400
 It seems that now things are coming back 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.310
 to move a bit and finally 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.160
 in principle the script would be stuart 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.010
 beattie famous for the movies of 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.060
 pirates of the Caribbean 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.140
 collateral 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.090
 and good apart from the script too 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.899
 I would have the advice of epic 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.600
 games unfortunately without clicks vi 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:47.200
 simple plessis that because ad 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.260
 If you do not know, he left the pickens studio 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.560
 two weeks ago or so more or less 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.020
 this is the news during the movies 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.020
 next weeks creative artist agency 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.780
 what is the company that has been done with 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.340
 the rights of the franchise because it has 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.320
 planned to meet with the producers 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.050
 to talk about the project and get down 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.560
 to the work of increase you do not know anything 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.560
 OK 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.500
 Any news I know that comes out 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.080
 I'll upload it, it's worth it because 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.050
 movie to me personally I like me 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.170
 would like to see her since her website is a 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.560
 I will play in capital letters and fine 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.720
 true 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.480
 although good is on the one hand if by a 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.140
 part I do not explain this and the opinion 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.510
 mine is worth 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.270
 most movies based on 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.630
 video games are usually worth shit 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.050
 this is so I do not know why but look for 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.990
 example 'dragon ball' and psoe are mother 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.230
 mine that descojone another case would be for 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.770
 example the recent movie and bolt that 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.690
 it's hardly related to the video game 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.989
 yes it is true that there are zombies that 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.270
 name in some characters but I do not know 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.910
 I do not see him almost no relationship with 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.580
 the video game finally this his opinion me 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.860
 You have commented what you think 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.490
 the software movie that you would like 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.250
 watch it in movies 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.860
 I say yes if I find any 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.650
 news about the movie 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.630
 I will go up and nothing has been all 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.080
 I hope you liked it we'll see you in 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.080
