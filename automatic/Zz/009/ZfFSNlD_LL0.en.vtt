also<00:01:21.140> one<00:01:21.530> that<00:01:21.710> spawns<00:01:22.040> under<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.610> bridge<00:01:23.000> a

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
also one that spawns under the bridge a

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.850 
also one that spawns under the bridge a
bit<00:01:23.360> further<00:01:23.600> up<00:01:23.750> and<00:01:24.049> you<00:01:24.380> want<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.650> check

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
bit further up and you want to check

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.770 
bit further up and you want to check
that<00:01:24.890> as<00:01:25.190> well<00:01:25.369> because<00:01:25.729> that<00:01:26.000> is<00:01:26.150> a<00:01:26.180> populist

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
that as well because that is a populist

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.690 
that as well because that is a populist
born<00:01:27.049> now<00:01:27.500> this<00:01:27.680> farming<00:01:28.070> technique<00:01:28.490> is

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
born now this farming technique is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.609 
born now this farming technique is
really<00:01:29.060> good<00:01:29.210> because<00:01:29.360> they<00:01:29.630> spawn<00:01:29.960> extremely

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
really good because they spawn extremely

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.980 
really good because they spawn extremely
fast<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.430> once<00:01:31.610> you've<00:01:31.790> completed<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.479> circle

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
fast so once you've completed the circle

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.870 
fast so once you've completed the circle
you<00:01:33.320> can<00:01:33.470> go<00:01:33.650> around<00:01:33.799> again<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.460> then

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
you can go around again and then

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.580 
you can go around again and then
complete<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.390> once<00:01:35.570> again<00:01:35.869> now<00:01:36.020> sometimes

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
complete it once again now sometimes

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.830 
complete it once again now sometimes
they're<00:01:36.799> also<00:01:36.950> can<00:01:37.369> be<00:01:37.400> an<00:01:37.729> event<00:01:38.299> that<00:01:38.390> spawns

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
they're also can be an event that spawns

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.690 
they're also can be an event that spawns
there<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:39.500> if<00:01:39.590> you're<00:01:39.740> doing<00:01:40.010> this<00:01:40.280> farming

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.850 
there so if you're doing this farming
technique<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:41.330> vent<00:01:41.869> spawns<00:01:42.229> you<00:01:42.680> may

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
technique and the vent spawns you may

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.980 
technique and the vent spawns you may
possibly<00:01:43.130> get<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.549> legendary<00:01:44.119> item<00:01:44.600> from<00:01:44.780> that

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
if you defeat the boss so you can always

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.850 
if you defeat the boss so you can always
do<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.180> as<00:01:47.360> well<00:01:47.390> just<00:01:48.080> an<00:01:48.200> add-on<00:01:48.409> in<00:01:48.740> the

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
do that as well just an add-on in the

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.830 
do that as well just an add-on in the
area<00:01:49.189> which<00:01:49.310> is<00:01:49.460> pretty<00:01:49.640> awesome<00:01:49.850> we<00:01:50.420> actually

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
area which is pretty awesome we actually

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.570 
area which is pretty awesome we actually
had<00:01:51.110> one<00:01:51.140> drop<00:01:51.650> while<00:01:51.860> we<00:01:52.040> were<00:01:52.130> doing<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.430> as

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
had one drop while we were doing it as

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.460 
had one drop while we were doing it as
well<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:52.970> I<00:01:53.150> ended<00:01:53.360> up<00:01:53.479> getting<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.869> legendary

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
well and I ended up getting a legendary

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.920 
well and I ended up getting a legendary
item<00:01:55.189> from<00:01:55.430> it<00:01:55.580> as<00:01:55.700> well<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:56.210> this<00:01:56.330> method<00:01:56.810> is

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
item from it as well so this method is

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.780 
item from it as well so this method is
extremely<00:01:57.650> good<00:01:57.860> and<00:01:58.070> it<00:01:58.159> is<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.310> lot<00:01:58.549> better

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
extremely good and it is a lot better

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.640 
extremely good and it is a lot better
than<00:01:58.970> going<00:01:59.119> to<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.420> alternative<00:01:59.840> which<00:02:00.439> is

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
than going to the alternative which is

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.499 
than going to the alternative which is
going<00:02:00.979> to<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.220> right<00:02:01.430> and<00:02:01.700> looking<00:02:02.240> for<00:02:02.390> them

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
going to the right and looking for them

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.420 
going to the right and looking for them
individually<00:02:02.689> when<00:02:03.500> doing<00:02:03.860> this<00:02:03.979> method

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
individually when doing this method

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.039 
individually when doing this method
you'll<00:02:04.549> get<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.759> lot<00:02:05.030> more<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.479> think<00:02:05.900> I've<00:02:06.020> got

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
you'll get a lot more I think I've got

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.740 
you'll get a lot more I think I've got
around<00:02:06.409> 30<00:02:06.740> or<00:02:06.920> 40<00:02:07.340> in<00:02:07.490> about<00:02:08.000> maybe<00:02:08.209> five<00:02:08.390> to

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
around 30 or 40 in about maybe five to

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.359 
around 30 or 40 in about maybe five to
ten<00:02:08.959> minutes<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.379> you<00:02:09.409> get<00:02:09.619> quite<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:09.950> lot<00:02:10.069> if

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
ten minutes so you get quite a lot if

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.670 
ten minutes so you get quite a lot if
you<00:02:10.729> do<00:02:10.879> get<00:02:11.090> lucky<00:02:11.420> now<00:02:11.750> spirit<00:02:12.260> blooms<00:02:12.530> are

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
you do get lucky now spirit blooms are

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.589 
you do get lucky now spirit blooms are
mainly<00:02:12.860> used<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.310> upgrade<00:02:13.459> legendary<00:02:14.180> armor

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
mainly used to upgrade legendary armor

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.750 
mainly used to upgrade legendary armor
so<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:14.840> can<00:02:14.959> upgrade<00:02:15.110> your<00:02:15.349> power<00:02:15.769> as<00:02:16.099> well<00:02:16.610> as

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
so you can upgrade your power as well as

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.400 
so you can upgrade your power as well as
your<00:02:16.940> light<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.450> all<00:02:17.569> your<00:02:17.750> defense<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.349> all

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
your light and all your defense and all

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.290 
your light and all your defense and all
that<00:02:18.590> sort<00:02:18.770> of<00:02:18.890> stuff<00:02:18.950> like<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.180> can

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
that sort of stuff like that so that can

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.240 
that sort of stuff like that so that can
be<00:02:20.330> extremely<00:02:20.780> useful<00:02:20.930> once<00:02:21.530> you're<00:02:21.739> past

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
be extremely useful once you're past

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.430 
be extremely useful once you're past
20<00:02:22.610> because<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.270> do<00:02:23.390> need<00:02:23.600> light<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.900> rank<00:02:24.290> up

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
20 because you do need light to rank up

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.200 
20 because you do need light to rank up
so<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:24.890> would<00:02:25.130> definitely<00:02:25.160> recommend<00:02:25.550> using

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
so I would definitely recommend using

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.000
