in this shot on the last camera okay
don't<00:02:09.050> test<00:02:09.349> it

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
don't test it

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.870 
don't test it
first<00:02:11.450> so<00:02:12.450> field

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.910 

well

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
well

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.550 
well
finish<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:19.870> can<00:02:19.990> imagine<00:02:20.140> what<00:02:20.349> you<00:02:20.470> can

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
finish so you can imagine what you can

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.290 
finish so you can imagine what you can
do<00:02:20.709> with<00:02:20.860> that

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
do with that

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.080 
do with that
pretty<00:02:22.960> good<00:02:23.170> about<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.370> okay<00:02:24.370> now<00:02:24.940> we're

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
pretty good about it okay now we're

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.760 
pretty good about it okay now we're
going<00:02:25.210> to<00:02:25.300> do<00:02:25.450> something<00:02:25.720> called<00:02:26.140> soft

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
going to do something called soft

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.570 
going to do something called soft
pattern<00:02:27.300> which<00:02:28.300> makes<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.690> move<00:02:29.110> smoothly<00:02:29.650> to

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
pattern which makes it move smoothly to

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.570 
pattern which makes it move smoothly to
the<00:02:30.610> next<00:02:30.940> destination<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.900> then<00:02:32.260> we<00:02:32.380> add

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
the next destination and then we add

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.880 
the next destination and then we add
frames<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:34.000> goes<00:02:34.240> through<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.230> if<00:02:35.560> we<00:02:35.620> got<00:02:35.860> a

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
frames it goes through so if we got a

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.010 
frames it goes through so if we got a
frame<00:02:36.250> it'll<00:02:36.850> go<00:02:37.000> through<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.690> frame

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
frame it'll go through to that frame

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.900 
frame it'll go through to that frame
then<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.440> next<00:02:38.560> one<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:39.040> will<00:02:39.130> smoothly<00:02:39.550> go

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
then the next one it will smoothly go

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.900 
then the next one it will smoothly go
through<00:02:40.210> and<00:02:41.170> then<00:02:41.350> it'll<00:02:42.130> get<00:02:42.460> to<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.700> next

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
through and then it'll get to the next

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.420 
through and then it'll get to the next
camera

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.770 

ok

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
ok

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.250 
ok

I did myself up with this bit that's

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.540 
I did myself up with this bit that's
because

it's just a tutorial to the needs to be
perfect<00:03:00.310> just<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:02.020> show<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.230> how<00:03:02.320> basically

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
perfect just to show you how basically

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.810 
perfect just to show you how basically
get<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.490> working<00:03:04.350> I'm<00:03:05.350> gonna<00:03:05.710> come<00:03:06.040> slide

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
get it working I'm gonna come slide

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.330 
get it working I'm gonna come slide
across<00:03:07.120> there

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.430 

I've<00:03:11.790> got<00:03:12.030> change<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.450> time<00:03:12.780> on<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:13.170> fair

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
I've got change the time on that fair

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.910 
I've got change the time on that fair
they<00:03:14.040> moved<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.970> within<00:03:15.269> one<00:03:15.540> second

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
they moved it within one second

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.140 
they moved it within one second
so<00:03:19.020> what<00:03:20.020> you<00:03:20.140> really<00:03:20.319> want<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.680> do<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:22.090> change

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
so what you really want to do is change

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.870 
so what you really want to do is change
it<00:03:22.569> to<00:03:22.690> about<00:03:22.840> 34<00:03:23.620> seconds<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.220> call<00:03:24.400> them<00:03:24.550> how

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
it to about 34 seconds to call them how

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.530 
it to about 34 seconds to call them how
long<00:03:24.910> will<00:03:25.360> it<00:03:25.390> take<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.810> travel<00:03:26.200> through<00:03:27.540> to

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
long will it take to travel through to

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.680 
long will it take to travel through to
the<00:03:28.569> camera<00:03:28.989> ah

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.949 

take<00:03:35.320> that<00:03:35.500> for<00:03:35.710> three<00:03:35.950> as<00:03:36.040> well

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
take that for three as well

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:51.330 
take that for three as well
and<00:03:38.959> let's<00:03:39.140> say<00:03:39.970> okay<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.030> they<00:03:41.180> play<00:03:41.390> again

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.309 

you<00:03:51.760> can<00:03:51.910> see<00:03:52.060> it<00:03:52.150> less<00:03:52.330> stuff<00:03:52.540> has<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.720> sidewalk

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
you can see it less stuff has a sidewalk

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.860 
you can see it less stuff has a sidewalk

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
so the game the full game may be

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.580 
so the game the full game may be
completely<00:05:05.000> different<00:05:05.210> cameras<00:05:06.050> to<00:05:06.350> what

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
completely different cameras to what

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.190 
completely different cameras to what
they<00:05:06.740> are<00:05:06.770> on<00:05:07.100> this<00:05:07.820> right<00:05:08.479> guys<00:05:08.510> see<00:05:09.139> you
