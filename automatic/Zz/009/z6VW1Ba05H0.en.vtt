when you pull the thread holding it like
it<00:00:39.510> would<00:00:39.660> be<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.960> machine<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.920> bobbin

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
it would be in the machine the bobbin

it's alternating green and yellow should

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.339 
it's alternating green and yellow should
be<00:02:26.579> able<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.819> see<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:27.359> video<00:02:27.659> it

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
be able to see that in the video it

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.110 
be able to see that in the video it
should<00:02:28.560> just<00:02:28.709> flash<00:02:29.010> off<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.579> on<00:02:29.700> like<00:02:29.939> that

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
should just flash off and on like that

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.140 
should just flash off and on like that
both<00:02:30.450> on<00:02:30.659> a<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.079> B<00:02:31.230> when<00:02:31.439> you<00:02:31.530> pull<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.889> thread

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
both on a and B when you pull the thread

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.780 
both on a and B when you pull the thread
that's<00:02:33.150> telling<00:02:33.719> me<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.469> sensor<00:02:34.920> and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
that's telling me that the sensor and

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.940 
that's telling me that the sensor and
this<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.329> sensor<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.049> this<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.650> what<00:02:37.829> it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
this is the sensor and this is what it

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.559 
this is the sensor and this is what it
looks<00:02:38.129> like<00:02:38.219> that's<00:02:38.700> telling<00:02:39.180> me<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.299> the

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
looks like that's telling me that the

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.929 
looks like that's telling me that the
sensor<00:02:39.959> is<00:02:40.109> good<00:02:40.409> it's<00:02:41.129> working<00:02:41.609> like<00:02:41.760> it

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
sensor is good it's working like it

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.640 
sensor is good it's working like it
should<00:02:41.969> and<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.840> shouldn't<00:02:43.200> be<00:02:43.290> getting<00:02:43.409> a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
should and you shouldn't be getting a

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.390 
should and you shouldn't be getting a
message<00:02:43.980> on<00:02:44.189> the<00:02:44.310> screen<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:46.680> there's<00:02:47.010> no<00:02:47.189> need

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
message on the screen so there's no need

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.970 
message on the screen so there's no need
to<00:02:47.459> replace<00:02:47.849> this<00:02:48.120> sensor<00:02:48.569> if<00:02:49.379> it's<00:02:49.709> not

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
to replace this sensor if it's not

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.369 
to replace this sensor if it's not
flashing<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.909> you<00:02:51.510> read<00:02:51.689> pull<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.079> thread

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
flashing and you read pull the thread

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.440 
flashing and you read pull the thread
and<00:02:52.650> it's<00:02:52.919> just<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.400> look<00:02:53.639> like<00:02:53.849> this<00:02:54.180> just

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
and it's just to look like this just

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.050 
and it's just to look like this just
yellow<00:02:55.379> like<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.189> not<00:02:56.370> alternately

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
yellow like that and not alternately

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.750 
yellow like that and not alternately
flash<00:02:57.450> green<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.409> means<00:02:58.680> your<00:02:58.950> sensors<00:02:59.430> bad

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
flash green that means your sensors bad

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.110 
flash green that means your sensors bad
and<00:03:00.269> it<00:03:00.450> needs<00:03:00.659> to<00:03:00.780> be<00:03:00.900> replaced<00:03:02.120> replacing

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
and it needs to be replaced replacing

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.429 
and it needs to be replaced replacing
the<00:03:03.659> sensor<00:03:04.109> is<00:03:05.010> very<00:03:05.459> easy<00:03:06.829> very<00:03:07.829> easy<00:03:09.439> let's

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
the sensor is very easy very easy let's

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.940 
the sensor is very easy very easy let's
get<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.650> screwdriver<00:03:11.099> here<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:13.230> can<00:03:13.409> pop<00:03:13.620> me

screwdriver just a very slight pry there

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.610 
screwdriver just a very slight pry there
take<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.150> sensor<00:03:24.599> out<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.669> unplug<00:03:26.669> the<00:03:26.849> wire

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
take the sensor out and unplug the wire

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.039 
take the sensor out and unplug the wire
there<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.799> go<00:03:29.180> that's<00:03:30.180> how<00:03:30.359> you<00:03:30.449> remove<00:03:30.900> the

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
there you go that's how you remove the

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.800 
there you go that's how you remove the
sensor<00:03:31.470> reverse<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.430> process<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.449> put<00:03:33.659> the

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
sensor reverse the process to put the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.099 
sensor reverse the process to put the
sensor<00:03:34.199> back<00:03:34.379> in<00:03:35.269> that's<00:03:36.269> about<00:03:36.629> all<00:03:36.930> the

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
sensor back in that's about all the

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.979 
sensor back in that's about all the
information<00:03:37.949> I<00:03:38.189> believe<00:03:38.220> for<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.120> video<00:03:39.599> I

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
information I believe for this video I

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.920 
information I believe for this video I
will<00:03:40.859> post<00:03:41.159> another<00:03:41.549> video<00:03:41.849> that<00:03:42.720> will<00:03:42.870> show

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
will post another video that will show

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.159 
will post another video that will show
you<00:03:43.139> how<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.620> turn<00:03:44.069> this<00:03:44.370> sensor<00:03:45.150> off<00:03:45.389> which<00:03:45.989> is

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
you how to turn this sensor off which is

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.890 
you how to turn this sensor off which is
what<00:03:46.349> a<00:03:46.379> lot<00:03:46.590> of<00:03:46.620> people<00:03:46.859> do<00:03:47.569> because<00:03:48.569> when<00:03:48.810> you

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
what a lot of people do because when you

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.929 
what a lot of people do because when you
do<00:03:49.049> run<00:03:49.229> on<00:03:49.379> a<00:03:49.409> lower<00:03:49.680> thread<00:03:50.099> then<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.699> upper

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:50.939 
do run on a lower thread then the upper

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.300 
do run on a lower thread then the upper
thread<00:03:51.209> is<00:03:51.419> not<00:03:51.659> the<00:03:52.229> upper<00:03:52.470> threads<00:03:52.769> not<00:03:53.009> pull

thread is not the upper threads not pull

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.610 
thread is not the upper threads not pull
through<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.909> you<00:03:54.689> do<00:03:54.900> get<00:03:55.079> a<00:03:55.139> warning<00:03:55.439> message
