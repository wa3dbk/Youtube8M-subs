00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
maybe I'm going with it thinks it but I

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.140 
maybe I'm going with it thinks it but I
feel<00:02:09.950> like<00:02:09.980> that<00:02:10.340> just<00:02:10.490> gives<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:10.880> a<00:02:10.970> little

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150

sea but anyway really it's not as bad a
toy<00:02:36.320> as<00:02:36.820> I<00:02:37.820> originally<00:02:38.300> thought<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:38.900> would<00:02:39.020> be

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
toy as I originally thought it would be

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.250 
toy as I originally thought it would be
because<00:02:39.440> I<00:02:39.650> really<00:02:40.190> didn't<00:02:40.459> like<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:41.780> look<00:02:42.080> of

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
because I really didn't like the look of

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.860 
because I really didn't like the look of
it<00:02:44.500> which<00:02:45.500> one<00:02:45.739> is<00:02:45.860> better<00:02:46.570> again<00:02:47.570> I'm<00:02:47.750> gonna

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
I wasn't sure how I'd like that first

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.710 
I wasn't sure how I'd like that first
but<00:03:06.800> it<00:03:06.980> does<00:03:07.190> look<00:03:07.220> good<00:03:08.800> but<00:03:09.800> I<00:03:10.720> mentioned

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
but it does look good but I mentioned

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.580 
but it does look good but I mentioned
earlier<00:03:11.810> about<00:03:13.840> this<00:03:14.840> right<00:03:15.050> here<00:03:15.230> being<00:03:15.500> the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
earlier about this right here being the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.310 
earlier about this right here being the
official<00:03:16.209> way<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.269> have<00:03:17.480> all<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.780> tail<00:03:17.989> fins

official way to have all the tail fins

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.190 
official way to have all the tail fins
and<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:19.100> don't<00:03:19.250> like<00:03:19.459> it<00:03:19.640> because<00:03:19.959> these<00:03:20.959> guys

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
and I don't like it because these guys

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.229 
and I don't like it because these guys
are<00:03:21.260> supposed<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.650> be<00:03:21.769> huge<00:03:22.130> hulking<00:03:22.519> robots

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
are supposed to be huge hulking robots

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.150 
are supposed to be huge hulking robots
that<00:03:23.450> are<00:03:23.510> armored<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.080> everything<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.590> it

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
that are armored and everything and it

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.890 
that are armored and everything and it
you've<00:03:25.340> got<00:03:25.520> all<00:03:25.760> this<00:03:25.910> open<00:03:26.180> area<00:03:26.540> right<00:03:26.870> here

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
you've got all this open area right here

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.470 
you've got all this open area right here
that<00:03:27.290> looks<00:03:27.530> like<00:03:28.160> it'd<00:03:28.340> be<00:03:28.490> a<00:03:28.520> good<00:03:28.730> spot<00:03:29.420> to

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
that looks like it'd be a good spot to

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.330 
that looks like it'd be a good spot to
put<00:03:29.750> a<00:03:29.780> rock

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
put a rock

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.030 
put a rock
so<00:03:31.340> what<00:03:31.519> I<00:03:31.549> like<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:31.879> do<00:03:32.030> is<00:03:32.239> just<00:03:32.269> take<00:03:32.689> and

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
so what I like to do is just take and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:41.059 
so what I like to do is just take and
rotate<00:03:34.040> this<00:03:34.340> down<00:03:34.810> behind<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:36.200> chest<00:03:36.530> piece

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.979 

it<00:03:41.640> gives<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:42.030> impression<00:03:42.239> of<00:03:42.480> being<00:03:42.569> a<00:03:42.780> lot

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
it gives the impression of being a lot

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.520 
it gives the impression of being a lot
more<00:03:43.019> armored<00:03:44.420> rotate<00:03:45.420> these<00:03:45.689> down<00:03:46.109> to<00:03:46.349> give

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
more armored rotate these down to give

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.119 
more armored rotate these down to give
them<00:03:46.680> shoulder<00:03:47.040> pads<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:48.560> on<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.889> back

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
them shoulder pads and on the back

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.739 
them shoulder pads and on the back
there's<00:03:50.489> one<00:03:50.790> thing<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.090> makes<00:03:51.359> a<00:03:51.510> very

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:51.749 
there's one thing that makes a very

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:53.929 
there's one thing that makes a very
small<00:03:52.079> difference<00:03:52.590> but<00:03:53.249> I<00:03:53.280> feel<00:03:53.609> like<00:03:53.730> it's

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
small difference but I feel like it's

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.539 
small difference but I feel like it's
worth<00:03:54.150> doing<00:03:54.480> take<00:03:55.469> and<00:03:55.680> bring<00:03:56.099> the<00:03:56.340> wings

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
worth doing take and bring the wings

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.569 
worth doing take and bring the wings
back<00:03:56.790> up<00:03:57.299> like<00:03:57.810> your<00:03:58.109> heart<00:03:58.650> way<00:03:58.799> transforming

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
back up like your heart way transforming

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.030 
back up like your heart way transforming
bring<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.750> back<00:04:00.989> down<00:04:01.319> and<00:04:01.560> lay<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:02.700> over

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
bring this back down and lay this over

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.550 
bring this back down and lay this over
the<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.519> small<00:04:05.790> winglets<00:04:06.329> on<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.540> back<00:04:06.780> what

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
the the small winglets on the back what

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.140 
the the small winglets on the back what
that's<00:04:07.739> going<00:04:07.889> to<00:04:07.950> do<00:04:08.129> is<00:04:08.370> going<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.639> bulk<00:04:08.969> up

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
that's going to do is going to bulk up

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.449 
that's going to do is going to bulk up
is<00:04:09.359> back<00:04:09.629> a<00:04:09.659> little<00:04:09.959> bit<00:04:10.109> more<00:04:10.349> and<00:04:10.590> make<00:04:11.280> him

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
is back a little bit more and make him

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.670 
is back a little bit more and make him
look<00:04:11.609> just<00:04:11.879> a<00:04:11.969> little<00:04:12.180> bit<00:04:12.419> more<00:04:12.680> well

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
look just a little bit more well

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.050 
look just a little bit more well
proportioned<00:04:15.199> he's<00:04:16.199> like<00:04:16.470> just<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.729> compare

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
proportioned he's like just to compare

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.230 
proportioned he's like just to compare
the<00:04:18.209> two<00:04:20.030> so<00:04:22.340> it's<00:04:23.340> not<00:04:23.550> much<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:24.060> difference

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
the two so it's not much of difference

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.680 
the two so it's not much of difference
it<00:04:24.479> but<00:04:24.720> that<00:04:24.930> makes<00:04:25.169> but<00:04:25.949> it<00:04:26.070> does<00:04:26.310> help<00:04:26.610> some

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.230 

these<00:04:30.690> legs<00:04:31.340> are<00:04:32.340> kind<00:04:32.699> of<00:04:32.759> hard<00:04:32.880> to<00:04:33.000> get<00:04:33.210> a

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
these legs are kind of hard to get a

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.700 
these legs are kind of hard to get a
decent<00:04:33.539> poses<00:04:34.110> with<00:04:34.289> because<00:04:35.900> that<00:04:36.900> is<00:04:37.199> as<00:04:37.440> far

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
decent poses with because that is as far

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.969 
decent poses with because that is as far
forward<00:04:38.039> as<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.490> hips<00:04:38.699> could<00:04:38.910> swing<00:04:39.300> and

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
forward as the hips could swing and

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.550 
forward as the hips could swing and
after<00:04:40.979> that<00:04:41.130> they<00:04:41.340> start<00:04:41.610> hitting<00:04:41.880> on<00:04:43.280> ports

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
after that they start hitting on ports

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.180 
after that they start hitting on ports
but<00:04:47.930> like<00:04:48.930> I<00:04:48.960> said<00:04:49.169> nowhere<00:04:49.530> near<00:04:49.770> as<00:04:49.889> bad<00:04:50.130> a

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
just how much of a difference it makes

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.120 
just how much of a difference it makes
standing<00:06:40.900> straight<00:06:41.380> compared<00:06:41.920> to<00:06:42.010> the

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
standing straight compared to the

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.450 
standing straight compared to the
doglegs<00:06:42.610> the<00:06:43.120> doglegs<00:06:43.630> do<00:06:43.960> look<00:06:44.170> good<00:06:44.380> but<00:06:45.220> it

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
doglegs the doglegs do look good but it

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.220 
doglegs the doglegs do look good but it
causes<00:06:45.850> you<00:06:46.150> to<00:06:46.270> have<00:06:46.300> to<00:06:46.420> lean<00:06:46.720> the<00:06:46.750> forward

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
causes you to have to lean the forward

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.160 
causes you to have to lean the forward
lean<00:06:47.740> the<00:06:47.950> figure<00:06:48.370> forward<00:06:49.000> to<00:06:49.720> be<00:06:49.870> able<00:06:49.960> to

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.170 
lean the figure forward to be able to

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.470 
lean the figure forward to be able to
balance<00:06:50.350> and<00:06:51.010> I<00:06:51.190> just<00:06:51.550> like<00:06:51.730> it<00:06:51.910> standing

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480 
balance and I just like it standing

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.290 
balance and I just like it standing
straight<00:06:52.840> better

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 
straight better

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.809 
straight better
