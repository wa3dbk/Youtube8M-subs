find any use from it and I'm actually
gonna<00:01:53.040> test<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.640> my<00:01:53.729> phone<00:01:53.909> I'm<00:01:54.180> gonna<00:01:54.420> test<00:01:54.750> to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
gonna test on my phone I'm gonna test to

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.810 
gonna test on my phone I'm gonna test to
see<00:01:55.110> if<00:01:55.140> hybrid<00:01:56.040> new<00:01:56.130> mode<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.369> actually<00:01:56.520> any

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
see if hybrid new mode is actually any

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.730 
see if hybrid new mode is actually any
faster<00:01:57.329> if<00:01:57.420> startup<00:01:57.840> than<00:01:58.079> regular<00:01:58.380> mode<00:01:58.530> cuz

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
faster if startup than regular mode cuz

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.319 
faster if startup than regular mode cuz
I<00:01:58.890> don't<00:01:59.100> really<00:01:59.340> think<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> lot<00:01:59.909> faster

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
I don't really think it is a lot faster

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.749 
I don't really think it is a lot faster
maybe<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.659> little<00:02:00.899> bit<00:02:01.020> not<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> lot<00:02:01.759> anyways

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
maybe a little bit not a lot anyways

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.609 
maybe a little bit not a lot anyways
yeah<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.240> say<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.469> lot<00:02:04.590> of

it's actually like a fitness one but I

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.860 
it's actually like a fitness one but I
yeah<00:02:55.170> let's<00:02:55.350> start<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.650> up<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.790> we'll<00:02:57.600> just<00:02:57.750> do

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
yeah let's start it up and we'll just do

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:06.260 
yeah let's start it up and we'll just do
the<00:02:57.960> Parpan<00:02:58.940> okay<00:03:00.260> we<00:03:01.260> got<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.620> going<00:03:05.270> yeah

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
the Parpan okay we got that going yeah

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.060 
the Parpan okay we got that going yeah
can<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.570> get<00:03:06.720> them<00:03:07.080> okay<00:03:07.530> yeah<00:03:07.740> I'm<00:03:07.800> just<00:03:07.950> gonna

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
can I get them okay yeah I'm just gonna

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.630 
can I get them okay yeah I'm just gonna
do<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.870> so<00:03:09.870> yeah<00:03:09.990> it<00:03:10.080> really<00:03:10.200> doesn't<00:03:10.560> take

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
do that so yeah it really doesn't take

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.160 
do that so yeah it really doesn't take
incredibly<00:03:11.640> long<00:03:11.850> in<00:03:12.030> my<00:03:12.090> opinion<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.630> mean

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
incredibly long in my opinion I mean

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.280 
incredibly long in my opinion I mean
that's<00:03:14.600> and<00:03:15.600> now<00:03:15.630> it's<00:03:15.870> going<00:03:16.020> through<00:03:16.170> the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
that's and now it's going through the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.360 
that's and now it's going through the
Start<00:03:16.500> menu<00:03:16.740> so<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.010> mean<00:03:18.710> 20<00:03:19.710> seconds<00:03:20.160> pretty

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
Start menu so I mean 20 seconds pretty

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.760 
Start menu so I mean 20 seconds pretty
much<00:03:20.520> to<00:03:20.790> start<00:03:21.000> up<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.180> console<00:03:21.560> maybe<00:03:22.560> like

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
much to start up the console maybe like

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.460 
much to start up the console maybe like
22<00:03:23.070> so<00:03:23.880> that's<00:03:24.210> not<00:03:24.390> too<00:03:24.570> bad<00:03:24.720> in<00:03:24.870> my<00:03:24.960> opinion<00:03:25.050> I

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
22 so that's not too bad in my opinion I

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.590 
22 so that's not too bad in my opinion I
would<00:03:25.530> just<00:03:26.070> rather<00:03:26.370> have<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:26.970> console<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.450> be

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
would just rather have the console of be

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.480 
would just rather have the console of be
turned<00:03:27.780> off<00:03:27.900> although<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.230> guess<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:29.010> be<00:03:29.160> fair

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
turned off although I guess to be fair

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.030 
turned off although I guess to be fair
what<00:03:30.270> you're<00:03:30.300> talking<00:03:30.630> about<00:03:30.660> phone<00:03:30.960> to<00:03:31.890> be

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
what you're talking about phone to be

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.620 
what you're talking about phone to be
fair<00:03:32.310> we<00:03:32.460> really<00:03:32.730> should<00:03:32.970> turn<00:03:33.330> off<00:03:33.480> the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
fair we really should turn off the

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.630 
fair we really should turn off the
console<00:03:34.020> which<00:03:34.830> it's<00:03:35.100> probably<00:03:35.190> pissed<00:03:35.490> off

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
console which it's probably pissed off

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.610 
console which it's probably pissed off
that<00:03:35.670> I'm<00:03:35.910> turning<00:03:36.270> off<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.540> on<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:36.840> much<00:03:36.990> but

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
that I'm turning off and on so much but

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.170 
that I'm turning off and on so much but
we<00:03:37.770> really<00:03:38.040> should<00:03:38.250> test<00:03:38.550> it<00:03:38.670> out<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:39.030> see<00:03:39.150> what

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
we really should test it out to see what

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.360 
we really should test it out to see what
hibernate<00:03:39.690> mode<00:03:39.780> does<00:03:40.280> actually<00:03:41.280> I've<00:03:41.340> never

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
hibernate mode does actually I've never

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.870 
hibernate mode does actually I've never
done<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:41.730> before<00:03:41.940> but<00:03:42.270> let's<00:03:42.840> find<00:03:42.990> out<00:03:43.880> and

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
done that before but let's find out and

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.400 
done that before but let's find out and
actually<00:03:45.030> let's<00:03:45.390> see<00:03:45.570> how<00:03:45.750> long<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.080> takes<00:03:46.110> to

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
actually let's see how long it takes to

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:54.740 
actually let's see how long it takes to
go<00:03:46.530> into<00:03:46.680> Harriett<00:03:47.010> mode<00:03:52.970> more<00:03:53.970> times<00:03:54.300> than<00:03:54.570> I

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
go into Harriett mode more times than I

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.530 
go into Harriett mode more times than I
would<00:03:55.370> assumed<00:03:58.790> it's<00:03:59.790> not<00:03:59.940> hibernate<00:04:00.390> mode

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
would assumed it's not hibernate mode

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.640 
would assumed it's not hibernate mode
until<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:00.960> yellow<00:04:01.140> light<00:04:01.350> is<00:04:01.470> on<00:04:01.620> there<00:04:03.650> why

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
until that yellow light is on there why

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.630 
until that yellow light is on there why
is<00:04:04.710> the<00:04:04.980> console<00:04:05.370> still<00:04:05.550> owned<00:04:07.340> why<00:04:08.340> does<00:04:08.520> the

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
is the console still owned why does the

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.270 
is the console still owned why does the
console<00:04:09.030> take<00:04:09.270> more<00:04:09.510> time<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:09.750> turn<00:04:10.140> off<00:04:10.280> than

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
console take more time to turn off than

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.020 
console take more time to turn off than
to<00:04:11.430> turn<00:04:11.610> on<00:04:15.799> but<00:04:16.799> still<00:04:17.040> on<00:04:17.190> folks<00:04:17.520> it's<00:04:17.850> still

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
to turn on but still on folks it's still

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.840 
to turn on but still on folks it's still
on

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.110 

still<00:04:23.850> going<00:04:24.800> there<00:04:25.800> we<00:04:26.010> go<00:04:26.160> so<00:04:26.520> probably

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
still going there we go so probably

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.670 
still going there we go so probably
about<00:04:27.270> 40<00:04:27.690> seconds<00:04:28.050> because<00:04:28.140> I<00:04:28.260> actually<00:04:28.410> turn

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
about 40 seconds because I actually turn

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.830 
about 40 seconds because I actually turn
it<00:04:28.770> on<00:04:28.890> a<00:04:28.920> little<00:04:29.010> bit<00:04:29.250> late<00:04:29.400> 40<00:04:30.390> seconds<00:04:30.750> to

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
it on a little bit late 40 seconds to

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.300 
it on a little bit late 40 seconds to
turn<00:04:30.960> off<00:04:31.140> the<00:04:31.290> console<00:04:31.560> into<00:04:31.860> hibernate<00:04:32.220> mode

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
turn off the console into hibernate mode

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.180 
turn off the console into hibernate mode
that's<00:04:33.300> fuckin<00:04:33.750> atrocious<00:04:34.260> and<00:04:34.530> Sony<00:04:34.950> needs

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
that's fuckin atrocious and Sony needs

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.070 
that's fuckin atrocious and Sony needs
to<00:04:35.340> do<00:04:35.460> something<00:04:35.760> about<00:04:35.820> that<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.240> anyways

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
let's see oh man it's so hard to do this

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.150 
let's see oh man it's so hard to do this
I'll<00:04:42.750> just<00:04:42.960> turn<00:04:43.110> off<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.290> I'll<00:04:43.740> turn<00:04:43.920> on<00:04:44.010> the

on from hibernate mode how long is it

00:04:49.650 --> 00:05:01.840 
on from hibernate mode how long is it
gonna<00:04:49.800> take<00:04:56.360> maybe<00:04:57.360> just<00:04:57.690> a<00:04:57.810> smidgen<00:04:58.260> faster

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850

hibernate<00:05:07.860> mode<00:05:07.950> just<00:05:08.190> took<00:05:08.310> longer

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
hibernate mode just took longer

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.720 
hibernate mode just took longer
hibernate<00:05:10.290> mode<00:05:10.440> just<00:05:10.980> took<00:05:11.220> longer<00:05:11.520> to

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
hibernate mode just took longer to

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.150 
hibernate mode just took longer to
startup<00:05:12.240> than<00:05:12.870> in<00:05:12.960> regular<00:05:13.050> mode<00:05:13.410> what<00:05:13.980> the

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
startup than in regular mode what the

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.310 
startup than in regular mode what the
fuck<00:05:14.490> is<00:05:14.760> the<00:05:14.970> point<00:05:15.210> of<00:05:15.450> hibernate<00:05:15.960> mode<00:05:16.170> oh

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320

fuck is the point of hibernate mode oh
no<00:05:19.320> I<00:05:19.350> should<00:05:19.590> stop<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:19.890> timer<00:05:20.070> but<00:05:20.580> literally

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
no I should stop the timer but literally

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.530 
no I should stop the timer but literally
it<00:05:21.240> took<00:05:21.450> longer<00:05:22.260> well<00:05:22.860> probably<00:05:23.400> to<00:05:24.090> be<00:05:24.240> fair

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
it took longer well probably to be fair

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.540 
it took longer well probably to be fair
probably<00:05:25.260> literally<00:05:25.740> about<00:05:26.010> the<00:05:26.130> same<00:05:26.310> time

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
probably literally about the same time

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.170 
probably literally about the same time
but<00:05:27.480> come<00:05:27.840> the<00:05:27.990> fuck<00:05:28.170> on<00:05:28.320> you<00:05:28.650> take<00:05:29.100> 22<00:05:29.760> seconds

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
but come the fuck on you take 22 seconds

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.970 
but come the fuck on you take 22 seconds
to<00:05:30.330> start<00:05:30.570> regardless<00:05:31.350> of<00:05:31.440> a<00:05:31.500> hibernate<00:05:31.860> mode

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
to start regardless of a hibernate mode

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.670 
to start regardless of a hibernate mode
or<00:05:32.190> not<00:05:32.610> why<00:05:33.450> the<00:05:33.510> fuck<00:05:33.840> can<00:05:34.080> I<00:05:34.170> just<00:05:34.380> turn<00:05:34.530> off

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
or not why the fuck can I just turn off

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.700 
or not why the fuck can I just turn off
the<00:05:34.860> console<00:05:35.190> altogether<00:05:35.850> I<00:05:36.180> don't<00:05:37.170> get<00:05:37.410> it

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
the console altogether I don't get it

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.770 
the console altogether I don't get it
and<00:05:37.800> probably<00:05:38.400> uses<00:05:38.820> a<00:05:38.850> lot<00:05:39.030> less<00:05:39.210> power<00:05:39.450> while

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
and probably uses a lot less power while

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.630 
and probably uses a lot less power while
it's<00:05:39.930> all<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.290> way<00:05:40.410> off<00:05:40.590> so<00:05:41.280> why<00:05:41.430> the<00:05:41.490> fuck

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.810 
it's all the way off so why the fuck
would<00:05:41.940> I<00:05:41.970> ever<00:05:42.150> really<00:05:42.570> need<00:05:42.870> hibernate<00:05:43.560> mode

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
would I ever really need hibernate mode
