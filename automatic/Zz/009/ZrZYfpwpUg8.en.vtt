 yes 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.830
 Y 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.710
 video analysis of the universe in more than 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.390
 two years that I have been writing for this 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.520
 magazine had never been so 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.080
 difficult to pigeonhole a title within 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.150
 the pre-established limits of a gender 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.099
 doc and docx universe has elements of 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.990
 graphic adventures of grass and even 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.070
 includes personality tests whose 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.919
 conclusions may result 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.840
 amazingly accurate this game is either 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.520
 try to do many things and while 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.360
 achieves its goal remarkably in 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.040
 some aspects 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.180
 unfortunately falters in those who 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.950
 have greater weight within the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.180
 classic conception of a videogame my 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.160
 first encounter with two video what 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.240
 juniors had freshness and mystery 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.640
 that involves surrendering to the unknown 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.050
 therefore he knew little or nothing about it before 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.030
 download it an artistic section 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.560
 I was particularly welcomed by a 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.900
 game that invites us to know more about 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.310
 ourselves on a large scale to 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.080
 inquire into humanity all its 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.210
 emotions your fears and your motivations 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.620
 the first scene we witnessed in 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.540
 doc and what universe is capable of 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.769
 to move from its tenderness and innocence 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.320
 our protagonist 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.150
 the model q3 robot is abandoned by its 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.829
 human family staying with the single 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.420
 company of a red balloon on time 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.070
 elapses and he is still standing at the same 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.630
 place with an unalterable expression and 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.149
 an illusion full of 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.950
 32 years later an extraterrestrial 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.930
 presents to him and convinces him of lovano 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.610
 of your wait urging you to start a 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.259
 search in which we will go through a 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.579
 wide repertoire of emotions with the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.740
 purpose of which our character 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.329
 learn to behave and agree as a 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.490
 person in that initial dialogue 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.780
 minimalist and effective I predisposed 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.490
 the best way to start the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.929
 adventure and I also achieve that I feel a 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.700
 little shame for belonging to the 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.170
 human genre the title proposes us 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.210
 tour the planets that shape this 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.280
 peculiar universe in each of them 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.079
 we will meet different characters that in 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.090
 most border on the absurd with those who 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.590
 we can interact are just the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.360
 dialogues one of the bases of tokidoki 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.159
 juniors then in its simplicity and in its 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.390
 We will find a lot of humor 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.580
 more than in its developments properly 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.599
 said the emphasis of the game is put 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.009
 in helping the beings that we will go 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.509
 knowing who in turn we 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.399
 will provide objects and gifts that 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.380
 later we can reuse in the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.939
 We will learn about the universe 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.009
 and its inhabitants and maybe we also 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.410
 let's take some interesting moral without 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.959
 embargo and beyond its virtues 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.069
 Tokidoki universe fishing where it hurts the most 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.630
 repeating until the fatigue mechanics 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.670
 of simple games that soon after 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.349
 they will feel extremely repetitive 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.329
 these subtract several integers to the 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.440
 fun making it the inertia and 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.240
 not the desire 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.650
 press continue acquiring tokidoki 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.360
 universe we can access the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.430
 versions of playstation 4 playstation 3 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.840
 and playstation vita there is also a 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.700
 considerable amount of content 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.320
 downloadable waiting for those who 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.150
 be attracted to this singular 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.920
 proposal the title does not have 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.540
 multiplayer modes although yes 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.890
 includes a curious application that 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.140
 allows to exchange messages through 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.120
 from facebook personally I think this 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.890
 last added attentively noticeably with 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.690
 the idea of ​​inner discovery the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.220
 what little should I have in common with 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.990
 share experiences in the most frivolous 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.280
 of social networks if it's true 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.230
 that the title manages to fulfill its 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.310
 objectives generate empathy promote the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.510
 internal inquiry 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.430
 at the same time it fails in its execution 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.780
 being unable to sustain a premise 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.760
 original and innovative that undoubtedly 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.260
 it's too ambitious for a 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.270
 game of these characteristics made the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.190
 destination that vain way of calling the 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.810
 chance that doc and docx universe have 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.220
 found at a time when the 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.080
 questions are more than the answers 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.340
 share a few hours with this title not 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.920
 It has made me wiser and has not given me 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.840
 no kind of certainties but it did help in 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.580
 I did not turn away from the path that 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.200
 he tried to build and fundamentally 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.610
 he managed to want to continue understanding 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.430
 who I am 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:31.520
 the best innocent sense of humor and 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.790
 effective artistic section the tests of 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.470
 personality really work what 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:43.750
 Extremely bad game mechanics 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.750
 repetitive score 7 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.840
