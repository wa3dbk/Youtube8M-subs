00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:10.710
 ok I understand it but what do we do with those 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.230
 colors that we no longer like were made 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.600
 ugly blankets dried because we know that 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.770
 form that we use we are never going to 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.510
 finish here three ideas one in 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.970
 accessories 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.890
 I have this one that I bought a long time ago 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.230
 has these forms already drawn and of 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.539
 fact already comes with a permanent enamel 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.970
 let's say another color that I do not like 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.180
 a lot and that I'm going to change what 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.090
 yellow and this becomes very easy just 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.550
 you have to paint carefully trying to 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.210
 do not get out of the lines like when 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.210
 we were children 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.860
 we let the first layer dry and this is 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.840
 easy because they do not have to be there 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.410
 immobile as when we do the 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.420
 Nails leave it there and we put the layers 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.950
 that are necessary leaving drying 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.950
 always between each 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.150
 and that's how mine is, it's a very 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.460
 easy to renew these accessories on 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.830
 Yellow made very good contrast with the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.430
 rusty of the old accessory apart already 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.030
 know in trend I liked it a lot more 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.869
 than the original color 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.850
 2 as an identifier in this case of 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.799
 keys but they can do it with what 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.869
 be and you know that I like it 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.270
 complicate my existence and I'm going to 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.670
 Give some design by covering with tape 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.229
 Adhesive diagonally to create 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.229
 straight lines and look more 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.030
 then you just have to paint the keys 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.160
 since they take advantage of all those colors 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.220
 rare that we bought that maybe we 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.220
 we put a maximum twice in life 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.900
 first layer we let dry 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.580
 if you want it to be much faster 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.560
 look for something that can keep them 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.270
 stops to dry of all 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.930
 sides and are not there waiting for you to 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.569
 flip one side flip it like that 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.250
 then we put second layer if the 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.689
 keys are very stained can put 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.689
 3-4 those who want 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.450
 since they dry completely we remove the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.450
 Scotch tape 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.540
 and we will have something like that look super 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.970
 originals to hang up they look 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.250
 well they are those ordinary things that 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.020
 we can give them a touch of design 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.030
 you see nice they help us to know what is 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:02.660
 which super easy and fast make yours 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.510
 and finally my favorite and it 's for 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.580
 decoration can do it with a thousand 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.740
 things I chose a base of a candle that 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.910
 I'm done, you know, I like to recycle 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.290
 and this is the easiest of all 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.980
 prepare yourself by putting something down to not 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.860
 stain take the direct enamel from 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.660
 vial and without any care they are going to 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:29.690
 drip as you want can make stripes 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:34.390
 dots circles waves mix colors 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.390
 the more messy the better 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.200
 since they have their abstract design and their 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.010
 work of art I also did in the part 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.379
 from below to make it look well done 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.170
 let dry here yes how is the 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.480
 coarse enamel it takes leave all the 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.760
 night if you can if you want too 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.069
 can put another color on this I what 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.590
 I did and I liked it much more with just one 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.170
 but you can try the good thing about this 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.390
 is that everything is temporary if you do not like it 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.470
 they clean it with acetone and it looks like 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.370
 I was 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.200
 and voilÃ  I really loved this one 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.870
 loved loved I loved it is something 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.930
 you only look artistic you can do it in 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.930
 what you want without a doubt my favorite 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.160
 I hope you liked this video so much 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.590
 like me they loved me three 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.320
 ideas especially the base was super 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.360
 Pretty, really do it, you and I have 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.650
 an appointment here in the next video to see 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.650
 if I happen to send them a kiss 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.680
