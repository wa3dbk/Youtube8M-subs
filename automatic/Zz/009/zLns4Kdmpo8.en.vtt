00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 questions addressed to Mr. miso de 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.610
 finance and public administrations 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.740
 question first the deputy 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.450
 Alberto Garzón of rural left 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.039
 Mr. Montoro, you have announced 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.720
 recently a tax reform and 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.460
 we ask you what are the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.960
 effects on social inequality 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.560
 existing in our country that will have 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.560
 this reform 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.280
 after days I have reputed Mr. Minister 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.640
 Thank you 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.160
 the first origin of inequality 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.560
 social problem in Spain is in the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.450
 unemployment in the lack of jobs in the 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.000
 lack of opportunities and precisely 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.970
 this is the first objective that aims 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.550
 address the tax reform by lowering the 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.030
 tax burden on payroll 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.670
 and doing it especially about 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.120
 medium and low salaries thanks sir 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.120
 President 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.100
 brad and teach shine that deputy 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.269
 yes sir montoro good has not responded 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.700
 to the specific question 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.650
 in any case you think it is 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.869
 fully aware that this 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.280
 tax reform is absolutely 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.140
 regressive because it affects unevenly 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.540
 very unevenly according to social class 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.119
 I give you an example a worker who 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.729
 copper 11 thousand euros a year will not notice 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.500
 no effect on this tax reform a 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.039
 worker who charges twenty thousand euros to 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.320
 year will win you will save two hundred euros in 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.210
 that income statement 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.610
 clear that two hundred euros clearly 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.899
 insufficient to deal with 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.270
 university fees that have 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.500
 shot up to 600 euros or the masters 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.659
 college students that have shot up 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.610
 up to four thousand euros and for the 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.039
 opposite those people who win 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.929
 about three hundred thousand euros a year will see 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.850
 a saving of ten thousand euros what 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.229
 chance with ten thousand euros if you 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.720
 will be able to face the fees 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.270
 universities and public masters 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.190
 you always make life difficult for 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.170
 poor and it is facilitated to the rich and 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.240
 that is consequently increase the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.670
 social inequality and Mr. Montoro 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.649
 keep in mind that increase the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.620
 social inequality is ultimately 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.750
 instance increase insecurity 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.130
 because if we want social stability and 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.840
 policy if you want stability 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.000
 social and political does not help 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.010
 fill the streets with policemen does not work 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.690
 nothing filling the houses with fines 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.000
 it serves no purpose to criminalize the protest 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.920
 social and it's no use generating fear 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.630
 in the population to end the 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.400
 citizen insecurity to promote 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.930
 social and political stability what there is 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.880
 What to do is to combat poverty 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.260
 poverty and social inequality and that 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.790
 it is also done from the fiscal policy 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.040
 but you have taken the road 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.660
 wrong you have taken the path of 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.720
 increase social inequality by 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.660
 via the fiscal system and Mr. Montoro 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.880
 we believe that it is not a utopia 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.130
 build a society with justice 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.320
 social and fiscal justice just need 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.450
 political will but you do not have it 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.630
 you on the other hand bet on another 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.730
 utopia a utopia that is impossible to 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.620
 fulfill that is the utopia of maintaining a 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.900
 society in time that is so 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.130
 unfair as it is today if we 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.680
 combat citizen insecurity 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.960
 we have to keep in mind that we have to 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.700
 feed three times a day to the 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.740
 children we have to fight the 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.400
 poverty that is not hiding poverty 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.019
 but to fight it in a scenario where 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.299
 it was learned yesterday in a UNICEF report 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.769
 more than 2 million children in this country 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.840
 they are in poverty that generates 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.909
 instability that generates insecurity 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.480
 citizen and its tax reform does not address 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.480
 to those reasons 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.940
 Thank you 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.099
 the deputy and friends 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.200
 misfortunes the gentleman president when 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.989
 we arrived at the government and found a 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.780
 hidden public deficit and a debt 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.920
 commercial without paying very high we raise the 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.580
 income tax on people 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.830
 physical and we raise it fairly evenly 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.430
 precisely up to seven points at 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.280
 higher incomes that has told 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.010
 you mister garzon what we did in your 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.049
 moment when we arrived at the government the 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.910
 large companies in Spain had a 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:06.010
 effective tax rate of something else 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:10.849
 3% with us we have already raised it 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:13.220
 three times to 9% that did the 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.560
 left when he was governing or going to 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.950
 to the left of his utopia 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.489
 Mr. Garzón, look at those speeches that 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.130
 you do 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.199
 he forgets the importance they have 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.229
 the proportions of people to 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:31.410
 a person who is having an income 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.870
 of twenty thousand euros the rebate we're going 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.599
 to promote from the government is a 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.360
 very substantial discount against low of 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:41.940
 almost 25 percent of 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.669
 tax that supports that is a reality 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.759
 a reality that will improve equity 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.069
 the equity that comes from the 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.860
 own tax system but I insist 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:55.560
 in a society to avoid precisely 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.349
 the most social inequalities 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.120
 flagrant and avoid the problems of 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.819
 social cohesion what needs to be done is 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.930
 grow and create employment that is exactly 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:09.840
 what is beginning to happen and how 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.000
 already happened in the past and I'm going to tell you 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.000
 which was precisely at the time of 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.870
 government of the popular party where there was 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.630
 fewer Spaniards in a position to incur 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.539
 in problems of extreme poverty because 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.320
 because it was then when unemployment and 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.780
 registered unemployment 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.650
 was at the lowest levels of his 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.680
 history 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.150
 that is the reality utopia that they want 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.970
 drive government policies 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.490
 the sooner you grow, create jobs and 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.780
 both strengthen social cohesion the 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.130
 equal opportunities in our 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.130
 society thank the president
