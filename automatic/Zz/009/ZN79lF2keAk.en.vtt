that's a guideline some guitars you want
to<00:00:56.109> go<00:00:56.199> a<00:00:56.230> little<00:00:56.440> closer<00:00:56.769> some<00:00:57.609> guitars<00:00:57.969> you

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
to go a little closer some guitars you

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.639

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
might want to go a little farther away

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.150 
might want to go a little farther away
depending<00:01:00.460> on<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:02.079> sound<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:02.679> response

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
depending on the sound and the response

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.860 
depending on the sound and the response
that<00:01:03.340> you<00:01:03.429> like<00:01:03.640> I<00:01:03.789> like<00:01:04.090> a<00:01:04.150> little<00:01:04.480> distance

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
that you like I like a little distance

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.840 
that you like I like a little distance
and<00:01:05.019> a<00:01:05.050> little<00:01:05.230> air<00:01:05.410> I<00:01:05.440> call<00:01:06.010> it<00:01:06.160> air<00:01:06.370> in

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
and a little air I call it air in

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.430 
and a little air I call it air in
between<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.510> string<00:01:07.870> and<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.110> pickup

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
between the string and the pickup

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.380 
between the string and the pickup
because<00:01:09.040> it<00:01:09.280> just<00:01:09.640> sounds<00:01:10.030> a<00:01:10.090> little<00:01:10.180> bit<00:01:10.330> more

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
because it just sounds a little bit more

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.450 
because it just sounds a little bit more
natural<00:01:10.750> and<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.170> strings<00:01:11.590> vibrate<00:01:11.680> a<00:01:12.220> little

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
natural and the strings vibrate a little

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.940 
natural and the strings vibrate a little
bit<00:01:12.610> more<00:01:12.850> freely<00:01:13.210> if<00:01:13.540> your<00:01:14.020> pickups<00:01:14.470> are<00:01:14.650> too

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
bit more freely if your pickups are too

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.670 
bit more freely if your pickups are too
close<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.479> strings<00:01:16.869> they're<00:01:17.380> actually

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
close to the strings they're actually

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.320 
close to the strings they're actually
going<00:01:17.799> to<00:01:17.860> pull<00:01:18.490> on<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.820> strings<00:01:19.119> and

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
going to pull on the strings and

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.380 
going to pull on the strings and
decrease<00:01:19.900> your<00:01:19.930> sustain<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:21.030> Rob<00:01:22.030> a<00:01:22.060> little

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
decrease your sustain and Rob a little

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.249 
decrease your sustain and Rob a little
tone<00:01:22.930> away<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.369> get<00:01:24.909> started<00:01:25.090> here<00:01:25.479> I<00:01:25.930> have

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
tone away so to get started here I have

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.499 
tone away so to get started here I have
my<00:01:26.380> ruler<00:01:26.710> set<00:01:27.009> on<00:01:27.189> three<00:01:27.610> thirty-seconds<00:01:28.329> and

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
my ruler set on three thirty-seconds and

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:29.490 
my ruler set on three thirty-seconds and
I'm<00:01:28.570> going<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:28.780> take<00:01:28.900> a<00:01:28.930> little<00:01:29.079> measurement

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
I'm going to take a little measurement

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.830 
I'm going to take a little measurement
here<00:01:29.850> okay<00:01:30.850> we<00:01:31.119> are<00:01:31.329> just<00:01:31.540> a<00:01:32.130> little<00:01:33.130> too<00:01:33.399> low

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
here okay we are just a little too low

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.069 
here okay we are just a little too low
so<00:01:34.840> holding<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.350> roller<00:01:36.000> I'm<00:01:37.000> going<00:01:37.329> to<00:01:37.509> raise

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
so holding the roller I'm going to raise

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:43.260 
so holding the roller I'm going to raise
this<00:01:38.320> pick<00:01:38.560> up<00:01:38.770> turning<00:01:39.430> clockwise<00:01:42.270> turns

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
this pick up turning clockwise turns

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.410 
this pick up turning clockwise turns
here<00:01:44.220> see<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.399> that<00:01:45.549> string<00:01:45.909> now<00:01:46.149> is

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
here see and that string now is

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.380 
here see and that string now is
perfectly<00:01:47.340> 3/32<00:01:48.340> although<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:48.909> pickup<00:01:49.240> is

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
perfectly 3/32 although the pickup is

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.929 
perfectly 3/32 although the pickup is
going<00:01:49.689> down<00:01:50.049> an<00:01:50.290> angle<00:01:50.680> like<00:01:50.829> this<00:01:50.860> I'm<00:01:51.369> going

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
going down an angle like this I'm going

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.609 
going down an angle like this I'm going
to<00:01:52.000> raise<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.630> middle<00:01:52.930> just<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.259> little<00:01:53.469> tiny

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
to raise the middle just a little tiny

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.870 
to raise the middle just a little tiny
bit<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:54.100> kind<00:01:54.280> of<00:01:54.310> flatten<00:01:54.579> it<00:01:54.850> out<00:01:56.549> much<00:01:57.549> flat

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
bit to kind of flatten it out much flat

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.380 
bit to kind of flatten it out much flat
good<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.420> let's<00:01:58.570> check<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.930> base<00:01:59.110> side<00:02:00.390> to

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
good and let's check the base side to

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.719 
good and let's check the base side to
slightly<00:02:01.869> low<00:02:02.289> I'm<00:02:02.590> going<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.799> raise<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.490> base

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
slightly low I'm going to raise the base

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.480 
slightly low I'm going to raise the base
side<00:02:04.060> of<00:02:04.689> this<00:02:05.079> bridge<00:02:05.350> pick<00:02:05.619> up<00:02:05.829> a<00:02:06.009> little

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
side of this bridge pick up a little

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.020 
side of this bridge pick up a little
tiny<00:02:06.700> bit<00:02:07.710> 3/32

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.179 

that's<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.150> little<00:02:12.359> bit<00:02:12.510> too<00:02:12.719> high<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:16.189> about

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
that's a little bit too high just about

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.720 
that's a little bit too high just about
right<00:02:17.400> now<00:02:18.090> some<00:02:18.420> people<00:02:18.599> like<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:19.230> run<00:02:19.730> or

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
right now some people like to run or

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.839 
right now some people like to run or
measure<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.599> should<00:02:21.930> say<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.439> bridge<00:02:22.829> pick<00:02:23.670> up

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
measure I should say the bridge pick up

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.899 
measure I should say the bridge pick up
the<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.269> base<00:02:25.200> side<00:02:25.500> down<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.430> little<00:02:26.760> bit

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
the the base side down a little bit

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.910 
the the base side down a little bit
further<00:02:27.150> maybe<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.200> know<00:02:28.319> maybe<00:02:28.590> another

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
further maybe you know maybe another

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.129 
further maybe you know maybe another
64th<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.030> that's<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.389> like<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.599> personal

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:31.139 
64th and that's just like a personal

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:32.929 
64th and that's just like a personal
taste<00:02:31.439> if<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:31.950> find<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.549> bass<00:02:32.760> strings

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
taste if you find that the bass strings

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.030 
taste if you find that the bass strings
are<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.209> little<00:02:33.480> too<00:02:33.750> loud<00:02:34.079> versus<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.709> treble

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
are a little too loud versus the treble

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.280 
are a little too loud versus the treble
strings<00:02:35.219> you<00:02:35.909> can<00:02:35.939> actually<00:02:36.450> take<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:36.930> pick

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
strings you can actually take that pick

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.170 
strings you can actually take that pick
up<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.650> lower<00:02:37.829> and<00:02:38.040> angle<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.519> down<00:02:38.819> if<00:02:39.090> you

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
up and lower and angle it down if you

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.059 
up and lower and angle it down if you
can<00:02:39.329> get<00:02:39.510> like<00:02:39.689> maybe<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.590> know<00:02:42.799> for<00:02:43.799> 30

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
can get like maybe you know for 30

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.490 
can get like maybe you know for 30
seconds<00:02:44.730> or<00:02:45.239> in<00:02:45.510> between<00:02:45.629> that<00:02:46.109> how<00:02:46.349> many

there<00:02:53.400> we<00:02:53.549> go<00:02:53.760> that's<00:02:54.419> about<00:02:54.659> level<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.049> like<00:02:55.079> it

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
there we go that's about level I like it

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.599 
there we go that's about level I like it
level<00:02:55.650> now<00:02:55.739> let's<00:02:55.889> check<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.219> neck<00:02:56.430> pickup

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
a little bit low neck pickup I tend to

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.699 
a little bit low neck pickup I tend to

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
because this magnetic pole is further

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.160 
because this magnetic pole is further

into the closer to the center of the
string<00:03:43.500> now<00:03:43.799> I<00:03:44.099> don't<00:03:44.760> know<00:03:44.909> if<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.030> can<00:03:45.150> see

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
string now I don't know if you can see

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.330 
string now I don't know if you can see
that<00:03:45.420> on<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.629> camera<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.920> elliptical

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
center than it is over here by the

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.160 
center than it is over here by the
bridge<00:03:50.819> in<00:03:51.209> other<00:03:51.359> words<00:03:51.540> there's<00:03:51.959> more

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
bridge in other words there's more

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.709 
bridge in other words there's more
vibrational<00:03:52.889> movement<00:03:53.459> here<00:03:53.790> than<00:03:54.299> close<00:03:54.569> to

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:54.719 
vibrational movement here than close to

vibrational movement here than close to
the<00:03:54.840> bridge<00:03:55.079> so<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:55.530> can<00:03:55.769> get<00:03:55.920> away<00:03:56.040> with

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
the bridge so you can get away with

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.670 
the bridge so you can get away with
running<00:03:57.299> your<00:03:57.329> pickup<00:03:57.989> or<00:03:58.170> adjusting<00:03:58.590> your

running your pickup or adjusting your

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.259 
running your pickup or adjusting your
pickup<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.069> should<00:03:59.250> say<00:03:59.489> closer<00:03:59.909> to<00:04:00.150> your

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
pickup I should say closer to your

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.179 
pickup I should say closer to your
strings<00:04:00.540> toward<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.989> bridge<00:04:01.200> rather<00:04:01.950> than

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
strings toward the bridge rather than

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.339 
strings toward the bridge rather than
toward<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.609> neck<00:04:02.819> so<00:04:03.659> then<00:04:03.780> after<00:04:04.079> you<00:04:04.169> have

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
toward the neck so then after you have

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.349 
toward the neck so then after you have
your<00:04:04.470> measurements<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.129> you're<00:04:05.220> all<00:04:05.340> set<00:04:05.700> put

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
your measurements and you're all set put

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.409 
your measurements and you're all set put
your<00:04:06.510> guard<00:04:06.689> back<00:04:06.930> on<00:04:07.790> to<00:04:08.790> plug<00:04:09.060> her<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.269> and

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
your guard back on to plug her in and

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:10.819 
your guard back on to plug her in and
give<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.569> a<00:04:09.629> shot<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.049> see<00:04:10.109> how<00:04:10.200> it<00:04:10.349> sounds

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
give it a shot and see how it sounds

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.280 
give it a shot and see how it sounds
actually<00:04:11.730> on<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.090> vintage<00:04:12.299> Telecaster<00:04:13.049> type

you may want to leave the pickguard off

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.029 
you may want to leave the pickguard off
