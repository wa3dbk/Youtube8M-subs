wooden species to stay in a woodland

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.270 
wooden species to stay in a woodland
partly<00:01:28.230> because<00:01:28.380> you've<00:01:28.740> always<00:01:28.890> got<00:01:29.160> a<00:01:29.190> new

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
partly because you've always got a new

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.010 
partly because you've always got a new
bit<00:01:29.760> because<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.390> don't<00:01:30.600> copy<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.900> whole

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
bit because you don't copy the whole

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.390 
bit because you don't copy the whole
woodland<00:01:31.350> at<00:01:31.470> once<00:01:31.620> you<00:01:31.830> do<00:01:31.980> a<00:01:32.010> bit<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.280> then

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
woodland at once you do a bit and then

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.710 
woodland at once you do a bit and then
you<00:01:32.490> move<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.760> and<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.030> another<00:01:33.150> bit<00:01:33.480> and<00:01:33.630> then

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
you move on and do another bit and then

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.000 
you move on and do another bit and then
you<00:01:33.810> move<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.080> and<00:01:34.260> do<00:01:34.320> another<00:01:34.410> bit<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.890> so

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
you move on and do another bit and so

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.140 
you move on and do another bit and so
there's<00:01:35.190> always<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.430> bit<00:01:35.640> that's<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> right

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
there's always a bit that's the right

earn<00:02:34.270> a<00:02:34.300> shilling<00:02:34.630> out<00:02:34.990> of<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.320> then<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:36.220> know

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
earn a shilling out of it then you know

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.520 
earn a shilling out of it then you know
and<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.610> don't<00:02:36.790> think<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.330> even<00:02:37.480> needs<00:02:37.990> to<00:02:38.350> be<00:02:38.500> a

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
and I don't think it even needs to be a

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.530 
and I don't think it even needs to be a
fortune<00:02:39.160> they're<00:02:39.370> earning<00:02:39.550> out<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.180> if

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
fortune they're earning out of it if

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.480 
fortune they're earning out of it if
they<00:02:40.930> could<00:02:41.110> actually<00:02:41.260> cover<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:41.980> costs<00:02:42.370> on

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
they could actually cover the costs on

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.730 
they could actually cover the costs on
it<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.880> a<00:02:43.000> little<00:02:43.180> bit<00:02:43.450> more<00:02:43.690> then<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:44.500> think

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
it and a little bit more then I think

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.980 
it and a little bit more then I think
they'd<00:02:44.920> be<00:02:44.980> on<00:02:45.160> board<00:02:45.490> and<00:02:45.790> weave<00:02:46.000> through

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
they'd be on board and weave through

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.090 
they'd be on board and weave through
