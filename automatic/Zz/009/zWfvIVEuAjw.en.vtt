 with the present tonight I do it better than the others 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.350
 they asked me in 3 minutes to say 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.240
 what is innovation? 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.400
 the medias also do it again myself 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.879
 orthopedic - a cat is good 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.580

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.580
 I begin to genoa maybe I pass it 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.090
 innovation in my opinion 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.330
 eheh renewable energy 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.340
 and that passion for the future 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.800
 that makes us say everything alive 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.800
 when others around us say everything down 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.730
 innovation 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.300
 it's not complaining 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.020
 nor is it just indignant 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.070
 linen of innovation are the verbs you find inside they measure to the future 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.430
 connect

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.470
 industry x 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.480
 innovation is a young stuff 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.020
 but really young for this, in my opinion, innovation and rita levi 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.130
 montalcini 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.869
 every 100 years he went to a laboratory at the end of the world 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.330
 to do scientific research these guys 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.640
 last year 101 years 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.970
 two months after breaking his femur 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.080
 he was telling me 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.190

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.169
 young mansion renovation really for this renewal federico morello 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:12.439
 who at the age of 13 wrote a letter to the mayor of a small village that is in 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.329
 friuli 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.739
 he said only dear mayor I want the internet 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:22.379
 and two years later and9 letters after that village finally ceased 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.709
 ita 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.379
 innovation 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.019
 an innovation minister who says we should not invest on the internet 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.579
 why so many Italians 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.079
 they don't use it 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.149
 innovation say in my opinion 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:37.639
 alarm clock italy 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.639
 we don't need the bridge over the strait we need broadband 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.259
 innovation and invite one day in Italy lorenz messengers who brought the 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:49.439
 Chamber of Deputies Flip-flops in front of all types kissy opposes to the future in 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.419
 this country 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.579
 it will be the end of the dinosaurs 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.799
 innovation is celebrating the end of the Pisanu decree 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:00.599
 lighting a spot in an Italian square to see the effect it makes 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:04.939
 and then realize that there is a wonderful stuff that is easy than with 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:05.440
 optics 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.619
 take taste 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.619
 and take it to 150 Italian squares 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.709
 innovation is not 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.899
 compare feisbuk to terrorism but it is a nobel peace prize that it says 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.839
 internet is a gift from god 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:23.429
 innovation realized that the internet is now only a young thing 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:26.269
 but it also and above all serves the elderly 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.599
 essential services are not at home in the pd porte 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.869
 but because it makes me fight the greatest enemy they have in solitude 

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:37.259
 innovation continue to have children in this country but do it 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.799
 thanking your grandparents because without them we will not be able to do all that 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.769

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.069
 and go abroad 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.249
 because you don't want to give up compliments to those who did it 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:57.509
 it takes twice as much courage as talent 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:58.859
 to stay here 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.519
 and try a band here in Naples that they do are even better in my opinion 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.579
 innovation 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.289
 evolen to create an innovation printer 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:12.749
 because 12 billion of innovation funds cannot disappear 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:16.349
 a thousand streams but from a star service of this country's prison talent

 you don't have to come here to look for a job you have to come here to create a 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.039

 let me discover my pride 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.569
 to be Italian 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.569
 innovation 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.550
 it means to have understood 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.639
 that to imitate the silicon valley perfume professor 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.319
 we don't have to bring in Italy 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.150
 new ga granita remoli garage 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.139
 because this is not silicon valley 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.979
 innovation 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.740
 and understand that waste is not a problem in a production country 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.610
 differentiated are not a resource 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.719
 innovation that to say that

 to keep the solar time 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.939
 unfortunately they are not nuclear 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:28.020
 innovation
