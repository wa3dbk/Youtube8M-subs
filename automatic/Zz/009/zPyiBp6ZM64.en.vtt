00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.719 
blend into the hairline and you want to
make<00:01:31.350> sure<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> strokes<00:01:32.070> are<00:01:32.250> seamless

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.679 
upwards you don't want to blend down so
make<00:01:43.470> sure<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.430> lift<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.060> product<00:01:45.509> up
