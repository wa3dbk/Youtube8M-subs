00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Hello dear friends and warmly 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.879
 Welcome back here at the one piece 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.620
 podcast around the theme of the end of 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.510
 ressorts from then we come to the times 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.759
 other pieces did not go on chris 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.950
 rose are present and so it is about the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.929
 it is about was it comes to nani and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.130
 is about job and we now know this 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.680
 grad on the way to st 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.420
 but what happened on the way was happening 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.010
 she believes they will become real now 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.470
 you still believe the wayfarer 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.510
 they are probably different from where else 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.320
 would you them as orienteering terms 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.240
 place 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.890
 Before that must clarify a question is big 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.690
 you really on the ship or have it 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.530
 only a few people sent and sits 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.510
 still somewhere else 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.540
 if I know she should actually 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.100
 so do not be on the ship one 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.290
 You can certainly say so if big 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.149
 name on the ship is then the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.440
 straw on board really no chance 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.200
 to attack this ship so we 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.739
 really just have to flee and 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.270
 Accordingly, I hope, of course 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.789
 that they are not on the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.770
 ship is but where was that is still her 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.039
 flagship that means theoretically 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.090
 she is not quite on the bosses either 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.530
 two ships but it must therefore from where 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.880
 I now come on the program 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.830
 not on the ship it is actually 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.659
 just a source and say we saw 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.250
 that really is the commander of elbit 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.930
 Man really stuck now 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.869
 and accordingly I believe that 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.580
 now with the so with the snail with 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.220
 So big man has communicated about the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.930
 bar and accordingly it seems 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.330
 to be really that Beck did not take 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.939
 was on board and now you would 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.619
 of course it is also think about it 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.350
 actually possible los angeles 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.000
 really this boss attacks and me 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.680
 personally it would be on the aspect 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.689
 Jihad Rafi really pay back 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.520
 asked for permission simply 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.070
 attack back or at least 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.509
 to defend and accordingly 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.310
 Of course it is possible now and it 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.509
 would really fit very well 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.399
 nevertheless they really need one 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.439
 higher bounty and if he has this 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.850
 ship of big mama would attack then 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.159
 I would just jump so big 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.079
 For his head money means we 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.149
 know yes sanchez head I think so 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.399
 now just at 77 million and 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.840
 that is really much too little he 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.270
 really needs a lot more 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.320
 and I would then would such a 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.320
 Attack in any case very good 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.860
 they would come to him this 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.420
 angie should not stick to this idea 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.440
 how come you are coming right now 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.230
 on this aspect 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.000
 well she is just multichannel a lot 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.490
 but currently double fight 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.030
 and as if that's with the ship 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.040
 the admira vacation detached from objects 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.420
 like these leopard types and these 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.620
 egghead can record 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.150
 what the fuck man it's akins me 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.890
 really be underestimated now 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.170
 the refurbished so a bit for now 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.670
 really very hard trained 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.610
 In two years he has every head 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.340
 training the vice of the call of 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.660
 the revolutionary army or it seems 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.700
 really also the first commander of the 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.530
 so I would be 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.150
 now classify after that comes clean 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.550
 But now for the first time back to the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.380
 theme it's susan that really has a lot 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.890
 Hardly trained in two years he has that 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.470
 ht both hgv and he really has 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.990
 the skywalk evolves that means 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.300
 actually the moonwalk from the cp 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.310
 9 and accordingly it really is 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.560
 that he has become very strong in 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.720
 Two years and I personally will 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.770
 hope for every case or I believe 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.780
 really very firm that it 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.470
 at least against one of the commanders 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.170
 arrive 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.290
 yes but actually against the 2 the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.489
 whole little statisticians and maybe 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.959
 is he still someone else on the ship? 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.890
 Above all, stop is not stronger in the 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.120
 current state is but what is 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.830
 because you can still collect with them 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.260
 actually go and then you can 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.820
 the straw hats and support for 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.250
 he too is really interested 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.470
 fight against the big name crew now 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.200
 and he really is not 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.170
 thinks cesar has captured 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.290
 yes no server with names or give 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.090
 would 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.440
 but in any case I think he has 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.269
 definitely interesting against 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.620
 beckmann to fight because if you do 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.440
 think about what's happening 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.880
 is he betrayed beckmann that is 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.290
 only in her eyes a traitor to her 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.489
 maybe they would torture 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.530
 maybe get executed 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.269
 You do not know how spirited 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.890
 are emperors and accordingly 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.660
 I believe in any case that he 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.730
 Now his interest has let you of 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.290
 beckmann to be captured and 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.780
 I think so too 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.900
 he prefers to fight the straw hats instead 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.419
 really to be captured 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.980
 only if you let go of him he would 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.700
 dissolve in smoke and then 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.830
 fly away 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.110
 Well , you know, you really do escape 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.740
 in doubt, there was van tienen again 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.840
 son si 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.430
 No, I mean the Czech skywalk 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.389
 that means he will never become this 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.180
 escape 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.410
 of course it is that is a bit 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.440
 to doubt the theory a bit 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.660
 I can understand that, of course 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.060
 In any case, I believe that there 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.130
 cesar at least with the tracks 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.680
 that will fight together again 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.669
 I hope there really boils down to friends 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.530
 Of course we are now at another 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.789
 opinion happens write your opinion 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.660
 on this topic simply in the 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.639
 Comments 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.870
 and then we can use the comments to on 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.590
 discuss once more 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.199
 in short what appeal to that and that 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.669
 ship is four or three times bigger 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:08.190
 as the complete islands is exactly right 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:11.159
 why nobody notices the ship 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.360
 also stancescu keep it clear 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.009
 maybe it really rules 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.150
 buy dress pink and maybe are 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.099
 they really all just like that 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.720
 she really cares 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.599
 did not notice that such a big one 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.759
 Ship on the island 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.699
 is or is almost an island 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:27.360
 has created three times the size of the 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.770
 island 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.120
 maybe someone can explain it to me or 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.580
 live images of the birdcage not only 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.229
 these threads but also a mirror of 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.840
 Keep the outer covering so keep the chamber 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.099
 do not look outside 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.560
 but of course it's really a lot 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:46.440
 interesting theory and of course that would be 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.449
 that possible but unfortunately it was already 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.349
 disproved and his fight between for 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.120
 the toronto 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.400
 since that was so really 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.440
 fujikura a big meteorite from 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.490
 has brought heaven and you already have 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.490
 seen how he really is on the 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.840
 birdcage to guest is accordingly 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.690
 is a reflection unfortunately not possible 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.219
 and you really have those with you now 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.900
 theories seen accordingly who 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:09.419
 unfortunately, this theory too 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.860
 refutes but overall we all hope 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.139
 probably that he really now 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.430
 santschi also has the guts to the 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.750
 now attack the ship 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.250
 maybe the straw hats 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.289
 general rich who knows maybe 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.550
 is much stronger and from the group 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:22.409
 we do not have much 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.449
 I think that's what happened 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:26.069
 has become very strong and overall 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:27.810
 of course we all really hope 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.969
 that he attack this ship 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.319
 but so friends then what is 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:34.050
 actually already from these parts 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:36.449
 And this day was about the day 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.790
 Crew are now on the way to 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:38.950
 st 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.110
 and we have a little bit more about it now 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.820
 spoken and in the next part it goes 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.320
 then almost to the revolution sunny 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.060
 will talk about the emperor 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.130
 We will also talk about alliances 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.840
 speak the pirate alliances 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.520
 who oppose the emperors 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.390
 means quite a lot for you 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.860
 topics open 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.690
 it's best you just leave this video 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.490
 a thumb up there clicks here 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.530
 above for and on the next part 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.480
 to come and then I would say 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:04.620
