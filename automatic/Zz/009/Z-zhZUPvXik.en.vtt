00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
battery which is over here just by

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.680 
battery which is over here just by
pushing<00:00:54.739> on<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.129> right<00:00:55.309> side<00:00:55.609> the<00:00:56.269> battery

pushing on the right side the battery

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.680 
pushing on the right side the battery
lock<00:00:57.260> will<00:00:57.500> give<00:00:57.800> away<00:00:58.039> and<00:00:58.719> then<00:01:01.269> this<00:01:02.269> is<00:01:02.449> the

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
lock will give away and then this is the

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.229 
lock will give away and then this is the
entire<00:01:03.260> compartment<00:01:04.070> which<00:01:04.670> is<00:01:04.790> holding<00:01:05.059> the

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
entire compartment which is holding the

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.910 
entire compartment which is holding the
RAM<00:01:05.449> and<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.750> harddrive<00:01:06.080> there<00:01:06.350> is<00:01:06.440> one<00:01:06.620> screw

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
RAM and the harddrive there is one screw

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.760 
RAM and the harddrive there is one screw
over<00:01:06.980> here<00:01:07.400> another<00:01:07.790> screw<00:01:08.090> one<00:01:08.270> over<00:01:08.690> here<00:01:08.960> so

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
over here another screw one over here so

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.710 
over here another screw one over here so
you<00:01:09.800> basically<00:01:10.370> need<00:01:10.730> a<00:01:10.790> star<00:01:11.240> screwdriver

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:24.280 

something<00:01:14.720> like<00:01:14.840> this<00:01:15.050> to<00:01:15.890> unscrew

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.290 

keep<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.040> screws<00:01:25.340> aside

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.800 

just<00:01:30.900> take<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.670> -<00:01:32.670> screwdriver<00:01:33.120> and<00:01:33.570> this

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
just take a - screwdriver and this

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.980 
just take a - screwdriver and this
protrude<00:01:34.800> this<00:01:35.070> portion<00:01:35.850> over<00:01:36.030> here<00:01:38.750> gently

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
as you can see this is the RAM bay area

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.250 
as you can see this is the RAM bay area
this<00:01:49.650> is<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.100> hard<00:01:50.400> drive<00:01:50.580> area<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.840> Dell<00:01:52.140> has

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
this is the hard drive area so Dell has

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.780 
this is the hard drive area so Dell has
made<00:01:52.410> it<00:01:52.500> very<00:01:52.560> simple<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:53.160> can<00:01:53.190> also<00:01:53.400> replace

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
made it very simple you can also replace

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.490 
made it very simple you can also replace
the<00:01:53.850> Wi-Fi<00:01:54.240> chip<00:01:54.480> just<00:01:54.780> by<00:01:54.900> removing<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.290> one

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
the Wi-Fi chip just by removing this one

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.610 
the Wi-Fi chip just by removing this one
school<00:01:56.240> for<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.360> RAM<00:01:57.540> there<00:01:58.170> are<00:01:58.290> two<00:01:58.470> slots

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
school for the RAM there are two slots

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.060 
school for the RAM there are two slots
so<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.670> just<00:01:59.910> need<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.680> both<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.800> them<00:02:01.920> are

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
so you just need to both of them are

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.380 
so you just need to both of them are
consumed<00:02:02.430> at<00:02:02.550> this<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.880> time<00:02:03.060> because

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
consumed at this one of time because

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.880 
consumed at this one of time because
this<00:02:03.570> laptop<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:04.200> are<00:02:04.260> upgrading<00:02:04.380> is

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
this laptop that we are upgrading is

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.670 
this laptop that we are upgrading is
having<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.940> 8gb<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:07.110> if<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.290> want<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.500> operate

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
having the 8gb so if you want to operate

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.889 
having the 8gb so if you want to operate
it<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.950> 16gb<00:02:08.340> both<00:02:09.000> these<00:02:09.240> DIMMs<00:02:09.540> have<00:02:09.720> been

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
it to 16gb both these DIMMs have been

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.650 
it to 16gb both these DIMMs have been
removed<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.710> we<00:02:11.460> need<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.730> replace<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.120> with<00:02:12.420> 8

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
removed and we need to replace it with 8

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.820 
removed and we need to replace it with 8
plus<00:02:12.930> 8<00:02:13.080> 16<00:02:13.260> GB<00:02:13.740> so<00:02:14.930> user<00:02:15.930> 2<00:02:16.140> fingers<00:02:16.470> thumbs

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
you need to just use a - pin and you can

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.850 
you need to just use a - pin and you can
just<00:02:49.880> remember<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.330> is<00:02:51.510> very<00:02:51.630> simple
