00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:17.890
 I believe that all 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:21.460
 players will usually dream of 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.650
 direct the clubs where they have where this 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.750
 state 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.980
 yes clear clear I think about having a 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.170
 possibility I wish I could have the chance 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.810
 you never know this is very difficult there 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.610
 many interests there are many things 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:45.440
 that escape to one of the hands 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.960
 but but if I think that if it 's something 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.530
 what I would love to have the chance in 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.530
 some future 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.120
 because I love the fans of 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.660
 pumas 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:02.360
 this identified I am in contact with 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.500
 a lot of hobby normally 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.180
 And of course 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.670
 I would love to have the possibility 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.670
 to be inside at some point 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:21.290
 I finished this year in my first year at the 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:25.670
 coach's course still remains for me 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:28.400
 all this year and then if my intention is 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.240
 return to Mexico to be able to direct in 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.990
 Mexico 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.560
 I 'm probably with my family coming 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.800
 to live here again 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.900
 and if my goal is 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.900
 to work here in mexico 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.800
 I believe that today America is much more 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.100
 consolidated as a team of what is 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.100
 pumas 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.510
 in ability of players surely 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.150
 america has a much more campus 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.110
 important of the one that has cougars today 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.539
 any team can beat the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.380
 america no no we are not talking about a 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.320
 beatable equipment 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.530
 I believe without doubt it just pachuca 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:19.070
 achieve in Aztec then I think if 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.610
 more have to leave you have to feel 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.610
 not sure 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.820
 well coaches who have not had the 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.620
 pumas philosophy and they meet with 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.220
 problems because they do not want to impose 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.680
 Maybe this is your ideas and many times the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.180
 ideas of a coach are not 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.180
 compatible with those that have a 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.370
 historical institution then they have 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:50.230
 there have been processes that have been completed 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.840
 cutting half and that has not done 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.280
 maintain a regularity that 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.590
 It is usually the one that helps you 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.549
 get the results started wrong the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.579
 tournament they did not want this was talked about that 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.769
 he was going to go coaches and he 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.290
 achieved three wins this was positioned 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.360
 pumas among the first of the tournament 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.370
 Mexican and it seems that there is no 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.370
 problems then many times this is the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.370
 anxiety 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.750
 the finished results 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.760
 accelerating processes and it's never this 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.350
 prudent that the processes go away 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.350
 accelerating too fast
