00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.279
 To In this video 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:13.460
 Full united around the original Og 03 gun 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:19.460
 I would like to introduce the deformation coalesce to the haughtiness 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:22.440
 Be deformed after the pride is gorgeous and blade section as well robot 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.640
 The original vehicle mode 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.980
 I will transform 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.980
 Then I think that I would like to refund from the original first 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.140
 At first we lower our feet 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.740
 Lift the belly hoodie 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.210
 I love my face 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.190
 Arms forward 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.220
 Take your arms out 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.570
 Make a 180 degree panel sideways 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.570
 Open arms 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.910
 Each part of the instrument 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.270
 Do not spread over 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.050
 On foot 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.050
 90 degree 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.530
 Remove the bend joint 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.900
 180 degrees 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.410
 Expand 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.410
 Foot 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.190
 It rotates like this 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.190
 Parts of the back 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.130
 Lift up and rotate the state well 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.520
 to return to the part 3 Pu 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.920
 I'm finished with this and I hope to continue transforming Kenyama 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.860
 So far coalescence process of the same 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.870
 First of all , 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.470
 I will store 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.280
 I will leave the parts again 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.409
 I will store my head 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.609
 I will spread my legs a little on the two-handed air from the knee 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.609
 On top 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.140
 90 degrees from this part 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.340
 U 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.340
 Rotate eh 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.250
 Press a foot from below the knee 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.349
 I remember my feet because I aimed at 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.550
 I will raise my part and the island foot 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.680
 It is completed above 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.359
 The upper part finally transforms the people 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.359
 I will store my head first 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.530
 I think I put my arms 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.020
 Toe 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.190
 Shadow 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.210
 Defeat me 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.210
 Rotate 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.220
 Lift the wing 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.750
 Wing 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.060
 Kushitani bends 90 degrees 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.290
 that's all 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.290
 Leo will take over 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.989
 mother 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.190
 The union count flows like this 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:03.950
 Also 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:03.950
 A case where the button Shome geology but one of the sound to flow in such a case 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:36.849
 Huh 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:36.849
 The balance is pretty bad like the other two bodies 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.680
 After all the back will be heavy 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.689
 Similarly, stock strength left over a helmet 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.189
 As a weapon like this 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:52.189
 So it can coalesce 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.050
 I think that maybe the balance will be better with this in hand 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.150
 The other is 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.150
 A combination of three weapons 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.310
 Can be installed 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.389
 I was able to barely stand alone with this 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.500
 Above was the introduction of the modified union to the Karasuma King
