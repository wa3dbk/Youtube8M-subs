was really pretty so I'm like oh let me
try<00:00:20.090> and<00:00:20.650> so<00:00:21.650> far<00:00:21.920> you<00:00:22.610> know<00:00:22.670> it's<00:00:22.880> not<00:00:23.030> too<00:00:23.180> bad

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
try and so far you know it's not too bad

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.520 
try and so far you know it's not too bad
I'm<00:00:24.080> not<00:00:24.320> sure<00:00:24.500> that<00:00:24.530> I<00:00:24.740> picked<00:00:25.040> it<00:00:25.220> out<00:00:25.370> enough

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530 
I'm not sure that I picked it out enough

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.710 
I'm not sure that I picked it out enough
so<00:00:27.530> it's<00:00:28.430> probably<00:00:28.790> not<00:00:28.910> as<00:00:29.090> big<00:00:29.330> as<00:00:29.450> it<00:00:29.540> could

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
so it's probably not as big as it could

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.180 
so it's probably not as big as it could
be<00:00:29.870> but<00:00:30.020> I<00:00:30.080> didn't<00:00:30.320> want<00:00:30.440> it<00:00:30.500> to<00:00:30.560> get<00:00:30.800> frizzy

stay tuned for the tutorial so I started

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.700 
stay tuned for the tutorial so I started
off<00:01:12.079> with<00:01:12.560> freshly<00:01:13.159> washed<00:01:13.310> hair<00:01:13.509> well<00:01:14.710> gotten

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
off with freshly washed hair well gotten

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.410 
off with freshly washed hair well gotten
a<00:01:15.740> little<00:01:15.979> dry<00:01:16.189> so<00:01:16.490> I<00:01:16.520> had<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.729> take<00:01:16.909> my<00:01:17.090> spray

a little dry so I had to take my spray
bottle<00:01:17.509> I<00:01:18.110> think<00:01:18.710> there<00:01:18.920> might<00:01:19.039> have<00:01:19.100> been<00:01:19.219> a

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
bottle I think there might have been a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.330 
bottle I think there might have been a
little<00:01:19.610> olive<00:01:19.909> oil<00:01:20.030> in<00:01:20.240> there<00:01:20.479> but<00:01:20.689> not<00:01:20.840> much

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
little olive oil in there but not much

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
saturated it a little bit just to get it

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.980 
saturated it a little bit just to get it
wet<00:01:25.100> again<00:01:25.250> it's<00:01:25.969> by<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:26.270> time<00:01:26.479> it<00:01:26.659> had<00:01:26.780> dried

moisture<00:02:18.490> with<00:02:19.490> coconut<00:02:20.000> oil<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:21.680> use<00:02:21.920> my

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099

of it that's it by the way the taka

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.990 
of it that's it by the way the taka
Latika<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:30.110> think<00:02:30.410> it's<00:02:30.560> fatique<00:02:30.890> a--<00:02:31.069> but<00:02:31.760> yeah

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
so I use my coconut oil to seal in the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.800 
so I use my coconut oil to seal in the
moisture<00:02:36.069> before<00:02:37.069> I<00:02:37.310> get<00:02:37.550> started<00:02:37.760> with<00:02:38.239> the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
moisture before I get started with the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.910 
moisture before I get started with the
twisting<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:41.150> between<00:02:41.330> those<00:02:41.690> I<00:02:42.110> take<00:02:42.739> my

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
twisting and in between those I take my

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.770

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
then I proceed to wrap it around itself

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.729 
then I proceed to wrap it around itself
wrapping<00:03:46.150> around<00:03:46.239> itself<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.930> then<00:03:47.170> kind<00:03:47.620> of

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
wrapping around itself and then kind of

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.610

stick<00:03:47.950> it<00:03:47.980> through<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:49.390> make<00:03:49.599> a<00:03:49.870> little<00:03:50.290> bit<00:03:50.470> of

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
stick it through to make a little bit of

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.680 
stick it through to make a little bit of
a<00:03:50.739> knot<00:03:51.010> but<00:03:51.280> not<00:03:51.489> really<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:52.090> don't<00:03:52.390> like<00:03:52.540> to

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
a knot but not really I don't like to

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.020 
a knot but not really I don't like to
use<00:03:52.720> bobby<00:03:53.140> pins<00:03:53.530> so<00:03:53.739> I<00:03:54.190> just<00:03:54.489> kind<00:03:54.700> of<00:03:54.790> tuck<00:03:55.000> it

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
use bobby pins so I just kind of tuck it

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.949 
use bobby pins so I just kind of tuck it
in<00:03:55.239> so<00:03:55.569> it<00:03:56.080> stays<00:03:57.209> then<00:03:58.209> I<00:03:58.239> do<00:03:58.480> that<00:03:58.720> with<00:03:58.840> the

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
in so it stays then I do that with the

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.720 
in so it stays then I do that with the
other<00:03:59.110> side<00:03:59.200> here's<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.040> finished<00:04:00.430> look

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
other side here's the finished look

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.589 
other side here's the finished look
after<00:04:01.540> I've<00:04:01.660> done<00:04:01.900> both<00:04:02.140> sections<00:04:02.950> I<00:04:03.599> then

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
after I've done both sections I then

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.110 
after I've done both sections I then
take<00:04:04.840> my<00:04:05.019> Owen<00:04:05.440> hand<00:04:05.769> mades<00:04:06.040> juices<00:04:06.970> and

berries<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:08.079> I<00:04:08.950> spray<00:04:09.549> my<00:04:09.579> head<00:04:09.910> just<00:04:10.349> to<00:04:11.349> get

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
berries and I spray my head just to get

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.379 
berries and I spray my head just to get
a<00:04:11.500> little<00:04:11.680> extra<00:04:12.010> moisture<00:04:12.310> in<00:04:12.610> there<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:15.389> I

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
a little extra moisture in there and I

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.180 
a little extra moisture in there and I

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
sections so out of each twist I have two

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.390 
sections so out of each twist I have two
sides<00:05:21.300> or<00:05:21.660> two<00:05:21.900> sections<00:05:22.380> and<00:05:22.710> out<00:05:23.070> of<00:05:23.220> each

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
sides or two sections and out of each

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.760 
sides or two sections and out of each
section<00:05:23.730> I<00:05:24.090> will<00:05:24.270> make<00:05:24.450> two<00:05:24.660> more<00:05:24.810> sections<00:05:25.140> so

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
section I will make two more sections so

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.910 
section I will make two more sections so
I'll<00:05:26.430> get<00:05:26.760> four<00:05:27.030> sections<00:05:27.660> out<00:05:27.900> of<00:05:28.170> each<00:05:28.560> twist

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
I'll get four sections out of each twist

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.920 
I'll get four sections out of each twist
which<00:05:29.250> is<00:05:29.430> normally<00:05:30.030> what<00:05:30.060> I<00:05:30.210> do<00:05:30.300> with<00:05:30.690> my

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
which is normally what I do with my

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.450 
which is normally what I do with my
standard<00:05:31.440> twist<00:05:31.710> outs<00:05:31.950> anyway<00:05:34.040> so<00:05:35.040> yeah<00:05:35.220> go

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460
