00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
actually is exactly what I did but um in

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.519 
actually is exactly what I did but um in
my<00:00:14.429> defense<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.330> seller<00:00:15.809> did<00:00:16.049> have<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.350> listed

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
my defense the seller did have it listed

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.950 
my defense the seller did have it listed
as<00:00:16.890> DC<00:00:17.490> SH<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.300> didn't<00:00:18.539> realize<00:00:18.779> there's

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
as DC SH and I didn't realize there's

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.500 
as DC SH and I didn't realize there's
more<00:00:19.260> than<00:00:19.380> one<00:00:19.500> version<00:00:19.710> but<00:00:20.310> now<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.240> know

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
more than one version but now you know

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.560 
more than one version but now you know
and<00:00:21.750> knowing<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.289> half<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.560> battle<00:00:23.210> the<00:00:24.210> DC

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
and knowing is half the battle the DC

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.540 
and knowing is half the battle the DC
superheroes<00:00:25.199> version<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.859> obviously<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
superheroes version is obviously the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.880 
superheroes version is obviously the
better<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:27.150> they<00:00:27.869> retooled<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.590> figure<00:00:28.859> a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
better one they retooled the figure a

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.890 
better one they retooled the figure a
little<00:00:29.039> bit<00:00:29.369> gave<00:00:29.640> him<00:00:29.789> elbow<00:00:30.090> articulation

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
little bit gave him elbow articulation

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.200 
little bit gave him elbow articulation
so<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.349> actually<00:00:31.410> hold<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.130> gun<00:00:32.550> as<00:00:32.820> it

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
so we can actually hold the gun as it

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.630 
so we can actually hold the gun as it
was<00:00:33.329> meant<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.690> be<00:00:33.719> held<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.950> USC<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> little

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
was meant to be held so USC is a little

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.240 
was meant to be held so USC is a little
handle<00:00:35.940> here<00:00:35.969> for<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.450> other<00:00:36.570> hand<00:00:36.840> but

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
handle here for the other hand but

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.819 
handle here for the other hand but
there's<00:00:38.250> no<00:00:38.399> way<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.579> get<00:00:38.760> these<00:00:38.879> two<00:00:39.059> arms<00:00:39.360> to

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
there's no way you get these two arms to

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.310 
there's no way you get these two arms to
reach<00:00:40.829> each<00:00:40.890> other<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.820> then<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> paint<00:00:43.170> was

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
reach each other and then the paint was

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.080 
reach each other and then the paint was
a<00:00:43.379> lot<00:00:43.590> cooler<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.340> your<00:00:44.460> little<00:00:44.550> icicles

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
a lot cooler so your little icicles

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.479 
a lot cooler so your little icicles
hanging<00:00:45.510> off<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.899> armor<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:46.530> lot<00:00:47.309> more

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
hanging off the armor and then lot more

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.479 
hanging off the armor and then lot more
variation<00:00:48.440> speaking<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.530> variation<00:00:50.219> there's

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
variation speaking of variation there's

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.819 
variation speaking of variation there's
also<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.969> classes<00:00:51.809> list<00:00:52.140> version<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.739> this

also a classes list version of this

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.090 
also a classes list version of this
figure<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.870> much<00:00:54.870> worth<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> DC<00:00:55.500> superheroes

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
figure a much worth the DC superheroes

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.790 
figure a much worth the DC superheroes
one<00:00:56.309> also<00:00:56.820> had<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> glasses<00:00:57.660> list<00:00:57.899> version<00:00:58.500> but

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.750 
one also had a glasses list version but
you<00:00:59.280> know<00:01:00.710> because<00:01:01.710> most<00:01:02.010> people<00:01:02.370> would<00:01:02.489> one

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
you know because most people would one

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.969 
you know because most people would one
with<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.300> glasses<00:01:03.570> anyway<00:01:04.170> I'm<00:01:04.320> sure<00:01:04.830> it's

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
with the glasses anyway I'm sure it's

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.190 
with the glasses anyway I'm sure it's
not<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.339> big<00:01:05.580> loss<00:01:05.850> either<00:01:06.150> way<00:01:07.369> now<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:09.200> this

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
not a big loss either way now on this

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.289 
not a big loss either way now on this
figure<00:01:10.590> has<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.890> little<00:01:11.250> gimmick<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.119> can

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
figure has a little gimmick here you can

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.480 
figure has a little gimmick here you can
twist<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.930> torso<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.470> move<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.010> head<00:01:14.189> inside

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
twist the torso to move the head inside

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.210 
twist the torso to move the head inside
the<00:01:14.640> helmet<00:01:15.439> honestly<00:01:16.439> would<00:01:16.560> prefer<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.009> just

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the helmet honestly would prefer to just

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.950 
the helmet honestly would prefer to just
be<00:01:17.460> able<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.700> take<00:01:17.880> off<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> helmet<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.780> move

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the head but then I also believe the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.960 
the head but then I also believe the
squirts<00:01:22.409> water<00:01:22.710> although<00:01:23.070> I've<00:01:23.310> never<00:01:23.340> tried

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
squirts water although I've never tried

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.380 
squirts water although I've never tried
it<00:01:24.030> i<00:01:25.040> bought<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.070> loose<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.670> don't<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
it i bought it loose so I don't have the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.060 
it i bought it loose so I don't have the
packaging<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.020> explain<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.530> but<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.890> see

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
packaging to explain it but you can see

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.249 
packaging to explain it but you can see
that<00:01:29.100> there<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> little<00:01:29.850> spigot<00:01:30.659> here<00:01:31.020> for

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
that there is a little spigot here for

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.039 
that there is a little spigot here for
the<00:01:31.350> water<00:01:31.500> shooting<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.159> then<00:01:32.689> imagine<00:01:33.689> that

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the water shooting and then imagine that

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.020 
the water shooting and then imagine that
here<00:01:34.259> goes<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:35.220> little<00:01:35.430> button<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:35.700> is
