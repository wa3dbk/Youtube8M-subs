and<00:00:26.269> coach<00:00:26.599> said<00:00:26.869> take<00:00:27.140> it<00:00:27.169> to<00:00:27.380> the<00:00:27.499> house<00:00:27.710> and

I<00:00:28.039> guess<00:00:28.339> the<00:00:28.550> Cardinals<00:00:29.089> were<00:00:29.269> listening

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
I guess the Cardinals were listening

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.300 
I guess the Cardinals were listening
because<00:00:30.169> the<00:00:30.289> first<00:00:30.560> time<00:00:30.769> they<00:00:30.949> touched<00:00:31.220> the

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
because the first time they touched the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.310 
because the first time they touched the
ball<00:00:31.550> that<00:00:31.789> give<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.150> number<00:00:32.450> five<00:00:32.720> and<00:00:32.750> forty

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
ball that give the number five and forty

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.800
