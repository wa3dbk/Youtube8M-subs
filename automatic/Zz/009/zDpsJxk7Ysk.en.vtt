I just lightly tap on it and I just

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:41.860 
I just lightly tap on it and I just
build<00:01:29.870> it<00:01:29.990> up<00:01:30.140> on<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.440> sides

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
and let it build up on its own I come in

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.170 
and let it build up on its own I come in
with<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.230> paintbrush<00:01:46.830> in<00:01:47.190> this<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.820> phone

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
with a paintbrush in this I have a phone

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.630 
with a paintbrush in this I have a phone

and<00:01:53.850> get<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.060> all<00:01:54.330> working<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.590> not<00:02:06.500> just<00:02:07.500> what

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
and get it all working and not just what

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.810 
and get it all working and not just what
I<00:02:08.369> always<00:02:08.730> think<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.240> ballasting<00:02:10.460> is<00:02:11.460> in<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
I always think is ballasting is in the

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.890 
I always think is ballasting is in the
art<00:02:15.530> it's<00:02:16.530> better<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.190> ballast<00:02:17.730> if<00:02:18.690> you're

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
art it's better to ballast if you're

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.940 
art it's better to ballast if you're
starting<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:20.070> model<00:02:20.910> where<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.320> want<00:02:22.560> to

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
starting a model where and you want to

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.680 
starting a model where and you want to
buy<00:02:23.100> italics<00:02:23.700> if<00:02:23.790> your<00:02:23.910> track<00:02:24.210> it's<00:02:24.450> better

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
buy italics if your track it's better

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.510 
buy italics if your track it's better
that<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.140> bounce<00:02:25.410> your<00:02:25.710> track<00:02:25.920> first<00:02:26.250> before

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
that you bounce your track first before

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.410 
that you bounce your track first before
you<00:02:26.790> start<00:02:26.820> doing<00:02:27.270> any<00:02:27.480> type<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.410> scenery<00:02:29.420> but

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
you start doing any type of scenery but

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.950 
you start doing any type of scenery but
I<00:02:30.720> didn't<00:02:31.820> do<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.330> I'm<00:02:33.570> paying<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
I didn't do that so I'm paying the

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.800 
I didn't do that so I'm paying the
consequence<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.950> if<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.400> mess<00:02:35.610> up<00:02:37.400> like<00:02:38.400> that

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
consequence and if I mess up like that

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.620 
consequence and if I mess up like that
it's<00:02:39.810> kind<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.110> hard<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.410> get<00:02:40.740> it<00:02:41.270> all<00:02:42.270> over<00:02:42.540> the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
it's kind of hard to get it all over the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.960 
it's kind of hard to get it all over the
place

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
place

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.560 
place
and<00:02:44.970> what<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.120> do<00:02:45.440> is<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.590> take<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.800> foam<00:02:47.070> brush

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
and what I do is I take a foam brush

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.130 
and what I do is I take a foam brush
looks<00:02:48.570> like<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:50.370> I'll<00:02:50.459> come<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:51.140> and

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
looks like this and I'll come in and

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.680 
looks like this and I'll come in and
brush<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.740> off<00:02:52.770> your<00:02:53.100> ties
