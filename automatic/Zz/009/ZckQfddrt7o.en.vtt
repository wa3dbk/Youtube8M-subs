 to ask one thing I believe in a 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.400
 sink and I 'm talking about those vamp 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.629

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:19.550
 lend this to the vampire fear 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.269
 the zeca asks the team to stay at the hotel 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.740
 pine we will give more than 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.840
 that creature that feeds on the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.760
 essence of the other person's life 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.949
 in mythology as we know are beings 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.620
 that suck sanguine but in real life 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.239
 there is another concept 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.280
 knows that person you can not 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.290
 spend a lot of time on the side you get 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.149
 Exhausted and you do not know how to explain. 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.710
 exactly the reason then maybe it's a 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.899
 good morning in the south of mine and energy mme 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.610
 says that 's exactly why it started a lot 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.370

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.379
 catalog as well as vampire types 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.789
 real life this phrase today, it's fuck 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.039
 It is important to say that in most 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.030
 Sometimes a vampire does not know he's a 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.890
 vampire 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.020
 Look what crazy, my friends, better. 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.390
 pay attention you may not realize that 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.860
 you look there 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.090
 I wanted to give the credits of the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.130
 Things I'm going to talk about here set 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.119
 Everything else says that I did the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.610
 my research 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.020
 there they cite ten types of vampires but 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.549
 I decided to choose five that are the most 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.140
 are known if you want to know if 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.850
 look at the description that I'm going to leave a dust 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.590
 Do you know that kind of person who 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.509
 only talk about her the whole time she knows that 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.979
 Take care to become a speech therapist. 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.650
 Shitting and walking to you when you 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.869

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.369
 She does not even talk about hers on hers. 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.040
 had to see what happens is to stay 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.780

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.780
 advice is good because she likes 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.119
 shit she wants shit they wallow in 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.759
 shit in a way that you end up with 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.549

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.259
 attention full time she wants you 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.930

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.310
 wondering why you're going to have a 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.950
 call because you're not responding 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.160
 messages disappear because you are 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.110
 of those who are studying the bible if 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.910
 If you let yourself feel guilty then 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.820

 I'm honest, I'm honest, no team at all. 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.320
 who cares about you, she motivates you 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.940
 It puts us work, you can be 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.489

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.970
 want what happens the person is not 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.920

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.989
 praised it too much when everything else 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.730
 Maybe you're suspicious because they 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.980
 Do you want something else you know? 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.690

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.090

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.329
 You know it's a crazy lack of touch. 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.519
 to make a face for what you want 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.640
 to get the right attention you know that you 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.630
 Are you looking at her then? 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.010
 gives an impression that she is 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:52.820
 wanting to pull me to her knows the time 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.040
 whole and I'm starting there I stay 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.970
 troubled charitable that my daughter 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.160

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.090
 banker and resolved to be completely 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.620
 studied little if fucking the 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.000
 another one does not care if the other goes 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.010
 feel more or less like I said before 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.660
 it is something half unconscious person 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.540
 Do not you know she's doing it now? 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.070
 how to deal with this type of person is 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.750
 difficult because often you do not have 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.640
 how to escape it is inserted in the middle 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.170
 You have no way of getting rid of the environment. 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.239
 of that shit and need to live with 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.920
 she think you need to arm yourself 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.020
 my friend is not allowed to affect 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.580
 understood not paid attention lets walk 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.230
 here and leaving here do not 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.760
 I know that many times the 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.350
 people want to help but sometimes the person 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.300
 Do not you want to help yourself do what she is? 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.180
 banging his head on the edge of the table 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.010
 one of the people we look at is going to look for a 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.210
 therapist half an hour that is expensive and I think 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.530
 that this is the best way to help a 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.510
 person that is how she needs to be 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.520
 solve with herself has things that 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.170
