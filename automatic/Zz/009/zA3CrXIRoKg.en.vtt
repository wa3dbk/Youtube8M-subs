00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:21.390
 and then people here are the oil and today I go 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.590
 bring you another game of 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.160
 browser 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.840
 Today's game is an onyx game. 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.960
 3d always wants plugin always and it is 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.320
 a game of jung 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.570
 He calls himself a dead island. He's a young man. 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.070
 very cool that I found there 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.410
 it was made by martim games and me 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.770
 I really liked this game because of the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.489
 graphic quality and also because it is well 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.820
 fun because kind c're on an island in 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:02.520
 middle of nowhere is a bit of a clichÃ© 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:05.909
 truth does not tell what happens you have 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.860
 agreed on the island and trade be there 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.060
 within a notion of the type not 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.119
 resident living 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.420
 There you will explore a little later 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.400
 It goes out there that's cool but 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.570
 you will see in the background of the gameplay how 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.180
 is that the graphics quality is very good 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.570
 and the gameplay is also very good 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.740
 is one of the best thing in this game 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.890
 besides dung it 's cool 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.400
 In my taste, of course, there is a 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.780
 arsenal up to great pressure game 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.540
 unity, not as much as it should 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.370
 has more than 100 weapons but this item 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.620
 for it does not look like much but at the time of 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:57.170
 game you will see that it looks like a game of 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:59.690
 First-person shooter is good and has a 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.450
 sword type a ninja katana 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.280
 I also have the pistol I never 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.850
 I managed to find but I'm sure that 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.860
 has that is that when the two grip does not pass 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.940
 by no weapon and three have already 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.840
 machine gun has to mp five all the 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.930
 start has all the game of fps and has a 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.010
 shotgun I know does not look like many guns 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.090
 No, but the game is too short. 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.910
 but he has a very good training, right? 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.190
 he has other monsters in 61 bi tem's 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.510
 as if it were a resident evil even has 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.770
 some monster is more evolved with 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.750
 no one to develop the spider 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:47.690
 giant scorpion these things 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.989
 So that's it, I hope you like the 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.400
