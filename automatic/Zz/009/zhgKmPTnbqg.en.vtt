doubt<00:02:08.670> we'll<00:02:08.940> get<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.179> information<00:02:09.450> on

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
doubt we'll get that information on

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.690 
doubt we'll get that information on
Sunday<00:02:10.080> morning<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.800> have<00:02:11.250> Jamal<00:02:11.550> Charles

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
Sunday morning so I have Jamal Charles

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.920 
Sunday morning so I have Jamal Charles
ranked<00:02:12.030> as<00:02:12.090> my<00:02:12.180> number<00:02:12.300> six

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
ranked as my number six

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.780 
ranked as my number six
running<00:02:13.079> back<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.769> week<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.219> think<00:02:14.609> if<00:02:14.700> he

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
running back of the week I think if he

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.640 
running back of the week I think if he
plays<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.329> have<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.870> play<00:02:16.049> him<00:02:16.079> because

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
plays you have to play him because

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.709 
plays you have to play him because
during<00:02:17.159> bye<00:02:17.400> weeks<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.939> where<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.329> drafted

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719 
during bye weeks and where you drafted

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:19.970 
during bye weeks and where you drafted
him<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.870> probably<00:02:19.140> don't<00:02:19.379> have<00:02:19.439> any<00:02:19.769> other

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
him you probably don't have any other

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.500 
him you probably don't have any other
alternatives<00:02:20.640> hopefully<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.209> have<00:02:21.329> Knile

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
alternatives hopefully you have Knile

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.970 
alternatives hopefully you have Knile
Davis<00:02:21.540> as<00:02:22.079> well<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.409> you<00:02:22.469> can<00:02:22.590> just<00:02:22.680> plug<00:02:22.950> him

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
Davis as well and you can just plug him

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.830 
Davis as well and you can just plug him
in<00:02:23.340> if<00:02:23.519> Charles<00:02:23.849> is<00:02:23.939> out<00:02:24.090> but<00:02:24.450> actually<00:02:24.689> the

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
Davis makes an okay start anyway I

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.089

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
than anticipated more than a week at

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.759 
than anticipated more than a week at
least<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:36.810> can<00:02:36.930> still<00:02:36.989> use<00:02:37.109> them<00:02:37.349> as<00:02:37.439> a<00:02:37.500> flex

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769

play<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.099> week<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.370> don't<00:02:38.519> think<00:02:38.670> that's<00:02:38.730> the

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
play this week I don't think that's the

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.849 
play this week I don't think that's the
end<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.150> world<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.540> see<00:02:40.079> that<00:02:40.349> if<00:02:40.709> they

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
end of the world I see that if they

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:41.990 
end of the world I see that if they
probably<00:02:41.040> don't<00:02:41.189> want<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.430> give<00:02:41.519> Charles<00:02:41.730> 30

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
probably don't want to give Charles 30

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.030 
probably don't want to give Charles 30
carries<00:02:42.269> probably<00:02:42.719> not<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.900> best<00:02:42.930> idea<00:02:43.349> so

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
carries probably not the best idea so

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.589 
carries probably not the best idea so
Davis<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.489> probably<00:02:44.700> gonna<00:02:44.819> sneak<00:02:45.060> in<00:02:45.180> 10<00:02:45.480> to

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
Davis is probably gonna sneak in 10 to

Davis is probably gonna sneak in 10 to
15<00:02:45.689> touches<00:02:46.260> as<00:02:46.349> well<00:02:46.560> along<00:02:46.889> with<00:02:46.950> Charles

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
15 touches as well along with Charles

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.610 
15 touches as well along with Charles
probably<00:02:47.790> getting<00:02:48.030> 15<00:02:48.629> to<00:02:48.780> 20<00:02:49.109> I<00:02:49.139> see<00:02:49.409> a<00:02:49.439> lot<00:02:49.560> of

probably getting 15 to 20 I see a lot of

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
might want a ross foster hamstring and

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.119 
might want a ross foster hamstring and
running<00:03:34.139> back<00:03:34.229> doesn't<00:03:34.530> really<00:03:34.650> go<00:03:34.799> hand<00:03:34.949> in

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
running back doesn't really go hand in

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.469 
running back doesn't really go hand in
hand<00:03:35.189> here's<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.669> thing<00:03:35.909> last<00:03:36.150> week<00:03:36.299> these

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
hand here's the thing last week these

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.360 
hand here's the thing last week these
have<00:03:36.689> a<00:03:36.780> SAT<00:03:37.019> Arian<00:03:37.409> Foster<00:03:37.859> because<00:03:38.220> he

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
have a SAT Arian Foster because he

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.749 
have a SAT Arian Foster because he
wasn't<00:03:38.639> 100%<00:03:39.169> so<00:03:40.169> if<00:03:40.290> he<00:03:40.439> plays<00:03:40.739> I<00:03:41.069> am<00:03:41.430> playing

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:41.759 
wasn't 100% so if he plays I am playing

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:43.789 
wasn't 100% so if he plays I am playing
Arian<00:03:42.299> Foster<00:03:42.720> with<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:43.109> high<00:03:43.470> degree<00:03:43.500> of

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
Arian Foster with a high degree of

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.080 
Arian Foster with a high degree of
confidence<00:03:43.889> i<00:03:44.400> think<00:03:44.579> it's<00:03:44.669> a<00:03:44.729> good<00:03:44.849> matchup

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
confidence i think it's a good matchup

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.740 
confidence i think it's a good matchup
and<00:03:45.509> if<00:03:45.810> foster<00:03:45.989> plays<00:03:46.379> it<00:03:46.650> kind<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.750> renders

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
and if foster plays it kind of renders

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.599 
and if foster plays it kind of renders
off<00:03:48.900> for<00:03:49.079> blue<00:03:49.199> inert<00:03:49.650> at<00:03:50.099> that<00:03:50.280> point<00:03:50.459> because

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
off for blue inert at that point because

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.280 
off for blue inert at that point because
the<00:03:50.849> texans<00:03:51.180> like<00:03:51.359> to<00:03:51.479> have<00:03:51.629> their<00:03:51.810> lead<00:03:52.019> back

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
the texans like to have their lead back

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.199 
the texans like to have their lead back
they<00:03:52.680> like<00:03:52.799> to<00:03:52.829> feature<00:03:53.159> that<00:03:53.459> lead<00:03:53.639> back<00:03:53.909> and

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
they like to feature that lead back and

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.610 
they like to feature that lead back and
basically<00:03:54.509> run<00:03:54.810> them<00:03:54.930> into<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.139> ground<00:03:55.199> and

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
basically run them into the ground and

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.110 
basically run them into the ground and
if<00:03:56.069> that<00:03:56.189> happens<00:03:56.310> with<00:03:56.549> foster<00:03:56.819> he<00:03:56.909> might<00:03:57.000> get

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
if that happens with foster he might get

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.339 
if that happens with foster he might get
hurt<00:03:57.299> again<00:03:57.449> I<00:03:57.720> feel<00:03:57.930> like<00:03:58.019> that's<00:03:58.139> the<00:03:58.290> only

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
hurt again I feel like that's the only

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.199 
hurt again I feel like that's the only
way<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:58.829> blue<00:03:59.009> absorbs<00:03:59.849> some<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.060> the

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
way that blue absorbs some of the

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.270 
way that blue absorbs some of the
touches<00:04:00.599> now<00:04:00.989> if<00:04:01.229> Foster's<00:04:01.620> out<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:02.159> it's

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
touches now if Foster's out and it's

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.550 
touches now if Foster's out and it's
just<00:04:02.609> Alfred<00:04:03.030> blue<00:04:03.209> I<00:04:03.419> like<00:04:03.840> him<00:04:03.930> as<00:04:04.019> a<00:04:04.079> top<00:04:04.229> 15

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
just Alfred blue I like him as a top 15

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.719 
just Alfred blue I like him as a top 15
running<00:04:04.829> back<00:04:04.949> I<00:04:04.979> think<00:04:05.220> he's<00:04:05.340> basically<00:04:05.609> a

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
running back I think he's basically a

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.369 
running back I think he's basically a
must-start<00:04:06.209> it's<00:04:06.419> a<00:04:06.479> great<00:04:06.599> matchup<00:04:06.840> against

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
must-start it's a great matchup against

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.280 
must-start it's a great matchup against
Buffalo<00:04:07.979> and<00:04:08.220> we<00:04:08.459> see<00:04:08.759> that<00:04:09.000> he's<00:04:09.810> going<00:04:10.169> to

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
Buffalo and we see that he's going to

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.689

blue so I think he's a great start and

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.170 
blue so I think he's a great start and
the<00:04:16.199> way<00:04:16.289> to<00:04:16.349> approach<00:04:16.769> this<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.880> injury

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
the way to approach this and the injury

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.520 
the way to approach this and the injury
report<00:04:18.359> will<00:04:18.750> decide<00:04:19.049> this<00:04:19.169> for<00:04:19.229> us<00:04:19.440> because

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
report will decide this for us because

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.529 
report will decide this for us because
this<00:04:19.650> is<00:04:19.829> one<00:04:20.039> of<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.190> early<00:04:20.459> games<00:04:20.669> but<00:04:21.359> if

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
this is one of the early games but if

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:22.760

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
out for blue and maybe pick someone else

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.100 
out for blue and maybe pick someone else
up<00:04:39.240> maybe<00:04:39.390> i'll<00:04:39.510> just<00:04:39.600> keep<00:04:39.750> them<00:04:39.900> for<00:04:40.050> the

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
up maybe i'll just keep them for the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.540 
up maybe i'll just keep them for the
week<00:04:40.230> and<00:04:40.380> see<00:04:40.470> what<00:04:40.620> happens<00:04:40.980> but<00:04:41.130> either<00:04:41.370> way

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
week and see what happens but either way

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.760 
week and see what happens but either way
just<00:04:41.700> taking<00:04:42.060> him<00:04:42.180> off<00:04:42.420> the<00:04:42.720> waiver<00:04:42.870> wire<00:04:43.050> it

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
just taking him off the waiver wire it

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.410 
just taking him off the waiver wire it
just<00:04:43.980> allows<00:04:44.190> fewer<00:04:44.730> options<00:04:45.000> for<00:04:45.360> your

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
just allows fewer options for your

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.700 
just allows fewer options for your
opponent<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.840> use<00:04:46.020> against<00:04:46.380> you<00:04:46.440> I<00:04:46.470> think

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
opponent to use against you I think

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.810 
opponent to use against you I think
that's<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.980> strategy<00:04:47.190> behind<00:04:47.460> it

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
that's the strategy behind it

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.760 
that's the strategy behind it
underhanded<00:04:48.480> tactics<00:04:48.930> we<00:04:49.050> gotta<00:04:49.200> go<00:04:49.470> all<00:04:49.740> out

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.580 
far so he's just not this integral part
of<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.240> niners<00:05:27.540> offensive<00:05:28.200> we've<00:05:28.290> been<00:05:28.410> used

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
of the niners offensive we've been used

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.140 
of the niners offensive we've been used
to<00:05:28.650> seeing<00:05:28.890> in<00:05:28.950> years<00:05:29.130> past<00:05:29.220> and<00:05:29.730> then<00:05:30.060> you've

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
to seeing in years past and then you've

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.300 
to seeing in years past and then you've
got<00:05:30.180> Carlos<00:05:30.660> Hyde<00:05:30.900> who<00:05:31.260> also<00:05:31.500> hasn't<00:05:32.070> done

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
got Carlos Hyde who also hasn't done

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.800 
got Carlos Hyde who also hasn't done
very<00:05:32.340> much<00:05:32.550> he's<00:05:32.820> got<00:05:32.970> two<00:05:33.120> touchdowns<00:05:33.570> more

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
very much he's got two touchdowns more

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.330 
very much he's got two touchdowns more
than<00:05:33.990> gordas<00:05:34.410> but<00:05:34.860> you're<00:05:34.980> looking<00:05:35.220> at<00:05:35.280> he

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
than gordas but you're looking at he

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.100 
than gordas but you're looking at he
only<00:05:35.490> has<00:05:35.610> 14<00:05:36.000> rush<00:05:36.180> attempts<00:05:36.540> three

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
only has 14 rush attempts three

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.840 
only has 14 rush attempts three
receptions<00:05:37.650> but<00:05:37.800> facing<00:05:38.160> the<00:05:38.250> Eagles<00:05:38.670> now

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
receptions but facing the Eagles now

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.030 
receptions but facing the Eagles now
good<00:05:39.240> matchup<00:05:39.660> there<00:05:39.840> enough<00:05:40.680> to<00:05:40.770> put<00:05:40.920> either

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
good matchup there enough to put either

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.140 
good matchup there enough to put either
one<00:05:41.130> of<00:05:41.250> those<00:05:41.430> in<00:05:41.580> your<00:05:41.640> lineups<00:05:41.970> you<00:05:42.030> like

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
one of those in your lineups you like

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.580 
one of those in your lineups you like
one<00:05:42.300> more<00:05:42.450> than<00:05:42.600> the<00:05:42.630> other<00:05:42.720> even<00:05:43.140> yeah

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
one more than the other even yeah

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.230 
one more than the other even yeah
they're<00:05:43.920> basically<00:05:44.310> a<00:05:44.430> coin<00:05:44.730> flip<00:05:44.880> at<00:05:45.090> this

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
they're basically a coin flip at this

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.180 
they're basically a coin flip at this
point<00:05:45.510> but<00:05:45.690> the<00:05:46.260> Eagles<00:05:46.380> have<00:05:46.620> a<00:05:46.650> surprisingly

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
point but the Eagles have a surprisingly

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.250 
point but the Eagles have a surprisingly
good<00:05:47.310> run<00:05:47.730> defense<00:05:48.090> you<00:05:48.210> pass<00:05:48.510> on<00:05:48.900> the

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
good run defense you pass on the

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.140 
good run defense you pass on the
Philadelphia<00:05:49.860> Eagles<00:05:49.890> against<00:05:50.460> running<00:05:50.940> back

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
Philadelphia Eagles against running back

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.210 
Philadelphia Eagles against running back
so<00:05:51.300> far<00:05:51.450> this<00:05:51.600> season<00:05:51.660> their<00:05:52.350> top<00:05:52.710> five<00:05:52.980> and

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
so far this season their top five and

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.100 
so far this season their top five and
fewest<00:05:53.430> points<00:05:53.730> allowed<00:05:53.910> to<00:05:54.120> the<00:05:54.390> position<00:05:54.660> so

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
fewest points allowed to the position so

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.450 
fewest points allowed to the position so
I<00:05:55.260> don't<00:05:55.530> think<00:05:55.680> either<00:05:55.830> one<00:05:56.130> of<00:05:56.190> them<00:05:56.310> is<00:05:56.400> a

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
I don't think either one of them is a

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.380 
I don't think either one of them is a
good<00:05:56.580> start<00:05:56.760> I<00:05:56.850> would<00:05:56.910> actually<00:05:57.060> kind<00:05:57.300> of

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
good start I would actually kind of

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.480 
good start I would actually kind of
favor<00:05:57.600> hide<00:05:57.990> in<00:05:58.230> this<00:05:58.380> matchup<00:05:58.590> just<00:05:59.280> because

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
favor hide in this matchup just because

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.220 
favor hide in this matchup just because
Frank<00:05:59.700> work<00:05:59.850> doesn't<00:06:00.390> catch<00:06:00.780> they<00:06:00.960> don't<00:06:01.080> even

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
Frank work doesn't catch they don't even

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.870 
Frank work doesn't catch they don't even
attempt<00:06:01.860> to<00:06:02.040> throw<00:06:02.160> to<00:06:02.280> him<00:06:02.400> and<00:06:02.700> we<00:06:02.760> stay

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
attempt to throw to him and we stay

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.820 
attempt to throw to him and we stay
attempt<00:06:03.270> to<00:06:03.450> throw<00:06:03.570> to<00:06:03.720> Carlos<00:06:04.050> Hyde<00:06:04.260> and<00:06:04.500> if

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
attempt to throw to Carlos Hyde and if

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.470 
attempt to throw to Carlos Hyde and if
they're<00:06:04.950> constantly<00:06:05.250> going<00:06:05.460> to<00:06:05.610> be<00:06:05.700> passing<00:06:05.940> I

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
they're constantly going to be passing I

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.690 
they're constantly going to be passing I
would<00:06:06.840> see<00:06:06.960> that<00:06:07.050> hide<00:06:07.230> picks<00:06:07.620> up<00:06:07.830> basically

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
would see that hide picks up basically

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.920 
would see that hide picks up basically
more<00:06:08.940> receptions<00:06:09.360> and<00:06:09.480> that's<00:06:09.660> where<00:06:09.840> he's

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
more receptions and that's where he's

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.480 
more receptions and that's where he's
gonna<00:06:10.080> get<00:06:10.200> his<00:06:10.320> value<00:06:10.620> from<00:06:10.770> it<00:06:10.830> if<00:06:10.980> I<00:06:11.040> had<00:06:11.370> to

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
gonna get his value from it if I had to

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.070 
gonna get his value from it if I had to
pick<00:06:11.520> either<00:06:12.000> one<00:06:12.120> it<00:06:12.420> would<00:06:12.510> be<00:06:12.600> hot<00:06:12.780> but<00:06:13.020> I

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
pick either one it would be hot but I

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.360 
pick either one it would be hot but I
wouldn't<00:06:13.350> want<00:06:13.470> to<00:06:13.530> start<00:06:13.740> either<00:06:13.860> honestly

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
wouldn't want to start either honestly

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.040 
wouldn't want to start either honestly
do<00:06:14.880> you<00:06:14.940> think<00:06:15.090> that<00:06:15.180> Niners<00:06:15.420> oftens<00:06:15.750> finally

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
don't see that changing I think it's a

don't see that changing I think it's a
big<00:06:21.300> week<00:06:21.420> for<00:06:21.480> crabtree<00:06:21.840> in<00:06:22.380> Vernon<00:06:22.680> Davis
