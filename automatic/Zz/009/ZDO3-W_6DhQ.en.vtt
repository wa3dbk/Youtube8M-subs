00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.920
 wants me to call the dumb deaf who does not 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.300

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.839
 he was a guy to make relationships 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.610

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.220
 look sir I call you for this notice 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.390

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.830
 stutters well 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.390
 now clear if the deaf mute will try 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.910
 to understand him by the movement of 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.550
 lips to a world that is so mute is 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.460
 is going to skewer the deaf mute says no 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.580
 you do not know this man by 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.170

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.680
 is this guy in the look of his form 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.860
 well and to look to express yourself with the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.260
 look at ten minutes to be 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.550
 talking to him we were not at ten 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.120
 minutes of being with him we were 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.920
 discussing football that we hope 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.050
 do not tell him you know what misfortune 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.440
 I said for this gentleman not to be able to shout a 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.150
 goal of your favorite team and good of 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.470
 who is mouth favorite juniors me 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.900
 agreement that at that time look for a 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.270
 I was bad, I said good, he will not be able to 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.190
 scream a lot then no and followed 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.009
 trying to put the deaf mute the 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.770
 panegyric of the deaf mute to put 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.260
 because he was charged a commission 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.239
 way there are cases like this that in the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.720
 there's nothing wrong with it but they're still 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:21.900
 a lot in people that what he does in 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.540
 clairvoyance the tarot cards that the letters 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.300
 the one lying in the mail because no 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.370
 they fix anything and I like it when it's 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.430
 as well as I may like to call 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.170
 to someone who is a plumber to this 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.180
 I take the sign to the other also to the other 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.489
 also I take the sign 10 Type and 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.470
 it turns out that he works a little bit in each 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.519
 side but the twine was put together 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.079
 you pass that data of people 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.610
 preferably what I want good 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.079
 we have some recordings I think that 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.030
 we can listen so that people who 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.829
 you do not know or do not know your job to this 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.780
 height of the match because it sounds thanks 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.879
 glad to have the first one is just for 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.319
 the day of the innocents exact then 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.849
 we can see more or less how it 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.280
 develop a conversation with everything 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.230
 this first one is titled the skeleton a 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.170
 skeleton girl the girl from whom 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.170
 they listen to us 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:13.340
 we are interested to see if we do intermediate 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:16.069
 I am the first brother of a man who 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.930
 he died a while ago and I have 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.599
 understood because they told me in the 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.360
 cemetery of morÃ³n the north has the 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:27.790
 project of this first hand less 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.650
 and I'm inclined to say they have 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.170
 by hand if it is in the hands of the person 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.450
 that he will use it at least for 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.220
 see how far you can go forward 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.020
 says medication student 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.350
 clear and then what do you have it for 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:48.130
 clear studies 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.890
 and just what is coming are fulfilled 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.590
 years of the day he died and to me 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.459
 I would like to be in the chacarita to me 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.730
 I would like to be able to send flowers or something to 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.730
 that you 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.430
 finding out 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.430
 and now 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:37.310
 he was badly mistreated by the skeleton of a 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:37.310
 man in life but in bread of god 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:55.069
 a little piece of big mountain those that 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:58.759
 they lived about 160 I do not know why not give me 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.759
 they are armed 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:12.140
 but a very difficult flower you have to 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:16.260
 make him with a drill screwdriver 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:19.710
 all the bones for example in the part 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:22.050
 hard 90 is complete is not hard 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.030
 you have and well below the queues of judgment 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.759
 he does not have them 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.740
 patients are loose does not have the 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.990
 wisdom tooth then it is not the 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.000
 patient friend because all the 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.009
 particularities for example tetela 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.229
 calculated that he had this of all the 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:41.530
 other person who is a woman so 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:45.100
 that the calculation is done in security by 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.690
 the ssa because of the insecurity 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.110
 next hours 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.970
 the training you can touch to 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.889
 pressure to ear questions of the two 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.139
 ears 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:57.999
 what about them on the ground and how 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:02.560
 how could you explain it with a 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:05.199
 little girl playing those at the offices 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.770
 mastoid process sucks sample 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:12.270
 Above the table and the apophysis touch not 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.270
 the skull will sit well 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:21.120
 the territory is female 

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:36.460
 how this relative and andresito was not 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:39.060
 that should not do that we're 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.060
 confusing 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.479
 between 15 or 20 days is a bit more with 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:56.229
 about seeing what you discovered while 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:58.800
 I clean t 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:58.800
 good good 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:05.800
 partial that I do not always get 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:07.900
 so tenor we dare not be 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.400
 for nothing but for the life that would have 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.400
 been my relatives well cared for 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.849
 the girl thought she was carrying you 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.180
 at times and not and I would not have anything like that 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:31.509
 I was bewildered you saw that giggle 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:33.610
 like thinking is poor guy who wants 

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:35.560
 to have the fury is ridiculous tipa the 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.479
 clear skeleton and also give you a 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.860
 anatomy lesson because we know that you 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:40.960
 head because it comes on the table in the 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.759
 I'm not looking for the ideal argument for 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.039
 the machistas that are going to find some 

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:47.710
 an explanation between the size of the 

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:50.310
 skull and apophis apophism and the 

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.310
 apus
