00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.540
 at that time already the whole heap 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.790
 washed bierlauch so that's not so 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:19.180
 it is damp after washing we have so 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.180
 a salad spinner and then pure 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:32.320
 and then it's still relatively dry 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.740
 quite but relatively, because we are doing today 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.860
 Wild Garlic butter 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.840
 who still good but of course butter what 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.120
 have already chopped small enough 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.980
 dice out completely I do that myself 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.110
 next we take the fresh 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.450
 Washed bay tub the fire bit 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.570
 have drilled cuts in the small 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.910
 and then we would do it like that 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.190
 small birch and for stir the whole 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.510
 with the brown-bellied butter 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.740
 Of course you can also season the whole thing 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.440
 however , I would only then 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.750
 if you put it on the bread 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.100
 smear or otherwise distorted there 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.100
 it will then last longer 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.219
 the bear leek butter is ready now and 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.749
 The cameraman gets in now 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.329

 taste good and see you soon 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.650

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.090
 bear-lily pressing that will also be quite 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.439
