00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.620 
the three moves that I talked about I
think<00:04:17.049> it<00:04:17.320> was<00:04:17.380> like<00:04:17.560> stomp<00:04:17.980> slam<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:18.940> Ram<00:04:19.209> I

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
think it was like stomp slam and Ram I

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.260 
think it was like stomp slam and Ram I
think<00:04:20.440> those<00:04:20.560> were<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.770> name<00:04:21.010> let's<00:04:21.760> go<00:04:21.910> on<00:04:22.060> in

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
think those were the name let's go on in

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.120 
think those were the name let's go on in
here<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:24.250> Rhino<00:04:25.000> we<00:04:25.240> just<00:04:25.450> upgrade<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:26.110> Rhino

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
here the Rhino we just upgrade the Rhino

here the Rhino we just upgrade the Rhino
and<00:04:27.250> let's<00:04:27.790> just<00:04:28.060> slide<00:04:28.270> along<00:04:28.600> here<00:04:33.510> there<00:04:34.510> it

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
and let's just slide along here there it

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.420 
and let's just slide along here there it
is<00:04:34.720> let's<00:04:35.140> go<00:04:35.290> into<00:04:35.530> battle<00:04:35.680> now<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:36.310> we're

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.640 
is let's go into battle now and we're
fighting<00:04:36.870> spider-man<00:04:38.490> or<00:04:39.490> mortal<00:04:39.970> enemy<00:04:40.650> all

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
fighting spider-man or mortal enemy all

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.580 
fighting spider-man or mortal enemy all
right<00:04:41.800> this<00:04:41.980> is<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.220> tapping<00:04:42.670> attack<00:04:43.590> let's

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
right this is the tapping attack let's

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.010 
right this is the tapping attack let's
do<00:04:44.710> a<00:04:44.740> swiping<00:04:45.340> attack<00:04:45.640> this<00:04:46.360> is<00:04:46.510> a<00:04:46.540> swiping

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
do a swiping attack this is a swiping

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.330 
do a swiping attack this is a swiping
tight<00:04:47.260> it<00:04:47.440> kind<00:04:47.680> of<00:04:47.710> reminds<00:04:48.010> me<00:04:48.130> of<00:04:48.220> the

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
tight it kind of reminds me of the

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.200 
tight it kind of reminds me of the
Incredible<00:04:48.850> Hulk

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
Incredible Hulk

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.030 
Incredible Hulk
I<00:04:49.270> think<00:04:49.480> they<00:04:49.570> do<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.870> same<00:04:50.050> thing<00:04:50.350> alright

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
I think they do the same thing alright

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.460 
I think they do the same thing alright
that's<00:04:51.640> the<00:04:51.730> power<00:04:51.970> charge<00:04:52.390> heavy<00:04:53.110> attack<00:04:53.440> I

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
that's the power charge heavy attack I

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.400 
that's the power charge heavy attack I
mean<00:04:55.020> we're<00:04:56.020> gonna<00:04:56.140> use<00:04:56.380> a<00:04:56.410> first<00:04:57.010> attack<00:04:58.410> so

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
mean we're gonna use a first attack so

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.930 
mean we're gonna use a first attack so
this<00:04:59.560> is<00:04:59.740> the<00:04:59.830> first<00:05:00.070> attack<00:05:00.370> that's<00:05:00.640> stopped

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
this is the first attack that's stopped

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.740 
this is the first attack that's stopped
I<00:05:02.010> guess<00:05:03.010> it's<00:05:03.190> really<00:05:03.460> just<00:05:03.670> a<00:05:03.790> stop<00:05:04.090> all

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
I guess it's really just a stop all

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:14.700 
I guess it's really just a stop all
right<00:05:04.960> I'm<00:05:05.560> gonna<00:05:05.710> hit<00:05:05.920> some<00:05:06.130> more<00:05:13.710> and

somehow<00:05:14.920> our<00:05:15.070> power<00:05:15.520> level<00:05:15.970> is<00:05:16.030> not

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
somehow our power level is not

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.380 
somehow our power level is not
increasing<00:05:16.750> from<00:05:17.110> getting<00:05:17.410> hits<00:05:18.390> it

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
increasing from getting hits it

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.990 
increasing from getting hits it
increases<00:05:19.990> when<00:05:20.140> we<00:05:20.290> hit<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.620> enemy<00:05:20.740> ah<00:05:21.130> boy

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000
