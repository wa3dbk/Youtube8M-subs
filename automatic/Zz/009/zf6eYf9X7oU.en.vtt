00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.870
 i the galera tv figures released here 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.880
 again 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.250
 Today I'm going to teach you the music never 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.210
 Her band cake this song music 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.859
 very simple 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.740
 The cool thing is that her riff is good. 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.350
 interesting and she has a solo 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.119
 trumpet at the end as others here 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.619
 to avoid going to be nice 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.590
 I will spend the first riff of the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:54.420
 tropes of the chorus, practically 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:56.219
 riff in the music all this neighbor 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.410
 practically on the whole song I will do 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.410
 here very slowly now you understand 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:28.580
 this song has a few little details nec 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.580
 anaclet is always alternating right 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.090
 during the chorus it makes a fingering 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.979
 that accompanies this rhythm that I ended up 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.979
 to do I will do here and off 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.460
 is 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.489
 the fingering the palette I'll just decide 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.420
 here we can switch it can do only 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.420
 This year both does 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.660
 soon after comes the trumpet solo before 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:27.160
 of the trumpet solo and give it a 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.660
 with a distortion here I'm going to do this 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:37.180
 distortion theme for this pull 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:42.310
 once it 's quite simple here the sun does 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:47.970
 single emir now comes the trumpet solo 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.970
 I'll make the sun here for you to see. 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.370
 i 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.780
 i and ii 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:08.960
 i make a very slow solo now to 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.960

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.670
 i and ii 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.159
 They have connected to dinho here O 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.750
 and the ground base continues to do that 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.250
 initial riff only output when the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.750
 solo that is a bit different 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.750
 harmony zinho that he will do it 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.420
 slow down here 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.730
 So people wanted to enjoy it here at 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.800
 in the middle of class and say that I 'm using 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.770
 Today I always came here in Estonia. 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.290
 the boring and 50g a good kitchen as well 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.780
 versatile that it helped me a lot here is 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.019
 take this timbre and cyclic I'm using 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.930
 what 's cool is he is a good man 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.270
 and you can call however 110 220 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:30.280
 it has dlr output if you want to connect the 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:32.470
 your mp3 player and such to monitor and 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.930
 The equalization of it is very 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.720
 controls it has a severe acute mean 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.480
 but really changed the same frequency have 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.340
 how to ring in several different ways 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.050
 of a legal volume also 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.120
 he has a headset if you want 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.730
 do not disturb your neighbors by color 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.530
 It's the good news and it's the one who reminded 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.550
 It can be practical, you can take it all. 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.890
 How much is it? 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.400
 He has a zinc truth, it's really cool and 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.060
 such 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.060
 I'll call here 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.440
 then the tip is from tse about the wide 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.820
 here we will continue class on the second 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:32.200
 stanza makes the riff accompanying bass 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:34.660
 is thus from the middle of the second 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:54.120
 stanza makes another riff I'm going to do 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:58.680
 now what a slow time this rich man 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.680
 explaining that he has a slide here 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:11.050
 he will do here is only the largest and smallest 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:15.960
 in case it just happened here he goes to me 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.960
 here the control of the minor's defense 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:34.360
 the older the music is basically this she 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.310
 repeats everything twice and that the 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.250
 second exchange this end that I just 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.770
 do at the end ends again with the 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.140
 trumpet solo and that's it 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.640
 This song was never dead than 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.310
 I hope you have enjoyed it 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:51.000
 I learned there and we see each other. 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.000

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.030
