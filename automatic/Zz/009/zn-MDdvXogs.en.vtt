00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.220
 310 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.230
 and it was read 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.640
 quinn value 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.190
 cool 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.420
 strong the lawn 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.940
 then the price both 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.100
 he hit him handles many doors 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.740
 suddenly it happens to you to find 1 m 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.120
 we are always 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.280
 and in the next campaign that same are 260 his three encounters 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.070
 and good what we won 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.270
 although serrano 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.270
 let's see how they work 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.599
 beat interpreter added 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:09.839
 create 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:12.169
 I showed them special and goal 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.169
 what I want to report 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:20.649
 then first let's wait how 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.879
 we're 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:27.620
 they are kids 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.620
 but that put many antennas and cÃ¡ceres 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:35.429
 penalties 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.419
 finally passed 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.419
 the other 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:59.999
 few cream 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.379
 one step 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.939
 bencomo 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.489
 how it takes longer 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.149
 now I have in my opinion 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:15.169
 Estevez 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.489
 very very good 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.639
 it's not that we wish you peace 11 Dec 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.359
 with crime 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.769
 and so many things that we have and those that are heavier 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.839
 but they would take it away 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:30.369
 if you get into their things do not pass by coming to a disinterest 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:33.139
 masks its use 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.179
 in fact it is very cool 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:38.179
 and that is to imply a good destiny doing for 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.239
 Peter Rasmussen Pil 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.779
 quino encounters 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:49.089
 you really need very little for me yes kill me art 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.319
 find world 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:57.400
 so much 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.979
 decide 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:05.079
 last year I bought it out of curiosity because after this 27 bags 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.259
 plus 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.569
 but the prepotent treatment the curiosity 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.949
 the president of ata 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:13.549
 I do not like 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.379
 nothing 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:16.799
 after your success 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.069
 the sumptuous 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:20.559
 in st 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:23.559
 sister reception charged with 

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:27.059
 experienced the face 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.599
 If you have to go use a lot of product 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:32.099
 he tried to explain it 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.319
 mascara 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.069
 definitely does not take it away 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:39.409
 or the face was planned after yesterday from a single face 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.749
 and there are the slabs and 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:45.020
 food 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.150
 if it gets in your eyes 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.300
 is with external help 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.870
 we owe him a lot 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.360
 No, I do not like 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.860
 and that's my opinion on these two 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.990
 I hope it has served you if you want to know which one to buy 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.849
 Well, that's what I can tell you 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.650
 in this context it is 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.809
 versions still these make-up removal pressures are very good 

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.590
 I am much better than any other 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.960
 any chicago disguise decision is much better than it is relevant 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.270
 terrible more 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.270
 one that was all set the Serbian followed him staab 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.789
 the winner was this 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:34.219
 in kentucky
