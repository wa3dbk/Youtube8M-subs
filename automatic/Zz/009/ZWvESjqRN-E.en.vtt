00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
buy new batteries pretty soon because of

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.179 
buy new batteries pretty soon because of
that<00:01:21.350> they're<00:01:22.350> pretty<00:01:22.560> old<00:01:22.619> they're<00:01:23.070> only

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
that they're pretty old they're only

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.530 
that they're pretty old they're only
giving<00:01:23.340> out<00:01:23.610> nine<00:01:23.850> bolts<00:01:24.240> even<00:01:24.450> though

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
giving out nine bolts even though

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.080 
giving out nine bolts even though
they're<00:01:24.689> completely<00:01:25.110> charged<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.520> there

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
they're completely charged up so there

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.249 
they're completely charged up so there
are<00:01:27.150> about<00:01:27.210> five<00:01:27.570> years<00:01:27.689> old<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.049> think<00:01:28.110> it's

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
are about five years old so I think it's

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.550 
are about five years old so I think it's
about<00:01:28.350> time<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.939> get<00:01:29.939> some<00:01:30.119> new<00:01:30.150> batteries<00:01:30.560> but

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
about time to get some new batteries but

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.859 
about time to get some new batteries but
nothing<00:01:31.950> really<00:01:32.070> special<00:01:32.369> about<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.150> have

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
nothing really special about this I have

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.480 
nothing really special about this I have
a<00:01:35.000> knack<00:01:36.000> extender<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:37.310> believe<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.430> is

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
a knack extender on it I believe this is

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.640 
a knack extender on it I believe this is
a<00:01:38.610> fire<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:38.970> our<00:01:39.060> product<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.570> well<00:01:39.780> there's

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
a fire in our product as well there's

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.810 
a fire in our product as well there's
nothing<00:01:40.920> really<00:01:40.979> hooked<00:01:41.189> up<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.520> there's

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
nothing really hooked up to this there's

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.069 
nothing really hooked up to this there's
no<00:01:41.880> batteries<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.630> guess<00:01:42.840> I'll<00:01:42.960> get<00:01:43.020> a

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
no batteries on it I guess I'll get a

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.350 
no batteries on it I guess I'll get a
couple<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.409> those<00:01:43.649> too<00:01:43.939> just<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.000> get<00:01:45.210> this

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
couple for those too just to get this

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.530 
couple for those too just to get this
stupid<00:01:46.170> battery<00:01:46.350> light<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.799> go<00:01:46.920> away

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.910 

let's<00:01:51.540> see<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.080> I<00:01:52.140> guess<00:01:52.380> all<00:01:52.560> that's<00:01:52.740> really

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
let's see so I guess all that's really

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.680 
let's see so I guess all that's really
left<00:01:54.140> is<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.880> pull<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:56.970> will<00:01:57.090> pull<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.479> fire

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
left is to pull it will pull the fire

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:15.100 
left is to pull it will pull the fire
alarm

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:42.949 

nothing<00:02:16.110> real<00:02:16.260> special<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.690> really

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
nothing real special that is really

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.979 
nothing real special that is really
really<00:02:43.200> well<00:02:43.380> trust<00:02:44.069> me<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.690> don't<00:02:45.690> care<00:02:45.840> about

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989
