it's it's just a prop this microphone
when<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.340> was<00:00:50.460> working<00:00:51.140> there's<00:00:52.140> certain<00:00:52.469> ways

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
when it was working there's certain ways

singing they tend to be too far away

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.920 
singing they tend to be too far away
from<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.700> microphone<00:01:05.850> they'll<00:01:06.450> stand<00:01:06.720> back

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
from the microphone they'll stand back

from the microphone they'll stand back
here<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.350> there's<00:01:07.439> some<00:01:07.590> kind<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.890> repulsive

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
here and there's some kind of repulsive

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.310 
here and there's some kind of repulsive
thing<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.939> happens<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.510> many<00:01:09.960> people<00:01:10.260> are

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
clear and of course you're further away

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.359 
clear and of course you're further away
so<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.439> crank<00:01:31.740> all<00:01:31.950> your<00:01:32.130> settings

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
so you have to crank all your settings

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.999 
so you have to crank all your settings
on<00:01:32.790> your<00:01:33.360> software<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.110> your<00:01:34.229> hardware<00:01:34.650> in

on your software and in your hardware in
order<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.280> compensate<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> distance<00:01:36.479> now

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
order to compensate for the distance now

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.200 
order to compensate for the distance now
in<00:01:37.500> order<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.799> get<00:01:37.920> away<00:01:38.430> from<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.090> get

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
in order to get away from that you get

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.450 
in order to get away from that you get
closer<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.720> microphone<00:01:39.930> now<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.280> get

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
closer to the microphone now if you get

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.859 
closer to the microphone now if you get
close<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.880> microphone<00:01:42.119> what's<00:01:42.689> gonna

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
close to this microphone what's gonna
