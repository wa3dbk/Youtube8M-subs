I use my split ender to dust my ends
it's<00:00:11.700> pretty<00:00:11.970> simple<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.390> use<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.710> what

it's pretty simple to use this is what

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.090 
it's pretty simple to use this is what
it<00:00:13.980> looks<00:00:14.220> like<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.810> the<00:00:16.170> front<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.740> has<00:00:17.070> a

it looks like and on the front it has a

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.689 
it looks like and on the front it has a
particular<00:00:17.900> directional<00:00:18.900> arrow<00:00:19.400> you<00:00:20.400> press

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
particular directional arrow you press

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.120 
particular directional arrow you press
it<00:00:20.880> down<00:00:21.240> toward<00:00:21.929> the<00:00:21.990> direction<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.859> you

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
it down toward the direction that you

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.499 
it down toward the direction that you
will<00:00:23.429> be<00:00:24.019> using<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.710> device<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.730> will<00:00:27.300> press

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
will be using the device so I will press

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.800 
will be using the device so I will press
it<00:00:27.539> down<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:29.130> indicate<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:30.179> I'm<00:00:30.300> going<00:00:30.599> this

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
it down to indicate that I'm going this

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.120 
it down to indicate that I'm going this
way

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
way

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.550 
way
if<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.399> need<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.910> flip<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.690> then<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.410> would

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
if I need it to flip it then I would

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.770 
if I need it to flip it then I would
have<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.890> move<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.370> arrow<00:00:35.580> in<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.300> opposite

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
have to move the arrow in the opposite

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.140 
have to move the arrow in the opposite
direction<00:00:37.170> because<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.190> would<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.670> this

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
direction because I would be going this

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.330 
direction because I would be going this
way<00:00:39.390> because<00:00:39.990> I<00:00:40.260> am<00:00:40.410> right-handed

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
way because I am right-handed

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.180 
way because I am right-handed
I<00:00:41.430> always<00:00:41.700> keep<00:00:42.090> my<00:00:42.150> directional<00:00:42.960> arrow<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.680> in

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
I always keep my directional arrow of in

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.060 
I always keep my directional arrow of in
the<00:00:44.340> same<00:00:44.610> direction<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.260> always<00:00:46.500> go

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the same direction because I always go

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.610 
the same direction because I always go
down<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.940> then<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.840> side<00:00:48.900> I<00:00:49.110> go<00:00:49.380> down

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
down and then on this side I go down

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.780 
down and then on this side I go down
this<00:00:49.860> way<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.100> don't<00:00:50.490> ever<00:00:50.940> flip<00:00:51.450> it<00:00:51.630> over<00:00:51.870> to

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
this way I don't ever flip it over to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.610 
this way I don't ever flip it over to
have<00:00:53.790> a<00:00:53.820> need<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.120> change<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.720> arrow<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.350> if

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
have a need to change the arrow but if

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.950 
have a need to change the arrow but if
you<00:00:56.010> were<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.370> do<00:00:56.580> that<00:00:56.790> it's<00:00:57.120> very<00:00:57.180> important

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you were to do that it's very important

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.860 
you were to do that it's very important
that<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.470> change<00:00:59.220> the<00:00:59.610> directional<00:01:00.270> arrow<00:01:00.540> as

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
that you change the directional arrow as

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.160 
that you change the directional arrow as
it<00:01:01.110> controls<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.920> blade<00:01:02.220> in<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.870> direction

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
it controls the blade in the direction

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.580 
it controls the blade in the direction
of<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> blade<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.820> like<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.659> separate<00:01:07.380> my

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
of the blade so I like to separate my

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.790 
of the blade so I like to separate my
hair<00:01:07.890> into<00:01:08.700> small<00:01:09.300> sections<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:10.470> time

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
hair into small sections this time

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.490 
hair into small sections this time
around<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.370> use<00:01:11.610> ponytails<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.600> find<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.470> be

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
around I use ponytails I find that to be

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.170 
around I use ponytails I find that to be
a<00:01:13.620> little<00:01:13.770> more<00:01:14.010> convenient<00:01:14.520> because<00:01:15.000> it's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
a little more convenient because it's

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.890 
a little more convenient because it's
already<00:01:16.460> sectioned<00:01:17.460> off<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.540> I'm<00:01:18.720> going

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
already sectioned off and as I'm going

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.330 
already sectioned off and as I'm going
through<00:01:19.140> my<00:01:19.290> hair<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> don't<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.100> worry

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
through my hair I don't have to worry

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.030 
through my hair I don't have to worry
about<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.120> also<00:01:22.110> make<00:01:22.470> sure<00:01:22.620> my<00:01:22.770> hair<00:01:23.010> is

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
about that I also make sure my hair is

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.730 
about that I also make sure my hair is
detangled<00:01:23.790> as<00:01:23.970> good<00:01:24.690> as<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.200> be<00:01:25.260> before

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
detangled as good as it can be before

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.310 
detangled as good as it can be before
using<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.520> splint<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:27.270> simply<00:01:27.930> because

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
using the splint in there simply because

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.680 
using the splint in there simply because
I<00:01:28.920> don't<00:01:29.130> want<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.550> actually<00:01:29.760> snag<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
I don't want it to actually snag the

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.840 
I don't want it to actually snag the
hair<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.200> know<00:01:31.620> that<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.430> split<00:01:32.700> into

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
hair I know that on the split into

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.030 
hair I know that on the split into
commercials<00:01:33.479> if<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.690> recall<00:01:34.049> correctly<00:01:34.470> anyway

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
commercials if I recall correctly anyway

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.370 
commercials if I recall correctly anyway
they<00:01:35.729> actually<00:01:36.360> show<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.780> split<00:01:37.080> end<00:01:37.260> they're

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
they actually show the split end they're

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.170 
they actually show the split end they're
coming<00:01:37.710> all<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> way<00:01:38.159> up<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.610> coming

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
coming all the way up here and coming

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.600 
coming all the way up here and coming
down<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.750> length<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.140> strand<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.770> tried

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
down the length of the strand I tried

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.910 
down the length of the strand I tried
that<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.390> always<00:01:42.540> seems<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.110> snag<00:01:43.409> my<00:01:43.650> hair

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that and it always seems to snag my hair

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.070 
that and it always seems to snag my hair
so<00:01:44.520> what<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.909> tend<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.510> is<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.930> start

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
so what I tend to do is I start

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.770 
so what I tend to do is I start
somewhere<00:01:47.040> kind<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.119> middle<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
somewhere kind of like in the middle and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.680 
somewhere kind of like in the middle and
then<00:01:49.229> work<00:01:49.470> my<00:01:49.500> way<00:01:49.890> down<00:01:49.920> sure<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.090> course<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
then work my way down sure of course the

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.270 
then work my way down sure of course the
top<00:01:51.930> half<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.500> strand<00:01:52.830> is<00:01:53.040> being

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
top half of the strand is being

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.030 
top half of the strand is being
overlooked<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.810> believe<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.530> majority

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
overlooked but I do believe the majority

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.910 
overlooked but I do believe the majority
of<00:01:56.190> my<00:01:56.340> issues<00:01:56.820> are<00:01:57.119> from<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.810> middle<00:01:58.140> down<00:01:58.409> so

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
of my issues are from the middle down so

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.370 
of my issues are from the middle down so
I<00:01:58.950> really<00:01:59.460> feel<00:01:59.640> pretty<00:02:00.060> confident<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.810> using

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
I really feel pretty confident in using

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.010 
I really feel pretty confident in using
this<00:02:01.890> particular<00:02:02.159> method<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:03.540> does<00:02:03.780> not

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
this particular method this does not

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.630 
this particular method this does not
replace<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.530> need<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.549> get<00:02:05.760> a<00:02:05.790> good<00:02:06.119> trim

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
replace the need to get a good trim

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.450 
replace the need to get a good trim
from<00:02:06.820> a<00:02:07.000> stylist<00:02:07.540> not<00:02:07.900> for<00:02:08.200> me<00:02:08.319> anyway<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:08.950> just

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
from a stylist not for me anyway I just

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.430 
from a stylist not for me anyway I just
use<00:02:09.670> this<00:02:09.850> as<00:02:09.910> maintenance<00:02:10.600> in<00:02:10.990> between<00:02:11.319> the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
use this as maintenance in between the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.120 
use this as maintenance in between the
times<00:02:11.680> when<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.250> have<00:02:12.640> not<00:02:13.450> received<00:02:13.990> a<00:02:14.380> trim

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
times when I have not received a trim

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.090 
times when I have not received a trim
from<00:02:15.670> my<00:02:15.880> stylist<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:16.600> let<00:02:17.590> me<00:02:17.680> show<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:17.890> how

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
from my stylist so let me show you how

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:45.780 
from my stylist so let me show you how
it<00:02:18.250> works

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.880 

okay<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:46.850> what<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:47.390> did<00:02:47.510> here<00:02:47.720> was<00:02:48.020> I<00:02:48.230> took<00:02:48.410> one

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
okay so what I did here was I took one

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.550 
okay so what I did here was I took one
Pony<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.640> split<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.540> in<00:02:50.660> two<00:02:50.840> sections<00:02:51.140> and

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
Pony and split it in two sections and

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.620 
Pony and split it in two sections and
then<00:02:51.770> used<00:02:52.100> a<00:02:52.220> split<00:02:52.520> in<00:02:52.700> there<00:02:52.850> on<00:02:53.030> one<00:02:53.270> small

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
then used a split in there on one small

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.420 
then used a split in there on one small
section<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.290> then<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.740> will<00:02:54.920> move<00:02:55.070> to<00:02:55.250> this

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
section and then I will move to this

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.640 
section and then I will move to this
section<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.060> complete<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.690> process<00:02:56.900> you

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
section and complete the process you

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.290 
section and complete the process you
will<00:02:57.800> notice<00:02:58.100> I<00:02:58.250> went<00:02:58.490> over<00:02:58.880> this<00:02:59.030> particular

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
will notice I went over this particular

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.490 
will notice I went over this particular
strand<00:03:00.050> or<00:03:00.830> section<00:03:01.340> twice<00:03:01.790> I<00:03:02.180> will<00:03:02.750> do<00:03:02.990> twice

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
strand or section twice I will do twice

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.370 
strand or section twice I will do twice
per<00:03:04.040> section<00:03:04.700> all<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.180> way<00:03:05.390> around<00:03:05.810> the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
per section all the way around the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.320 
per section all the way around the
directions<00:03:06.980> actually<00:03:07.190> tell<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:08.150> make

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
directions actually tell you to make

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.000 
directions actually tell you to make
sure<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:08.780> go<00:03:08.930> over<00:03:08.960> the<00:03:09.380> hair<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.800> same

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
sure you go over the hair the same

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.390 
sure you go over the hair the same
number<00:03:10.430> of<00:03:10.460> times<00:03:10.790> two<00:03:11.660> passes<00:03:12.500> is<00:03:12.740> my

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
number of times two passes is my

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.940 
number of times two passes is my
preference<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:14.270> have<00:03:14.960> done<00:03:15.170> three<00:03:15.500> in<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.710> past

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
preference I have done three in the past

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.560 
preference I have done three in the past
but<00:03:16.190> I<00:03:16.280> don't<00:03:16.490> really<00:03:16.640> notice<00:03:16.940> much<00:03:17.360> of<00:03:17.390> a

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
but I don't really notice much of a

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.390 
but I don't really notice much of a
difference<00:03:17.600> between<00:03:18.320> two<00:03:18.530> or<00:03:18.680> three<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.190> I

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
difference between two or three so I

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.420 
difference between two or three so I
just<00:03:19.880> normally<00:03:20.600> do<00:03:20.810> two<00:03:21.110> after<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.040> have<00:03:22.400> gone

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
just normally do two after I have gone

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.790 
just normally do two after I have gone
through<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:23.090> section<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:23.720> like<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.410> look<00:03:24.590> at

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
through the section I like to look at

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.220 
through the section I like to look at
the<00:03:24.950> ends<00:03:25.430> just<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:25.790> make<00:03:26.060> sure<00:03:26.390> I<00:03:26.780> don't<00:03:26.990> see

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
the ends just to make sure I don't see

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.000 
the ends just to make sure I don't see
any<00:03:27.560> problems<00:03:28.310> any<00:03:28.670> splits<00:03:29.209> if<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:30.170> see<00:03:30.470> any<00:03:30.740> as

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
any problems any splits if I see any as

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.510 
any problems any splits if I see any as
I<00:03:31.610> do<00:03:31.670> right<00:03:32.709> here<00:03:33.709> I<00:03:33.920> will<00:03:34.910> get<00:03:35.270> my<00:03:36.520> scissors

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
I do right here I will get my scissors

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.970 
I do right here I will get my scissors
and<00:03:38.480> just<00:03:39.790> trim<00:03:40.790> that<00:03:41.300> off<00:03:41.480> so<00:03:41.959> I'll<00:03:42.560> do<00:03:42.950> that

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
and just trim that off so I'll do that

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.420 
and just trim that off so I'll do that
through<00:03:43.790> each<00:03:44.060> section<00:03:44.420> of<00:03:44.780> hair<00:03:45.250> until<00:03:46.250> I'm

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
through each section of hair until I'm

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.790 
through each section of hair until I'm
done

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.130 

a<00:03:48.880> few<00:03:49.880> other<00:03:50.150> tips<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:50.810> would<00:03:50.960> like<00:03:51.110> to

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
a few other tips that I would like to

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.230 
a few other tips that I would like to
share<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:51.740> I<00:03:52.070> have<00:03:52.370> kind<00:03:52.730> of<00:03:52.910> learned

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
share that I have kind of learned

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.180 
share that I have kind of learned
through<00:03:53.630> trial<00:03:54.080> and<00:03:54.200> error<00:03:54.440> now<00:03:55.130> the

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
through trial and error now the

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.520 
through trial and error now the
instructions<00:03:55.760> state<00:03:56.300> that<00:03:56.750> you<00:03:57.080> should<00:03:57.320> use

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
instructions state that you should use

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.160 
instructions state that you should use
the<00:03:57.710> split<00:03:57.890> ender<00:03:58.400> on<00:03:58.700> clean<00:03:59.150> hair<00:03:59.480> my

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
the split ender on clean hair my

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.320 
the split ender on clean hair my
preference<00:04:00.770> is<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.040> use<00:04:01.190> a<00:04:01.400> split<00:04:01.850> ender<00:04:02.150> on

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
preference is to use a split ender on

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.050 
preference is to use a split ender on
hair<00:04:02.720> that<00:04:02.960> is<00:04:03.140> with<00:04:03.410> product<00:04:03.980> I<00:04:04.220> find<00:04:04.850> that<00:04:05.000> I

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
hair that is with product I find that I

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.110 
hair that is with product I find that I
get<00:04:05.210> much<00:04:05.570> less<00:04:05.870> breakage<00:04:06.590> when<00:04:06.920> I<00:04:06.950> do<00:04:07.070> so<00:04:07.460> I<00:04:07.760> do

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
get much less breakage when I do so I do

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.930 
get much less breakage when I do so I do
not<00:04:08.420> use<00:04:08.690> it<00:04:08.900> without<00:04:09.050> product<00:04:09.980> in<00:04:10.280> my<00:04:10.430> hair<00:04:10.460> so

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
not use it without product in my hair so

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.260 
not use it without product in my hair so
that's<00:04:11.420> just<00:04:11.690> how<00:04:11.840> I<00:04:11.960> prefer<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:13.190> do<00:04:13.790> that

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
that's just how I prefer to do that

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.979 
that's just how I prefer to do that
now<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:14.960> split<00:04:15.410> ender<00:04:15.860> is<00:04:16.100> not<00:04:16.840> 100%<00:04:17.840> accurate

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
now the split ender is not 100% accurate

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.000 
now the split ender is not 100% accurate
if<00:04:18.470> you<00:04:18.590> will<00:04:18.769> as<00:04:19.010> you<00:04:19.940> notice<00:04:20.330> I<00:04:20.510> did<00:04:21.019> find<00:04:21.470> a

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
if you will as you notice I did find a

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.600 
if you will as you notice I did find a
split<00:04:22.820> even<00:04:23.600> after<00:04:24.200> I<00:04:24.560> had<00:04:24.860> already<00:04:25.250> gone

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
split even after I had already gone

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.790 
split even after I had already gone
through<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:26.030> hair<00:04:26.240> so<00:04:26.840> that's<00:04:27.260> kind<00:04:27.530> of<00:04:27.590> why<00:04:27.770> I

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
through the hair so that's kind of why I

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.680 
through the hair so that's kind of why I
had<00:04:28.160> mentioned<00:04:28.670> it<00:04:28.850> doesn't<00:04:29.210> replace<00:04:29.390> the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
had mentioned it doesn't replace the

I<00:04:57.890> guess<00:04:58.890> how<00:04:59.670> could<00:04:59.880> I<00:04:59.970> forget<00:05:00.150> in<00:05:00.510> order<00:05:01.170> to

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
I guess how could I forget in order to

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.400 
I guess how could I forget in order to
make<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:01.740> split<00:05:02.070> endure<00:05:02.610> work<00:05:03.210> you<00:05:04.080> have<00:05:04.380> to

the<00:05:10.950> sound<00:05:11.220> of<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:11.580> blade<00:05:12.120> actually<00:05:12.800> working

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
the sound of the blade actually working

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.400 
the sound of the blade actually working
and<00:05:14.250> doing<00:05:14.790> this<00:05:14.970> thing<00:05:15.300> there<00:05:15.900> is<00:05:16.050> a<00:05:16.080> lock

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
and doing this thing there is a lock

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.520 
and doing this thing there is a lock
switch<00:05:16.650> on<00:05:17.010> the<00:05:17.130> back<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:18.470> on<00:05:19.470> the

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
directional switch if you move it to the

directional switch if you move it to the

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
center position it basically turns it

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.560 
center position it basically turns it
off<00:05:25.320> and<00:05:25.950> one<00:05:26.220> thing<00:05:26.640> to<00:05:26.850> note<00:05:27.030> about<00:05:27.210> the

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
off and one thing to note about the

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.690 
off and one thing to note about the
direction<00:05:27.900> of<00:05:28.110> arrow<00:05:28.350> just<00:05:28.950> kind<00:05:29.340> of<00:05:29.370> keep<00:05:29.550> in

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
direction of arrow just kind of keep in

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.430 
direction of arrow just kind of keep in
mind<00:05:29.940> that<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.300> arrow<00:05:30.540> should<00:05:30.870> always<00:05:31.110> be

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
mind that the arrow should always be

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.410 
mind that the arrow should always be
facing<00:05:31.680> down<00:05:31.890> toward<00:05:32.640> the<00:05:32.790> floor

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
facing down toward the floor

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.360 
facing down toward the floor
that's<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:33.900> easy<00:05:34.080> way<00:05:34.290> to<00:05:34.350> remember<00:05:34.680> it<00:05:34.950> so

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
that's the easy way to remember it so

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.570 
that's the easy way to remember it so
once<00:05:35.760> it's<00:05:36.030> off<00:05:36.210> you<00:05:36.870> can<00:05:37.200> lock<00:05:37.830> into<00:05:38.460> the

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
once it's off you can lock into the

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.470 
once it's off you can lock into the
particular<00:05:39.060> comb<00:05:39.480> and<00:05:40.400> you<00:05:41.400> pull<00:05:41.700> off<00:05:42.120> this

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
particular comb and you pull off this

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.350 
particular comb and you pull off this
particular<00:05:43.290> top<00:05:43.890> part<00:05:44.220> by<00:05:44.730> pressing<00:05:45.210> the

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
particular top part by pressing the

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.390 
particular top part by pressing the
release<00:05:45.510> button<00:05:45.690> and<00:05:46.230> you<00:05:46.620> just<00:05:46.830> clean<00:05:47.100> it<00:05:47.130> out

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
release button and you just clean it out

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.000 
release button and you just clean it out
and<00:05:47.670> you<00:05:48.030> store<00:05:48.330> it<00:05:48.450> away<00:05:48.570> you<00:05:49.380> are<00:05:49.680> to<00:05:49.860> get

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
and you store it away you are to get

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.510 
and you store it away you are to get
your<00:05:50.160> blades<00:05:50.490> replaced<00:05:51.450> at<00:05:51.920> some<00:05:52.920> point<00:05:53.250> I've

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
your blades replaced at some point I've

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.910 
your blades replaced at some point I've
not<00:05:53.850> had<00:05:54.090> my<00:05:54.390> split<00:05:54.690> endure<00:05:55.050> long<00:05:55.410> enough<00:05:55.740> or

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
not had my split endure long enough or

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.250 
not had my split endure long enough or
well<00:05:56.430> I<00:05:56.700> probably<00:05:57.090> had<00:05:57.540> it<00:05:57.690> long<00:05:57.870> enough<00:05:58.140> to

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
well I probably had it long enough to

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.080 
well I probably had it long enough to
get<00:05:58.410> their<00:05:58.590> blades<00:05:58.860> replaced<00:05:59.400> but<00:05:59.820> I've<00:05:59.940> not

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
get their blades replaced but I've not

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.260 
get their blades replaced but I've not
used<00:06:00.570> it<00:06:00.900> all<00:06:01.080> that<00:06:01.470> much<00:06:01.710> I<00:06:02.010> probably<00:06:02.880> have

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
used it all that much I probably have

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.170 
used it all that much I probably have
used<00:06:03.570> the<00:06:03.750> split<00:06:04.050> in<00:06:04.260> there<00:06:04.470> maybe<00:06:05.180> seven

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
used the split in there maybe seven

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.660 
used the split in there maybe seven
eight<00:06:06.420> ten<00:06:06.870> times<00:06:07.200> in<00:06:07.710> the<00:06:08.160> course<00:06:08.340> of<00:06:08.550> about

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
eight ten times in the course of about

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.840 
eight ten times in the course of about
three<00:06:08.820> years<00:06:09.360> of<00:06:09.570> owning<00:06:09.900> it<00:06:10.050> so<00:06:10.380> I<00:06:11.160> will<00:06:11.640> reach

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
three years of owning it so I will reach

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.640 
three years of owning it so I will reach
out<00:06:12.030> to<00:06:12.210> the<00:06:12.300> company<00:06:12.690> at<00:06:12.810> some<00:06:13.110> point<00:06:13.440> to

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
out to the company at some point to

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.260 
out to the company at some point to
figure<00:06:13.830> out<00:06:14.130> when<00:06:14.400> is<00:06:14.550> a<00:06:14.580> good<00:06:14.820> time<00:06:15.030> to

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
figure out when is a good time to

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.270 
figure out when is a good time to
replace<00:06:15.600> the<00:06:16.020> blades<00:06:16.260> but<00:06:16.920> due<00:06:17.100> to<00:06:17.130> my

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
replace the blades but due to my

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.700 
replace the blades but due to my
infrequent<00:06:18.000> use<00:06:18.240> they<00:06:18.510> are<00:06:18.540> still<00:06:18.990> very<00:06:19.350> sharp

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
infrequent use they are still very sharp

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.100 
infrequent use they are still very sharp
and<00:06:20.040> getting<00:06:20.580> the<00:06:20.700> job<00:06:20.730> done

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
and getting the job done

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.649 
and getting the job done
okay<00:06:24.039> so<00:06:24.099> I'm<00:06:24.430> done<00:06:24.699> and<00:06:25.000> here's<00:06:25.419> what<00:06:25.569> it

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:25.659 
okay so I'm done and here's what it

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:29.909 
okay so I'm done and here's what it
looks<00:06:25.840> like<00:06:26.610> if<00:06:27.610> you<00:06:27.669> can<00:06:28.090> see<00:06:28.300> that<00:06:28.590> it's<00:06:29.590> just

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 
looks like if you can see that it's just

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:34.010 
looks like if you can see that it's just
a<00:06:30.039> little<00:06:30.250> bit<00:06:30.460> of<00:06:30.580> hair<00:06:30.849> much<00:06:31.479> like<00:06:31.509> dust<00:06:32.259> and

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
a little bit of hair much like dust and

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.869 
a little bit of hair much like dust and
it's<00:06:35.020> not<00:06:35.169> enough<00:06:35.469> to<00:06:35.860> make<00:06:35.889> you<00:06:36.189> lose<00:06:36.219> lint<00:06:36.729> of

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:36.879 
it's not enough to make you lose lint of

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:38.670 
it's not enough to make you lose lint of
you<00:06:36.969> on<00:06:37.150> your<00:06:37.449> hair<00:06:37.780> it's<00:06:38.050> just<00:06:38.259> enough<00:06:38.530> to

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
you on your hair it's just enough to

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.409 
you on your hair it's just enough to
make<00:06:38.830> your<00:06:38.949> ends<00:06:39.340> feel<00:06:39.550> healthier

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:40.419 
make your ends feel healthier

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:42.330 
make your ends feel healthier
of<00:06:40.719> course<00:06:41.020> you're<00:06:41.229> losing<00:06:41.620> some<00:06:41.830> good<00:06:42.039> ends

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340 
of course you're losing some good ends

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.390 
of course you're losing some good ends
in<00:06:42.460> the<00:06:42.550> process<00:06:43.060> but<00:06:43.449> overall<00:06:44.229> the<00:06:44.919> end<00:06:45.159> goal

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
in the process but overall the end goal

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.209 
in the process but overall the end goal
is<00:06:45.699> to<00:06:45.939> get<00:06:46.120> rid<00:06:46.180> of<00:06:46.389> any<00:06:46.629> bad<00:06:46.870> ends<00:06:47.469> make<00:06:48.069> the

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:48.219 
is to get rid of any bad ends make the

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:52.409 
is to get rid of any bad ends make the
ends<00:06:48.430> feel<00:06:48.729> healthy<00:06:49.300> and<00:06:49.919> just<00:06:51.150> improve<00:06:52.150> the

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419 
ends feel healthy and just improve the
