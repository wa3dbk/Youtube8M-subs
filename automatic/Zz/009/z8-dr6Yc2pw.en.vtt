start slow and just work on the 6th and
5th<00:03:29.320> strings<00:03:29.800> first<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:30.520> eventually<00:03:31.480> add

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
5th strings first and eventually add

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.220 
5th strings first and eventually add
working<00:03:33.520> with<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:33.670> metronome<00:03:33.910> is<00:03:34.390> also<00:03:34.870> advised

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
working with a metronome is also advised

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.900 
working with a metronome is also advised
because<00:03:35.620> then<00:03:35.770> you<00:03:35.890> would<00:03:36.010> also<00:03:36.250> be<00:03:36.580> working

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
because then you would also be working

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.860 
because then you would also be working
on<00:03:37.000> your<00:03:37.060> rhythm<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:38.500> that's<00:03:39.190> a<00:03:39.340> good<00:03:39.550> exercise

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
on your rhythm so that's a good exercise

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.610 
on your rhythm so that's a good exercise
to<00:03:40.870> build<00:03:41.260> stamina<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:42.100> strength<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:43.780> be<00:03:44.590> able

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
to build stamina and strength to be able

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.020 
to build stamina and strength to be able
to<00:03:45.190> play<00:03:45.370> bar<00:03:46.180> chords<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:48.520> second<00:03:48.880> exercise

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
to play bar chords the second exercise

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.420 
to play bar chords the second exercise
I'm<00:03:49.570> going<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.900> show<00:03:50.110> you<00:03:50.170> requires<00:03:50.830> you<00:03:51.190> to

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
I'm going to show you requires you to

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.390 
I'm going to show you requires you to
tune<00:03:51.730> your<00:03:52.060> guitar<00:03:52.450> in<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.530> different<00:03:53.980> tuning

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
tune your guitar in a different tuning

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.210 
tune your guitar in a different tuning
the<00:03:55.209> first<00:03:55.420> exercise<00:03:55.750> that<00:03:56.110> I<00:03:56.200> showed<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:56.530> can

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
the first exercise that I showed you can

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.030 
the first exercise that I showed you can
be<00:03:57.310> done<00:03:57.520> in<00:03:57.610> any<00:03:57.730> tuning<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:59.170> my<00:03:59.620> guitar<00:03:59.739> was

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
be done in any tuning and my guitar was

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.430 
be done in any tuning and my guitar was
tuned<00:04:00.250> in<00:04:00.370> standard<00:04:00.790> tuning<00:04:00.820> for<00:04:01.390> that<00:04:01.600> but

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
tuned in standard tuning for that but

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.729 
tuned in standard tuning for that but
right<00:04:02.620> now<00:04:02.830> my<00:04:02.860> guitar<00:04:03.400> is<00:04:03.519> tuned<00:04:03.820> in<00:04:03.970> open<00:04:04.480> e

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
right now my guitar is tuned in open e

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.090 
right now my guitar is tuned in open e
tuning<00:04:05.880> so<00:04:06.880> what<00:04:07.300> that<00:04:07.330> means<00:04:07.690> is<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:08.100> i'm

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
tuning so what that means is that i'm

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.830 
tuning so what that means is that i'm
going<00:04:09.489> to<00:04:09.550> run<00:04:09.700> through<00:04:09.970> this<00:04:10.209> tuning<00:04:10.720> with

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
going to run through this tuning with

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.350 
going to run through this tuning with
you<00:04:10.959> real<00:04:11.320> quick<00:04:11.350> here<00:04:11.950> so<00:04:12.519> the<00:04:12.940> 6th<00:04:13.150> string

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
you real quick here so the 6th string

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.849 
you real quick here so the 6th string
stays<00:04:14.110> the<00:04:14.290> same<00:04:14.470> that's<00:04:15.220> e<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:17.169> 5th<00:04:17.500> string

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
stays the same that's e the 5th string

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.690 
stays the same that's e the 5th string
is<00:04:17.980> now<00:04:18.100> a<00:04:18.130> be<00:04:18.519> so<00:04:19.269> one<00:04:19.570> whole<00:04:19.750> step<00:04:19.900> up<00:04:20.700> the

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
is now a be so one whole step up the

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.370 
is now a be so one whole step up the
force<00:04:22.000> fourth<00:04:22.960> string<00:04:23.650> is<00:04:23.919> a<00:04:23.980> e<00:04:25.140> so<00:04:26.140> that's<00:04:26.290> an

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
force fourth string is a e so that's an

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.170 
force fourth string is a e so that's an
octave<00:04:26.710> above<00:04:26.830> from<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.250> sixth<00:04:27.669> string<00:04:27.730> so

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
octave above from the sixth string so

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.180 
octave above from the sixth string so
that's<00:04:28.330> an<00:04:28.480> one<00:04:28.750> whole<00:04:29.200> step<00:04:29.350> up<00:04:29.620> from<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:30.010> D

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
that's an one whole step up from the D

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.960 
that's an one whole step up from the D
that<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.640> fourth<00:04:30.880> string<00:04:31.180> is<00:04:31.330> originally<00:04:32.970> the

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
that the fourth string is originally the

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.730 
that the fourth string is originally the
third<00:04:34.240> string<00:04:34.540> goes<00:04:34.720> up<00:04:34.900> a<00:04:35.020> half<00:04:35.200> step<00:04:35.230> to<00:04:35.710> a

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
third string goes up a half step to a

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.380 
third string goes up a half step to a
g-sharp<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:38.440> second<00:04:38.740> string<00:04:38.919> stays<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.310> same

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
g-sharp the second string stays the same

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.270 
g-sharp the second string stays the same
and<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:41.020> first<00:04:41.230> string<00:04:41.500> stays<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:42.040> same<00:04:42.220> so

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
and the first string stays the same so

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.130 
and the first string stays the same so

can do to build stamina and strength is
by<00:05:07.460> using<00:05:07.910> an<00:05:08.150> open<00:05:08.390> tuning<00:05:08.690> and<00:05:08.810> just<00:05:08.960> playing

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
by using an open tuning and just playing

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:23.860 
by using an open tuning and just playing
one<00:05:10.070> finger<00:05:10.430> chords<00:05:20.890> and<00:05:22.510> do<00:05:23.510> something

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
there are no rules to what you can do

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.170 
there are no rules to what you can do
but<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:30.290> important<00:05:30.680> thing<00:05:30.710> is<00:05:31.040> that<00:05:31.070> you<00:05:32.030> will

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
but the important thing is that you will

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.290 
but the important thing is that you will
are<00:05:32.330> playing<00:05:32.870> with<00:05:33.260> that<00:05:33.440> one<00:05:33.710> finger<00:05:34.300> we're

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
are playing with that one finger we're

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.110 
are playing with that one finger we're
going<00:05:35.450> to<00:05:35.540> use<00:05:35.750> or<00:05:36.260> borrowing<00:05:36.680> a<00:05:36.860> chord<00:05:37.190> your

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
going to use or borrowing a chord your

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.110 
going to use or borrowing a chord your
first<00:05:38.360> finger<00:05:38.600> and<00:05:38.930> just<00:05:39.560> laying<00:05:40.370> all<00:05:40.790> the

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
first finger and just laying all the

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.140 
first finger and just laying all the
strings<00:05:41.800> every<00:05:42.800> time<00:05:43.010> strumming<00:05:43.640> through<00:05:43.880> all

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
strings every time strumming through all

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:56.850 
strings every time strumming through all
the<00:05:44.300> strings<00:05:44.600> every<00:05:44.930> time<00:05:45.140> you<00:05:45.860> play

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.390 

and<00:05:57.639> that's<00:05:58.599> really<00:05:58.719> as<00:05:58.990> simple<00:05:59.169> as<00:05:59.469> it<00:05:59.650> is<00:05:59.830> it

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
and that's really as simple as it is it

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.939 
and that's really as simple as it is it
does<00:06:00.669> require<00:06:00.849> you<00:06:01.240> to<00:06:01.449> retune<00:06:02.319> your<00:06:02.349> guitar

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
does require you to retune your guitar

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.309 
does require you to retune your guitar
into<00:06:03.370> this<00:06:03.520> other<00:06:03.729> tuning<00:06:04.240> but<00:06:04.689> the<00:06:04.930> benefit

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:05.319 
into this other tuning but the benefit

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:07.920
