00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.710
 Hello, my name is Kobelev Alexey 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.639
 and today i would like to tell you how 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.920
 connect collector engines 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.150
 direct arousal from household 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.289
 washing machines 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:23.449
 I have such an engine from 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:29.269
 household typewriter 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:32.279
 skid maker above specified 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.719
 its characteristics are indicated 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.210
 that is, this is actually the engine 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:42.050
 sequential excitation power 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.760
 its 460 wat 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:53.610
 rotational speed 12000 power 230 240 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.469
 volt here is this engine working I already 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.070
 he basically looked here with him 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.739
 cool here is such a thing 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.979
 engine but if so in the design 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.340
 a little dip then he has a rotor 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:14.570
 with windings and there it will be possible 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:18.720
 see and the stator itself winding 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.049
 rotor stator output to the terminal block 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.100
 she still has 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:28.799
 tachogenerator which allows 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:33.799
 read engine rpm data i 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:39.920
 then looked figured out and painted 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:44.070
 own such a scheme here which means 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:48.700
 I'll take a pencil 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:54.130
 here it means this is our rotor here on 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:02:00.400
 These terminals tacho generator stator 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:02.680
 winding and thermal protection at the manufacturer 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:08.070
 when he was shooting it was already this 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:13.150
 jumper which the rotor protects 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:19.930
 temperature sensor so well 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:24.130
 actually it is a cream from him here 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:29.890
 jumper jumper immediately already built 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:32.290
 just klemka dresses and everything directly 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.750
 This engine is generally not recommended. 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.160
 include as he is 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.850
 collector it develops very large 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.810
 turnovers can honestly say gallop but 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.720
 if you fix it well 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.120
 you can start it in principle but better 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.390
 do not do this and run it let's say 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.000
 through the incandescent bulb or there is not 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.120
 I know through the iron through the kettle all that 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.580
 please to recite 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.010
 There are many different schemes on the Internet 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.510
 control of this engine that is possible 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.030
 assemble the circuit itself 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.200
 frequency control but i actually 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.230
 I did not do this, I went to the site 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.190
 Chinese online store and purchased 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.230
 Here is a frequency control frequency 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.530
 regulator 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:27.730
 that is, the usual and do not even know what is there 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:32.290
 for the transistor is but it has an input-output 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:36.350
 these wires just plugged into it 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.610
 you give in to taking it off 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.970
 wiring diagram of the engine itself 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.040
 actually everything is simple 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.310
 sequentially stator rim 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.920
 connects to rotor winding through 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.780
 protect 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.770
 through the thermal sensor but since there 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.920
 jumper is already worth showing again 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.260
 here this jumper is worth that is, we 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.260
 consistently connect the rotor 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:10.900
 winding the stator I am now then 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:14.450
 draw right here what we do we 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:18.489
 connect the sixth and fifth terminals set 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:27.220
 one more jumper and energize 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:27.220
 on the eighth and ninth terminals actually 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.160
 So I drew the second jumper 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.990
 connect and serve on the eighth tenth 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.110
 220 volt terminal 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.460
 if you file it directly 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.300
 maximum speed but then not 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.800
 forget to fasten it if through here 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.080
 so the frequency control is possible 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.910
 little by little 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.980
 Now I will connect all this and then show 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:59.350
 how does it work so well that's it 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:02.690
 all , here is my hour of current regulator which 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.020
 engine all connected included in 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.030
 I am now a motor outlet 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:13.730
 slowly, here is another scheme to show now 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:15.710
 which was clearly visible so now it means 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.830
 This is a factory jumper which is here 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:22.640
 there was this jumper which I put 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.880
 This we connect 220 through frequency 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:29.650
 the regulator is now looking at the actual me 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.650
 add stress 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.770
 and here is the engine starting 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.310
 you can reduce a little 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.220
 not so big momentum 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.849
 but it's even just a little bit literally me 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.539
 added here start 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.539
 from add 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.800
 It was 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.349
 everything here is scary me 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.620
 bother what a brake and I 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:07.710
 I slow down with 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:10.440
 so that he does not run far away here he is 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.250
 slowly spinning very small 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:17.000
 turnovers can even see 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.000
 I can completely remove 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.190
 set here he stopped 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:30.030
 run again twist slightly 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.030
 add 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.070
 try to install 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.370
 he is now the surface 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.180
 situations 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.180
 put likes 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:55.470
 turns are not mad thing works 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.070
 and flights 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.070
 all beauty 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:11.270
 he himself must slowly 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.270
 stop translate with 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.950
 wet the month on inert 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:33.650
 Well, that's all I wanted 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:36.650
 tell thanks for attention up 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.650
