for them prior to going over and how do

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.780 
for them prior to going over and how do

you monitor what boys are going through
in<00:02:57.200> Australia<00:02:57.709> I<00:02:57.920> guess<00:02:58.489> a<00:02:58.569> distinguishing

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
in Australia I guess a distinguishing

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.509 
in Australia I guess a distinguishing
factor<00:02:59.780> of<00:03:00.080> my<00:03:00.230> role<00:03:00.410> with<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.739> NRL<00:03:01.160> is<00:03:01.310> that

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
factor of my role with the NRL is that

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.520 
factor of my role with the NRL is that
I'm<00:03:01.700> in<00:03:01.819> a<00:03:01.910> neutral<00:03:02.269> position<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.870> therefore

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
I'm in a neutral position and therefore

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.490 
I'm in a neutral position and therefore
I<00:03:03.590> get<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.860> work<00:03:03.980> across<00:03:04.250> all<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.760> NRL<00:03:05.150> clubs

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
I get to work across all the NRL clubs

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.840 
I get to work across all the NRL clubs
so<00:03:06.500> I've<00:03:06.650> been<00:03:06.769> in<00:03:06.890> this<00:03:06.980> role<00:03:07.160> for<00:03:07.220> just<00:03:07.549> over

so I've been in this role for just over

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.280 
so I've been in this role for just over
a<00:03:07.880> year<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.450> if<00:03:08.569> I<00:03:08.690> look<00:03:08.840> back<00:03:09.019> on<00:03:09.140> my<00:03:09.170> time

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
a year and if I look back on my time

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.259 
a year and if I look back on my time
I've<00:03:09.709> probably<00:03:10.130> spent<00:03:10.400> about<00:03:10.580> five<00:03:10.850> months<00:03:11.150> in

building those relationships at the same
time<00:03:18.350> it's<00:03:18.500> important<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:19.070> we<00:03:19.220> bring<00:03:19.400> the

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.970 
and the pressure put on them to succeed
that's<00:03:32.630> huge<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:33.170> you<00:03:33.410> know<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.650> thing<00:03:33.829> is<00:03:33.859> a

lot of this pressure comes from the

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.810 
lot of this pressure comes from the
parents<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.260> that's<00:03:37.220> why<00:03:37.370> we've<00:03:37.549> started

parents and that's why we've started

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.520 
parents and that's why we've started
engaging<00:03:38.060> with<00:03:38.510> parents<00:03:38.870> of<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.049> community

the<00:03:41.720> difference<00:03:41.870> between<00:03:42.170> providing<00:03:42.950> support

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
the difference between providing support

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.610 
the difference between providing support
for<00:03:43.609> their<00:03:43.760> boys<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.239> when<00:03:44.870> that<00:03:44.989> support<00:03:45.440> can

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
for their boys and when that support can
