might be

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.140 
might be
they're<00:02:11.480> all<00:02:11.840> mostly<00:02:12.700> exactly<00:02:13.730> just<00:02:14.240> sing<00:02:14.960> I

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
mean let's say I mean if I compare into

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.630 
mean let's say I mean if I compare into
this<00:02:21.440> beats<00:02:21.680> me<00:02:21.950> of<00:02:22.220> course

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
this beats me of course

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.810 
this beats me of course
beats<00:02:23.030> is<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.390> little<00:02:23.720> bit<00:02:23.840> better<00:02:24.640> but<00:02:25.640> still

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
beats is a little bit better but still

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.190 
beats is a little bit better but still
these<00:02:26.540> are<00:02:26.600> really<00:02:27.050> good<00:02:28.000> headphones<00:02:29.200> I'm

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
these are really good headphones I'm

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.450 
these are really good headphones I'm
buying<00:02:30.500> from<00:02:30.680> 30<00:02:30.980> bucks<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:32.050> I'm<00:02:33.050> really<00:02:33.590> you

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
buying from 30 bucks and I'm really you

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:42.420

I'm<00:02:43.430> having<00:02:43.760> problems<00:02:44.150> with<00:02:44.570> these<00:02:44.720> I<00:02:45.110> think

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
I'm having problems with these I think

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.560 
I'm having problems with these I think
they're<00:02:45.890> pretty<00:02:46.070> good<00:02:46.370> they're<00:02:46.640> just<00:02:47.360> like

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
they're pretty good they're just like

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.250 
they're pretty good they're just like
the<00:02:47.720> beats<00:02:47.959> I<00:02:48.430> mean<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.730> think<00:02:50.630> they're<00:02:51.080> just

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
the beats I mean I think they're just

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.480 
the beats I mean I think they're just
the<00:02:51.440> same<00:02:51.850> so<00:02:53.500> they're<00:02:54.500> almost<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:55.010> same<00:02:55.040> two

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
the same so they're almost the same two

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.250 
the same so they're almost the same two
sounds<00:02:56.260> beats<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.800> bad<00:02:58.040> stuff<00:02:58.640> like<00:02:58.820> that<00:02:59.260> if

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
sounds beats the bad stuff like that if

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.830 
sounds beats the bad stuff like that if
I<00:03:00.470> compare<00:03:00.850> these<00:03:01.850> headphones<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.600> beads

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
I compare these headphones the beads

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.590 
I compare these headphones the beads
they're<00:03:03.500> almost<00:03:04.180> likely<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.510> same<00:03:06.490> so<00:03:07.600> that's

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
they're almost likely the same so that's

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.990 
they're almost likely the same so that's
the<00:03:08.840> end<00:03:08.990> of<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.260> video<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:14.110> Philips

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
the end of the video and so Philips

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.100 
the end of the video and so Philips

I<00:03:26.019> can't<00:03:27.019> just<00:03:27.200> for<00:03:27.410> these<00:03:27.739> just<00:03:28.280> I<00:03:28.640> could<00:03:29.030> I'd

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
I can't just for these just I could I'd

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.540 
I can't just for these just I could I'd
say<00:03:29.390> let's<00:03:30.019> see<00:03:30.200> if<00:03:30.260> you're<00:03:30.470> an<00:03:30.530> airplane<00:03:30.800> and

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
say let's see if you're an airplane and

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.090 
say let's see if you're an airplane and
you're<00:03:32.150> just<00:03:32.390> right<00:03:32.870> by<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.170> engine<00:03:33.830> you<00:03:33.980> know

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
you're just right by the engine you know

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.670 
you're just right by the engine you know
the<00:03:34.250> engine<00:03:34.640> makes<00:03:34.880> a<00:03:35.030> lot<00:03:35.209> of<00:03:35.239> noise<00:03:35.390> so<00:03:35.959> I'm

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
the engine makes a lot of noise so I'm

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.160 
the engine makes a lot of noise so I'm
just<00:03:36.980> trying<00:03:37.280> to<00:03:37.340> switch<00:03:37.670> on<00:03:38.320> right<00:03:39.320> here<00:03:41.170> and

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
just trying to switch on right here and

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.340 
just trying to switch on right here and
you<00:03:42.410> want<00:03:42.590> here<00:03:42.830> maybe<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:44.510> might<00:03:44.870> hear<00:03:45.320> a

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
you want here maybe you might hear a

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.300 
you want here maybe you might hear a
little<00:03:45.530> bit<00:03:46.190> but<00:03:46.670> not<00:03:46.850> too<00:03:46.910> much<00:03:47.360> so<00:03:48.160> I<00:03:49.160> think

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
little bit but not too much so I think

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.840 
little bit but not too much so I think
that's<00:03:49.700> pretty<00:03:49.940> much<00:03:50.180> it<00:03:50.480> for<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:51.590> video

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
that's pretty much it for the video

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.630 
that's pretty much it for the video
