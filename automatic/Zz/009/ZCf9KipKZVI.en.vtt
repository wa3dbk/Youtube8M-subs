00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.120
 are on this occasion is I'm going to talk 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.160
 about colorimetry this is important in 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.070
 the world of makeup since we 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.840
 allow to discover the different 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.710
 different types of combinations that 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.050
 we can achieve 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.430
 when doing a makeup we have to be 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.609
 a little bit open to explore 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.059
 different colors to be able to achieve a 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:37.420
 Really beautiful makeup beautifying 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:40.000
 and creative above all 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.489
 to begin with I'm going to give you something 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 surely in school they learned and 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.969
 it's about the groups of the colors the 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.699
 first group is primary colors 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.309
 this group are clearly colors 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:59.180
 cigars are not formed from any other color 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:02.120
 and it's yellow, red and blue 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.309
 we continue with the secondary group that 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.390
 is going to form the combination 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.119
 of the primaries example a red with the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.970
 yellow one yellow with blue blue 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.480
 with red etcetera and from there we are going to take 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.000
 the color orange 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.650
 green and violet 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.870
 and finally there is the group of 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.760
 tertiary colors that is more the 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.970
 combination of a primary color and a 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.370
 secondary and from there comes a great 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.770
 amount of 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.570
 of colors that for example we have the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.180
 turquoise the purple the green apple a 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.730
 From this we can see that there are 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.920
 different types of colors but also 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.390
 we have to learn that there are dyes 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:54.020
 shades and shades the dye is the most 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.840
 white the tone is the most gray color and the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.750
 and the shadow is the most beautiful color this 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.400
 will help us complete in our 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.980
 make a clear example sometimes 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.290
 we see in palettes for example how is this 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.200
 palette that comes a whole range of 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.150
 colors and we do not know how to combine in the 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.700
 makeup there are three types of 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.950
 of makeup back the redundancy and 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.079
 the first one is makeup 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.629
 monochromatic for that I recommend you 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:24.120
 have a color circle such as 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.519
 that I teach them here so they can 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.420
 realize that you can combine with that 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:34.890
 the monochromatic is the makeup that 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.159
 is formed of tone and shadow tint this 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.980
 it means that if I'm going to give a rose 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:44.780
 I'm going to be a paler red or a pink 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.299
 darker and thus make up a makeup 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.510
 monochromatic using a single color then 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:54.269
 we continue with an anal makeup 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.000
 that it was formed from one color and 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.599
 your neighbors a clear example is the red 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.760
 orange and yellow able to be 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.690
 asking how can I combine all of that 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.160
 you can then we continue with him 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.150
 complementary opposites that are going to 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.750
 formed from d 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.970
 the opposite of what they see in the circle 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.870
 the one on the other side in shape 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.360
 linear of the circle a clear example is 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.360
 the violet and the yellow and the blue and the 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.890
 orange and we are again makeup 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.990
 triadic that is a little more more played and 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.630
 This is going to form 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.520
 the colors that are x distant to the 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.670
 wheel of colombia this will form a 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.960
 equilateral triangle a clear example is 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.960
 violet orange and green 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.260
 from this we can have a 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.850
 countless makeups 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.220
 combinations the only thing that you have to be 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.340
 dare they can not always be in 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.680
 monochromatic triadic I know 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.840
 complementary analog like those 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.640
 comments to a single makeup 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.569
 we can also wear the dress 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:10.569
 Accessories for pro dresses shoes 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:13.030
 wallets and make a makeup for 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.980
 that I understand a little better if 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.650
 I have a party and I'm going to wear a dress 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.109
 violet I can do an opposite 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.150
 complementary to violet that wants 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.979
 say that my makeup will be 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.080
 included yellow also likewise with 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.090
 the same violet dress I can use a 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.360
 analogous makeup and I will use in my 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.169
 eyes a reddish violet or a violet 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.360
 bluish 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.749
 or for example if we want to make a 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.249
 triadic makeup we will use with the 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:49.090
 same violet dress 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:51.370
 the orange and the green in our eyes 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.660
 so you have a number of combinations 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.630
 to do the truths 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.730
 I encourage you to try it 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.330
 experience those combinations out there 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:06.120
 sometimes one has a style and always 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.640
 ends then putting on the same 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.430
 color to me happens to me for example in the 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.640
 eyes always always always like me 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:18.570
 use violet but here I see that violet 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.030
 I can combine it with blue or red 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.790
 and I know it's going to look good because in the 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.130
 chromatic circle tells us that they are 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.820
 combinable I hope you liked it 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.970
 this video you have understood if you 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:36.000
 liked to like it the video tell me 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.290
 what do you think if you have any doubt that 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.410
 you left I do not know if I was 100% clear 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.820
 question - it's not a problem and if it's the 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.640
 first time you see this channel 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.490
 subscribe to the bottom part and we 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.690
 we see in the next video a chao 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.640
 this time I made a makeup 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.550
 inspired by the video of Katy Perry and 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:00.430
 huawei that are gray tones 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.320
 violet red dots and well this is the 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.820
 the truth is that I loved it 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.820
 and I hope that you too
