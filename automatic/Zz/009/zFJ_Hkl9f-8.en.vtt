00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
just like the way this deck looks I like

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.710 
just like the way this deck looks I like
the<00:02:59.570> way<00:02:59.690> it<00:02:59.780> feels<00:03:00.190> with<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.400> air<00:03:02.330> cushion

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720

finish<00:03:03.110> it's<00:03:03.380> pretty<00:03:04.070> reliable<00:03:04.670> it's<00:03:04.850> going

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
finish it's pretty reliable it's going

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.830 
finish it's pretty reliable it's going
to<00:03:05.060> hold<00:03:05.270> up<00:03:05.420> pretty<00:03:05.690> well<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:06.170> it's<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.840> think

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
to hold up pretty well and it's I think

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.960 
to hold up pretty well and it's I think
this<00:03:08.960> deck<00:03:09.350> would<00:03:09.530> be<00:03:09.650> great<00:03:10.070> for<00:03:10.310> magic<00:03:10.700> just

this deck would be great for magic just

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.300 
this deck would be great for magic just
because<00:03:11.330> of<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.860> something<00:03:12.860> different<00:03:13.220> to

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
because of the something different to
