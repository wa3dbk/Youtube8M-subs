string<00:00:25.079> attachments<00:00:25.769> two<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.400> go<00:00:27.089> from<00:00:27.300> each

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
string attachments two that go from each

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.720 
string attachments two that go from each
end<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.319> the<00:00:28.439> hammock<00:00:28.829> then<00:00:29.249> you<00:00:29.339> have<00:00:29.460> three

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
end of the hammock then you have three

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.669 
end of the hammock then you have three
on<00:00:29.849> each<00:00:30.329> other<00:00:30.720> end<00:00:31.050> which<00:00:31.409> you'll<00:00:31.589> see

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
on each other end which you'll see

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.330 
on each other end which you'll see
outside<00:00:31.919> that<00:00:32.820> have<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.570> line<00:00:34.380> locks<00:00:34.740> on<00:00:35.100> them

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
outside that have the line locks on them

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.710 
outside that have the line locks on them
so<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.580> you<00:00:35.730> could<00:00:35.850> tighten<00:00:36.060> them<00:00:36.240> up<00:00:36.300> once

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
so that you could tighten them up once

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.750 
so that you could tighten them up once
you've<00:00:36.960> put<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.830> stakes<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> grounds

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
you've put the stakes and the grounds

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.490 
you've put the stakes and the grounds
for<00:00:38.970> it<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.240> will<00:00:39.540> say<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.960> doesn't<00:00:40.230> include<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
for it I will say it doesn't include the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.590 
for it I will say it doesn't include the
stakes<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.550> would<00:00:41.760> definitely<00:00:42.090> invest<00:00:42.210> in

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
stakes so I would definitely invest in

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.080 
stakes so I would definitely invest in
some<00:00:42.750> stakes<00:00:43.020> or<00:00:43.260> even<00:00:44.160> better<00:00:44.430> yet<00:00:44.670> if<00:00:44.940> you

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
some stakes or even better yet if you

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.270 
some stakes or even better yet if you
have<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> tent<00:00:45.720> and<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:45.990> don't<00:00:46.650> mind<00:00:46.830> borrowing

have a tent and you don't mind borrowing

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.420 
have a tent and you don't mind borrowing
from<00:00:47.370> your<00:00:47.580> tent<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.810> takes<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.560> use<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.980> it

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.649 
and how easy it is so let's get started
its<00:01:35.070> first<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.640> each<00:01:35.760> end<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.090> your<00:01:36.210> dry<00:01:36.420> fly

go ahead and string up your dry fly
first<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.690> then<00:01:52.290> put<00:01:52.560> your<00:01:52.650> straps

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
first and then put your straps

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.390 
first and then put your straps
underneath<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.820> or<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.930> above<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.070> that

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
underneath it or just above it so that

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.679 
underneath it or just above it so that
it<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:57.270> at<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.930> level<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.260> want<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.619> hang<00:01:58.830> it

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
it is at the level you want to hang it

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.670 
it is at the level you want to hang it
but<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.720> kind<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.020> skip<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.380> step

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
but I kind of skip that step

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.740 
but I kind of skip that step
either<00:02:02.070> way<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.490> do<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.150> still<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:03.450> to

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
either way you do it it's still going to

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.270 
either way you do it it's still going to
work<00:02:05.150> then<00:02:06.150> on<00:02:06.510> each<00:02:07.020> side<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:07.799> have<00:02:07.920> three

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
work then on each side you have three

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.580 
work then on each side you have three
different<00:02:08.640> strings<00:02:09.060> pull<00:02:09.450> strings<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:10.110> pull

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
different strings pull strings to pull

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.610 
different strings pull strings to pull
it<00:02:10.709> tight<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.330> as<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.420> can<00:02:12.540> see<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:13.470> just

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
it tight and as you can see you just

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.390 
it tight and as you can see you just
pull<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:13.890> tight<00:02:14.220> here

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
pull it tight here

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.759 
pull it tight here
and<00:02:15.670> either<00:02:16.330> use<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.959> tree<00:02:18.180> or<00:02:19.319> take<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.680> the

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
and either use a tree or take it to the

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:21.360 
and either use a tree or take it to the
ground

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
ground

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.280 
ground
I<00:02:22.590> used<00:02:23.590> 10<00:02:24.190> stakes<00:02:24.549> that<00:02:25.540> was<00:02:25.750> just<00:02:25.959> as<00:02:26.080> good

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
I used 10 stakes that was just as good

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.199 
I used 10 stakes that was just as good
they<00:02:26.890> don't<00:02:27.129> come<00:02:27.370> with<00:02:27.519> it<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:27.970> do<00:02:28.180> have

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
they don't come with it so you do have

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.289 
they don't come with it so you do have
to<00:02:28.420> purchase<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:29.170> on<00:02:29.640> your<00:02:30.640> own<00:02:30.670> as<00:02:31.239> a

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
to purchase this on your own as a

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.559 
to purchase this on your own as a
separate<00:02:31.810> item<00:02:32.579> but<00:02:33.579> also<00:02:34.060> while<00:02:34.269> you're<00:02:34.450> out

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
separate item but also while you're out

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.149 
separate item but also while you're out
in<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.750> forest<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.200> might<00:02:35.470> even<00:02:35.650> be<00:02:35.860> able<00:02:36.069> to

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
in the forest you might even be able to

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.410 
in the forest you might even be able to
use<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.370> tree<00:02:36.900> like<00:02:37.900> I've<00:02:38.079> done<00:02:38.260> here<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:40.150> attach

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
use a tree like I've done here to attach

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.830 
use a tree like I've done here to attach
it<00:02:40.599> to<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.379> pull<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.709> out<00:02:42.299> also<00:02:43.299> you<00:02:43.629> have

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
it to you to pull it out also you have

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.920 
it to you to pull it out also you have
line<00:02:44.379> locks<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.640> can<00:02:45.849> pull<00:02:46.810> the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
line locks so that you can pull the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.349 
line locks so that you can pull the
string<00:02:47.200> tighter<00:02:47.560> or<00:02:47.980> looser<00:02:48.190> just<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.299> you

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
string tighter or looser just so you

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.750 
string tighter or looser just so you
have<00:02:49.599> tension<00:02:49.930> on<00:02:50.200> your<00:02:50.260> line<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:51.280> this<00:02:51.459> is<00:02:51.609> how

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
have tension on your line so this is how

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.490 
have tension on your line so this is how
it<00:02:52.060> looks<00:02:52.299> pretty<00:02:52.900> much<00:02:53.019> when<00:02:53.200> you're<00:02:53.319> done

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
it looks pretty much when you're done

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.809 
it looks pretty much when you're done
staking<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.400> out

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
staking it out

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.400 
staking it out
I<00:02:54.849> could<00:02:55.420> obviously<00:02:55.720> go<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:56.079> little<00:02:56.319> bit

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
I could obviously go a little bit

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.319 
I could obviously go a little bit
tighter<00:02:56.620> on<00:02:56.769> my<00:02:56.890> lines<00:02:57.129> but<00:02:57.879> I<00:02:57.910> wanted<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.209> give

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
tighter on my lines but I wanted to give

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.660 
tighter on my lines but I wanted to give
you<00:02:58.359> a<00:02:58.450> general<00:02:58.840> idea<00:02:58.989> of<00:02:59.319> it<00:02:59.530> I<00:02:59.739> also<00:03:00.310> could

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
you a general idea of it I also could

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.630 
you a general idea of it I also could
have<00:03:00.730> gone<00:03:00.909> higher<00:03:01.180> obviously<00:03:01.930> but<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.920> really

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
have gone higher obviously but I really

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.430 
have gone higher obviously but I really
just<00:03:03.670> wanted<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.120> see<00:03:04.390> how<00:03:04.750> easy<00:03:05.049> it<00:03:05.230> was
