 Hi everyone, I'm an optimist and consultant to SCOT Consulting. 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.510
 Good Morning 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.559
 but I wanted to pass on to you a vision 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.559
 on Brazilian beef on the international market 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.960
 this vision of a trailer friend of ours 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.330
 who works for a large meat carrier 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.890
 I love a Dutch company. 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:26.880
 according to this trailer 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.449
 the main advantages of Brazilian meat are volumes and prices 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.769
 low 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.350
 the fact that production is concentrating on the hand of a few 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.400
 great fridges also positive for those who buy 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.500
 was always marked and for sale 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
 and with ease of choice of côrtes 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.870
 the quality may be a weak point of Brazilian beef compared to 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.590
 the butt some important competitors 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.200
 as is the case of Argentina 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.080
 It's like the Uruguayan case. 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.110
 despite the improvements in Europe still mainly in Europe. 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.980
 considered does not hurt the game the European breeds provenance for being 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.980
 firmer - normalized heat 7 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.740
 there is also a lot of quality variation between the refrigerators 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.660
 Brazilians, or between the Brazilian brands, and this disturbs 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.710
 with marketing 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.930
 the logistics are bad 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.410
 the Brazilian music due to the great distances covered 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.990
 and also in relation to port programs 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.040
 if there is any problem of freezing for example is somebody entering the chain 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.170
 of cold 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.410
 significantly impaired the quality of the 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.330
 product 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.260
 he even gave an example cited for example man and the canon error in the 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.330
 Sicíla worried in everything that was rested and to that and to turn off the 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.690
 concession system in exchange for 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.040
 in practice the noise 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.670
 on this record would not be long if we were not waiting 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.670
 this problem, but this is not the Brazilian reality 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.180
 and due to the overproduction in Brazilian plants the contamination of 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.830
 is more frequent than implants tangent and australia despite 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.149
 normal serum levels 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.850
 but I still said 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.279
 he points out that in the two very competitive 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.769
 in terms of the names so 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:20.829
 but he 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.619
 less competitive in terms of quality so if we have to focus 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:30.359
 1 the goal for him to grow in the international market ' 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.969
 he believes that 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:36.869
 and this duty we focus on the work on the quality issue reminds us of 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.709
 quality with the product is not 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.139
 is what the intrinsic criticisms to load marbling fat cover bh 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.679
 or is it a science that is 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.789
 and also involved in process quality 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:52.899
 instability sanity 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:56.059
 the issues microbiological contamination animal welfare 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:58.710
 show today 1 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.589
 fashion that the socio-environmental issue 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:03.959
 elderson hug everyone and until the next
