up on the light you can go ahead and

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:57.420 
up on the light you can go ahead and
turn<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.960> sorry<00:00:30.960> roughing<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.470> around

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.010 

skin<00:00:58.430> there<00:00:58.700> okay<00:00:59.060> once<00:00:59.330> you<00:00:59.450> got<00:00:59.630> it<00:00:59.750> pretty

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
skin there okay once you got it pretty

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.960 
skin there okay once you got it pretty
much<00:01:00.260> wrong<00:01:01.330> you<00:01:02.330> can<00:01:02.450> go<00:01:02.630> ahead<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:03.790> I<00:01:04.790> use<00:01:04.940> a

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
much wrong you can go ahead and I use a

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.200 
much wrong you can go ahead and I use a
skew<00:01:05.600> tool<00:01:06.110> I<00:01:06.410> find<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.160> day<00:01:07.310> works<00:01:07.580> best<00:01:07.730> and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
skew tool I find the day works best and

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.330 
skew tool I find the day works best and
you<00:01:11.210> start<00:01:11.600> working<00:01:11.840> around<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.380> edges<00:01:12.800> like

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
you start working around the edges like

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.150 
you start working around the edges like
that<00:01:13.370> until<00:01:13.970> you<00:01:14.090> got<00:01:14.510> it<00:01:14.720> about<00:01:15.500> where<00:01:16.040> you

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
that until you got it about where you

00:01:16.160 --> 00:02:01.370 
that until you got it about where you
want<00:01:16.370> it

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.950 

all<00:02:01.860> right<00:02:02.040> once<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.880> cut<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.600> it

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.070 

then<00:02:07.260> you<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.460> stop<00:02:08.910> inside<00:02:09.630> on<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.960> other

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
then you can stop inside on the other

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.330 
then you can stop inside on the other
side<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.840> after<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.440> you're<00:02:13.830> pretty<00:02:14.130> much

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
side and after that you're pretty much

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.440 
side and after that you're pretty much
done<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:15.120> can<00:02:15.270> do<00:02:15.420> some<00:02:15.660> standing<00:02:16.230> or<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:18.300> can

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
done you can do some standing or you can

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.250 
done you can do some standing or you can
do<00:02:18.570> whatever<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:19.050> want<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:20.990> it's<00:02:21.990> pretty

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
do whatever you want to it it's pretty

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.090 
do whatever you want to it it's pretty
easy<00:02:22.710> project<00:02:23.810> maybe<00:02:24.810> about<00:02:25.110> five<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.860> ten

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
easy project maybe about five to ten

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.309 
easy project maybe about five to ten
minutes<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:28.130> just<00:02:29.130> finishing<00:02:29.640> up<00:02:29.760> my<00:02:29.790> ball

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.210 

it<00:02:32.739> looks<00:02:32.950> pretty<00:02:33.310> nice<00:02:34.470> like<00:02:35.470> I<00:02:35.650> said<00:02:35.980> it's

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
it looks pretty nice like I said it's

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.020 
it looks pretty nice like I said it's
really<00:02:36.519> easy<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.150> do<00:02:38.340> sums<00:02:39.340> actually<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.760> little

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
really easy to do sums actually a little

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.570 
really easy to do sums actually a little
bit<00:02:40.239> bigger<00:02:40.480> than<00:02:40.659> my<00:02:40.840> other<00:02:40.959> one<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.580> think

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
bit bigger than my other one I think

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.350 
bit bigger than my other one I think
that<00:02:42.879> would<00:02:43.090> be<00:02:43.120> alright

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.360 

and<00:02:48.870> if<00:02:48.990> you<00:02:49.110> don't<00:02:49.320> like<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.650> size<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.310> you

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
and if you don't like the size so you

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.190 
and if you don't like the size so you
know<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.790> just<00:02:50.970> cut<00:02:51.270> off<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.450> little<00:02:51.720> bit<00:02:51.930> at<00:02:52.080> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
know is just cut off a little bit at the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.420 
know is just cut off a little bit at the
bandsaw<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.310> put<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.000> back<00:02:54.120> on<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.510> lathe

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
bandsaw and put it back on the lathe

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.150 
bandsaw and put it back on the lathe
finish<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.580> up<00:02:56.700> again<00:02:58.460> looks<00:02:59.460> a<00:02:59.520> lot<00:02:59.640> better

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.610 

I<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:03.060> do<00:03:03.210> a<00:03:03.240> little<00:03:03.540> bit<00:03:03.750> more<00:03:03.900> work<00:03:04.260> and

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
I just do a little bit more work and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:12.320 
I just do a little bit more work and
I'll<00:03:04.860> be<00:03:05.010> done<00:03:06.890> here<00:03:07.940> it<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:11.180> little<00:03:12.180> bit

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
I'll be done here it is a little bit

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.820 
I'll be done here it is a little bit
rough<00:03:12.540> this<00:03:12.990> because<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.350> was<00:03:13.470> working<00:03:13.740> with

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
rough this because I was working with

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.450 
rough this because I was working with
end<00:03:14.070> grain<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.690> you're<00:03:15.690> going<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.020> have<00:03:16.170> that

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
end grain and you're going to have that

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.380 
end grain and you're going to have that
now<00:03:17.460> you<00:03:17.520> just<00:03:17.700> stand<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.150> up<00:03:18.240> and<00:03:18.420> do<00:03:18.600> whatever

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
now you just stand it up and do whatever

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.070 
now you just stand it up and do whatever
so<00:03:21.390> there<00:03:21.540> we<00:03:21.690> go

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
so there we go

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.860 
so there we go
wooden<00:03:22.650> ball
