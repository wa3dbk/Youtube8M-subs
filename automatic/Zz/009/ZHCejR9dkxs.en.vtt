00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170
 when i read the 4 hour book 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.880
 Tim Ferris week I thought so a 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.780
 cool idea but still work not by 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.500
 40 hours a day 5 days a week for 8 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.000
 hours work 4 hours a week 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.769
 I now dreamed about reading this book 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.769
 four day week when i work 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.880
 only four hours it worked out 16 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.769
 hours and when he saw new ones 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.829
 opportunities before after read 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.809
 I saw a book that even this 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.760
 imposing goal which he set himself 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.890
 she is very modest because there is tim 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.980
 ferris there are new rich who 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.110
 really work very very 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.039
 short time during the week 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.820
 someone there two hours 48 well maximum 16 yes 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.280
 and such people they no longer work 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.480
 more doing what they love 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.629
 doing hobbies 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.910
 they travel they spend time with 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.720
 those people with whom they like 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.479
 communicate and I set myself exactly 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.580
 such goals, I noted that we are good 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.979
 Now we reduce the time when we work 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.400
 we increase the time when we are 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.610
 with our loved ones, we increase the time 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.610
 leisure travel and we increase 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.860
 time when we do our hobbies 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.170
 your favorite things your own 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.710
 hobbies and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.850
 as soon as I started to apply everything 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.250
 Tim Ferris recommendations 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.659
 because of this book i saw it all 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.979
 works in practice 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.240
 if it really apply and if 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.140
 learn those skills 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.530
 and which are just given in the book about 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.020
 who says tim ferris many people i 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.990
 already seen many people who read 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.479
 they put this book on the shelf and say 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.790
 that in general it could be somewhere 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.270
 works in the west but not with us and 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.920
 it certainly is not so what's the difference 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.319
 where we live in russia in usa in indonesia 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.069
 no matter what we have access to 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.129
 the internet 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:18.290
 which now blurs all boundaries between 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:21.720
 countries between nations between markets and 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.670
 that's as soon as we understand what a limits 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.709
 it is actually not then we understand 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.030
 that it doesn't matter 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:32.340
 usa works it anywhere she works 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.129
 and then we understand that this 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.069
 works everywhere for every person 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.959
 set such a goal and here in 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:45.000
 I want to complete this video 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:47.549
 you apply the knowledge that is written 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.709
 and told in the book 4 hour working 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:55.709
 week and tim ferry myself and naturally i 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.110
 I wish you that life lifestyle 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.170
 such a lifestyle of which Tim speaks 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.170
