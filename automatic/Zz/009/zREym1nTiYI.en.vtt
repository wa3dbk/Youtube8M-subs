00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.940
 hi hi all friends subscribers 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.150
 my channel today would like to tell 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.330
 about ten reasons for which is 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.160
 go to linux with windows operating 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.410
 systems 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.410
 the first reason i think is that vindos 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.510
 is a paid procyon kai alina snow 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.960
 Why overpay if there is free 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.449
 analogue 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.029
 yes you say a dozen promise to do 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.109
 free there a lot of pitfalls there 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:34.710
 I heard this info that dates pirates 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.290
 updated there all things but free 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.329
 only cheese in a mousetrap guys there 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.110
 certain period of time the whole thing 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.579
 for free will continue with your general row 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.890
 grandmas for a subscription 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.649
 that is, not everything is so simple the system is not yet 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.160
 released in release so this reason is still 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.070
 the following second reason is relevant I 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.840
 I think 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.230
 what is relevant is that big 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.809
 part of the software on windows toll yes she 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.210
 linux no you have application managers 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.460
 you have repositories you have and 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.350
 commands you through the terminal 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.619
 either through the application the whole thing 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.140
 install update on windows you 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.720
 it is necessary either a lot of bash 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.030
 and in dollars there are huge sums for 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.650
 software is also a bunch of viruses in this whole thing 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.410
 either you have to mess with 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.259
 With cracks and this, too, in the same I can speak 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.710
 pick up and viruses computer harm 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.479
 and actually uncomfortable but why extra 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.170
 hemorrhoids 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:41.450
 3 reason I think that in general I 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.789
 I think all were connected to the fact that windows 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.970
 through time and it starts to brake terribly 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.280
 linux no windows have three returned 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.640
 own registries because of constructive 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.860
 features of the system but through time 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.899
 starts to buy food we all noticed before 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.200
 put windows on started sweetie 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:03.920
 tyry-pyry flies there shorter but then 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.520
 actually gone to the brakes and so on 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.160
 so linux linux our fourth 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.620
 cause 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.660
 windows system it gets clogged up and 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.440
 not optimal use disk 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.180
 space 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.560
 and linux is not with it all okay 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.280
 windows a lot of garbage not only from 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.790
 browser registry there various porridges there 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.840
 and disk garbage there a bunch and fragments 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.960
 various this date there is a bunch of everything 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.720
 look there bang and run there actually 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.520
 giga space there is no disk leaves and 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.650
 space over time is nowhere 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.320
 a bunch of trash 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.680
 5 reason I think that but own on 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.840
 floats out of 4 reasons for windows 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.840
 necessary to defrag linux such 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.680
 there is no problem as the other is used 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.580
 system 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.130
 and features of the structure, it did not become 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.460
 defragment fragments do not need it 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:08.400
 windows is actually reduced 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:11.200
 speed of work on disk load up to and 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.420
 hemorrhoids are just not yes why are you there once 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.340
 week or how many run there 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.000
 defragmentation follow this in 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.590
 own linus solved this problem 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.410
 actually linux here so our choice 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.900
 why windows won't do it and don't know 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.560
 there the problem is solved very quickly 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.660
 shift 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:36.370
 the file system did not solve this problem 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:38.980
 wanders from xp and above damn oh well six 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.430
 the reason i think is that over windows 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.860
 generally a bunch of viruses and spam volumes and worms 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.739
 and Trojans on the Internet there is a bunch 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.440
 In general, everything and you can pick up some 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.370
 Spandex zhku there before the browser will infect 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.930
 us uchetka chrome and all that later 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.700
 own leave feeder slide 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.340
 various advertising and so on i mean 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.330
 it's not good linux 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.090
 Generally about the structure of the system 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:12.489
 the system itself protect is protected 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:14.860
 although generally open source system but 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.169
 protection is at the level and the background process 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.030
 without your knowledge will not start you 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.639
 the password will be requested you cut off 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.470
 and the virus as they say goodbye then 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.350
 have linux safe system 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.889
 and viruses are mostly written under windows 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.389
 under linux the virus is generally minimum and 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.639
 so actually about linux it 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.160
 much safer it is used and in 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.780
 banks and in various structures where 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.780
 general safety is important 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.530
 i.e. linux is cooler i security plan 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.780
 you do not need to buy no antivirus and 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.960
 Actually, I think you understand in general 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.840
 the seventh reason linux is easier and more stable 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.789
 yes there is no data from the lag of Windows 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.120
 proper windows dam lag because 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.800
 reasons that described previously to 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.050
 clogs and defragmentation need to 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.570
 new Windows flies there in a month she 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.770
 brakes the vag and there and so on that is 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:12.150
 linux stable linux linux our all 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.849
 roughly speaking the coupe has such an opinion 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.010
 the eighth reason and one of the main 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.800
 Benefits Linux can work in 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.160
 live mode from removable media and you can 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.740
 make changes to be remembered 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.349
 install applications on linux 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.450
 which is on a flash drive and it is very 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.280
 handy tool for a sysadmin or 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.639
 generally for users who are active 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.370
 enjoys yes here let's say flew 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.770
 windows is the same yes and you need to move 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.169
 data such a scenario you stick a flash drive 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.729
 load it and do 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:49.090
 In general, all you need with your file 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:53.789
 system transfer that is working with 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:56.050
 life support here as well may be there until 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.509
 connect to a different computer with 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.490
 flash drives yes there are a lot of viruses on Windows 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.569
 booted linux about what you need 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.749
 transferred there without the threat of infection 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:09.159
 viruses whole thing and do but always 

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:11.590
 convenient to have your operating room at hand 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:12.219
 system on a flash drive up in your pocket with your 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.439
 data 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:16.060
 any computer stick and under your arms 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:19.240
 you have your operating system that is 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:23.620
 a bunch of the advantage of this solution think you 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:26.469
 I understand 9 reason why it is worth 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.719
 switch from windows to linux assuming that 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:31.479
 he from linux you probably know how to 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:36.339
 linux users like my viewers 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:38.770
 my linux channel group has linux 

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:40.229
 many possibilities for customizing a bunch 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.669
 various shells 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:45.460
 the user can be as convenient as possible 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:47.139
 to customize the system if ready 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.509
 solutions generally lack but 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:52.659
 not enough of all these shells 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:54.550
 you can redo any shell 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:56.560
 an adapter for yourself that is linux can 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.319
 do anything 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.460
 what the user wants is convenient 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:05.770
 very relevant ie customization 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:09.729
 individualization is very cool windows 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:12.339
 well you are not windows and what did 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:17.760
 microsoft theme is ahead of us 

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:20.730
 enjoy here friends and 10 reason 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.190
 I did not write it specifically here I suggest 

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:25.620
 you write a tenth reason why 

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:28.800
 actually you think it is worth moving to 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:31.200
 linux with windows operating system 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.530
 maybe I missed something and I wonder 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:38.100
 hear your opinion comment this 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:39.480
 video I am interested in your opinion I hope 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.610
 it was useful to you if 

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.280
 like it please put like and
