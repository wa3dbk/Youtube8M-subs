00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.740
 hello all friends welcome to this 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.530
 video tutorial as they call them from 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.349
 how did this plane know that it flies a lot 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:15.089
 for me at least it flies me a lot and is 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.089
 good pimp 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.820
 I will be doing the steps slowly 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.040
 so you can enter first 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:29.000
 you need a A4 sheet of what is normal 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:32.460
 that you have everything at home and we started like this 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.670
 the corner we take it 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.140
 and we make the edge an edge of this 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.140
 parallel to the other 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.730
 OK 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.200
 so it would be 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.200
 now the same with the other side 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.140
 this to me I'm no good but 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.140
 good 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.309
 It will be a little hem but 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:08.030
 well , nothing happens 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.640
 and now there's kind of like a club 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.800
 you turn around and what you have to do 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.090
 is 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:19.270
 fold what is the folio to where 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.420
 the cross is marked up here and up 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.420
 here 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.760
 every day like this 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.110
 now he stretches him jce and you turn him around 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.870
 by pressing it the center point 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.050
 from the cross 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.870
 will stay like this up will be there 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.080
 then here be attentive 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:53.490
 we will press down here folded by the 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.490
 side and 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.940
 there it would be 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.960
 OK 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.440
 but a thing like that 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.990
 Now what you have to do is this 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.330
 tip 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.330
 the you bring up here 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:18.760
 cone 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.760
 up here and the same with the other 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.060
 OK 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.120
 A) Yes 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.360
 now this peak you take here to 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.360
 center 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.140
 this peak down here too 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.590
 It's worth it 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.590
 would later horita 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.050
 Now what I usually do is always 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.090
 this point the tip lower it down 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.390
 but this time I'm going to do it by cutting the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.200
 because that way you see it easier then what 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.830
 what you have to do now is 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.830
 bend normal to normal as usual 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.260
 cool 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.870
 now 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.890
 let's make the wings and when doing the 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.740
 wings what is the 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.910
 double when the doubles will have to 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.970
 do whatever is parallel to this 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.690
 so I would fly better but go if I did 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.690
 a different poquillo 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.590
 6 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:47.019
 A) Yes 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:49.650
 that equal to the same height and equal with 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.650
 the other side 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.140
 OK 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:07.330
 you have it like that 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:10.760
 so this would have to be now because it 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:14.280
 would do with a kind of ailerons 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.109
 for the plane to plan more like this is 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.389
 and if you get one bigger than another, 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.720
 nothing happens alone that will turn the plane 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.720
 and it is already 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.990
 A) Yes 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.990
 clear, it would raise a little 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:36.240
 now that it's done or you can just 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.300
 make some cuts 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.320
 I usually put this this down and 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.610
 on this side 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.320
 this one up 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.129
 and to put it like that 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.059
 OK 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:53.919
 go for your doctor and now also what 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:55.950
 what I usually do is break it here 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.870
 down 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.080
 and here as well as on the sides but 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.490
 because it goes then 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.060
 on the plane 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.380
 pressures here 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.380
 and that of nobody else 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.129
 OK 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.659
 and it is already that way 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:22.249
 Now what I said about the tip 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:24.639
 placed as we go outside is cut the 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:24.639
 chair 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.350
 and so would he saw 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.840
 OK 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.750
 For me, it flies a lot, I do not know 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.360
 you how it will be good if you liked 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.030
 read me if you liked it very much 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.380
 there are favorite favorites latrilla and 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.380
 Nothing bye
