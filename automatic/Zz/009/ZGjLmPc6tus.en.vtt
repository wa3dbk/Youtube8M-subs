00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.230
 writer on the edge 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.230
 I took my budget the same time 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.340
 Besides 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.750
 not 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.350
 the worst 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.470
 the worst thing that I still do not know 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.260
 what I want 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.200
 why i want 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.480
 why not 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.000
 I have this all the time without thinking 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.360
 the fact that the streets are creative people 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.750
 think yes no 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.890
 i don't know february big savino yes 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.010
 I'm afraid that I have no desires 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.320
 you know how it is and think damn you 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.070
 just work you work I'm just 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.280
 workers I just journalists do not belong 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.430
 yourself that now the TV host author 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.050
 in Astana some kind of artist to learn 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.800
 draw already done the first exhibition 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.150
 means there 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.900
 so negative 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.660
 firstly not very responsible 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.210
 principle for some steps 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.250
 and before other people principle 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.990
 probably take a break in front of you probably 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.000
 all but first of all 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.440
 so without starting, I took a step 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.330
 later 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.860
 my gosh, not everything will work out and I want it 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.640
 not always because just here I am 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.010
 cynically want something but recently 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.560
 it is known that I was recently I understood 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.170
 i don't want anything invested 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.590
 I want Norway 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.100

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.440
 summit 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.650
 it is necessary all the same as something so make out 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.400
 how do you read if you do not want something 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.900
 to think 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.470

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.100
 I don’t know what I want and didn’t give 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.980
 took place when people talk about everything 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.700
 it's more you post the light 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.350
 people who are really clear 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.390
 understand what they want 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.010
 and they go to their goal 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.399
 I do not have them 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.769

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.469

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.029
 me that's just the conventions of this life 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:18.989
 here it is and creation is important the consequences all 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.949
 because if the end of the year there themselves 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:24.229
 their lives working high life 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:26.339

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:28.549
 held for people who are successful and all 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.399
