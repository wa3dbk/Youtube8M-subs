00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.080 

so<00:00:05.630> the<00:00:05.750> sk<00:00:06.050> 450<00:00:06.680> is<00:00:06.980> a<00:00:07.040> great<00:00:07.370> little<00:00:07.640> frame

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
so the sk 450 is a great little frame

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.950 
so the sk 450 is a great little frame
for<00:00:09.010> starting<00:00:10.010> off<00:00:10.100> with<00:00:10.340> but<00:00:10.690> probably<00:00:11.690> shown

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
for starting off with but probably shown

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.220 
for starting off with but probably shown
this<00:00:12.080> before<00:00:12.139> but<00:00:12.760> the<00:00:13.760> flex<00:00:14.150> on<00:00:14.389> these<00:00:14.719> arms

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
this before but the flex on these arms

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:23.500 
this before but the flex on these arms
is<00:00:16.060> quite<00:00:17.060> a<00:00:17.090> bit<00:00:17.800> so<00:00:19.630> not<00:00:20.630> ideal<00:00:21.140> for<00:00:22.510> the

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
is quite a bit so not ideal for the

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.710 
is quite a bit so not ideal for the
quadcopter<00:00:23.750> to<00:00:24.260> have<00:00:24.350> so<00:00:24.530> much<00:00:24.650> flex<00:00:24.980> going<00:00:25.250> on

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
quadcopter to have so much flex going on

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.150 
quadcopter to have so much flex going on
so<00:00:26.720> I'm<00:00:26.960> going<00:00:27.200> to<00:00:27.230> basically<00:00:27.560> move<00:00:27.830> all<00:00:28.100> of

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
so I'm going to basically move all of

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.479 
so I'm going to basically move all of
this<00:00:29.289> kit<00:00:30.400> onto<00:00:31.629> this<00:00:32.949> s500<00:00:33.949> frame<00:00:34.219> which

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
this kit onto this s500 frame which

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.250 
this kit onto this s500 frame which
basically<00:00:34.969> very<00:00:35.840> much<00:00:36.170> different<00:00:36.800> plastic<00:00:38.260> so

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
basically very much different plastic so

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.310 
basically very much different plastic so
that's<00:00:40.160> my<00:00:40.340> next<00:00:40.520> project<00:00:41.350> and<00:00:44.079> see<00:00:45.079> how<00:00:45.260> it

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
that's my next project and see how it

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.470 
that's my next project and see how it
flies<00:00:45.560> when<00:00:45.890> it's<00:00:46.040> all<00:00:46.370> together<00:00:46.610> I'm

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
flies when it's all together I'm

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.790 
flies when it's all together I'm
beginning<00:00:47.899> to<00:00:47.930> get<00:00:48.200> a<00:00:48.260> little<00:00:48.380> bit<00:00:48.590> concerned

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
beginning to get a little bit concerned

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.950 
beginning to get a little bit concerned
about<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:50.470> multi<00:00:51.470> rotor<00:00:51.649> hobby<00:00:52.540> this<00:00:53.540> is<00:00:53.780> the

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
about the multi rotor hobby this is the

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.290 
about the multi rotor hobby this is the
second<00:00:54.440> frame<00:00:54.770> in<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:55.010> row<00:00:55.220> that<00:00:56.059> I<00:00:56.180> have

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
second frame in a row that I have

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.010 
second frame in a row that I have
received<00:00:56.480> that<00:00:57.200> has<00:00:57.350> come<00:00:57.590> with<00:00:57.710> instructions

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
received that has come with instructions

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.709 
received that has come with instructions
it's<00:01:00.020> just<00:01:00.260> not<00:01:00.440> quite<00:01:00.620> right<00:01:00.940> anyway<00:01:01.940> we'll

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
it's just not quite right anyway we'll

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.899 
it's just not quite right anyway we'll
get<00:01:02.809> on<00:01:02.960> with<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.170> build<00:01:03.430> so<00:01:04.430> I<00:01:04.489> get<00:01:04.640> to<00:01:04.759> use<00:01:04.879> my

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
get on with the build so I get to use my

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.389 
get on with the build so I get to use my
wiring<00:01:05.390> loom<00:01:05.719> that<00:01:06.049> I<00:01:06.079> built<00:01:06.320> up<00:01:06.500> for<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.799> SK<00:01:07.130> 4

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
wiring loom that I built up for the SK 4

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:17.260 
wiring loom that I built up for the SK 4
54<00:01:11.319> millimeter<00:01:12.319> bullets<00:01:15.729> you<00:01:16.729> can<00:01:16.789> see<00:01:17.060> that

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
54 millimeter bullets you can see that

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.139 
54 millimeter bullets you can see that
the<00:01:17.749> upturn<00:01:18.289> of<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.619> frame<00:01:18.950> which<00:01:19.909> is<00:01:19.939> the

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
the upturn of the frame which is the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.139 
the upturn of the frame which is the
main<00:01:20.509> reason<00:01:20.749> I<00:01:20.929> bought<00:01:21.079> this<00:01:21.289> one<00:01:22.029> give<00:01:23.029> you

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
main reason I bought this one give you

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.870 
main reason I bought this one give you
have<00:01:23.240> more<00:01:23.389> stability<00:01:24.159> as<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:25.340> can<00:01:25.459> see<00:01:25.700> now

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
have more stability as you can see now

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.129 
have more stability as you can see now
with<00:01:26.090> one<00:01:26.329> motor<00:01:26.600> on<00:01:27.069> give<00:01:28.069> it<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.249> twist

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:29.139 
with one motor on give it a twist

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:31.629 
with one motor on give it a twist
doesn't<00:01:30.139> move<00:01:30.319> a<00:01:30.350> lot<00:01:30.649> that's<00:01:31.219> a<00:01:31.369> bit<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.579> same

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:31.639 
doesn't move a lot that's a bit the same

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:34.359 
doesn't move a lot that's a bit the same
force<00:01:32.029> that<00:01:32.119> I<00:01:32.270> was<00:01:32.389> applying<00:01:32.569> to<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.079> SK<00:01:33.709> 450

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
force that I was applying to the SK 450

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.629 
force that I was applying to the SK 450
frame<00:01:34.929> and<00:01:35.929> it<00:01:36.049> moves<00:01:36.259> it<00:01:36.349> about<00:01:36.529> a<00:01:36.770> millimeter

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:37.639 
frame and it moves it about a millimeter

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.120 
frame and it moves it about a millimeter
whereas<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.299> iscap<00:01:38.689> or<00:01:38.929> 50<00:01:39.289> moved<00:01:39.499> about<00:01:39.770> a

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
whereas the iscap or 50 moved about a

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.459 
whereas the iscap or 50 moved about a
centimeter<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.770> big<00:01:43.009> difference<00:01:43.429> in<00:01:43.700> the

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
centimeter so the big difference in the

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.019 
centimeter so the big difference in the
flexibility<00:01:45.469> of<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.709> frame<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.789> this<00:01:46.880> is

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:47.029 
flexibility of the frame so this is

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:48.789 
flexibility of the frame so this is
quite<00:01:47.240> possibly<00:01:47.270> my<00:01:47.869> fastest<00:01:48.289> build<00:01:48.560> ever

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
quite possibly my fastest build ever

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.159 
quite possibly my fastest build ever
given<00:01:49.249> their<00:01:49.549> season<00:01:50.240> motors<00:01:50.599> are<00:01:50.749> all<00:01:50.869> set<00:01:51.139> up

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:51.169 
given their season motors are all set up

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:54.940 
given their season motors are all set up
I<00:01:51.849> did<00:01:52.849> was<00:01:52.999> mark<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.569> AFC's<00:01:54.169> they<00:01:54.590> live<00:01:54.799> the

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
I did was mark the AFC's they live the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.739 
I did was mark the AFC's they live the
clock<00:01:55.279> wise<00:01:55.520> I've<00:01:55.789> left<00:01:55.969> the<00:01:56.090> props<00:01:56.329> on<00:01:56.539> so

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:56.749 
clock wise I've left the props on so

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.929 
clock wise I've left the props on so
there's<00:01:56.929> no<00:01:57.020> mistaking<00:01:57.759> working<00:01:58.759> straight

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
there's no mistaking working straight

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.899 
there's no mistaking working straight
back<00:01:59.149> on<00:01:59.299> the<00:01:59.419> new<00:01:59.569> frame<00:01:59.840> I'd<00:02:00.679> be<00:02:00.919> concerned

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
back on the new frame I'd be concerned

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.989 
back on the new frame I'd be concerned
with<00:02:01.999> this<00:02:02.209> frame<00:02:02.539> my<00:02:03.529> well<00:02:04.039> not<00:02:04.849> really

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:04.999 
with this frame my well not really

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.510 
with this frame my well not really
concern<00:02:05.450> it's<00:02:05.599> just<00:02:05.719> an<00:02:05.810> observation<00:02:06.099> is<00:02:07.099> that

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
concern it's just an observation is that

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
concern it's just an observation is that
there<00:02:07.700> is<00:02:07.819> no<00:02:08.060> X<00:02:09.670> configuration<00:02:10.670> slots<00:02:11.239> for

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
there is no X configuration slots for

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.940 
there is no X configuration slots for
mounting<00:02:11.870> you

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
mounting you

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.040 
mounting you
you're<00:02:13.700> bored<00:02:13.940> too<00:02:15.790> real<00:02:16.900> bit<00:02:17.900> of<00:02:17.989> a

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
you're bored too real bit of a

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.720 
you're bored too real bit of a
limitation<00:02:18.410> but<00:02:18.650> there<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.370> go

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
limitation but there you go

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.199 
limitation but there you go
looks<00:02:20.270> like<00:02:20.450> we'll<00:02:20.599> be<00:02:20.630> taping<00:02:20.989> this<00:02:21.200> one<00:02:21.380> on

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
looks like we'll be taping this one on

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.320 
looks like we'll be taping this one on
well<00:02:23.209> back<00:02:23.599> to<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.780> build

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330

there it is still KK on to test it after
