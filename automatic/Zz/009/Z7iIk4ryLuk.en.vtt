00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.620
 I'll bring a video here teaching how to 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.630
 to plant garlic 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:16.619
 I know everyone is doing this. 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:20.609
 video but rogge also the first thing 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.680
 is to only get people water 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.580
 call being officially just going to train 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:32.250
 in the market buy a head of garlic in 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.660
 separate your teeth after you 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.820
 get the garlic 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.280
 you choose a place that you will 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.579
 plant here I will plant here in this 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.660
 part and I will do the crop rotation 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.510
 garlic and lettuce or there and some on the side 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.170
 then the spacing between a plant and 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.600
 another of 12 centimeters and 15 centimeters 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.980

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.760
