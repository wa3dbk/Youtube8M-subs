00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.400
 Five o'clock, the Frisian news. Good afternoon. 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.800
 After a fierce fire, the Hoogersmilde transmission tower partially collapsed. 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.900
 Nobody was injured, but the damage is great. 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.500
 Moreover, many channels in the North are no longer available. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.600
 You will see the mast fall on images that have just arrived, just before four o'clock. 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.200
 The damage is great. Firefighters were working in the complex ... 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.000
 but could come out on time. Nobody was injured. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.100
 Here the same images in repetition. 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.700
 So Hoogersmilde this afternoon, the collapse of the famous radio tower. 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.000
 At 6 am more about the fire in the mast in Hoogersmilde. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.100
 Four million liters of diesel fuel are stored unsafe in Sneek. 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.600
 This is evident from the inventory of dangerous companies in the Netherlands. 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.600
 The municipality noted at the Noord-Nederlandse Tank storage ... 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.800
 various defects on the Einsteinstraat in Sneek. 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.700
 We also saw an imploded tank. A bit of an expensive word, but ... 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.000
 in an explosion, things collapse, in an implosion it collapses. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.600
 The risks are the same, tanks can tear open. 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.200
 And with fuels that can be dangerous. 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200
 You absolutely have to prevent that. 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.400
 The management of Ucon, owner of the store, is surprised. 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.800
 He says that everything is fine now ... 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.600
 and that the company is not a danger to the environment. 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.600
 The Wadden promenade in Harlingen is a safety risk area from today. 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.700
 Tourists for Terschelling and Vlieland ... 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.100
 today had to do with the new drug controls. 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.900
 They happen at the request of both islands. 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.800
 It was immediately hit this afternoon. A number of people had to hand in their drugs. 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.400
 Because of the safety predicate on the Wadden Promenade ... 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.400
 the police can now also search. 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.200
 The OM and the police have set up this action together ... 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.900
 because we know that there is a nuisance on the islands due to drug use. 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.600
 That is why we are now going to make sure that there are no drugs on the islands. 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.300
 We have set up this promotion for this. 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.300
 Anyone caught gets a fine immediately. 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.400
 Parents of minors are informed. 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.000
 The checks last all summer. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.800
 Parades with decorated cars in Anjum should be a party, the youth believes. 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.700
 The last weeks it went wrong in some villages. 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.300
 The municipality warns that there will no longer be a procession in case of nuisance. 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.200
 This morning was the first and tomorrow the cars will go through the village again. 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.600
 The tour in Anjum is in the spotlight ... 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.300
 because there was earlier nuisance from the youth in Paesens Moddergat and Ternaard. 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.700
 He stood drunk on the wagons, peed against facades ... 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.300
 and threw beer bottles on the street. 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.600
 Mayor Waanders then warned ... 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.900
 that in the event of persistent nuisance the parades are over. 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.000
 The 3-year-old boy from Bolsward who was severely abused this week ... 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.300
 is still in the intensive care unit of the UMCG in Groningen. 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.300
 His condition is stable. 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.500
 The suspects, the 23-year-old mother and her 22-year-old friend ... 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.900
 are being brought before the examining magistrate today ... 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.000
 which determines whether the pre-trial detention will be extended. 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.400
 The two are suspected of attempted homicide or severe assault. 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.100
 The boy is supervised by the Child Protection. A guardian is coming. 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.600
 Two men from Boelenslaan were yesterday between Wartena and Garijp ... 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.900
 injured in a tractor accident. 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.600
 The tractor and trailer tilted due to an unknown cause. 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.700
 One of them got under the tractor and went to the UMCG with the trauma. 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.200
 The other man also had to go to the Groningen hospital. 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.600
 The road was closed for a while after the accident. 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.500
 The first agricultural path in the Netherlands has been opened between Gorredijk and Terwispel. 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.800
 It is a special strip for agricultural traffic. 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.000
 No more tractors on the road or cycle path, for farmers there is this reinforced sand path. 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.900
 Deputy Galema started using the strip in style: on the tractor. 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.500
 The two-kilometer strip must improve road safety and traffic flow. 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.000
 There will also be such an agricultural path between Hallum and Stiens. 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.600
 Doutzen Kroes has the taste of acting. 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.500
 The top model made its debut in the first Dutch film in 3D: 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.500
 Nova Zembla. 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.400
 It is the story of Willem Barentsz. that hibernates on Nova Zembla. 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.000
 It plays in the 16th century and this week there were recordings in old Bruges. 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.500
 Yesterday was the last shooting day for Doutzen Kroes ... 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.400
 that plays a small but important role. 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.700
 Who knows the start of a long film career. 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.500
 It is a new step, but I have experienced it as something very beautiful. 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.900
 I think it might be something for the future. 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.700
 You see her thinking before she answers and responds ... 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.400
 and that makes her so special. There is an interesting inner world. 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.300
 That in combination with her looks, timing and feeling for the camera ... 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.900
 that makes it spectacular. 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.700
 The film Nova Zembla will premiere on November 24. 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.900
 The weather: about 13 degrees tonight. The chance of rain increases. 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.900
 Dry tomorrow, there is a strong southwest wind. 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.600
 More clouds in the afternoon and more rain in the evening. 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.500
 The temperature is around 22 degrees tomorrow. So far this short Hud. 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.500
 Miranda Werkman will soon tell you everything about Simmer in FryslÃ¢n, after Hea! 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.200
 I sign up with more Frisian news, later at 6 a.m. 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.200
