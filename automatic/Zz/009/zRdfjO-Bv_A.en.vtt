00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
something I often will talk to children

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.930 
something I often will talk to children
about<00:00:44.930> their<00:00:45.440> families<00:00:45.890> or<00:00:46.100> their<00:00:46.160> situations

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
about their families or their situations

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.790 
about their families or their situations
and<00:00:47.360> children<00:00:47.840> will<00:00:48.050> do<00:00:48.170> a<00:00:48.200> lot<00:00:48.380> better<00:00:48.560> if

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
and children will do a lot better if

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.830 
and children will do a lot better if
they're<00:00:48.950> able<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:49.280> project<00:00:49.940> onto<00:00:50.270> an<00:00:50.660> object

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
they're able to project onto an object

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.060 
they're able to project onto an object
and<00:00:52.540> so<00:00:53.540> one<00:00:53.780> thing<00:00:53.930> I<00:00:53.990> might<00:00:54.140> do<00:00:54.380> is<00:00:54.590> have<00:00:54.829> them

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
and so one thing I might do is have them

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.860 
and so one thing I might do is have them
come<00:00:55.370> in<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:55.790> pick<00:00:56.060> something<00:00:56.360> that

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
come in and pick something that

come in and pick something that
represents<00:00:57.739> them<00:00:57.980> or<00:00:58.520> represents<00:00:59.180> each

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
represents them or represents each

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.810

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
over to the shelves and they'll find

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.049 
over to the shelves and they'll find
something<00:01:03.860> that<00:01:04.100> it's<00:01:04.220> symbolic<00:01:04.850> of
