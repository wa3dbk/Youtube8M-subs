00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.299
 hello you love and yes we come to 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.370
 my new video 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:12.420
 Today I wanted you my little one 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.920
 but fine dm hall show and yes if 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.549
 you are interested in what I bought so 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.800
 have 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.820
 stay tuned first I have 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.910
 bought me such a matte top coat of 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.699
 l'oréal paris 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.830
 I wanted to wait a minute so one years 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.210
 have a good day because I think so 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.640
 always looks really classy if you 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.620
 The nails stop somehow black 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.260
 or painted white and then stop 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.219
 makes that look nice and looking yes 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.260
 he has now cost four euros 45 and 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.520
 yes I can tell you that's real 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.520
 works but I have the feeling 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.190
 that matte effect after two days 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.469
 somehow weaker so you know 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.180
 what I mean 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.320
 I have one again 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.000
 bought white nail polish because my age 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.520

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.210

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.650
 so nails so that you know only so above 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.270
 that's why the brush was pretty small 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.259
 but I have just another one in it 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.080

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.840

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.140

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.479

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.979

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.660
 I pronounce that correctly 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.489
 now for over two years and 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.220
 I just think great because of 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.319
 is really soft and yes he holds the 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:13.440
 All day and it's just mine 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:14.579
 hair color and that cost 195 then 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.069
 I have another one 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:22.620
 Lipstick bought and although from this 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:25.980
 P2 line from this P2 series this bio 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.040
 color lipstick and that is that the 0 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.650
 10 and the 3rd 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:36.630
 that's just a pretty nude color 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.190
 because I think that we are so dark few 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.900
 sounds do not stand at all that looks 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.989
 simply is somehow painted like 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.700
 a clown and that's why I have 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.350
 make purchases then I wear just 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.040
 and I think that's so much to me 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.459
 stand better 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.049
 the lipstick has now tasted 195 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.730
 then I have one more right 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.230
 bought a cool nail and this one 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.959
 here 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.030
 he has so little snowflakes in it 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.420
 Unfortunately, I have no idea of 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.310
 which brand is that or because of that 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.769
 it did not matter and it was reduced 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.989
 to 95 cents after 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.049
 ok then I'll just take it 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:16.079
 I just do not know which 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:19.190
 brand of heat but now cool and that 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:24.539
 last thing I bought is 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.770
 this eyebrow colors thingy yes 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.640
 that's just eyebrows and eyelashes 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.710
 color from swiss upa and I thought so 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.900
 so well public that one out because how 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.570
 in some I know I am me 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.669
 usually blond hairy and singing 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.450
 I also have blonde eyebrows 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.740
 and eyelashes and stops me because of me 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.210
 must not be unvarnished so well 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.919
 many because I think that 's more 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.760
 like an alien because i have no eyebrows 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.260
 and that's why I have now 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.969
 here with endangered I 've already done that 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.320
 brings now unfortunately I have yet 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:59.370
 not married to the eyelashes because of that 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.390
 stop in the eye and that shows color and 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.890
 that would not be so good if that's in the eye 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.870
 that's why I have that 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.070
 not married but on the eyebrows 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.840
 I have already tried and I think 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.419
 that really good 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.030
 and yes as I said that's great 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:15.510
 and it brown so the color brown it 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.310
 are still black and so and then 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.460
 is also durable and colourfast 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:24.050
 for many weeks that's nice 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:28.250
 and for cf applications 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:31.770

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:35.820
 and yes it was already mine 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:39.810
