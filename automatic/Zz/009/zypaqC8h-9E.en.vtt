00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.359

cases<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:10.260> they<00:01:10.439> were<00:01:10.500> similar<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.890> some<00:01:11.220> that

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
cases but they were similar to some that

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.340 
cases but they were similar to some that
I<00:01:11.430> had<00:01:11.640> been<00:01:11.850> looking<00:01:12.180> at<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.479> amazon<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.229> ebay

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
I had been looking at on amazon and ebay

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.130 
I had been looking at on amazon and ebay
and<00:01:13.860> obviously<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.909> Amazon<00:01:15.270> eBay<00:01:15.540> ones<00:01:15.810> were

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
and obviously the Amazon eBay ones were

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.020 
and obviously the Amazon eBay ones were
a<00:01:16.320> little<00:01:16.560> bit<00:01:16.799> less<00:01:17.070> expensive<00:01:17.790> because

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
a little bit less expensive because

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.810 
a little bit less expensive because
these<00:01:18.390> are<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.930> bit<00:01:19.350> pricier<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.670> really

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
these are a bit pricier but the really

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.429 
these are a bit pricier but the really
cool<00:01:21.030> thing<00:01:21.240> about<00:01:21.330> these<00:01:21.540> cases<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:21.960> all<00:01:22.290> of

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
cool thing about these cases is all of

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.920 
cool thing about these cases is all of
the<00:01:22.560> crystals<00:01:23.040> are<00:01:23.299> swasti<00:01:24.299> crystals<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the crystals are swasti crystals and

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.020 
the crystals are swasti crystals and
Australian<00:01:25.680> crystals<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.580> they're<00:01:26.729> really

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
Australian crystals so they're really

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.030 
Australian crystals so they're really
good<00:01:27.150> quality<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.780> really<00:01:28.229> nice<00:01:28.350> shine<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
good quality have really nice shine and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.830 
good quality have really nice shine and
it<00:01:29.130> doesn't<00:01:29.369> look<00:01:29.460> cheap<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.210> don't<00:01:30.720> know

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
it doesn't look cheap like I don't know

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.510 
it doesn't look cheap like I don't know
maybe<00:01:31.020> some<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.560> might<00:01:31.710> think<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.159> looks<00:01:32.369> a

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
maybe some of you might think it looks a

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.240 
maybe some of you might think it looks a
bit<00:01:32.780> gaudy<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.380> think<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.680> even<00:01:34.979> though

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
bit gaudy but I think that even though

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.210 
bit gaudy but I think that even though
it's<00:01:35.520> very<00:01:35.990> sparkly<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.110> blingy<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.799> doesn't

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
it's very sparkly and blingy it doesn't

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.249 
it's very sparkly and blingy it doesn't
look<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.460> inexpensive<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.020> tell

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
look like inexpensive like you can tell

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.560 
look like inexpensive like you can tell
that<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> quality<00:01:41.220> product<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.180> i

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
that it is a quality product and i

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.800 
since it is hand glued and customized
and<00:03:07.660> all<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:08.380> jazz<00:03:08.680> but<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:10.390> doesn't<00:03:10.690> take

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
and all that jazz but it doesn't take

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.720 
and all that jazz but it doesn't take
that<00:03:10.990> long<00:03:11.050> like<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.740> might<00:03:12.070> take<00:03:12.370> that<00:03:12.580> long

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
that long like it might take that long

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.100 
that long like it might take that long
if<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.970> order<00:03:13.360> when<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.510> lot<00:03:13.690> of<00:03:13.810> people<00:03:14.020> are

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
if you order when a lot of people are

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.410 
if you order when a lot of people are
ordering<00:03:14.320> but<00:03:15.220> for<00:03:15.610> me<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:15.940> took<00:03:16.090> like<00:03:16.240> a<00:03:16.300> week

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
ordering but for me it took like a week

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.120 
ordering but for me it took like a week
and<00:03:16.780> then<00:03:17.050> they<00:03:17.170> shipped<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.830> they<00:03:17.920> ship

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
and then they shipped it and they ship

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.160 
and then they shipped it and they ship
from<00:03:18.280> california<00:03:18.390> so<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:19.510> just<00:03:19.720> took<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.900> couple

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
from california so it just took a couple

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.630 
from california so it just took a couple
days<00:03:20.410> after<00:03:20.710> that<00:03:20.830> and<00:03:21.010> I<00:03:21.040> live<00:03:21.190> in<00:03:21.220> Michigan

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
days after that and I live in Michigan

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.670 
days after that and I live in Michigan
so<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:22.120> think<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:22.780> was<00:03:22.930> really<00:03:23.230> good<00:03:23.350> it<00:03:23.560> was<00:03:23.590> a

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
so I think that was really good it was a

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.960 
so I think that was really good it was a
lot<00:03:23.890> quicker<00:03:24.160> than<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.370> thought<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:24.670> would<00:03:24.790> be

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
lot quicker than I thought it would be

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.420 
lot quicker than I thought it would be
and<00:03:25.210> so<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.470> coolest<00:03:26.740> thing<00:03:26.860> about<00:03:26.890> this<00:03:27.190> case

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
and so the coolest thing about this case

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.340 
and so the coolest thing about this case
is<00:03:27.610> that<00:03:27.700> everybody's<00:03:28.690> gonna<00:03:28.840> notice<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:29.320> I

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
is that everybody's gonna notice that I

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.010 
is that everybody's gonna notice that I
mean<00:03:29.590> look<00:03:29.800> at<00:03:29.860> that<00:03:30.040> that<00:03:30.610> is<00:03:30.790> some<00:03:31.150> linkage

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
mean look at that that is some linkage

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.690 
mean look at that that is some linkage
and<00:03:32.320> I<00:03:32.650> actually<00:03:32.800> picked<00:03:33.190> this<00:03:33.400> case

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
and I actually picked this case

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.580 
and I actually picked this case
specifically<00:03:34.270> because<00:03:34.840> I<00:03:35.020> liked<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:35.410> it

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
specifically because I liked that it

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.590 
specifically because I liked that it
still<00:03:35.860> had<00:03:35.980> some<00:03:36.160> order<00:03:36.580> and<00:03:36.850> has<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.300> linear

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
still had some order and has the linear

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.750 
still had some order and has the linear
design<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.350> I<00:03:38.710> thought<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.250> pink

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
design and I thought that the pink

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.330 
design and I thought that the pink
flowers<00:03:40.360> were<00:03:40.630> very<00:03:40.870> me<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.980> just<00:03:42.220> thought

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
flowers were very me and I just thought

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.120 
flowers were very me and I just thought
it<00:03:42.610> was<00:03:42.700> very<00:03:42.730> classy<00:03:43.690> yet<00:03:44.170> still<00:03:44.620> very<00:03:44.830> fun

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
it was very classy yet still very fun

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.330 
it was very classy yet still very fun
and<00:03:45.310> useful<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:46.360> I<00:03:46.630> chose<00:03:47.560> this<00:03:47.620> one<00:03:47.920> I'll<00:03:48.130> link

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
where the flowers are cuz they're um

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.890 
where the flowers are cuz they're um
they're<00:04:11.730> like<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.760> cloth<00:04:13.060> material<00:04:13.300> and<00:04:13.840> I

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
they're like a cloth material and I

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.480 
they're like a cloth material and I
actually<00:04:14.050> this<00:04:14.500> is<00:04:14.680> gonna<00:04:14.770> sound<00:04:15.040> kind<00:04:15.400> of

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
actually this is gonna sound kind of

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.620 
actually this is gonna sound kind of
weird<00:04:15.550> and<00:04:15.790> maybe<00:04:15.970> even<00:04:16.090> a<00:04:16.209> little<00:04:16.239> gross<00:04:16.600> but

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
weird and maybe even a little gross but

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.010 
weird and maybe even a little gross but
I<00:04:17.170> think<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.470> stays<00:04:17.739> there<00:04:17.980> it<00:04:18.220> tastes<00:04:18.459> like<00:04:18.580> oh

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
I think it stays there it tastes like oh

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.409 
I think it stays there it tastes like oh
it<00:04:20.020> feels<00:04:20.620> like<00:04:20.979> corn<00:04:21.370> on<00:04:21.460> the<00:04:21.520> cob<00:04:21.790> like<00:04:22.120> after

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
it feels like corn on the cob like after

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.270 
it feels like corn on the cob like after
you<00:04:22.510> bite<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.900> corner

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
you bite the corner

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.040 
you bite the corner
the<00:04:23.340> cob<00:04:23.520> it<00:04:24.000> kind<00:04:24.240> of<00:04:24.300> feels<00:04:24.360> like<00:04:24.780> what<00:04:25.020> it

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
the cob it kind of feels like what it

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.430 
the cob it kind of feels like what it
would<00:04:25.230> feel<00:04:25.260> like<00:04:25.470> after<00:04:25.770> its<00:04:26.310> Eden<00:04:26.700> like<00:04:26.910> that

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
would feel like after its Eden like that

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.480 
would feel like after its Eden like that
texture<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:28.710> I<00:04:28.770> know<00:04:28.830> that's<00:04:29.040> really<00:04:29.220> weird

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
texture and I know that's really weird

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.070 
texture and I know that's really weird
but<00:04:29.760> every<00:04:30.000> time<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.180> feel<00:04:30.420> it<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:30.630> think<00:04:30.690> of<00:04:30.960> that

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
but every time I feel it I think of that

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.650 
but every time I feel it I think of that
and<00:04:31.380> as<00:04:31.830> strange<00:04:32.669> as<00:04:32.850> that<00:04:32.880> is<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.240> really<00:04:33.419> like

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
and as strange as that is I really like

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.470 
and as strange as that is I really like

obvious when things fall off and it
doesn't<00:05:42.479> look<00:05:42.600> good<00:05:42.660> and<00:05:43.050> it<00:05:43.320> just<00:05:43.350> is<00:05:44.310> that
