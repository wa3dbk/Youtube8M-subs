 zarif the aura of mariposa fails on the 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.270
 wall of the second run and that's the 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.770
 collapse on the end of the course

 nice surprise for the French him who 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.420
 was sure he missed his shot 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.189
 just before the passage of pénélope 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.530
 leprévost the course of the test has 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.780
 been somewhat upset alps uran sky 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.490
 the mare steve guerdat perrin do 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.229
 in training but the champion 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.450
 Olympic enters the track after a few 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.539
 minutes of well- determined interruption to 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.310
 stand out in front of his audience as the 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.200
 day before in the big Swiss credit 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.119
 steve price plays bad luck in late 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.009
 four- point course on the whole 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.330
 both runs and very fast it's 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.250
 still the third step of the 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.899
 podium for the Jura with its two 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.940
 mares by kenan that it only goes up 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.679
 for a few months now I think the 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.840
 runway bosses finally a job 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.189
 fantastic today we were without 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.959
 fault it was like very fast to 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.000
 dams so I wanted to try 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.989
 now are going to do it it's 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.369
 things that happened it was the last 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:08.140
 obstacle before entering the track but 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.750
 good it's things that we are 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.860
 accustomed I think if we get to this 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.910
 level there is that one must be 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.150
 able to handle situations 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.400
 like that it's a little hazard, let's say 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.489
 of the sport that one must be able to 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.750
 master if if you want if you want 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.069
 win tests like that and we 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.590
 was not far today it's 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.760
 pity the bar did not hold I 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.830
 nevertheless as I said very happy 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.480
 of this podium even though there were so many 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.370
 serious contenders for victory that 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.550
 two competitors in this 14th final 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.800
 of the top ten rolex jrc it's finally the 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.090
 number one who stands out the one who is 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.640
 at the controls of the world ranking 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.500
 for a year without stopping the 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.819
 british scott brh for her all 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.860
 first participation 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.840
 after your two major victories this 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.440
 season it seems like it was well and truly 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.440
