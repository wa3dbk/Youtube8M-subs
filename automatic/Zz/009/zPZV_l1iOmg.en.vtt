perhaps cross-country skiing but

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.110 
perhaps cross-country skiing but
anything<00:00:13.830> where<00:00:13.980> you're<00:00:14.219> going<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.639> be<00:00:14.759> on<00:00:14.940> the

move

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.359 
move
you<00:00:15.839> need<00:00:16.020> some<00:00:16.230> weather<00:00:16.410> protection<00:00:16.890> but<00:00:17.250> you

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
you need some weather protection but you

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.550 
you need some weather protection but you
also<00:00:17.580> need<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.910> high<00:00:18.180> level<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.869> breathability

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
also need a high level of breathability

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.220 
also need a high level of breathability
so<00:00:19.949> you've<00:00:20.490> got<00:00:20.609> dual<00:00:20.880> fabrication<00:00:21.720> going<00:00:22.050> on

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
so you've got dual fabrication going on

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.710 
so you've got dual fabrication going on
in<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.859> jacket<00:00:23.189> definitely<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.119> high<00:00:24.359> level

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
in this jacket definitely a high level

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.990 
in this jacket definitely a high level
of<00:00:24.900> breathability<00:00:25.439> as<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.250> would<00:00:26.430> want<00:00:26.609> again

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
of breathability as you would want again

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.450 
of breathability as you would want again
for<00:00:27.269> high<00:00:27.449> aerobic<00:00:27.599> activities<00:00:28.130> you've<00:00:29.130> got

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
for high aerobic activities you've got

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.959 
for high aerobic activities you've got
that<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.359> nylon<00:00:30.840> ripstop<00:00:31.349> body<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.460> this

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.389 
that in the nylon ripstop body of this
jacket<00:00:33.590> but<00:00:34.590> sometimes<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.100> need<00:00:35.250> some

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
weather protection too so in those key

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.630 
weather protection too so in those key
areas<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:38.250> shoulders<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.450> hood<00:00:40.640> you

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
areas the shoulders the hood you

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.690 
areas the shoulders the hood you
actually<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.530> 30<00:00:43.530> D<00:00:43.770> Pertex<00:00:44.280> shield

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
actually have a 30 D Pertex shield

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.940 
actually have a 30 D Pertex shield
fabric<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.780> waterproof<00:00:46.559> breathable

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
fabric so I waterproof breathable

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.569 
fabric so I waterproof breathable
protection<00:00:47.600> again<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.750> those<00:00:48.930> key<00:00:49.410> areas<00:00:49.710> most

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
protection again in those key areas most

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.790 
protection again in those key areas most
exposed<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> elements<00:00:51.710> definitely<00:00:52.710> an

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
exposed to the elements definitely an

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.310 
exposed to the elements definitely an
athletic<00:00:53.579> cut<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.270> jacket<00:00:54.629> which<00:00:55.020> again

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
athletic cut to this jacket which again

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.779 
athletic cut to this jacket which again
makes<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.710> lot<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.920> sense<00:00:56.280> when<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.610> think

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
makes a lot of sense when you think

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.119 
makes a lot of sense when you think
about<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.300> being<00:00:57.480> used<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.920> going

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
about what it's being used for not going

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.889 
about what it's being used for not going
to<00:00:59.219> get<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> lot<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.820> other<00:00:59.969> layers<00:01:00.300> beneath

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
to get a lot of other layers beneath

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.910 
to get a lot of other layers beneath
this<00:01:02.030> only<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.480> most<00:01:03.750> low<00:01:04.019> profile<00:01:04.619> base

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
this only the most low profile base

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.580 
this only the most low profile base
layers<00:01:05.129> certainly<00:01:05.790> over<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> t-shirt<00:01:06.500> leaves<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
layers certainly over a t-shirt leaves a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.350 
layers certainly over a t-shirt leaves a
lot<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.740> room<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.040> put<00:01:08.220> layers<00:01:08.400> over<00:01:08.670> top<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:09.210> it

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
lot of room to put layers over top of it

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.469 
lot of room to put layers over top of it
so<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:10.080> an<00:01:10.229> interesting<00:01:10.470> mid<00:01:10.950> layer<00:01:11.479> but

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
so and it's an interesting mid layer but

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.780 
so and it's an interesting mid layer but
again<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.869> think<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.560> more<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.100> really

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
again I think of this more as a really

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.140 
again I think of this more as a really
lightweight<00:01:15.619> outerwear<00:01:16.619> piece<00:01:16.920> does<00:01:17.880> have

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
lightweight outerwear piece does have

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.710 
lightweight outerwear piece does have
elasticity<00:01:19.049> at<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.009> cuffs<00:01:20.390> which<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.540> nice

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
elasticity at the cuffs which is nice

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.870 
elasticity at the cuffs which is nice
keep<00:01:21.990> those<00:01:22.170> sleeves<00:01:22.500> from<00:01:22.770> rolling<00:01:23.189> up<00:01:23.369> also

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
keep those sleeves from rolling up also

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.719 
keep those sleeves from rolling up also
keeps<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.360> where<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.080> want<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.729> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
keeps it where you want it to be a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.190 
keeps it where you want it to be a
single<00:01:27.600> point<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.170> adjustability<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.700> hem

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
single point of adjustability on the hem

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.380 
single point of adjustability on the hem
so<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.259> single<00:01:31.590> pool<00:01:31.740> cinch<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.610> jacket<00:01:32.790> in

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
so a single pool cinch that jacket in

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.359 
so a single pool cinch that jacket in
and<00:01:33.659> get<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.350> much<00:01:34.619> better<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.159> fit

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and get that much better of a fit

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.719 
and get that much better of a fit
because<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.530> definitely<00:01:37.729> some

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
because of it definitely some

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.480 
because of it definitely some
adjustability<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.079> hood<00:01:40.619> as<00:01:40.860> well<00:01:43.490> more

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
adjustability on the hood as well more

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.550 
adjustability on the hood as well more
of<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.670> streamlined<00:01:45.270> fit<00:01:45.659> then<00:01:46.049> you're<00:01:46.259> seeing

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
of a streamlined fit then you're seeing

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.980 
of a streamlined fit then you're seeing
on<00:01:46.829> some<00:01:47.579> Jack<00:01:47.939> as<00:01:48.119> more<00:01:48.329> Alpine<00:01:48.720> style

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
on some Jack as more Alpine style

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.319 
on some Jack as more Alpine style
jackets<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.979> more<00:01:50.640> accepting<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.210> a

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
jackets that are more accepting of a

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.300 
jackets that are more accepting of a
hood<00:01:51.479> because<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> better<00:01:52.860> fit<00:01:53.130> for

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
hood because this is a better fit for

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.350 
hood because this is a better fit for
your<00:01:53.399> actual<00:01:53.729> head<00:01:54.439> in<00:01:55.439> keeping<00:01:56.130> with<00:01:56.159> that
