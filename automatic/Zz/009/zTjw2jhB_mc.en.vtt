system<00:01:13.010> this<00:01:13.460> is<00:01:13.640> a<00:01:13.670> system<00:01:14.030> that<00:01:14.060> can

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
system this is a system that can

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.210 
system this is a system that can
individually<00:01:14.990> brake<00:01:15.200> wheels<00:01:15.500> that<00:01:15.740> slip<00:01:16.009> and

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
individually brake wheels that slip and

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
wheels on a higher grip surface so

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.230 
wheels on a higher grip surface so
what's<00:01:21.680> really<00:01:21.920> great<00:01:22.070> about<00:01:22.130> 4matic<00:01:22.759> is<00:01:23.060> that

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
what's really great about 4matic is that

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.120 
what's really great about 4matic is that
the<00:01:23.630> system<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:24.170> we've<00:01:24.439> developed<00:01:24.650> is

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
the system that we've developed is

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.859 
the system that we've developed is
modular<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:25.880> we're<00:01:26.090> able<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.450> offer<00:01:26.630> it

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
modular and we're able to offer it

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.690 
modular and we're able to offer it
across<00:01:27.170> multiple<00:01:27.619> car<00:01:27.920> lines<00:01:28.130> in<00:01:28.280> fact<00:01:28.549> we

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
across multiple car lines in fact we

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.569 
across multiple car lines in fact we
offer<00:01:28.909> in<00:01:29.270> ten<00:01:29.600> model<00:01:30.020> variants<00:01:30.560> in<00:01:31.009> our

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
offer in ten model variants in our

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:32.590 
offer in ten model variants in our
product

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
product

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.690 
product
so<00:01:32.900> basically<00:01:33.260> any<00:01:33.740> car<00:01:34.130> that's<00:01:34.370> not<00:01:34.670> a

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
so basically any car that's not a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.690 
so basically any car that's not a
convertible<00:01:35.000> we<00:01:35.660> have<00:01:35.810> it<00:01:35.930> as<00:01:36.050> 4matic<00:01:36.410> I<00:01:36.860> think

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
convertible we have it as 4matic I think

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.680 
convertible we have it as 4matic I think
what<00:01:37.820> people<00:01:38.060> think<00:01:38.180> about<00:01:38.300> all-wheel-drive

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
what people think about all-wheel-drive

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.260 
what people think about all-wheel-drive
I<00:01:39.170> think<00:01:39.380> about<00:01:39.530> SUVs<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:40.340> then<00:01:40.520> we<00:01:40.940> start<00:01:41.180> to

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
I think about SUVs and then we start to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.090 
I think about SUVs and then we start to
think<00:01:41.330> about<00:01:41.480> it<00:01:41.660> more<00:01:41.930> in<00:01:41.960> terms<00:01:42.320> of<00:01:42.500> sedans

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
think about it more in terms of sedans

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.200 
think about it more in terms of sedans
but<00:01:43.220> now<00:01:43.370> with<00:01:43.580> a<00:01:43.670> coupe<00:01:43.910> we're<00:01:44.090> actually

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
but now with a coupe we're actually

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.030 
but now with a coupe we're actually
opening<00:01:44.750> up<00:01:44.900> new<00:01:45.320> opportunities<00:01:45.350> for

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
opening up new opportunities for
