00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.189
 sure as users and they will ask us today 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:13.929
 which would be technological advances or benefits that we could 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.029
 order within five or five years of our products 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.600
 the month would not be difficult enough to be complicated to guess 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.840
 the manufacturers many of the amazing things with advances that 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.840
 we could not even wait in these current percent 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.920
 I am carlos ormÃ¡zabal indian and I am going to talk about the new nikon efe 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.839
 4 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.719
 the one that competed is a high-end compact camera talk about endorsement 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.440
 technical means talking about the mafias benefits and especially the maximum 

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:50.759
 optical quality will end with a great future this case we are in front of a 26 

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:52.030
 by stabilized 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.990
 certainly an optic that reaches us from 26 millimeters to 2 676 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:04.540
 as I say notica also stabilized the silver ring around the front of 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.690
 optics tells us that we are talking let's say this one should 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.690
 from a great technology optics to see with a very good sharpness and very 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.800
 good precision 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.280
 just like those of 90 we are already talking about a compact camera 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.510
 cd circle the moveable 3 inch high quality and high 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.130
 resolution 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.500
 and in the case of the camera of the range p of benefits of course apart from 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.760
 automatic modes we have the holiday thanks to the mode dial 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.320
 to manual modes pirate programs the opening riad speed and who by 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.450
 what manual 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.310
 more the media scene 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.990
 and some of the ways of technical approaches such as the approaches of 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.950
 follow up to the subject 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.700
 but if you look at the camera itself 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.289
 we will see very prominent 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.180
 a new engine 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.510
 it's the bus where exclusive of glass 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.620
 with this dedicated button really accessing the video function is very 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.660
 simple we just have to choose kilian same nme 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.740
 access hs good switch integrated into the video itself kun urged to lend 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.440
 they showed as simple as any of the video cameras that we can 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.170
 find markets give names say a needle the same optics from that 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.250
 moment finally finished button of high quality that will allow us 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.570
 record our video figures in full hd so the resolution in any 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.329
 condition practically 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.259
 in this section the video must be made special mention to the different 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:35.639
 recording speed options that would allow us to design 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.790
 from 15 30 hours per second that would be the equivalent of recording in 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:42.839
 fast camera until the 240 seconds photographer so it would be the same 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:45.889
 record in super slow motion 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.039
 in the sound section the camera has an external microphone 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:53.109
 integrated with very interesting options like the suppression of the wind in 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.149
 these audio recordings 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:59.019
 but that level of electronics where they competed presents a solution 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.279
 This new retro-illuminated sensor allows to collect the 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:08.429
 solution feels but the one that after going through descent that this is reflected for 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:12.009
 what the votes and that they gather that part information that in other stations of 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:13.129
 service 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:14.629
 finally like 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.909
 this remarkable formation of the mood growing concern to be seen 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.909
 what are the acronyms as you know leaves dynamics reich 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.959
 Thanks to this function, the camera allows you to reproduce photographs with a 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.959
 Extended dynamic range that theme is achieved will take several 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.309
 signs of weakness 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:35.439
 all this thanks to its 11 mons backlit to the technology 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.129
 exclusive of nikon vila and reds 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.329
 ia the great quality and competing 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.980
 as I said at the beginning of this video or with one out of a camera column 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.030
 high performance in a very compact body lan and compete is really 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:56.049
 everything we can expect including the video in full hd from the camera 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.640
 high performance jumper
