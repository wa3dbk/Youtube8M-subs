00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.060
 and san paro 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:14.780
 and you about baby chub father 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.780
 so guess the ideas of the pair kant 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.340
 good afternoon dear friends to me often 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:26.170
 there are questions about strengthening 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.720
 bones when practicing or breathing question 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.050
 such a plan for some reason is how to be 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.090
 if constantly in a duel i lose i 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.820
 want 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.120
 the brush is knocked out and so well matched 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.280
 that today our pipes dinish morev 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:48.699
 Director of the company force sleeve provided 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:53.800
 us a complete set of their own nothing 7660 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:56.080
 50 millimeters and these shells 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.449
 are the solution to your problem and 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:05.720
 Now I will show you how to demonstrate 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:09.190
 the direction of the world is required while 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.190
 that baby moscow 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.850
 when fighting the first first moment is 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:31.920
 wrestling without being tied here 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:37.350
 brush opening occurs here in this on 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:43.470
 the problem is the vector of effort 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:48.450
 and all evil is at hand and as you see here it is 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.840
 captures for these for pumping 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.810
 of protection 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.820
 from the top of Chapli patients without tying we 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:02.409
 use pens and 76 millimeters 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:05.920
 I do this exercise from the top block 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:10.539
 for the broadest and relieve attentive 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.519
 early horizontal bar and hang here we had 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:22.750
 end so I will explain on the elastic but up 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:25.480
 this dad from understandable I take without 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.220
 thumb but because the grip here 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.660
 so not so 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.580
 and so 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:39.590
 that's why I think with a thumb 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.590
 It can be a lot or otherwise 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:52.880
 bending the finger you do not need to let go 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:56.090
 here do not pump and then from sunset 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.090
 deep water 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.280
 You can alternate the thickness of the ray is 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:16.160
 earrings paw healthy so I'm into the game 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:30.680
 a thick pen can also be used 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:30.680
 60 meters everything is exactly the same 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:44.120
 capture without a thumb here that is 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.120
 that's the way I put it 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.160
 have them 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.950
 how do you see maximum effort when 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:57.590
 the position of the brush patch is almost 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.590
 perpendicular to the bones eternity 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.459
 2 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.959
 they are fundamentally different moment 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.959
 fight or fight ligaments 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.660
 instead of a bunch inside the stash all 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.530
 bundle is 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.930
 a bunch is an emphasis 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:44.150
 carpal joint 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.350
 accordingly the brush controls better 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:51.560
 the one with the flexion of the hand 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.810
 stronger that is from the direct position here 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.320
 this initial insolent then here already 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.620
 the effort doesn't go up like when fighting without 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.500
 ligaments before disclosing but practically clear 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:10.280
 horizontally over here shaft washing here 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:17.810
 here here therefore for these purposes we 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:23.849
 we will bend on the bench 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:29.880
 here is a thick pen not necessarily me 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:33.050
 most comfortable 5 and 6 centimeters 70 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.050
 76 millimeters already 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:53.710
 and come remember somikov 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:58.240
 the amplitude is a bit of a failure of these 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:05.669
 degrees 30 from straight 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:08.370
 here and bend because it allows 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:11.729
 here again capture 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.620
 here more all the same such pickup is not 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:16.260
 take that is it all comes down to 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.980
 country do not put because 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:23.750
 in this case you have no red wine and 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.730
 on large loads it will deliver to you 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.200
 easy discomfort 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:33.020
 that's why control your thumb 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:36.710
 a barrel is enough for a bench and 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.060
 download here almost victim section 1 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.530
 four 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.530
 just below the parallels do 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:55.439
 and it makes no sense 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:59.749
 But in such in such a plate de do from 

00:06:55.439 --> 00:07:03.070
 the best of course horizontal 

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:05.460
 pass a little lower 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.460
 bend 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:11.519
 dear friends there will be questions boldly and 

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:11.519
 ask everyone good luck
