00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.200
 Hello everyone today in my hands here 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.089
 such a very unusual package is 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.680
 mac makeup and which I ordered on 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:22.020

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.869
 recently a man is drawn precisely this 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.279

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.030
 shopping mall network we have shopping 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.649
 centers if something looked after and 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.730
 I decided to see if it would be cheaper 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.110
 I'll order myself on the official 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.559
 in the official online store in 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.289
 America and you know for the price 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.390
 it came out much more profitable to wait two 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.949
 weeks and so they sent me 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.780
 this order came directly from there 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.340
 order 2 weeks approx this order 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.719
 came out four and a half thousand 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.330
 rubles and in our stores the same 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.260
 the product would go out about ours with 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.850
 half 7 thousand rubles so here 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.830

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.520
 order has been issued and waits through 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.810
 the mediator is not from the official 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.610

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.900

 magician from america to russia does not exercise 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.590
 that's why it was delivery through 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.810
 I have ordered an intermediary 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.240
 offering to watch first is just 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.610
 the magic of which 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.420
 video store this pigment pigment 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:08.230

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:13.120
 let's take a closer look at it 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:14.980
 it looks like we think that the products then I 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.390
 open and test on hand already in 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:23.080
 late video review and here also ordered 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:26.980
 tonal brush 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:32.140
 or tonal cream take a closer look 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:36.520
 and such by us 192 by the way everyone praises very much 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:41.380
 on the Internet as well as the makeup artists themselves 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:46.810
 in stores magician she is quite so 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.940
 solid dense here I already have 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.000
 brush mage so i have thats been 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.600
 absolutely happy about it because 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.110
 Something to regret buying this brush and 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:03.730
 look beyond even what we did this 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:10.140
 eye shadow brush 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:14.260
 feather brush number 239 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.630
 so here it looks like that is 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.140
 autumn is here to the touch and scientifically so 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:24.489
 nice soft 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.980
 very so well naped therefore 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:33.150
 I think we think may well apply 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.980
 the shadows and shade also I ordered a 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.230
 mineral concealer 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.310
 mineral concealer I picked at 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:47.760
 store makeup artist 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:52.780
 here he is not really passed that tone in n20 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:57.160
 so here he will be here with him 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:01.470
 special brush for applying and he 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.610
 it is very easy to shade 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.580
 it is shaded itself that is and we also 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.599
 you can hide some small 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:21.150
 imperfections of the skin and the last thing i 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:24.580
 I ordered the vulture shadows I ordered a 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.490
 coal black I have not had this yet 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.970
 we are a collection of shadows so he was not 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.400
 just need now I suggest 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.680
 still try to let it be and 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:41.430
 hand but let's see then that's how all these 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.430
 products will be sloth 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:54.200
 I suggest we start with the red pigment 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.200
 our new brush comes in handy 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.340
 pigment 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.910
 so here he looks on a tassel he 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:17.240
 not loose attacking reminds some 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.240
 small flakes and put on hand 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.970
 so here it looks on the hand i just 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:33.280
 I don't know how good the camera is 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.560
 captures these sparkles are very interesting 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.970
 But I really like him 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:43.750
 looks fine here let 's go now 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:46.860
 then try shadow shadow they absolutely 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.860
 ordinary matte black 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.530
 the shadows shake well and here at first 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.050
 sight 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.930
 maybe too little time and surprised 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.570
 shadows but me in the state plan is loose and especially 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:11.760
 not much dust like that 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:16.130
 hand now let's take parts because 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.130
 then you can try concealer 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.069
 I suggest to try concealer 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:34.240
 cover up on hand 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.680
 spider stars try 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:08.320
 so here it looks natural to me hand 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:12.550
 darker than the person's face is always lighter in 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:14.830
 drown here but covering ability of me 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.980
 arrange because i have a really 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:20.680
 business is not very big circles some 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.300
 dark under the eyes or dates therefore in 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.580
 In principle, I am very happy that 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:29.830
 touches the brush for applying the tone 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:31.600
 I will try it then and lay it out in 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.610
 comments under the video here is my opinion 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.950
 brush data on and no doubt that she 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:40.380
 will be excellent to this heart osip for 

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.380
 attention and a good day so far
