00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:15.089
 it's on the coast 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.169
 a good legacy of bush the simple program 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.839
 and well this is the one we are going to use 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:22.230
 one 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.909
 how to do it 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:25.819
 percent e 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:29.929
 by means of a project I live in the vuos thigh less 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.390
 the new monday the background 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.390
 a new shipper 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.350

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.300
 camera 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.130
 hand 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.230
 in the same line 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.190
 Madrid 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.190
 tohá alta 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.360
 Canada 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.040
 Aragon 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.310
 he's right I do not like to do 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.290
 always name the people 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.290
 and let's see how an unchecked 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.800
 according to the site 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.800
 Suppose they help you 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.960
 a reguetón to see 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.960
 for example 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.210
 now we will see the subject down 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.090
 but I think we're going to do 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.080
 it's not throwing the 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.470
 the spectrum and just or know where the topic starts from 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.290
 the nice night 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.120
 in 2010 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.299
 we owe them 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.899
 we close with what he is 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.899
 the sky I fought I lie to configure now 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:18.409
 just time said 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.409
 in the note a lot 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.409
 the loins like videos or the control of the times 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.199
 we go we knew when 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:30.859
 where to save it 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.369
 well he said 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:34.959
 on Friday 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.179
 on Friday 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:40.149
 Friday on the network 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:43.149
 petroecuador 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.949
 phito here we have last square is ready to start 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:51.549
 Posner to the basics 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.139
 after what we are going to do 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.000
 expose 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.579
 ya obasi 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.879
 for the theme 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.879
 for example it could be 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.569
 tab 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:12.729
 so what does not mean this 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.719
 Let's finish 2010 - the theme where it starts at the base of the original theme 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:21.749
 in the note a lot 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:23.369
 Masters 

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.369
 and we put the base no more 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.829
 some that Ávila we do not have 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:46.859
 maybe he does not 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.579
 background 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.259
 you know him with respect for example saucer all for one hundred like dt 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.119
 if everything that offends it seems good to me that someone 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.679
 they are not going to put 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:03.679
 for example we put out where saltillo 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.389
 and from the floor 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.439
 efe 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.439
 So, there, the society wanted 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.709
 that place 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.709
 to know what is what today is the basics of 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.710
 to do it 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.729
 d 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.809
 you will receive
