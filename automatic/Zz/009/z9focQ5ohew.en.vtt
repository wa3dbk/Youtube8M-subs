in<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.930> decent<00:00:49.289> position<00:00:49.410> but<00:00:50.010> he<00:00:50.730> always<00:00:50.879> says

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
in a decent position but he always says

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.430 
in a decent position but he always says

about<00:01:53.850> playing<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.329> him<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.530> player<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
about playing for him is as a player the

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.719 
about playing for him is as a player the
