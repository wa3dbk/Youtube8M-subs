00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
um what are some of the bigger themes of

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.370 
um what are some of the bigger themes of
this<00:04:14.420> film<00:04:14.750> do<00:04:15.140> you<00:04:15.230> think<00:04:15.580> um

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
this film do you think um

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:25.060 
this film do you think um
I<00:04:18.470> think<00:04:19.459> that<00:04:21.730> bigger<00:04:22.730> themes<00:04:23.000> are<00:04:23.920> there<00:04:24.920> is

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
I think that bigger themes are there is

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.130 
I think that bigger themes are there is
a<00:04:25.100> sort<00:04:25.670> of<00:04:25.700> a<00:04:25.820> classic<00:04:25.970> good<00:04:26.360> versus<00:04:26.720> evil<00:04:26.870> in

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
a sort of a classic good versus evil in

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.950 
a sort of a classic good versus evil in
there<00:04:27.370> but<00:04:28.370> that<00:04:28.550> is<00:04:28.730> really<00:04:29.030> wrapped<00:04:29.540> much

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
there but that is really wrapped much

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.510 
there but that is really wrapped much
more<00:04:30.590> in<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:31.190> idea<00:04:31.580> of<00:04:32.620> allowing<00:04:33.620> yourself

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
more in the idea of allowing yourself

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.460 
more in the idea of allowing yourself
the<00:04:34.790> freedom<00:04:35.000> to<00:04:35.420> be<00:04:36.610> to<00:04:37.610> be<00:04:37.640> who<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.000> are<00:04:38.300> and

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
the freedom to be to be who you are and

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.980 
the freedom to be to be who you are and
and<00:04:39.470> and<00:04:40.160> that<00:04:40.580> that's<00:04:40.850> okay<00:04:41.300> and<00:04:41.630> that<00:04:41.780> that's

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
and and that that's okay and that that's

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.930
