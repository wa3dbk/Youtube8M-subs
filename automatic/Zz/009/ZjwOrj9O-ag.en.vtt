00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.919
 hello everyone I'm the vegan cat and in the 

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:07.350
 today's video we will talk about the 

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:09.360
 dental problems of the guinea pig here 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.250
 Kintaro that will help me explain 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.039
 they removed it good 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.619
 and the guinea pigs like the rodents that are 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.730
 they have to wear their teeth because 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.300
 unlike for example we if 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.119
 our teeth are smoothed that tooth 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.699
 does not recover again while the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.589
 rodents the tooth keeps growing and 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:39.210
 growing and growing that's why they need 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:43.050
 wear and tear with food 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.159
 with the totopos taking hay or vegetables 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.559
 of stem of thick stem is worth having 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:53.009
 that force the then is when the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.320
 wear out and then what can you 

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:57.809
 problems can have outside is the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.089
 about dental growth that usually 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.939
 due to a poor diet that 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:05.460
 maybe the animal does not have hay all 

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:06.960
 the day because he enjoys being very very 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.909
 little bit 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.720
 for that though as all food 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.450
 too soft then do not get no 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.909
 get worn out and another problem that 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.990
 there may be is the bad dental occlusion 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.009
 this means that 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.390
 jaw does not close properly 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.630
 then clear to create many 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.280
 problems to eat many times 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.970
 is linked one thing with another 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.340
 It must be said that he may have malocclusion 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.780
 and that grows produce him on the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:44.320
 growth or the wrong way back what 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.649
 there may be what you are observing is 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.619
 his teeth are good but there are times 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.409
 it is appreciable until it is not more serious 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.329
 the problem then 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.479
 we can appreciate it for the first 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.060
 symptoms that would be that the animal leaves 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.610
 to eat stop eating first 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.420
 things of thick stem and hay that are 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.920
 what is most difficult for them and gradually 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.260
 I would stop eating absolutely everything 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.069
 until they do not even drink water 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.069
 until they die 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:21.010
 we can make an observation ourselves 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:24.389
 a routine control in every little bit 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.040
 time to control that everything goes well 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:30.440
 we can open your mouth with a lot 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.840
 Care from the corners of the mouth 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.510
 we opened his mouth 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.290
 and we saw the teeth we see the look that 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.379
 has the color that does not have any 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.510
 infection no wound or anything and then 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:49.370
 with him with the skin with his mouth open 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.720
 we close our teeth 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.740
 here let's observe 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.760
 as in box to exceed is the incisors of 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.430
 down 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.730
 how do they fit up because in 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.860
 chances are too much is too much 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.330
 big then you start to nail 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.910
 in the jaw on the top 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.700
 that starts to produce wound infection 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.680
 German stops eating etc. Etcetera 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.170
 there have been cases of animals especially 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.500
 rabbits that is problem 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.230
 much more serious in rabbits than 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.590
 teeth come through the part of 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.940
 up and the people not the owners do not 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.530
 nothing 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.780
 this can go with clear well by 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.780
 illustration with an otoscope the vet 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.580
 can go looking for everything to go right 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.550
 us understandable to look at the 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.819
 teeth that have to be smooth and 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.620
 worn out if any peak appears is 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.340
 because that is not having wear 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.640
 right sometimes if it's mild it's 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.640
 say if the guinea pig has a slight 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.190
 a small problem as the vet 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.900
 proceed to cheer him or the incisors are 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.870
 the molars according to where you have the problem 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.380
 and recommend an appropriate diet 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.780
 for the guinea pig to have more 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.750
 wear and with which you may have in the 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.910
 present as for example that you have 24 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.060
 hours a day access to a quantity 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.100
 plentiful of tea not that makes it be forced 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.239
 or to remove a little more food 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.620
 soft at least until I get 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:28.199
 file and have a mouth 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.380
 It's usually a problem to weaken me 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:34.199
 what if the mother or father have had 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.400
 malocclusion or on growth 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:41.310
 dental the children will have it too 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.010
 then it is a genetic factor but 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.050
 it is also a factor of feeding 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.210
 what we see them is that we have a 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.560
 quite important role in terms of 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:55.370
 dental health of the guinea pig in other cases 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.830
 that will be more serious maybe genetic 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.169
 with rabbits and bossy be careful 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.380
 with food, what we do 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.380
 is 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.070
 lengthen a bit is to lengthen and 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.890
 that these symptoms of the 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:14.610
 illness but sometimes they end up 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:17.040
 leaving before or after and the solution to 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.330
 times it's just to operate then they would have 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.789
 what 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.370
 and marley the molars according to that 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:27.080
 decide the veterinarian or even get to 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.569
 remove a tooth 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.310
 if you do not remove it say if an animal 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:34.830
 have the problem of the denture 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.840
 and you need an operation and it's not done 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.590
 the animal is going to stop eating and goes to 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.100
 die in a few days that's going we're going very 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.290
 Quick 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.990
 in case of the molars that is very 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.810
 complicated because the incisors are 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.190
 much more visible but the molars to 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.870
 unless it is with the help of a 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.300
 veterinarian or an otoscope that 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.540
 have we can not look like the 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.470
 have we can only detect by the 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.730
 symptoms as I say that they eat well 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.220
 but the problem is that many times 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.730
 teeth are curved well inwards 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.400
 then they trap the tongue and prevent them 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.950
 the swallowing so the animal equal 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.760
 dies from starvation is a pretty subject 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.760
 important 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:24.730
 the tooth problem because it's very very 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:29.080
 very typical that a guinea pig or a 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:30.730
 rabbit that you do not know why it is and 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.550
 really has been because of this because they have not 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.730
 taken care of your denture is a 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:39.130
 of the biggest causes of mortality 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:42.640
 inexplicable that exist then 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:46.560
 simply so that it does not happen meals 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.810
 that they force a little bit of 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.720
 that they are lime veterinary controls 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:55.380
 every bit of time because hey it costs 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.880
 much less and to review it is fine or 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.660
 but they have to be filed 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.220
 little bit and avoid that we are going to do good 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.889
 what comes from an infection what 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.430
 you have to get to remove a piece 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:10.860
 dental much better to avoid it is worth and is 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.690
 a little thing that good is not known to the 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.820
 people who are informed about you know 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.370
 icog yesterday yes you know him there are people who 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.680
 directly you have no idea and do not 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:23.220
 controls in the mouth of the animal so 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.229
 that end up dying there are times that 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.410
 they are not even aware that a 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:30.389
 incisor or crash it against the lip 

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:33.570
 thus causing the animal not to eat 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:35.409
 well and all that and nothing simply 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.499
 any doubt 

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:40.449
 came exotic veterinarians 

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:41.800
 specialized that will recommend you what 

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:44.480
 What is it 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.820
 and nothing was expected in the next video it 

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.410
 He liked to hit like and if you want 

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.890
 stay up to date on the videos that I'm going 

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:53.080
 going up 

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.080
 you can subscribe until later
