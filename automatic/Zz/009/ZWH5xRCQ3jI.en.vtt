00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.259
 added a whole bar counter because 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.239

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.539

 of course the place behind the bar was not enough 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:43.959
 so now we have three bars for two 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.730

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.780
