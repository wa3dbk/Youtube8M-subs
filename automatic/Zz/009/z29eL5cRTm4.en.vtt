I'm writing a parser here and here and

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.650 
I'm writing a parser here and here and
here<00:00:58.239> and<00:00:59.129> at<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.340> back<00:01:00.489> I'm<00:01:00.970> just<00:01:01.239> giving<00:01:01.570> you

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
here and at the back I'm just giving you

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.740 
here and at the back I'm just giving you
details<00:01:02.590> about<00:01:03.400> what<00:01:03.850> this<00:01:04.030> is<00:01:04.210> inclusive

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
details about what this is inclusive

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.340 
details about what this is inclusive
with<00:01:04.960> so<00:01:05.440> let's<00:01:06.340> talk<00:01:06.640> about<00:01:06.700> more<00:01:07.570> when<00:01:08.320> I

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
with so let's talk about more when I

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.420 
with so let's talk about more when I
open<00:01:08.770> this<00:01:08.890> box

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
open this box

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.780 
open this box
so<00:01:10.060> here<00:01:10.330> we<00:01:10.450> go<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:11.500> most<00:01:11.800> expensive<00:01:12.310> module

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
so here we go the most expensive module

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.030 
so here we go the most expensive module
set<00:01:13.030> in<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.570> sh<00:01:13.960> figures<00:01:14.350> line<00:01:14.619> and<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:15.009> only

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
set in the sh figures line and the only

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.120 
set in the sh figures line and the only
that<00:01:15.580> plane<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:15.970> stamp<00:01:16.240> exclusive<00:01:17.020> is<00:01:17.290> module

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
that plane the stamp exclusive is module

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.490 
that plane the stamp exclusive is module
set<00:01:18.369> 5<00:01:18.610> as<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.270> biggest<00:01:19.630> set<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.050> hopefully

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
set 5 as the biggest set and hopefully

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.070 
set 5 as the biggest set and hopefully
the<00:01:20.619> last<00:01:20.830> has<00:01:21.310> xx<00:01:21.850> both<00:01:22.119> on<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.630> off<00:01:22.750> switches

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
the last has xx both on and off switches

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.650 
the last has xx both on and off switches
to<00:01:23.590> match<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:24.100> modules<00:01:24.460> included<00:01:24.940> I<00:01:25.090> will<00:01:25.479> not

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
to match the modules included I will not

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.719 
to match the modules included I will not
dwell<00:01:25.810> much<00:01:26.170> on<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.590> switches<00:01:26.890> because<00:01:27.490> it

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
dwell much on the switches because it

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.210 
dwell much on the switches because it
functions<00:01:28.030> just<00:01:28.660> like<00:01:28.780> any<00:01:29.170> other<00:01:29.350> so<00:01:30.009> let's

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
functions just like any other so let's

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.520 
functions just like any other so let's
count<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.670> modules<00:01:31.030> one<00:01:31.210> by<00:01:31.390> one<00:01:31.660> first<00:01:32.259> is

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
count the modules one by one first is

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.920 
count the modules one by one first is
the<00:01:32.770> scope<00:01:33.009> or<00:01:33.220> chauvel<00:01:33.759> module<00:01:34.360> a<00:01:34.479> green

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
the scope or chauvel module a green

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.870 
the scope or chauvel module a green
plastic<00:01:35.200> mode<00:01:35.560> which<00:01:35.890> is<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.130> plain<00:01:36.430> shovel

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
placed on forces right arm there are no

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.280 
placed on forces right arm there are no
additional<00:01:39.760> gimmicks<00:01:40.360> there<00:01:40.690> so<00:01:40.869> I'll<00:01:41.080> move

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
additional gimmicks there so I'll move

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.130 
additional gimmicks there so I'll move
over<00:01:41.650> to<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:41.920> next<00:01:42.100> one<00:01:42.369> and<00:01:42.670> module<00:01:43.150> similar

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
over to the next one and module similar

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.620 
over to the next one and module similar
to<00:01:44.320> magic<00:01:44.680> end<00:01:44.920> but<00:01:45.369> this<00:01:45.549> time<00:01:45.820> it<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.390> a

position if you are itching to do so the
base<00:02:24.160> will<00:02:24.430> work<00:02:24.730> with<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.390> stamp<00:02:25.810> pad<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.320> get

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
base will work with a stamp pad and get

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.410 
base will work with a stamp pad and get

for example base States is quite

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.490 
for example base States is quite
Universal<00:03:56.410> in<00:03:56.560> nature<00:03:56.890> so<00:03:57.280> he<00:03:58.030> can<00:03:58.300> use<00:03:58.870> any<00:03:59.260> of

the helicopter thingy and fire states is

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.810 
the helicopter thingy and fire states is
using<00:04:15.460> the<00:04:16.080> big<00:04:17.080> foot<00:04:17.350> module<00:04:17.770> like<00:04:17.920> like<00:04:18.370> here

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
using the big foot module like like here

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.599 
using the big foot module like like here
and<00:04:19.000> one<00:04:19.660> thing<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:20.080> note<00:04:20.230> is<00:04:20.500> this<00:04:21.040> foot<00:04:21.430> is

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
and one thing to note is this foot is

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.870 
and one thing to note is this foot is
really<00:04:21.850> huge<00:04:22.390> so<00:04:22.870> you<00:04:22.900> have<00:04:23.350> to<00:04:23.620> balance<00:04:24.040> your

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
really huge so you have to balance your

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.780 
really huge so you have to balance your
finger<00:04:25.420> just<00:04:26.020> like<00:04:26.260> so<00:04:26.500> by<00:04:26.950> bending<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.430> knees

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
finger just like so by bending the knees

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.770 
finger just like so by bending the knees
to<00:04:28.090> level<00:04:28.660> itself<00:04:29.380> on<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:30.280> floor<00:04:30.640> so<00:04:31.300> that's

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
to level itself on the floor so that's

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.960 
to level itself on the floor so that's
all<00:04:32.050> you<00:04:32.200> need<00:04:32.350> to<00:04:32.470> know<00:04:32.590> about<00:04:32.740> these<00:04:33.310> modules

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
all you need to know about these modules

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.780 
all you need to know about these modules
and<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:34.390> hope<00:04:34.690> you<00:04:35.380> like<00:04:35.620> this<00:04:35.920> set<00:04:36.250> as<00:04:36.430> much<00:04:36.640> as

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
this now you have five choices of the

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.760 
this now you have five choices of the

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
module sets you really want to have

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.700 
module sets you really want to have
either<00:04:45.430> you<00:04:45.820> pick<00:04:46.000> one<00:04:46.240> of<00:04:46.390> the<00:04:46.510> four<00:04:46.780> or<00:04:47.020> go

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
either you pick one of the four or go

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.970

for<00:04:48.010> the<00:04:48.130> biggest<00:04:48.520> set<00:04:48.750> besides<00:04:49.750> three<00:04:50.530> module

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
for the biggest set besides three module

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.010 
for the biggest set besides three module
sets<00:04:51.250> are<00:04:51.460> equivalent<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:52.180> this<00:04:52.330> package<00:04:52.780> and

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
sets are equivalent to this package and

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.980 
sets are equivalent to this package and
I<00:04:53.440> believe<00:04:53.800> it<00:04:54.010> is<00:04:54.070> a<00:04:54.430> decent<00:04:54.820> price<00:04:55.000> taking

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
I believe it is a decent price taking

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.930 
I believe it is a decent price taking
to<00:04:56.080> account<00:04:56.410> the<00:04:56.590> number<00:04:56.740> of<00:04:56.920> modules<00:04:57.430> of<00:04:57.670> this
