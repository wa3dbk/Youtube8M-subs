00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.540
 this is my church feser cobra 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.589
 with the standard tires and the rear the 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.570
 standard errors 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.139
 At the front are the standard springs for me 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.299
 already gone 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:19.800
 that's why we are different than 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.599
 the back and much stronger so 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.060
 Here I have to press and here he goes 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.890
 directly on the ground 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:32.520
 I also shortened the antenna 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:43.980
 usually longer so and now comes 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:49.070
 that owner is here in front 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:53.989
 battery that I had to buy after 72 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:57.690
 gold and sixth 4600 media more 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.820
 and if you have the car at Amazon 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.460
 ordered is unfortunately no battery and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.440
 charger available 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:11.490
 Unfortunately, the engine is only installed here 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:16.320
 35 km h but that's enough for beginners 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.930
 the front of the receiver and if you are 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.180
 because here in front 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.840
 The antenna must be inserted into the field 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:32.190
 Not at all, and I thought so too 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:34.310
 kinda stupid then here 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.500
 the remote control 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.150
 there you can set an autopilot if 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.940
 which now automatically moves forward and 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.290
 running backward then here is the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.240
 steering to the inside 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.010
 Here's again the strength of 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.990
 steering to adjust 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.220
 Here is the speed to ask 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.690
 and here is speed from 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.300
 drive backwards to set and 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:16.829
 steer and gas is clear 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:26.010
 and then here in the institution now 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:28.459
 the steering a bit too bad that me 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.560
 had let him go 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.560
 in front of the individual small crankshafts 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.420
 jumped out 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.040
 that's why I'm from four to two 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.719
 So millions have gone up 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.459
 but I do not think so now 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.260
 bad 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.840
 That was my church officer coo 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.969
 been 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.969
 or is it then 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:07.220
 Now we come to the battery of these ideas 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:14.450
 I bought from a buddy for 10 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:16.430
 euro with the tires and I had stop 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.540
 from the beginning on no battery and that of 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.410
 my buddy is the so I had 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.410
 then stop directly 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:30.230
 the connection is a standard amaya 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:32.480
 connection because here is the charger 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.230
 I had to buy something else quickly 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.780
 charger also mittermeier connection there 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.380
 are then also show on whether 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.770
 that is full or still loading is like that 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:52.330
 Full is then down here and at the store 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.330
 is here around my church st
