you

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.129 

galing<00:00:13.670> around<00:00:14.670> where<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.090> pocket<00:00:15.900> clip

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
galing around where the pocket clip

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.650 
galing around where the pocket clip
meets<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.950> scales<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.700> knife<00:00:18.000> that's<00:00:18.420> too

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
meets the scales of the knife that's too

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.420 
meets the scales of the knife that's too
aggressive<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.350> there<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.860> I<00:00:19.920> think<00:00:20.220> what

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
aggressive in there and I think what

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.880 
aggressive in there and I think what
Kershaw<00:00:20.850> could<00:00:21.300> have<00:00:21.420> done<00:00:22.050> there<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.710> they

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
Kershaw could have done there is they

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.310 
Kershaw could have done there is they
could<00:00:22.950> have<00:00:23.220> put<00:00:23.520> maybe<00:00:24.510> even<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:25.020> a

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
could have put maybe even just a

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.929 
could have put maybe even just a
half-inch<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:27.020> stripe<00:00:28.020> of<00:00:28.320> non<00:00:29.220> scaled

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
half-inch a stripe of non scaled

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.900 
half-inch a stripe of non scaled
material<00:00:30.779> directly<00:00:31.590> under<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.160> pocket<00:00:32.669> clip

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
material directly under the pocket clip

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.569 
material directly under the pocket clip
because<00:00:33.150> what<00:00:33.480> happens<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.310> they<00:00:35.310> could<00:00:35.489> have

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
because what happens and they could have

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.069 
because what happens and they could have
done<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.850> same<00:00:35.880> thing<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> reverse<00:00:36.810> side

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
done the same thing on the reverse side

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.350 
done the same thing on the reverse side
in<00:00:37.290> case<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.590> reverse<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.950> pocket<00:00:38.460> clip<00:00:38.640> what

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
in case you reverse the pocket clip what

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.479 
in case you reverse the pocket clip what
happens<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.930> when<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.200> carry<00:00:40.560> this<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.100> carried

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
happens is when you carry this I carried

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.760 
happens is when you carry this I carried
this<00:00:41.670> for<00:00:42.230> about<00:00:43.230> three<00:00:43.950> months<00:00:45.260> in<00:00:46.260> some

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
this for about three months in some

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.870 
this for about three months in some
tactical<00:00:47.370> shorts<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.650> tactical<00:00:49.730> pants<00:00:50.730> that

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
tactical shorts and tactical pants that

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.930 
tactical shorts and tactical pants that
I<00:00:50.910> use<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.720> what<00:00:52.590> happened<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.280> totally

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
I use and what happened is it totally

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.230 
I use and what happened is it totally
destroyed<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.650> pocket<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.190> scaling<00:00:57.120> is

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
destroyed the the pocket the scaling is

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.630 
destroyed the the pocket the scaling is
so<00:00:57.450> aggressive<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:58.680> almost<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.220> sandpaper

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
so aggressive it's almost like sandpaper

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.630 
so aggressive it's almost like sandpaper
so<00:01:00.120> every<00:01:00.390> time<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.630> would<00:01:00.930> clip<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.070> my

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
so every time I would clip it on my

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.999 
so every time I would clip it on my
pocket<00:01:03.180> they're<00:01:03.570> using<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.619> heavy-duty

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
pocket they're using that heavy-duty

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.640 
pocket they're using that heavy-duty
pocket<00:01:06.000> clip<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.720> aggressive<00:01:06.990> scaling

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
pocket clip and the aggressive scaling

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.590 
pocket clip and the aggressive scaling
it<00:01:07.860> was<00:01:07.979> basically<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.909> was<00:01:09.030> sanding

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
it was basically like it was sanding

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.859 
it was basically like it was sanding
sanding<00:01:10.500> my<00:01:10.950> pants<00:01:11.939> or<00:01:12.090> my<00:01:12.210> shorts<00:01:12.630> they're

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
sanding my pants or my shorts they're

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.190 
sanding my pants or my shorts they're
definitely<00:01:13.860> put<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> hole<00:01:14.939> pretty<00:01:15.450> quickly<00:01:15.750> in

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
definitely put a hole pretty quickly in

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.800 
definitely put a hole pretty quickly in
each<00:01:16.500> one<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.799> those<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:17.909> don't<00:01:18.539> like<00:01:18.749> that

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
each one of those so I don't like that

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.639 
each one of those so I don't like that
although<00:01:19.499> it<00:01:20.219> serves<00:01:20.969> its<00:01:21.240> purpose<00:01:21.530> you<00:01:22.530> know

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
although it serves its purpose you know

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.469 
although it serves its purpose you know
when<00:01:22.890> you're<00:01:23.009> holding<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.549> knife<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
when you're holding the knife the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.230 
when you're holding the knife the
scaling<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.140> great<00:01:25.469> but<00:01:26.219> not<00:01:26.399> to<00:01:26.609> clip<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.060> on

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
scaling is great but not to clip it on

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.230 
scaling is great but not to clip it on
your<00:01:27.450> pocket<00:01:28.700> second<00:01:29.700> thing<00:01:29.759> i<00:01:29.880> don't<00:01:29.939> like

that the blade protrusion there see how
it<00:02:15.630> almost<00:02:16.590> looks<00:02:16.890> like<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.250> pistol<00:02:17.910> grip

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
notice that this is this is more of a

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.470 
notice that this is this is more of a
problem<00:02:40.489> there<00:02:41.489> is<00:02:41.520> that<00:02:41.849> that<00:02:42.209> blade

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
problem there is that that blade

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.240 
problem there is that that blade
protrusion<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.290> always<00:02:43.680> going<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.920> hit<00:02:44.099> your

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.670 
protrusion is always going to hit your
finger<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.849> you<00:02:45.540> know<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:46.080> not<00:02:46.290> like<00:02:46.470> it

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
finger and you know it's not like it

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.210 
finger and you know it's not like it
hurts<00:02:46.920> or<00:02:47.130> anything<00:02:48.410> but<00:02:49.410> it's<00:02:49.590> just<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:49.890> mild

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
hurts or anything but it's just a mild

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.430 
hurts or anything but it's just a mild
annoyance<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.209> think<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:51.840> Kershaw

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
annoyance that I think that Kershaw

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.740 
annoyance that I think that Kershaw
could<00:02:52.860> have<00:02:52.950> done<00:02:53.099> a<00:02:53.130> better<00:02:53.220> job<00:02:53.630> when<00:02:54.630> they

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
could have done a better job when they

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.660 
could have done a better job when they
design<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.380> blade<00:02:55.620> protrusion<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.370> keep<00:02:56.519> it

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
design that blade protrusion to keep it

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.559 
design that blade protrusion to keep it
from<00:02:56.819> doing<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:59.760> last<00:03:00.000> thing<00:03:00.269> that<00:03:00.330> I

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
from doing that the last thing that I

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.979 
from doing that the last thing that I
don't<00:03:00.989> like<00:03:01.230> about<00:03:01.590> this<00:03:02.580> knife<00:03:02.850> is<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.569> blade

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
put cuts right into the paper mmm now if

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.259 
put cuts right into the paper mmm now if
we<00:04:09.780> take<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:11.340> would<00:04:11.489> definitely<00:04:11.700> cut

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
we take and that would definitely cut

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.789 
we take and that would definitely cut
you<00:04:12.480> you<00:04:12.600> know<00:04:12.750> there's<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.049> portion<00:04:13.500> of<00:04:13.590> your

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
you you know there's a portion of your

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.279 
you you know there's a portion of your
the<00:04:14.670> meat<00:04:14.910> on<00:04:15.060> your<00:04:15.209> finger<00:04:15.600> that<00:04:15.780> can<00:04:15.959> get<00:04:16.139> in

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
the meat on your finger that can get in

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.520 
the meat on your finger that can get in
there<00:04:16.880> I'm<00:04:17.880> assuming<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:18.900> could<00:04:19.079> push<00:04:19.320> this

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
there I'm assuming I could push this

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.550 
there I'm assuming I could push this
hard<00:04:19.829> enough<00:04:20.100> on<00:04:20.280> my<00:04:20.489> arm<00:04:20.900> that<00:04:21.900> some<00:04:22.229> of<00:04:22.350> my

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
hard enough on my arm that some of my

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.920 
hard enough on my arm that some of my
flesh<00:04:23.430> could<00:04:23.789> get<00:04:23.940> up<00:04:24.060> in<00:04:24.210> there<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.660> I<00:04:24.720> could

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
flesh could get up in there and I could

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.010 
flesh could get up in there and I could
cut<00:04:25.139> myself<00:04:25.320> it<00:04:26.280> again<00:04:27.150> it's<00:04:27.419> a<00:04:27.539> small

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
cut myself it again it's a small

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.620 
cut myself it again it's a small
annoyance<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:29.460> doesn't<00:04:29.940> detract<00:04:30.210> from<00:04:30.450> the

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
annoyance it doesn't detract from the

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.490 
annoyance it doesn't detract from the
total<00:04:31.050> quality<00:04:31.669> and<00:04:32.669> beauty<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:33.419> utility<00:04:34.020> of

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
total quality and beauty and utility of

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.290 
total quality and beauty and utility of
this<00:04:34.590> knife<00:04:34.979> but<00:04:35.400> it's<00:04:35.520> definitely<00:04:35.729> an

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
this knife but it's definitely an

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.659 
this knife but it's definitely an
annoyance<00:04:36.780> there<00:04:37.110> if<00:04:37.590> you<00:04:38.250> look<00:04:38.370> at<00:04:38.550> the

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
annoyance there if you look at the

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.010 
annoyance there if you look at the
kershaw<00:04:39.120> blur<00:04:39.150> they<00:04:39.810> did

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
kershaw blur they did

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.080 
kershaw blur they did
much<00:04:40.289> better<00:04:40.560> job<00:04:40.889> and<00:04:41.220> I<00:04:41.280> could<00:04:41.490> push<00:04:41.759> as<00:04:42.060> hard

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
much better job and I could push as hard

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.170 
much better job and I could push as hard
as<00:04:42.449> I<00:04:42.569> want<00:04:42.810> to<00:04:43.160> with<00:04:44.160> my<00:04:44.340> finger<00:04:44.819> and<00:04:45.030> I'm

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
as I want to with my finger and I'm

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.150 
as I want to with my finger and I'm
never<00:04:45.509> going<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.810> feel<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.259> blade<00:04:46.590> tip<00:04:46.949> in

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
never going to feel that blade tip in

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.790 
never going to feel that blade tip in
fact<00:04:47.430> I've<00:04:47.879> got<00:04:48.569> a<00:04:48.599> good<00:04:48.810> millimeter<00:04:49.440> or<00:04:49.770> two

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
fact I've got a good millimeter or two

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.369 
fact I've got a good millimeter or two
of<00:04:50.370> space<00:04:50.819> between<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.569> tip<00:04:51.720> of<00:04:51.750> my<00:04:51.990> finger

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
of space between the tip of my finger

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:55.700 
of space between the tip of my finger
and<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:53.099> blade<00:04:53.340> tip<00:04:54.229> that's<00:04:55.229> never<00:04:55.470> going<00:04:55.650> to

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
and the blade tip that's never going to

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.119
