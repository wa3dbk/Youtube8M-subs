the rocker arm shaft this bolt was
supposed<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.279> lock<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.790> shaft<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.570> instead

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
supposed to lock the shaft but instead

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.299 
supposed to lock the shaft but instead
it<00:00:34.140> allows<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.280> rock<00:00:35.820> back<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.300> forth<00:00:36.840> as

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
it allows it to rock back and forth as

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.380

true you're also getting a tick from in

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.919 
true you're also getting a tick from in
play<00:00:59.500> but<00:01:00.500> this<00:01:00.739> is<00:01:00.949> not<00:01:01.190> as<00:01:01.460> bad<00:01:01.730> as<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:02.570> shaft

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
play but this is not as bad as the shaft

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.749 
play but this is not as bad as the shaft
tick<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:05.869> rocker<00:01:06.170> Locker<00:01:06.799> bushings<00:01:07.490> go

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
tick the rocker Locker bushings go

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.800 
tick the rocker Locker bushings go
between<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.420> bolt<00:01:08.689> and<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.320> shaft<00:01:10.630> they<00:01:11.630> are

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
between the bolt and the shaft they are

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.749

tapered one end is larger than the other

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.700 
tapered one end is larger than the other
so<00:01:16.759> it'll<00:01:17.119> only<00:01:17.240> go<00:01:17.479> in<00:01:17.659> one<00:01:17.690> way

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
so it'll only go in one way

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.020 
so it'll only go in one way

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
so that it does not rotate anymore it's

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.059 
so that it does not rotate anymore it's
as<00:02:29.180> tight<00:02:29.480> as<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:29.810> can<00:02:29.840> be<00:02:32.620> another<00:02:33.620> advantage

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
as tight as it can be another advantage

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.110 
as tight as it can be another advantage
of<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.610> rocker<00:02:34.849> lockers<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:36.379> it<00:02:36.530> always

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
of the rocker lockers is that it always

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.910 
of the rocker lockers is that it always
positions<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.390> rocker<00:02:38.690> arm<00:02:39.140> support<00:02:39.680> plate
