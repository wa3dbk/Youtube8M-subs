00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.700
 hello and welcome to the game 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.559
 ursula went to play third place 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.059
 or rather leo against the maximus 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.930
 Thorald lifestyle with bacteria 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.580
 played with games 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.730
 the whole thing is here with the new one 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.820
 patch 1.9 the many changes with 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:32.009
 for example, it brings the increase 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.840
 the cost for elite troops and often 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.430
 reduce the cost of cheap 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.340
 We are troops for weak troops 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.870
 here on the card next to pack 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.440
 I have not submitted any special 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.960
 in the final play just let the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.610
 handle players now alone 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.870
 they have both mounted four times 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.070
 archers I do not have so me 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.289
 maybe I should be introduced 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:01.230
 we are all neo has four times the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:06.150
 locations otherwise i still believe 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.060
 six times not quite three times her beijing 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.979
 offer three times 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.360
 and some more cavalry and the 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.450
 elephants as general motors has here 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.270
 the eastern katar asked two 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.570
 Japanese archers and then couple 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.640
 tables sword fighters and that 's it 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.939
 not only so badisch sword fighter 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.939
 almost only 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:41.369
 I think I have a rule ra damn 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:43.229
 So quickly see it now no 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.189
 big rupture therefore puck only times 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.180
 how it continues here now only now 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.399
 here is a shot change between 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.850
 burning apartment protect everything 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.649
 Now try this with them here 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.500
 bad leo has first rush 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:06.390
 apology made a rush 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.069
 but then somehow slowed down 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.880
 so see the katar facts there are 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.090
 no harm done by the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:17.489
 archer over there but actually 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:20.130
 pretty heavy losses at leo 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.140
 not big losses yet 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.549
 here with the elephants here 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.810
 are somehow the brits in 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.350
 archers in close quarters and me 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.350
 I do not know 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.019
 lighting here i notice here 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.190
 over there it runs then somehow so 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:43.069
 parallel from fatal binary 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.290
 I think that along with his 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.670
 sword fighting has something difficult 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.019
 on the other hand get hold the plans 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.590
 especially frontal, however, has leoni 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.610
 the seniors have very long lines 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.890
 I honestly said with the patch 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.049
 I have not played yet 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.180
 not if he is still there at the mechanics 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:06.980
 what has changed in any case is holding leo 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.440
 grad with three units here the whole 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:16.280
 melee army of gallos over there 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.260
 he with the elephants the kata facto almost 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.590
 wiped out a unit is still to 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.120
 half there and with the brits in Bolzano 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.579
 he has the upper hand here too 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.329
 won 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.329
 so look at this here 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.499
 the sword fighters are actually coming 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.499
 barely ran 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.750
 although that is really very long lines 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.750
 I do not know if the crisis is stronger 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.710
 however , it had been made here 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.710
 in any case disadvantages 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.430
 this will be difficult for him 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.030
 that would have come over his flank 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.370
 have to 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.960
 but here are the troops councils and 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.490
 he may be trying here now 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.100
 to shoot the pioneers a bit 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.970
 that would take way too long from here 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.400
 mounted horses are coming over there now 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.600
 Archers over the elephants 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.380
 Also there will probably be in the 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:17.750
 pushed back or certainly 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.750
 here's trying to talk through this 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.830
 Actually, I actually managed 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.020
 it may be too late then 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.020
 Here comes the cavalry of Leo 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.350
 the mind has become so too 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.380
 rather not shoot what I 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:42.490
 why he is waiting here now he can 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.600
 but still I could manage you 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.000
 do not feel like copying 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.000
 however, that is very unlikely 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:56.070
 so leos elephants are now too 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.070
 broken through 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.040
 Graf drove with swords who are now 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.570
 Definitely away let's see if the elephants 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.080
 run amok now they are closed 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:14.090
 they run amok but still 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:14.090
 Do a lot of damage so see 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:23.000
 Okay, something from the side of the 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.990
 growth gate as but must now 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.010
 still get through 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.780
 I really do not think anyone anymore 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:34.730
 badly chosen especially went the 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.860
 Partie would also have a little different 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.490
 have to act as too long from 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.490
 leave 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:49.300
 elephant now has no means to 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:53.290
 from now on general still reasonably 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.290
 The royal Qatar factor 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:01.520
 Diana is one of the few on the 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:06.199
 battlefield as it looks 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.199
 I do not believe in ammunition any more 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.920
 the other still a bit but 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:19.440
 As I said frontal shop creates chaos there 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:23.460
 nothing and I do not see any now 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.920
 chance more because he is losing too much 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.000
 suffered 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.600
 the last tour will be now too 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.600
 reamed 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.919
 Yes 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:50.509
 Far are quite sovereign victories of 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:52.360
 leo leo he also sees the statistic 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:57.470
 It sure looks like this 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:59.300
 they have about the same troops on 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.919
 field called told the little one 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.550
 break of guy that was not now 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:06.710
 so bad i have been from the beginning 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.570
 that he was design with 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.590
 I will have problems 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.910
 suppose that the panic 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:16.190
 SchwertkÃ¤mpfer still relatively expensive 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:18.680
 The pioneers are probably 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.699
 not cheap either but you have to 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.229
 in each case a lot of sword fights 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:23.710
 would have stopped then no head-on 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:25.970
 may run against 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.680
 and his katar had asked something 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.110
 playful so he was at the beginning too 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.669
 offensive but it is still nothing 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.039
 So lost that was now the first 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:35.150
 first battle now comes the second he 

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:36.520
 So still has a chance too 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.780
 win 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.130
 and yes I hope you have the battle 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.509
 We liked'll see you at the same 

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.440
 the second battle until then bye 

00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:44.440
