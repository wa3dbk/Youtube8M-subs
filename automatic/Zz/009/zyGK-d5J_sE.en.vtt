00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.620
 program of bands this program serves 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.990
 to make a sure deletion of the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.029
 hard drives if you could sell your machine 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.460
 or are you going to sell your hard drive at the same 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.109
 dark that you have now and then 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.210
 to do this procedure so that 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.410
 nobody can see or recover what 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.289
 was once there stored and 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.989
 well let's start with this mini 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.149

 lotion 2,217 here that would be for 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.350
 record it in a genius but then in this 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.659
 Once we are going to make it viable in a 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.440
 usb later so you do not have to be 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.630
 burning and good now while low 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.090

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.100
 with the usb which is called universal 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:33.090

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.599
 the folder is going to open immediately 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.739
 of download where you're going to agree the 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:15.090
 good program although now that I already 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:18.990
 we have ready from bank and we have the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.510
 universal usb mental program 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.860
 we go to the folder where it was downloaded 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:30.180
 this last one install and we execute it 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.430
 we click on the week and see what it says 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.340
 step 1 you have to select the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.090
 gray distro of linux with which you go to 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.690
 start from your usb then then we go 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.270
 to select the option of this bar that 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.480
 is in this list we are going to 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:52.260
 come down here and tell us 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.800
 other distros alphabetically we're going to 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:01.170
 select de ban 2.2 point x in 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:04.530
 we have the a 22.7 then this one 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.800
 serves us and then we will look here 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.480
 on the tested button the iso that 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:15.330
 download from the bank's page 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.540
 The next step is to select the usb 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.700
 in this case I have it as gm and so 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.940
 we select it normally in the 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.880
 memory and I have formatted 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.630
 but in case you do not have the 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.630
 information on your usb are going to have to 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.830
 make your backup because it is necessary 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.830
 that is formatted 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.310
 and if not is because the 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.580
 program you download it automatically 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.980
 that you can save and well then we're going 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.110
 to click on create send us here a 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.110
 message of the actions that goes to 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.690
 take the program so we click on it 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.020
 itself and will start to create our 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.310
 our boat talk about the banks 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.590

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.040
 moment when I wait for him to copy the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.470
 faction users for our usb and 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.020
