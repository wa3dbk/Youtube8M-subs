00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
like this video and here is the tutorial

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.900 
like this video and here is the tutorial
to<00:00:43.739> start<00:00:43.980> off<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.190> look<00:00:44.370> I'm<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.850> be

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
to start off this look I'm going to be

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.900 
to start off this look I'm going to be
applying<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.539> yellow<00:00:45.930> colors<00:00:46.410> first<00:00:46.910> just

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
applying the yellow colors first just

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.580 
applying the yellow colors first just
because<00:00:47.940> whenever<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.660> work<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.020> with<00:00:49.230> yellow

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
because whenever you work in with yellow

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.439 
because whenever you work in with yellow
and<00:00:50.010> purple<00:00:50.309> they<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> tendency<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.329> get

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
and purple they have a tendency to get

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.660 
and purple they have a tendency to get
really<00:00:51.719> muddy<00:00:51.989> really<00:00:52.320> quickly<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
really muddy really quickly so I like to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.790 
really muddy really quickly so I like to
just<00:00:54.030> kind<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.449> lightly<00:00:55.170> blend<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.770> two

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
just kind of lightly blend the two

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.099 
just kind of lightly blend the two
together<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.850> find<00:00:57.210> if<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.480> put<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> yellow

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
together so I find if I put the yellow

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.290 
together so I find if I put the yellow
down<00:00:58.350> first<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.550> blend<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> other<00:01:00.030> colors

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
down first I can blend the other colors

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.439 
down first I can blend the other colors
into<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.489> as<00:01:02.489> opposed<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.910> trying<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.239> put

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
into it and as opposed to trying to put

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.230 
into it and as opposed to trying to put
a<00:01:03.719> lighter<00:01:04.229> color<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.769> top<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> darker<00:01:05.489> that

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
a lighter color on top of a darker that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.940 
a lighter color on top of a darker that
makes<00:01:06.420> any<00:01:06.540> sense<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:07.049> hope<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.530> does<00:01:07.650> I'm<00:01:07.799> just

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
applying it just sort of rate to the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.910 
applying it just sort of rate to the
center<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.759> my<00:01:42.210> lid<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:43.530> kind<00:01:43.799> of

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
center of my lid and then just kind of

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.120 
center of my lid and then just kind of
lightly<00:01:44.250> dusting<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.829> around<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.960> stuff<00:01:49.200> I'm

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
lightly dusting it around and stuff I'm

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.039 
lightly dusting it around and stuff I'm
so<00:01:50.520> I'm<00:01:50.700> picking<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.390> little<00:01:51.600> bit<00:01:51.720> more<00:01:51.930> of

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
so I'm picking up a little bit more of

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.139 
so I'm picking up a little bit more of
that<00:01:52.200> color<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.950> I'm<00:01:53.399> also<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.729> going<00:01:54.090> to

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
that color and I'm also just going to

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.149 
that color and I'm also just going to
blend<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.570> lightly<00:01:55.850> um<00:01:57.409> so<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.439> passed<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
blend it lightly um so I passed the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.670 
blend it lightly um so I passed the
crease<00:01:59.460> if<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.880> makes<00:02:00.030> any<00:02:00.090> sense<00:02:00.680> because

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
crease if that makes any sense because

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.380 
crease if that makes any sense because
you<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:01.920> see<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.880> I've<00:02:03.000> sort<00:02:03.329> of

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
you can see on this I that I've sort of

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.929 
you can see on this I that I've sort of
blended<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.990> all<00:02:04.140> together<00:02:04.399> so<00:02:05.399> I'm<00:02:05.700> just

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
blended this all together so I'm just

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.109 
blended this all together so I'm just
putting<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.420> little<00:02:06.540> bit<00:02:06.840> past<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:08.090> crease

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
putting it a little bit past the crease

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.960 
putting it a little bit past the crease
and<00:02:10.390> then<00:02:11.319> also<00:02:11.500> just<00:02:11.709> taking<00:02:12.370> sort<00:02:12.819> of<00:02:12.879> the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
and then also just taking sort of the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.070 
and then also just taking sort of the
corner<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.629> brush<00:02:14.519> and<00:02:16.739> applying<00:02:17.739> it

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
corner of that brush and applying it

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.750 
corner of that brush and applying it
right<00:02:20.080> in<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.440> center<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.430> little<00:02:21.580> bit

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
right in the center this is a little bit

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.240 
right in the center this is a little bit
of<00:02:21.849> a<00:02:21.909> backwards<00:02:22.450> way<00:02:22.629> of<00:02:22.659> doing<00:02:23.379> my<00:02:24.040> makeup

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
of a backwards way of doing my makeup

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.059 
of a backwards way of doing my makeup
but<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.640> thought<00:02:24.909> it<00:02:25.030> might<00:02:25.060> be<00:02:25.269> fun<00:02:25.299> and<00:02:26.069> I

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
but I thought it might be fun and I

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.350 
but I thought it might be fun and I
really<00:02:27.099> like<00:02:27.579> the<00:02:27.730> way<00:02:27.819> that<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.060> turned<00:02:28.239> out

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
really like the way that it turned out

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.479 
really like the way that it turned out
so<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.959> know<00:02:29.079> try<00:02:29.470> new<00:02:29.620> things<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:30.069> then<00:02:30.310> for

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
so you know try new things and then for

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.750

the more purple side or it has a

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.850 
the more purple side or it has a
tendency<00:05:37.550> to<00:05:37.880> so<00:05:38.690> just<00:05:38.960> keep<00:05:39.050> that<00:05:39.110> in<00:05:39.230> mind<00:05:39.410> so

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
tendency to so just keep that in mind so

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.430 
tendency to so just keep that in mind so
far<00:05:40.070> base<00:05:40.370> on<00:05:40.670> my<00:05:40.850> lips<00:05:41.120> I've<00:05:41.390> applied<00:05:41.690> max
