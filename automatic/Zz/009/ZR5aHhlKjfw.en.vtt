more<00:01:15.210> like<00:01:15.780> skateboarding<00:01:16.380> sir<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:16.830> he's

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
more like skateboarding sir but he's

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.820 
more like skateboarding sir but he's
like<00:01:17.159> condensed<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.500> we<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.680> watch<00:01:19.770> each

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
like condensed and we can watch each

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.680 
like condensed and we can watch each
other<00:01:20.190> ride<00:01:20.400> because<00:01:20.790> snowboarding<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.450> can

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
other ride because snowboarding you can

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.840 
other ride because snowboarding you can
go<00:01:22.440> a<00:01:22.470> little<00:01:22.590> faster<00:01:23.070> than<00:01:23.190> skating<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.760> you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
go a little faster than skating so you

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.000 
go a little faster than skating so you
can't<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.210> have<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.360> same<00:01:24.720> session<00:01:25.290> so

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
can't really have the same session so

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.430 
can't really have the same session so

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
being in a a mini pipe is great you get

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.630 
being in a a mini pipe is great you get
