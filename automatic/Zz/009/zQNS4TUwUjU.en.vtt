let's just be real right sometimes the
targeting<00:03:30.570> system<00:03:30.750> doesn't<00:03:31.350> quite<00:03:31.680> work<00:03:31.920> the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
targeting system doesn't quite work the

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.980 
targeting system doesn't quite work the
way<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.220> want<00:03:32.520> it<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.640> now<00:03:33.420> I'm<00:03:33.570> not<00:03:33.750> dead<00:03:33.960> I'm

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
way you want it to now I'm not dead I'm

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.810 
way you want it to now I'm not dead I'm
not<00:03:34.110> you<00:03:34.590> know<00:03:34.680> downgrading<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.430> at<00:03:35.520> all<00:03:35.640> cuz

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
not you know downgrading it at all cuz

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.310 
not you know downgrading it at all cuz
there's<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.000> lot<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.210> stuff<00:03:36.330> going<00:03:36.600> on<00:03:36.690> but<00:03:36.900> just

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
there's a lot of stuff going on but just

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.500 
there's a lot of stuff going on but just
be<00:03:37.470> careful<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.160> listen<00:03:38.550> for<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.850> audio<00:03:39.210> cue

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
be careful to listen for the audio cue

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.210 
be careful to listen for the audio cue
because<00:03:39.630> you'll<00:03:39.960> actually<00:03:40.140> hear<00:03:40.560> yourself

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
because you'll actually hear yourself

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.730 
because you'll actually hear yourself
tell<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.910> dogs<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.480> attack<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:43.440> just

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
tell the dogs to attack that and just

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.110 
tell the dogs to attack that and just
make<00:03:43.830> sure<00:03:43.980> that<00:03:44.160> when<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.520> hear<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.880> that

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
make sure that when you hear that that

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.450 
make sure that when you hear that that
the<00:03:45.300> red<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:46.440> red<00:03:46.470> box<00:03:46.890> is<00:03:47.100> around<00:03:47.340> a

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
the red the red box is around a

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.160 
the red the red box is around a
helicopter<00:03:47.970> right<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.540> that's<00:03:48.720> another<00:03:48.990> good

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
helicopter right and that's another good

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
helicopter right and that's another good
thing<00:03:49.230> I'm<00:03:49.500> glad<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:49.830> brought<00:03:49.950> that<00:03:50.040> up

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
thing I'm glad you brought that up

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.530 
thing I'm glad you brought that up
because<00:03:52.220> targeting<00:03:53.220> like<00:03:53.610> a<00:03:53.640> gun<00:03:53.970> it's<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:54.420> lot

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
because targeting like a gun it's a lot

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.330 
because targeting like a gun it's a lot
different<00:03:54.900> than<00:03:54.930> targeting<00:03:55.410> your<00:03:55.500> pack<00:03:55.770> right

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
different than targeting your pack right

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.120 
different than targeting your pack right
you<00:03:56.700> have<00:03:56.820> to<00:03:57.110> target<00:03:58.110> something<00:03:58.710> and<00:03:58.860> then

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
you have to target something and then

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.840 
you have to target something and then
press<00:03:59.610> the<00:04:00.270> right<00:04:00.570> thumbstick<00:04:01.440> in<00:04:01.920> right<00:04:02.460> and

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
press the right thumbstick in right and

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.520 
press the right thumbstick in right and
notice<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.570> notice<00:04:03.750> right<00:04:04.020> here<00:04:04.080> that<00:04:04.320> we<00:04:04.410> got

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
notice and notice right here that we got

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.500 
notice and notice right here that we got
the<00:04:04.650> red<00:04:04.800> out<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.490> outline<00:04:05.880> around<00:04:06.090> each

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
the red out of the outline around each

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.870 
the red out of the outline around each
chopper<00:04:07.080> and<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:08.280> lets<00:04:08.460> you<00:04:08.580> know<00:04:08.610> what

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880
