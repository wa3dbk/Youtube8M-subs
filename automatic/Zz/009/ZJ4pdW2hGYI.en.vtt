00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:11.690
 Mixed LPG vehicles are enjoying increasing popularity 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.539
 many drivers are still unsure how a felt 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.660
 Under pressure there are gas tanks in case of serious accidents or vehicle fires 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.000
 In relation to this, the ADAC undertook various tests for the safety of 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.259
 To investigate LPG systems 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.889
 Since April 2006, only tested systems may be retrofitted 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.530
 first a rear impact with 60 km / h and one for such collision accidents 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.530
 typical coverage of 70 percent 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.460
 Where else the spare wheel has its place, the gas tank is bolted 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.540
 The yellow stripes should later possibly occurring deformations 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.990
 demonstrate 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.140
 no explosion 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.590
 provoked the guest had emptied and filled the gas tank with water 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.820
 south-regional ligist 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.650
 Not 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.490
 H 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.290
 a camera had Laura's behavior 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.270
 the whole sustainable 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.580
 the subsequent check shows that the holder he can himself and 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.580
 all line connections remained intact 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.020
 Although the tank is minimally damaged, but the welds are intact 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.290
 Now follows a test of the gas system for leaks 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.719
 Frank after the crash filled with gas 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.669
 Amber trees around with a gauge checked for gas leakage and then 

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:41.300
 determined that the entire gas system is still tight 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.460
 the tank is damaged new entry 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.590
 However, he has therefore draw much energy from building a preliminary 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.210
 that means he himself is the rear of the vehicle 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.160
 I'm silent to find 4 11 in great formation 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
 This vehicle he has next to the guest then also a gas tank 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.250
 there is water in the fuel tank that has not leaked out meaning that 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.250
 Fuel tank is just as dense and want to guest again 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.850
 a safety valve in operation ensured that the gas can flow again 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.120
 when the engine is running 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.210
 but even after starting the engine 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.210
 There were no leaks here 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:22.089
 But what happens if the vehicle in an accident on fire device 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.589
 that too should be clarified in another test 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:30.289
 This and multi valves ensures safe pressure conditions in the tank 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:37.189
 Metal flags with gasoline under the cars demolish leaked fuel like 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.639
 it is often the case in practice 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.639
 it will be serious vehicle fire 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.299
 an infrared camera shows the heat 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.329
 Here's just the first row 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.839
 when Carinthia reached a certain extent 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:03:00.269
 here is the safety valve gradually from the gas then controlled 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.579
 angered 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.819
 how to mark the dilapidated areas the greatest heat 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:08.349
 that from 1 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.890
 because the guest from the tank no explosion is therefore probably not sure 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.889
 prevented 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.299
 the safety valve shot addressed 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.979
 the gas escaped in a controlled manner 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.369
 it can not cause explosions 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.659
 Therefore, it can be assumed that this vehicle put into operation sure that 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.519
 In comparison, by quantifying his band their vehicle would be the 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.529
 usually plastic tanks melt through the heat 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:34.119
 the gasoline runs out 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:36.949
 spreads out on the street and burns up there too 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:40.669
 I have shown that the experiments of gas vehicles 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:44.999
 Comparable are according to the security authorities again
