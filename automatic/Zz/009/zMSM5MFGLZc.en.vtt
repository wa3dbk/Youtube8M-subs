kind of high-end which is kind of nice

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.410 
kind of high-end which is kind of nice
as<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.299> can<00:01:39.420> tell<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.840> pretty<00:01:40.619> thin<00:01:41.420> it's

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
as you can tell it's pretty thin it's

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.330

got a 2 megapixel camera on the back

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.840 
got a 2 megapixel camera on the back
with<00:01:44.939> no<00:01:45.180> flash<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.869> that's<00:01:46.049> kind<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.380> downer

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
with no flash so that's kind of a downer

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.280 
with no flash so that's kind of a downer
considering<00:01:47.850> all<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.149> other<00:01:48.420> Android

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
considering all the other Android

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.960 
considering all the other Android
devices<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.799> typically<00:01:50.460> come<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:50.729> at

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
devices that typically come with at

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.030 
devices that typically come with at
least<00:01:51.149> five<00:01:51.360> megapixels<00:01:52.049> or<00:01:52.290> sometimes<00:01:52.920> even

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
least five megapixels or sometimes even

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.880 
least five megapixels or sometimes even
eight<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:54.390> that's<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.020> thing<00:01:55.200> that's<00:01:55.380> not<00:01:55.680> so

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
eight so that's one thing that's not so

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.620 
eight so that's one thing that's not so
great<00:01:56.040> about<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.490> also<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.210> screen<00:01:57.509> is

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
great about this also the screen is

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.620 
great about this also the screen is
pretty<00:01:57.840> small<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.350> only<00:01:58.530> 3.2<00:01:59.070> inches<00:01:59.630> so

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
pretty small it's only 3.2 inches so

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.270 
pretty small it's only 3.2 inches so
that's<00:02:00.810> that's<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.649> know<00:02:01.740> something<00:02:02.100> that

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
that's that's you know something that

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.569 
that's that's you know something that
may<00:02:02.820> not<00:02:03.060> be<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.719> great<00:02:03.990> for<00:02:04.740> folks<00:02:04.979> coming
