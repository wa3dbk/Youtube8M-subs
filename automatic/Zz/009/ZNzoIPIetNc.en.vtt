00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.070
 hello my name is vanesa gonzález 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:06.830
 student of the technical university of 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.630
 machala studying the leveling course 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.250
 well I'm going to talk about the chains 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.250
 food in food chains 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.690
 we have three the terrestrial the aquatic and 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.240
 the aerial 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.460
 which are food chains or also 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.070
 called trophic chains this 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.050
 points out dietary relationships between 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.980
 the consumer producers and 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.590
 decomposers 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.990
 in other words the chain reflects 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.090
 Who eats who this means 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.210
 that a living being feeds on that 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.250
 proceeds and at the same time is eaten by the one who 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.050
 follow 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.620
 let's go with the example of the chain 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.480
 terrestrial food 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.420
 in the street of Earth bound boundary 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.250
 as an example the mount to the cricket to the rag 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.840
 to the snake 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.510
 and the eagle 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.910
 the bush is eaten by the cricket the 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.560
 video is eaten by the tsar with the seasoning 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.760
 eaten by the snake 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.130
 and the snake is eaten by the eagle 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.320
 let's go with the example of the chain 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.810
 aquatic food we have as 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.090
 example the letter the crayfish the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.109
 carp the gambús 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.880
 the blow with bacteria organic remains 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:21.359
 algae and molluscs cited 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.359
 plants 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.060
 and the algae the organic remains and the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.060
 phytoplankton 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.120
 the bacteria are eaten by 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.300
 molluscs 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.850
 the algae the algae are eaten by the 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.710
 crayfish and carp the 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.760
 organic remains are eaten by the 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.820
 bacteria 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.580
 and the bacteria and the other flanks are 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.920
 meals by the so I plant and that planted me 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.990
 He has been eaten by the Gambús and Gambús 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.170
 Crab's letter are eaten by the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.200
 cake 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.930
 this is an example of the chain 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.550
 aquatic food 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.340
 now let's talk about the chain 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.550
 airline food have to alpiste the 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:14.870
 sparrow the kestrel the owl and the hawk 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:17.510
 the birdseed is eaten by him 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.760
 by the sparrow the sparrow is eaten by 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.790
 the kestrel the kestrel is eaten by 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.250
 the owl and the owl for the hawk this is 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.090
 what we can talk about the 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.230
 food chains 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.230
 thank you very much
