00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.400 

so<00:00:01.680> I<00:00:01.709> reset<00:00:02.580> up<00:00:02.760> my<00:00:02.970> hydroponic<00:00:03.750> garden<00:00:04.170> it

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
so I reset up my hydroponic garden it

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.920 
so I reset up my hydroponic garden it
was<00:00:04.710> sitting<00:00:05.130> by<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.759> side<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.210> my<00:00:06.330> house<00:00:06.569> for

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
was sitting by the side of my house for

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.799 
was sitting by the side of my house for
a<00:00:06.990> few<00:00:07.200> months<00:00:07.730> and<00:00:08.730> I've<00:00:09.420> made<00:00:09.630> some

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
a few months and I've made some

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.450 
a few months and I've made some
improvements<00:00:10.440> over<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.889> years<00:00:11.070> since<00:00:11.280> I

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
improvements over the years since I

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.459 
improvements over the years since I
posted<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:12.179> initial<00:00:12.599> video<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.320> lot<00:00:13.410> of

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
posted the initial video and a lot of

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.959 
posted the initial video and a lot of
people<00:00:13.799> have<00:00:13.889> liked<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.250> video<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:14.940> I

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
people have liked that video so I

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.519 
people have liked that video so I
thought<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.269> would<00:00:15.509> share<00:00:15.750> some<00:00:15.809> tips<00:00:16.230> with

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
thought I would share some tips with

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.390 
thought I would share some tips with
what's<00:00:17.490> worked<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.060> what<00:00:18.150> hasn't<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:19.220> if<00:00:20.220> you

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
what's worked and what hasn't and if you

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.920 
what's worked and what hasn't and if you
had<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.760> build<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.090> again<00:00:21.390> how<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.720> would

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
had to build it again how you would

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.130 
had to build it again how you would
build<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.289> differently<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.660> one<00:00:24.660> thing<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:24.900> I

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
build it differently so one thing that I

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.960 
build it differently so one thing that I
realized<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.680> really<00:00:26.010> important<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
realized is really important is the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.839 
realized is really important is the
amount<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.359> air<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.650> my<00:00:28.949> initial<00:00:29.099> design<00:00:29.580> just

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
amount of air so my initial design just

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.530 
amount of air so my initial design just
had<00:00:30.029> one<00:00:30.240> air<00:00:30.480> pump<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.470> one<00:00:31.650> has<00:00:31.859> three

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
had one air pump and this one has three

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.310 
had one air pump and this one has three
each<00:00:33.540> pump<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.350> fed<00:00:34.770> into<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:36.239> PVC<00:00:36.450> pipe<00:00:36.989> and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
each pump is fed into the PVC pipe and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.770 
each pump is fed into the PVC pipe and
actually<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.340> splitter<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:38.969> there's<00:00:39.480> two

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
actually have a splitter so there's two

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.709 
actually have a splitter so there's two
air<00:00:40.170> hoses<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.820> spreads<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.540> air

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
air hoses so that spreads the air

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.110 
air hoses so that spreads the air
through<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> big<00:00:43.590> air<00:00:43.800> stone<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.550> all<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
through a big air stone to all the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.930 
through a big air stone to all the
plants<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.649> past<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.190> saw<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.610> certain

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
plants in the past I saw that certain

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.670 
plants in the past I saw that certain
plants<00:00:48.360> were<00:00:48.450> growing<00:00:48.719> really<00:00:48.899> well<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.440> one

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
plants were growing really well in one

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.799 
plants were growing really well in one
area<00:00:49.950> not<00:00:50.190> another<00:00:50.610> area<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.360> was<00:00:51.420> because

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
area not another area and it was because

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.760 
area not another area and it was because
of<00:00:51.840> lack<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.710> air<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:54.930> other<00:00:55.050> thing<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.350> has

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
of lack of air the other thing that has

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.130 
of lack of air the other thing that has
become<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.910> important<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.719> learned

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
become really important that I learned

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.930 
become really important that I learned
quickly<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.969> plants<00:01:00.719> need<00:01:00.930> support<00:01:01.940> and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
quickly is that plants need support and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.119 
quickly is that plants need support and
when<00:01:03.899> they<00:01:04.019> get<00:01:04.170> really<00:01:04.470> big<00:01:04.680> they<00:01:04.890> tend<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
when they get really big they tend to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.950 
when they get really big they tend to
topple<00:01:05.519> over<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.180> isn't<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.540> big<00:01:06.720> deal

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
topple over and this isn't a big deal

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.289 
topple over and this isn't a big deal
for<00:01:07.439> things<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.860> lettuce<00:01:08.490> or<00:01:08.909> things<00:01:09.180> like

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
for things like lettuce or things like

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.770 
for things like lettuce or things like
basil<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.310> back<00:01:11.520> row<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.240> some

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
basil but in the back row I have some

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.600 
basil but in the back row I have some
peas<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.140> some<00:01:13.740> tomatoes<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.189> these<00:01:14.490> are

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
peas and some tomatoes and these are

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.760 
peas and some tomatoes and these are
going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> get<00:01:14.939> huge<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:16.530> whole

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
going to get huge and so this whole

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.810 
going to get huge and so this whole
support<00:01:17.159> system<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> back<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:19.610> built<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
support system in the back I built to

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.620 
support system in the back I built to
just<00:01:21.210> clip<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.549> easy<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.970> remove<00:01:24.299> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
just clip on so it's easy to remove and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.440 
just clip on so it's easy to remove and
store<00:01:26.030> but<00:01:27.500> it's<00:01:28.500> really<00:01:28.890> important<00:01:29.450> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
store but it's really important the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.850 
store but it's really important the
other<00:01:30.540> thing<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.960> just<00:01:30.990> kind<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.530> plant

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
other thing is just kind of plant

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.789 
other thing is just kind of plant
management<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.600> yard<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.200> Sun<00:01:34.439> comes

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
management so in my yard the Sun comes

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.170 
management so in my yard the Sun comes
in<00:01:35.299> this<00:01:36.299> direction<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:37.640> that<00:01:38.640> means<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.150> I

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
in this direction and that means that I

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.730 
in this direction and that means that I
want<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.479> put<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> big<00:01:39.869> things<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.470> back

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
want to put the big things in the back

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.800 
want to put the big things in the back
so<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> tomatoes<00:01:41.909> are<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> back<00:01:42.479> row<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
so the tomatoes are on the back row and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.469 
so the tomatoes are on the back row and
they're<00:01:43.020> gonna<00:01:43.170> climb<00:01:43.439> up<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.950> trellis

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
they're gonna climb up on that trellis

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.789 
they're gonna climb up on that trellis
where<00:01:45.479> as<00:01:45.659> short<00:01:45.960> things<00:01:46.200> are<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> front

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
where as short things are in the front

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.410 
where as short things are in the front
row

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
row

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.330 
row
lettuce<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.140> basil<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.740> medium-sized

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
lettuce and basil and medium-sized

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.260 
lettuce and basil and medium-sized
plants<00:01:50.030> like<00:01:50.900> peppers<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:51.830> green<00:01:52.670> beans<00:01:52.939> are

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
plants like peppers and green beans are

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.480 
plants like peppers and green beans are
in<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.479> middle<00:01:53.689> row<00:01:53.920> when<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.009> final<00:01:55.310> thing

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
in the middle row when the final thing

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.910 
in the middle row when the final thing
is<00:01:55.520> just<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.570> share<00:01:56.780> what<00:01:57.049> grows<00:01:57.320> well<00:01:57.649> and

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
is just to share what grows well and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.330 
is just to share what grows well and
what<00:01:58.070> doesn't<00:01:58.399> grow<00:01:58.850> well<00:01:59.979> everything<00:02:00.979> that

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
what doesn't grow well everything that

what doesn't grow well everything that
I've<00:02:01.939> planted<00:02:02.299> here<00:02:02.600> is<00:02:02.720> kind<00:02:02.990> of

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
I've planted here is kind of

tried-and-true a lot of variety of
tomatoes<00:02:06.140> grow<00:02:06.470> great<00:02:06.799> in<00:02:06.950> here

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
tomatoes grow great in here

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.160 
tomatoes grow great in here
peas<00:02:08.030> grow<00:02:08.360> great<00:02:08.860> peppers<00:02:09.860> grow<00:02:10.160> great<00:02:11.170> beans

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
dill and green onions also grew well

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.490 
dill and green onions also grew well
things<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:19.970> haven't<00:02:20.209> had<00:02:20.569> luck<00:02:20.959> with<00:02:20.989> have

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
things that I haven't had luck with have

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.460 
things that I haven't had luck with have
been<00:02:21.709> cucumbers<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:22.880> eggplants<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:23.989> maybe

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
been cucumbers and eggplants so maybe

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.300 
been cucumbers and eggplants so maybe
someone<00:02:24.950> has<00:02:25.130> tips<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:25.819> how<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.000> grow<00:02:26.299> them

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
someone has tips on how to grow them

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.120 
someone has tips on how to grow them
that<00:02:28.310> would<00:02:28.430> be<00:02:28.459> awesome<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.510> hear<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.920> final

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
that would be awesome to hear the final

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.840 
that would be awesome to hear the final
tips<00:02:31.519> are<00:02:32.739> one<00:02:33.739> problem<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:34.280> I<00:02:34.310> ran<00:02:34.370> into<00:02:34.819> a

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
tips are one problem that I ran into a

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.940 
tips are one problem that I ran into a
lot<00:02:35.150> was<00:02:35.450> that<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.720> end<00:02:35.870> caps<00:02:36.200> we're<00:02:36.470> leaking

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
lot was that the end caps we're leaking

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.710 
lot was that the end caps we're leaking
and<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:38.030> think<00:02:38.209> it<00:02:38.269> had<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.450> do<00:02:38.540> with<00:02:38.569> the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
and I think it had to do with the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.900 
and I think it had to do with the
sealant<00:02:39.140> used<00:02:39.440> so<00:02:39.920> here<00:02:40.340> I've<00:02:40.459> used<00:02:40.700> a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
sealant used so here I've used a

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.090 
sealant used so here I've used a
silicone<00:02:41.390> sealant<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.049> that<00:02:42.590> seems<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.069> work

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
silicone sealant and that seems to work

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.670 
silicone sealant and that seems to work
really<00:02:43.340> well<00:02:43.459> I<00:02:43.910> also<00:02:44.840> switched<00:02:45.260> over<00:02:45.500> to

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
really well I also switched over to

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.710 
really well I also switched over to
these<00:02:45.799> other<00:02:46.069> kind<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:46.670> output<00:02:47.120> valve<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:47.630> that

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
these other kind of output valve so that

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.180 
these other kind of output valve so that
seemed<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.080> be<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.200> bit<00:02:48.350> tighter<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.769> get<00:02:49.160> a

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
seemed to be a bit tighter to get a

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.380 
seemed to be a bit tighter to get a
cleaner<00:02:49.790> seal<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.370> also<00:02:52.519> just<00:02:52.790> put<00:02:53.120> a

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
cleaner seal and I also just put a

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.460 
cleaner seal and I also just put a
little<00:02:54.260> lock<00:02:54.560> on<00:02:54.890> here<00:02:55.570> really<00:02:56.570> simple<00:02:57.170> but

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
little lock on here really simple but

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.009 
little lock on here really simple but
another<00:02:58.370> problem<00:02:58.609> I<00:02:58.880> ran<00:02:59.030> into<00:02:59.090> is<00:02:59.600> there'd<00:02:59.930> be

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
another problem I ran into is there'd be

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.650 
another problem I ran into is there'd be
so<00:03:00.170> much<00:03:00.290> pressure<00:03:00.680> on<00:03:01.040> this<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.480> would

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
so much pressure on this that I would

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.449 
so much pressure on this that I would
pop<00:03:02.870> open<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.440> light<00:03:03.650> would<00:03:03.799> be<00:03:03.920> getting<00:03:04.130> into

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
pop open and light would be getting into

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.509 
pop open and light would be getting into
there<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.660> can<00:03:05.780> get<00:03:05.840> algae<00:03:06.290> growth<00:03:06.560> and

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
there and you can get algae growth and

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.810 
there and you can get algae growth and
one<00:03:08.269> other<00:03:08.450> tip<00:03:08.780> is<00:03:08.989> at<00:03:09.829> first<00:03:10.190> I<00:03:10.370> was<00:03:10.489> using

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
one other tip is at first I was using

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.750 
one other tip is at first I was using
really<00:03:11.000> expensive<00:03:12.310> hydroponic<00:03:13.310> fertilizer

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
really expensive hydroponic fertilizer

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.120 
really expensive hydroponic fertilizer
and<00:03:14.320> it<00:03:15.320> doesn't<00:03:15.560> really<00:03:15.650> seem<00:03:15.829> to<00:03:15.890> make<00:03:16.070> a

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
and it doesn't really seem to make a

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.920 
and it doesn't really seem to make a
difference<00:03:16.220> so<00:03:16.850> now<00:03:17.060> I<00:03:17.090> use<00:03:17.239> just<00:03:17.720> this

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
difference so now I use just this

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.479 
difference so now I use just this
powdered<00:03:18.440> fertilizer<00:03:20.620> super<00:03:21.620> cheap<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.220> it

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
powdered fertilizer super cheap and it

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.030 
powdered fertilizer super cheap and it
has<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.790> advantage<00:03:23.180> of<00:03:23.299> being<00:03:23.680> really<00:03:24.680> clean

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
has the advantage of being really clean

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.340 
has the advantage of being really clean
so<00:03:25.430> there's<00:03:25.609> not<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:25.790> lot<00:03:26.060> of<00:03:26.350> particulate

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
so there's not a lot of particulate

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.120 
so there's not a lot of particulate
matter<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.799> that<00:03:28.609> gums<00:03:29.150> up<00:03:29.540> all<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.650> tubing

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
matter and that gums up all the tubing

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.170 
matter and that gums up all the tubing
so<00:03:31.489> using<00:03:31.940> just<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.269> the<00:03:33.049> chemical<00:03:33.530> stuff<00:03:34.180> works

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
so using just a the chemical stuff works

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.729 
so using just a the chemical stuff works
well<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:35.600> keeps<00:03:35.810> a<00:03:35.930> water<00:03:36.109> cleaner<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.680> I

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
well it keeps a water cleaner and I

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.449 
well it keeps a water cleaner and I
think<00:03:37.010> that's<00:03:37.190> going<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.430> give<00:03:38.350> better<00:03:39.459> oxygen

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
think that's going to give better oxygen

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.009 
think that's going to give better oxygen
penetration<00:03:41.060> into<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.269> water<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:41.720> into<00:03:41.930> the

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
penetration into the water and into the

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.620 
penetration into the water and into the
roots<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:42.639> thanks<00:03:43.639> for<00:03:43.880> watching<00:03:44.239> everyone

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
roots so thanks for watching everyone

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.959 
roots so thanks for watching everyone
right
