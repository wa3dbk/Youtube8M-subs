00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
strong if you think about the amount of

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.370 
strong if you think about the amount of
power<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.699> can<00:00:24.119> come<00:00:24.330> from<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:25.170> poor

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
Rotom can hydro pump but that's not

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.720 
Rotom can hydro pump but that's not
going<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.559> knock<00:00:43.680> out<00:00:43.800> sylveon<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.579> burn

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
going to knock out sylveon you can burn
it<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.000> that's<00:00:45.090> not<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.600> worry<00:00:45.719> about

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
it but that's not going to worry about

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.500 
it but that's not going to worry about
the<00:00:45.989> special<00:00:46.320> attack<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.920> I'm<00:00:47.910> liking<00:00:48.390> this

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the special attack and I'm liking this

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.510 
the special attack and I'm liking this
right<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.680> scarf<00:00:49.950> or<00:00:50.129> gum<00:00:50.250> Z<00:00:50.399> is

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
right here that the scarf or gum Z is

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.060 
right here that the scarf or gum Z is
going<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.820> lead<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.390> much<00:00:51.629> speed<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.770> let

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
going to lead so much speed and just let

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.240 
going to lead so much speed and just let
sylveon<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:54.180> into<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.719> round<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.289> well<00:00:55.469> so

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
sylveon go into that round as well so

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.459 
sylveon go into that round as well so
that's<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.390> good<00:00:57.510> strategy<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.140> double

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
that's a good strategy like the double

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.630 
that's a good strategy like the double
round<00:00:58.680> because<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.219> those<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.489> don't

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
round because for those of you don't

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.369 
round because for those of you don't
know<00:00:59.760> round<00:01:00.059> makes<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.510> other<00:01:00.780> pokemon<00:01:01.289> that

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
know round makes it other pokemon that

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.319 
know round makes it other pokemon that
use<00:01:01.500> round<00:01:01.829> go<00:01:02.309> immediately<00:01:02.550> after<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.270> if

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
use round go immediately after so if

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.179 
use round go immediately after so if
you're<00:01:03.449> leading<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> scarf<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.890> you

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
you're leading the scarf it's like you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.330 
you're leading the scarf it's like you
have<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.339> scar<00:01:05.640> sylveon<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> opponent

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
have this scar sylveon so the opponent

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.219 
have this scar sylveon so the opponent
decides<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.939> fake<00:01:09.090> out<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> sylveon<00:01:09.780> does<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
decides to fake out the sylveon does a

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.140 
decides to fake out the sylveon does a
decent<00:01:10.470> amount<00:01:10.680> damage<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.580> poor

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
decent amount damage to it and poor

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.910 
decent amount damage to it and poor
Gonzi<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.020> get<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> round<00:01:13.439> off<00:01:13.590> onto

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
lot of damage to begin with so sylveon

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.800 
lot of damage to begin with so sylveon
gets<00:01:20.130> flinched<00:01:20.580> hydro<00:01:21.299> pump<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.570> going<00:01:21.720> to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
gets flinched hydro pump is going to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.499 
gets flinched hydro pump is going to
come<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.290> sylveon<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:22.860> well<00:01:23.360> that<00:01:24.360> thing

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
come in on to sylveon as well that thing

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.480 
come in on to sylveon as well that thing
is<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.750> too<00:01:25.110> tanky<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.680> even<00:01:25.950> indoors<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
is just too tanky it even indoors the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.910 
is just too tanky it even indoors the
critical<00:01:27.030> hit<00:01:27.270> right<00:01:27.540> there<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.439> my<00:01:28.590> guess<00:01:28.650> is

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
critical hit right there so my guess is

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.200 
critical hit right there so my guess is
you<00:01:29.220> know<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.400> don't<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.970> worry<00:01:30.119> about

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
you know you don't have to worry about

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.600 
you know you don't have to worry about
any<00:01:30.450> hit<00:01:30.659> or<00:01:30.810> any<00:01:31.170> speed<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.920> go<00:01:32.040> full

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
any hit or any speed so you can go full

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.700 
any hit or any speed so you can go full
hit<00:01:32.850> points<00:01:33.240> full<00:01:33.720> special<00:01:34.229> attack<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.619> that

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
hit points full special attack on that

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.200 
hit points full special attack on that
sylveon<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.369> modest<00:01:35.670> nature<00:01:35.820> and

my goodness that's cool so like pretty
much<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.939> looks<00:01:54.090> like<00:01:54.210> porygon<00:01:54.689> z<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.350> core

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
much it looks like porygon z is the core

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.800 
much it looks like porygon z is the core
on<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.860> one<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.490> if<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.090> scarf<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.509> e<00:01:57.600> goes

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
on this one that if the scarf is e goes

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.569 
on this one that if the scarf is e goes
down<00:01:58.079> could<00:01:58.740> make<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> strategy<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.399> bit

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
down could make the strategy a bit

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.859 
down could make the strategy a bit
difficult<00:01:59.790> however<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.570> still<00:02:00.630> have

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
difficult however you still have

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.690 
difficult however you still have
salamence<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.560> thing<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:01.890> speed<00:02:02.310> up<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
salamence that thing can speed up and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.539 
salamence that thing can speed up and
then<00:02:02.820> use<00:02:02.969> around<00:02:03.180> for<00:02:03.479> itself<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.469> doesn't<00:02:05.310> do

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
then use around for itself so doesn't do

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.580 
then use around for itself so doesn't do
quite<00:02:05.700> half<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.270> Kings<00:02:06.479> gone<00:02:06.750> but<00:02:07.020> then<00:02:07.500> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
quite half to Kings gone but then the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.350 
quite half to Kings gone but then the
round<00:02:07.829> from<00:02:08.039> Solomon's<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.879> has<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.209> finish
