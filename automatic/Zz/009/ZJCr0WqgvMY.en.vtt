00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.769
 this food hygiene 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.840
 There is a tendency to relate the 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:11.090
 food hygiene problems with the 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.820
 third world and think that in the world 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.680
 developed those things do not happen but not 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.900
 wrong hygiene problems 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.760
 food also exist in the world 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.580
 developed 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.990
 new diseases also appear 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.550
 In addition, an increase of 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.430
 cases in diseases that currently 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.859
 had reduced their number of cases are 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.350
 the so-called emerging dangers like 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.840
 sample here I present you three examples 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.149
 click on the images to see the 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.620
 content 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.870
 recently in the press we have been able 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.449
 read numerous news related to 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.430
 the mad cow disease among the 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.250
 hypotheses that are shuffled about their origin 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.930
 is the use of feed from 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.089
 animal flours and processed with a 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.870
 inadequate thermal treatment in the 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.870
 ruminant feeding 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.660
 according to this hypothesis the evil could have 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.850
 come to the human being of the 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.740
 following way with products not 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.020
 commercially produced flours that 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.570
 make up some feed if the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.820
 heat treatment is not appropriate and 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.130
 the people who cause this disease do not 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.260
 is destroyed and becomes part of the 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.000
 I think then feed the cows 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.070
 with the possible transmission of the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.610
 illness that in turn can happen to 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.610
 humans 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.950
 in the 80s another big scandal 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.560
 shook the public opinion of the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.750
 rapeseed oil contaminated with hundreds 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.990
 of people affected some of the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.420
 which passed away 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.549
 finally I have reserved this case 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.079
 for the end who knows at best 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.079
 you could be yourself 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.230
 It seems that the yogurt has expired 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.230
 a few days and I do not think anything will happen
