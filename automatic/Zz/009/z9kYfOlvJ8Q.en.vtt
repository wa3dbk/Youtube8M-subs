00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:37.589 
this toolkit so the first thing is the

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:39.470 
this toolkit so the first thing is the
lamination<00:00:38.100> sheet<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.999> pack<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.239> five

the<00:01:11.579> fine<00:01:11.790> tuning<00:01:12.680> okay<00:01:13.680> now<00:01:13.829> we<00:01:13.890> will

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the fine tuning okay now we will

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.359 
the fine tuning okay now we will
actually<00:01:14.280> do<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:15.079> this<00:01:16.079> no<00:01:16.409> cap<00:01:16.680> 5800

now this is where this comes in you can
see<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.410> edges<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.220> this<00:03:34.730> is<00:03:34.910> not<00:03:35.060> very<00:03:35.210> fine

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
see the edges of this is not very fine
