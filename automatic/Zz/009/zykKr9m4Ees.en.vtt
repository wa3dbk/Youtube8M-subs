one's<00:00:48.899> called<00:00:49.110> indigo<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:51.000> looks<00:00:51.329> wow

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
one's called indigo and it looks wow

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.110 
one's called indigo and it looks wow
that<00:00:52.590> looks<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.610> pretty

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
that looks like that it is pretty

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.840 
that looks like that it is pretty
vibrant<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.559> indigo<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> purpley<00:00:56.820> blue

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850

like<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.170> exact<00:02:00.470> same<00:02:00.500> consistency<00:02:01.190> add<00:02:01.460> the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
like the exact same consistency add the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.840 
like the exact same consistency add the

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
that's what that looks like it's

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.100 
that's what that looks like it's
basically<00:04:40.060> just<00:04:40.180> like<00:04:40.509> a<00:04:40.630> little<00:04:40.840> bit<00:04:41.050> more

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
it this way just putting it straight on

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.800 
it this way just putting it straight on
to<00:05:14.979> your<00:05:15.069> lashes<00:05:15.340> I<00:05:15.880> feel<00:05:16.300> like<00:05:16.419> it<00:05:16.539> gets<00:05:16.690> a

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
to your lashes I feel like it gets a

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.520 
to your lashes I feel like it gets a
little<00:05:16.930> bit<00:05:17.280> kind<00:05:18.280> of<00:05:18.340> clumpy<00:05:19.090> and<00:05:19.169> flaky<00:05:20.169> and

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
little bit kind of clumpy and flaky and

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.520 
little bit kind of clumpy and flaky and
just<00:05:20.740> harder<00:05:21.520> to<00:05:21.550> apply<00:05:21.849> when<00:05:22.780> to<00:05:22.990> applying<00:05:23.380> it

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
just harder to apply when to applying it

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.249 
just harder to apply when to applying it
over<00:05:23.889> top<00:05:24.190> of<00:05:24.250> the<00:05:24.669> mascara<00:05:25.300> I<00:05:25.659> just<00:05:26.050> feel<00:05:26.169> like

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
over top of the mascara I just feel like

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.230 
over top of the mascara I just feel like
it's<00:05:26.380> easier<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:27.009> it<00:05:27.130> goes<00:05:27.310> on<00:05:27.550> smoother<00:05:28.090> when

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
it's easier and it goes on smoother when

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.670 
it's easier and it goes on smoother when
you're<00:05:28.389> applying<00:05:28.509> it<00:05:28.840> directly<00:05:28.960> onto<00:05:29.440> your

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680
