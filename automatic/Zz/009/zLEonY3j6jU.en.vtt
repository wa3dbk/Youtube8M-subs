00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.780 
times you've been great at time these
look<00:01:54.659> completely<00:01:55.079> inept<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:55.950> he's<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
look completely inept in like he's the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.770 
look completely inept in like he's the
34<00:01:57.390> year<00:01:57.509> old<00:01:57.689> man<00:01:57.869> hasselbeck<00:01:58.500> he<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.920> but<00:01:59.780> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
34 year old man hasselbeck he is but the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.450 
34 year old man hasselbeck he is but the
Titans<00:02:01.140> somehow<00:02:01.409> are<00:02:01.590> eight<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.860> seven<00:02:02.130> if

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
Titans somehow are eight and seven if

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.490 
Titans somehow are eight and seven if
the<00:02:03.030> jets<00:02:03.329> lose<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.990> few<00:02:06.990> things<00:02:07.229> got

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
the jets lose and the a few things got

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.359 
the jets lose and the a few things got
to<00:02:07.619> happen<00:02:07.950> really

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
to happen really

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.289 
to happen really
I think<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.700> bay<00:02:08.909> are<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:11.069> Broncos<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.090> a

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
I think the bay are the Broncos and a

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.640 
I think the bay are the Broncos and a
bunch<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.629> teams<00:02:12.840> are<00:02:13.019> going<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.200> have<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.440> lose

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
bunch of teams are going to have to lose

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.970 
bunch of teams are going to have to lose
but<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.069> Titans<00:02:14.459> playoff<00:02:15.030> hopes<00:02:15.360> are

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
but the Titans playoff hopes are

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.350 
but the Titans playoff hopes are
mathematically<00:02:16.980> not<00:02:17.310> eliminated<00:02:18.000> at<00:02:18.150> this

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
mathematically not eliminated at this

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.180 
mathematically not eliminated at this
point<00:02:19.970> Schrader's<00:02:20.970> 16<00:02:21.569> Chiefs<00:02:21.959> 13<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
point Schrader's 16 Chiefs 13 the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.910 
point Schrader's 16 Chiefs 13 the
Raiders<00:02:23.760> win<00:02:24.150> puts<00:02:24.480> them<00:02:24.720> in<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.930> tie<00:02:25.230> for<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
Raiders win puts them in a tie for the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.949 
Raiders win puts them in a tie for the
division<00:02:26.129> with<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.519> Broncos<00:02:27.030> lost<00:02:27.299> today<00:02:27.690> and

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
division with the Broncos lost today and

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.550 
division with the Broncos lost today and
you<00:02:28.349> know<00:02:28.470> they're<00:02:28.680> very<00:02:28.920> much<00:02:29.159> still<00:02:29.489> alive<00:02:29.849> I

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
you know they're very much still alive I

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.350 
you know they're very much still alive I
think<00:02:31.560> if<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:32.040> broncos<00:02:32.489> lose<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:33.060> think<00:02:33.239> it's

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
think if the broncos lose I think it's

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.819 
think if the broncos lose I think it's
if<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.569> broncos<00:02:33.959> lose<00:02:34.140> next<00:02:34.379> week<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.769> the

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
if the broncos lose next week and the

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.470 
if the broncos lose next week and the
raiders<00:02:35.099> win<00:02:35.340> then<00:02:35.549> they're<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:35.730> right<00:02:36.090> yeah

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
raiders win then they're in right yeah

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.539 
raiders win then they're in right yeah
it's<00:02:36.840> basically<00:02:37.349> one<00:02:37.680> or<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:37.920> other<00:02:37.950> it's

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
it's basically one or the other it's

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.160 
it's basically one or the other it's
going<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.790> be<00:02:38.909> in<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.090> playoffs<00:02:39.360> next<00:02:39.840> week

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
going to be in the playoffs next week

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.460 
going to be in the playoffs next week
and<00:02:40.410> i<00:02:41.190> believe<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.390> broncos<00:02:42.690> on<00:02:43.290> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
and i believe the broncos on the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.800 
and i believe the broncos on the
tiebreak<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:44.370> if<00:02:44.670> they<00:02:45.269> both<00:02:45.480> when<00:02:45.720> the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
tiebreak so if they both when the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.500 
tiebreak so if they both when the
broncos<00:02:46.260> will<00:02:46.410> probably<00:02:46.739> be<00:02:46.859> in<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.510> broncos

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
broncos will probably be in the broncos

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.729 
broncos will probably be in the broncos
today<00:02:48.930> lost<00:02:49.579> 42-14<00:02:50.579> Tim<00:02:51.450> Tebow<00:02:51.930> obviously

spiller rushes for 111 yards as the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.509

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
going to be tough task of Patriots I've

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.170 
going to be tough task of Patriots I've
done<00:03:31.470> this<00:03:31.650> last<00:03:31.919> few<00:03:32.280> years<00:03:32.310> been<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.790> best

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
done this last few years been the best

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.289 
done this last few years been the best
team<00:03:33.299> and<00:03:33.780> ultimately<00:03:34.709> have<00:03:35.010> not<00:03:35.790> done<00:03:36.090> what

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
team and ultimately have not done what

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.030 
team and ultimately have not done what
they<00:03:36.419> needed<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.810> do<00:03:37.079> to<00:03:37.319> get<00:03:37.500> back<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.919> the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
they needed to do to get back to the

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.819 
they needed to do to get back to the
Super<00:03:38.250> Bowl<00:03:38.459> since<00:03:39.049> 2007<00:03:40.049> so<00:03:40.230> we're<00:03:40.739> gonna

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
Super Bowl since 2007 so we're gonna

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.289 
Super Bowl since 2007 so we're gonna
have<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.099> see<00:03:41.280> what<00:03:41.400> happens<00:03:41.430> i<00:03:41.910> think<00:03:42.150> that

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
have to see what happens i think that

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.000 
have to see what happens i think that
the<00:03:42.389> Patriots<00:03:42.599> are<00:03:43.079> certainly<00:03:43.709> a<00:03:43.829> contender

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
the Patriots are certainly a contender

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.009 
the Patriots are certainly a contender
but<00:03:44.609> if<00:03:44.879> you're<00:03:45.389> going<00:03:45.510> to<00:03:45.569> tell<00:03:45.720> me<00:03:45.750> they're

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
but if you're going to tell me they're

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.839 
but if you're going to tell me they're
the<00:03:46.199> best<00:03:46.440> team<00:03:46.560> I'm<00:03:46.949> just<00:03:47.160> not<00:03:47.280> sure<00:03:47.340> because

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
the best team I'm just not sure because

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.949 
the best team I'm just not sure because
of<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.209> defense<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:49.769> Giants<00:03:50.370> 29<00:03:50.940> Jets<00:03:51.389> 14

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
Patriots lose and the Ravens when I

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.839 
Patriots lose and the Ravens when I
think<00:05:06.770> they<00:05:06.889> might<00:05:07.099> even<00:05:07.220> be<00:05:07.400> able<00:05:07.490> to<00:05:07.610> get<00:05:07.729> the

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
number one seed it looks like they will

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:16.150
