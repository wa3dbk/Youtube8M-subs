00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:14.879
 Wisdom and deer recommend the ice coffee with flower arrangement 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.570
 First , extract a cup of coffee with 3 cups 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:23.970
 Pour hot water into the queen's pot 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:30.529
 Don't fire the coffee pot This is the tip of a delicious coffee 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.529
 Is the temperature of hot water from 92 degrees to 90 degrees ? 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:42.810
 We will extract without giving too much hot water a little thinner than regular coffee 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:48.080
 Carefully 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.080
 This is a good point for drips , as you can get dark coffee 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.050
 Wait 30 seconds 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.170
 I will pour a little bit from the middle 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:15.570
 The amount of old age is smaller than usual and the temperature is slightly higher than usual 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.650
 Is the recommended Shigerutoshi because 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.390
 Carefully 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.390
 Let's give this kind of woman's coffee 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.810
 In the middle 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.810
 I will try to raise a little 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.620
 It is little more need 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:06.430
 Take a little more time than usual 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:10.200
 I just cut it off as usual 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.200
 It is the turn of midsummer from here 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.959
 Masu First proofreading Date to survive 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.530
 Pour the ice coffee When you put the appropriate amount of alternating current 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.160
 And let's get off 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.850

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.819
 When done 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.819
 Pour into the bowl 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.040
 The ice 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.040
 With each other and other 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.420
 Stir lightly 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:15.080
 After this 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:17.920
 I have some ice that doesn't heat up while I'm drinking 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.920
 This is completed
