00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
to understand the opportunities and the

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.280 
to understand the opportunities and the
usage<00:01:42.520> models<00:01:42.940> so<00:01:43.570> really<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:43.810> think<00:01:43.870> most<00:01:44.230> of

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
usage models so really I think most of

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.450 
usage models so really I think most of
the<00:01:44.380> machines<00:01:44.710> that<00:01:44.860> you'll<00:01:45.190> see<00:01:45.340> in<00:01:45.400> the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
the machines that you'll see in the

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.980 
the machines that you'll see in the
market<00:01:45.730> are<00:01:45.820> going<00:01:45.940> to<00:01:46.000> be<00:01:46.090> Android<00:01:46.450> specific

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
market are going to be Android specific

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.720 
market are going to be Android specific
or<00:01:47.170> Windows<00:01:47.530> specific<00:01:48.010> but<00:01:48.430> you'll<00:01:48.550> certainly

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
or Windows specific but you'll certainly

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.790 
or Windows specific but you'll certainly

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
do you have any idea how those tablets

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.900 
do you have any idea how those tablets
work<00:01:53.020> by<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.260> way<00:01:53.410> how<00:01:53.890> they<00:01:54.040> share<00:01:54.280> memory<00:01:54.640> or

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
work by the way how they share memory or

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.330 
work by the way how they share memory or
anything<00:01:55.210> like<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.360> we<00:01:56.050> could<00:01:56.230> we<00:01:56.320> do<00:01:56.620> okay

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
anything like that we could we do okay

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.010 
anything like that we could we do okay

and<00:02:34.310> one<00:02:35.310> questions<00:02:35.700> always<00:02:35.880> been<00:02:36.090> in<00:02:36.180> my<00:02:36.240> mind

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
and one questions always been in my mind

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.580 
and one questions always been in my mind
since<00:02:38.460> this<00:02:39.270> baytril<00:02:39.960> female<00:02:40.200> i<00:02:40.230> should<00:02:40.440> say

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
since this baytril female i should say

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.060 
since this baytril female i should say
is<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:42.000> as<00:02:42.720> well<00:02:42.960> is<00:02:43.110> also<00:02:43.410> very<00:02:43.530> attractive

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
is so as well is also very attractive

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
for example i have a surface pro 2 that

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.310 
for example i have a surface pro 2 that
shirt<00:02:46.080> has<00:02:46.230> wall<00:02:46.440> inside<00:02:47.390> for<00:02:48.390> tablets<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:48.960> are

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
shirt has wall inside for tablets so are

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.080 
shirt has wall inside for tablets so are
you<00:02:49.440> sensing<00:02:49.950> any<00:02:50.070> shift<00:02:50.430> maybe<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.760> little<00:02:50.910> bit

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
you sensing any shift maybe a little bit

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.500 
you sensing any shift maybe a little bit
shift<00:02:51.660> or<00:02:51.900> two<00:02:52.020> as<00:02:52.110> well<00:02:52.350> or<00:02:52.860> among<00:02:53.220> more<00:02:53.700> you

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
shift or two as well or among more you

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.080 
shift or two as well or among more you
know<00:02:54.890> I'm<00:02:55.890> more<00:02:56.130> welcoming<00:02:56.550> attitude<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:57.060> it

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
know I'm more welcoming attitude to it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.080 
know I'm more welcoming attitude to it
as<00:02:57.360> well<00:02:57.390> then<00:02:57.690> maybe<00:02:58.410> before<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:59.190> know<00:02:59.730> I<00:02:59.760> think

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
as well then maybe before I know I think

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.950 
as well then maybe before I know I think

explicitly<00:03:47.710> what<00:03:48.710> I<00:03:48.740> believe<00:03:48.950> Brian<00:03:49.400> said<00:03:49.670> and

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
explicitly what I believe Brian said and

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.960 
explicitly what I believe Brian said and
the<00:03:50.270> analyst<00:03:51.080> report<00:03:51.410> is<00:03:51.530> a4x<00:03:51.980> increasing<00:03:52.730> the

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
the analyst report is a4x increasing the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.050 
the analyst report is a4x increasing the
Tavel<00:03:53.300> units<00:03:53.680> you're<00:03:54.680> on<00:03:54.800> you're<00:03:55.130> a<00:03:55.340> relative

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
Tavel units you're on you're a relative

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.240 
Tavel units you're on you're a relative
to<00:03:56.150> our<00:03:56.240> work<00:03:56.540> so<00:03:57.320> that<00:03:57.470> comes<00:03:57.770> to<00:03:57.980> roughly

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
to our work so that comes to roughly

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.580 
to our work so that comes to roughly
forty<00:03:58.610> nine<00:03:58.790> we're<00:03:59.540> saying<00:03:59.780> for<00:04:00.050> x<00:04:00.200> we'll<00:04:00.410> let

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
forty nine we're saying for x we'll let

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.980 
forty nine we're saying for x we'll let
the<00:04:00.950> analysts<00:04:01.310> of<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.490> math<00:04:01.640> on<00:04:01.790> that<00:04:01.959> what<00:04:02.959> I

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
the analysts of the math on that what I

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.199 
the analysts of the math on that what I
think<00:04:03.080> it<00:04:03.350> really<00:04:03.410> says<00:04:03.980> is<00:04:04.580> that<00:04:04.610> Intel<00:04:05.090> is

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
think it really says is that Intel is

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.850 
think it really says is that Intel is
making<00:04:05.510> a<00:04:05.600> real<00:04:05.810> dent<00:04:06.110> in<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.500> tablet<00:04:06.830> market
