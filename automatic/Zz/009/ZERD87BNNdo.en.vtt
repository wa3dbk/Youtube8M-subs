the<00:00:59.190> rallycross<00:00:59.820> cars<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.330> that<00:01:00.540> some<00:01:00.809> people

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the rallycross cars is that some people

the rallycross cars is that some people
some<00:01:01.530> teams<00:01:01.739> use<00:01:01.920> longitude<00:01:02.460> engines<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.210> use

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
some teams use longitude engines we use

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.230 
some teams use longitude engines we use
a<00:01:03.449> transverse<00:01:04.400> that<00:01:05.400> means<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.210> a

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
a transverse that means that we have a

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.030 
a transverse that means that we have a
different<00:01:06.659> distribution<00:01:07.050> we<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
different distribution we have a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.250 
different distribution we have a
turbocharger<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.270> behind<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.810> engine<00:01:09.930> here

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
turbocharger just behind the engine here

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.010 
turbocharger just behind the engine here
we<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.560> see<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.950> all<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.030> small<00:01:12.420> wiring<00:01:12.870> and

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
we can see and all the small wiring and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.190 
we can see and all the small wiring and
so<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.380> with<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.740> magnet<00:01:14.040> marelli<00:01:15.200> electronic

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
so is with the magnet marelli electronic

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.109 
so is with the magnet marelli electronic
unit

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.419 

here<00:01:23.719> we<00:01:23.840> are<00:01:23.869> inside<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:24.320> Persia<00:01:24.679> -<00:01:24.979> wait

this is Timmy's office what we can see

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.270 
this is Timmy's office what we can see
is<00:01:28.100> that<00:01:28.340> we<00:01:29.060> have<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.929> button<00:01:30.590> place<00:01:31.009> here

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
is that we have a button place here

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.429 
is that we have a button place here
where<00:01:31.579> the<00:01:31.939> drivers<00:01:32.329> can<00:01:32.539> manage<00:01:32.929> the<00:01:33.170> engine

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
where the drivers can manage the engine

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.919 
where the drivers can manage the engine
and<00:01:33.679> start<00:01:34.460> and<00:01:34.640> everything<00:01:35.030> we<00:01:35.539> have<00:01:35.630> a<00:01:35.659> gear

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
and start and everything we have a gear

and start and everything we have a gear
leader<00:01:36.140> we<00:01:36.649> have<00:01:36.770> a<00:01:36.799> handbrake<00:01:37.240> we<00:01:38.240> have<00:01:38.359> a

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
leader we have a handbrake we have a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.940 
leader we have a handbrake we have a
dashboard<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:41.090> dashboard<00:01:41.240> for<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.719> gear

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
dashboard and the dashboard for the gear

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.740 
dashboard and the dashboard for the gear
this<00:01:42.950> is<00:01:43.009> information<00:01:43.579> that<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.209> drivers<00:01:44.539> can

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
this is information that the drivers can

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.039 
this is information that the drivers can
get<00:01:44.929> when<00:01:45.799> we<00:01:45.950> have<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.250> different<00:01:46.369> drivers

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
get when we have the different drivers

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.559 
get when we have the different drivers
Timur<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:48.560> Timmy<00:01:49.280> it's<00:01:49.789> some<00:01:50.119> different

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
Timur and Timmy it's some different

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.499 
Timur and Timmy it's some different
setup<00:01:51.020> it<00:01:51.740> means<00:01:51.979> that<00:01:52.250> five-millimeter<00:01:53.240> on

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
setup it means that five-millimeter on

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.449 
setup it means that five-millimeter on
the<00:01:53.600> gear<00:01:53.810> lever<00:01:54.109> closer<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.709> driver<00:01:54.920> or

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
the gear lever closer to the driver or

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.699 
the gear lever closer to the driver or
grab<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:55.909> seat<00:01:56.329> three<00:01:56.810> millimeter<00:01:57.289> lower<00:01:57.500> in

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
grab the seat three millimeter lower in

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:59.710 
grab the seat three millimeter lower in
the<00:01:57.829> front<00:01:58.069> end<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:58.459> so<00:01:58.579> it's<00:01:59.119> very<00:01:59.390> crucial

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
the front end and so it's very crucial

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.990 
the front end and so it's very crucial
so<00:02:00.500> they<00:02:00.619> get<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.950> right<00:02:01.130> working<00:02:01.640> feeling

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.490 

here<00:02:08.000> we<00:02:08.119> see<00:02:08.299> some<00:02:08.569> of<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:08.840> suspension<00:02:09.379> on

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
here we see some of the suspension on

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.770 
here we see some of the suspension on
the<00:02:09.619> first<00:02:09.829> two<00:02:10.099> eight<00:02:10.329> it's<00:02:11.329> obviously<00:02:11.690> very

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
the first two eight it's obviously very

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.199 
the first two eight it's obviously very
important<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:12.829> get<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.190> handling<00:02:13.640> of<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.970> car

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
important to get the handling of the car

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.569 
important to get the handling of the car
very<00:02:14.239> right<00:02:14.750> so<00:02:15.019> it<00:02:15.170> suits<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.769> driver<00:02:16.040> so

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
very right so it suits the driver so

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.759 
very right so it suits the driver so
that<00:02:16.610> can<00:02:16.940> be<00:02:16.970> adjusted<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.930> little<00:02:18.079> different

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
that can be adjusted a little different

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.300 
that can be adjusted a little different
so<00:02:19.190> each<00:02:19.489> driver<00:02:19.790> have<00:02:20.120> its<00:02:20.329> own<00:02:20.510> feeling<00:02:21.319> but

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
so each driver have its own feeling but

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.789 
so each driver have its own feeling but
one<00:02:22.549> very<00:02:22.579> important<00:02:23.510> thing<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.810> tires<00:02:24.140> you

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
one very important thing is tires you

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.370 
one very important thing is tires you
know<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:25.190> car<00:02:25.640> have<00:02:25.849> only<00:02:26.000> four<00:02:26.329> spots<00:02:26.720> on<00:02:27.109> the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
know a car have only four spots on the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.500 
know a car have only four spots on the
ground<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.799> that<00:02:27.829> is<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.190> tire<00:02:28.430> we<00:02:29.329> are

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510
