00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
which is hard obviously so I'm like

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.480 
which is hard obviously so I'm like
three<00:03:49.140> seconds<00:03:49.500> behind<00:03:49.650> which<00:03:49.950> actually<00:03:50.160> when

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
three seconds behind which actually when

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.699 
three seconds behind which actually when
you<00:03:50.520> think<00:03:50.640> about<00:03:50.850> it's<00:03:51.090> pretty<00:03:51.120> good

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
you think about it's pretty good

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.900 
you think about it's pretty good
three-second<00:03:52.709> fine<00:03:52.830> is<00:03:53.040> not<00:03:53.340> bad<00:03:53.550> at<00:03:53.850> all

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
three-second fine is not bad at all

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.000 
three-second fine is not bad at all
actually<00:03:54.450> so<00:03:55.260> how<00:03:55.380> do<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:55.530> crease<00:03:55.860> my

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010
