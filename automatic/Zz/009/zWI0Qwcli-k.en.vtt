00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
but basically to do this all you have to

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.190 
but basically to do this all you have to
do<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.790> do<00:00:11.969> something<00:00:12.420> really<00:00:12.630> similar<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.049> how

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200

do is do something really similar to how
you<00:00:13.259> did<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.500> before<00:00:13.679> but<00:00:14.429> basically<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.940> just

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
you did it before but basically you just

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.480 
you did it before but basically you just
have<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.269> open<00:00:15.299> up<00:00:15.809> your<00:00:16.020> like<00:00:16.410> little<00:00:16.710> area

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
have to open up your like little area

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.920 
have to open up your like little area
that<00:00:17.609> allows<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.000> go<00:00:18.150> into<00:00:18.300> passive<00:00:18.779> mode

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
that allows you to go into passive mode

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.010 
that allows you to go into passive mode
you're<00:00:19.080> gonna<00:00:19.199> hover<00:00:19.439> over<00:00:19.770> passive<00:00:20.279> mode<00:00:20.490> and

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
you're gonna hover over passive mode and

what you're gonna do is you're not turn
on<00:00:23.699> passive<00:00:24.269> mode<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.600> then<00:00:24.689> you're<00:00:24.779> going<00:00:24.869> to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
on passive mode and then you're going to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.210 
on passive mode and then you're going to
have<00:00:25.109> your<00:00:25.289> friends<00:00:25.680> shoot<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.130> head

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
have your friends shoot you in the head

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.460

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
right as you turn on passive mode now

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.750 
right as you turn on passive mode now
the<00:00:28.529> best<00:00:28.740> thing<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.099> can<00:00:29.220> do<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.429> get

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the best thing that you can do to get

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.939 
the best thing that you can do to get
the<00:00:29.880> timing<00:00:30.119> down<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:31.260> can<00:00:31.380> count<00:00:31.650> down

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
the timing down is you can count down

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.209 
the timing down is you can count down
from<00:00:32.399> three<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:33.210> one<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.559> one<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.070> guys

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
from three to one and on one you guys

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.670 
from three to one and on one you guys
can<00:00:35.489> do<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.850> at<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.120> same<00:00:36.300> exact<00:00:36.660> time<00:00:36.870> also

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
can do that at the same exact time also

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.049 
can do that at the same exact time also
make<00:00:37.860> sure<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.129> using<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.610> sniper<00:00:38.879> rifle

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
make sure that using a sniper rifle

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.790 
make sure that using a sniper rifle
because<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.230> use<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> sniper

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
because you do have to use a sniper

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.790 
because you do have to use a sniper
rifle<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.180> actually<00:00:42.210> work<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.140> if

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
rifle for this to actually work and if

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.590 
rifle for this to actually work and if
you<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.129> correct<00:00:44.399> timing<00:00:44.969> what<00:00:45.390> should

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
you the correct timing what should
