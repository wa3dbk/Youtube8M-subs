00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
that rather than dealing with this the

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.000 
that rather than dealing with this the
whole<00:04:14.720> idea<00:04:15.019> is<00:04:15.109> already<00:04:15.230> ridiculous<00:04:15.859> is

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
the same time like I think it'd be a

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.000 
the same time like I think it'd be a
more<00:04:20.690> interesting<00:04:20.870> character<00:04:21.350> dynamic

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
more interesting character dynamic

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.129 
more interesting character dynamic
because<00:04:22.310> what<00:04:22.580> made<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:23.180> first<00:04:23.419> tab<00:04:23.690> works<00:04:23.960> so

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
because what made the first tab works so

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.200 
because what made the first tab works so
well<00:04:24.380> was<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.800> buddy<00:04:25.100> relationship<00:04:26.000> the

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210
