00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:02.750 
all right we're at the beginning of the

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.090 
all right we're at the beginning of the
C&amp;O<00:00:03.139> canal<00:00:03.469> here<00:00:03.920> in<00:00:04.040> Georgetown<00:00:05.259> so<00:00:06.259> about

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.100 
C&amp;O canal here in Georgetown so about

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.680 
C&amp;O canal here in Georgetown so about
six<00:00:07.339> to<00:00:07.430> seven<00:00:07.459> miles<00:00:07.879> to<00:00:08.029> Harpers<00:00:08.360> Ferry<00:00:08.390> I

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690 
six to seven miles to Harpers Ferry I

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.370 
six to seven miles to Harpers Ferry I
guess<00:00:08.840> I'll<00:00:08.960> take<00:00:09.110> a<00:00:09.170> day<00:00:09.380> off<00:00:09.940> this<00:00:11.080> C&amp;O<00:00:12.080> canal

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
guess I'll take a day off this C&amp;O canal

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.320 
guess I'll take a day off this C&amp;O canal
it's<00:00:12.560> the<00:00:12.710> cumberland<00:00:13.100> and<00:00:13.250> ohio<00:00:13.550> is<00:00:14.120> that

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
it's the cumberland and ohio is that

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.230 
it's the cumberland and ohio is that
right<00:00:14.980> nope<00:00:18.369> this<00:00:19.369> is<00:00:19.519> the<00:00:19.640> Chesapeake<00:00:19.849> and

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
right nope this is the Chesapeake and

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.509 
right nope this is the Chesapeake and
Ohio<00:00:20.269> Canal<00:00:20.660> it<00:00:21.169> connects<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:21.800> Chesapeake

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
Ohio Canal it connects the Chesapeake

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.399 
Ohio Canal it connects the Chesapeake
Bay<00:00:22.550> with<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.659> Ohio<00:00:23.960> Valley

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:24.409 
Bay with the Ohio Valley

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:26.439 
Bay with the Ohio Valley
so<00:00:24.890> this<00:00:25.130> locking<00:00:25.669> system<00:00:25.999> was<00:00:26.150> to<00:00:26.269> help

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
so this locking system was to help

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.380 
so this locking system was to help
barges<00:00:26.839> that<00:00:27.079> from<00:00:27.769> all<00:00:28.039> the<00:00:28.249> fertile<00:00:28.999> plains

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
barges that from all the fertile plains

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.290 
barges that from all the fertile plains
out<00:00:29.689> west<00:00:30.169> of<00:00:30.349> here<00:00:30.589> to<00:00:31.220> get<00:00:31.339> their<00:00:31.579> produce

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
out west of here to get their produce

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.389 
out west of here to get their produce
all<00:00:32.720> the<00:00:32.870> way<00:00:32.960> back<00:00:33.140> into<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:33.590> DC<00:00:33.920> area<00:00:33.949> into

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
all the way back into the DC area into

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.910 
all the way back into the DC area into
market<00:00:34.789> so<00:00:34.940> they<00:00:35.059> could<00:00:35.239> go<00:00:35.539> overseas<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:36.350> be

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
market so they could go overseas and be

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.630 
market so they could go overseas and be
sold<00:00:37.160> in<00:00:37.340> in<00:00:38.030> Europe<00:00:38.359> or<00:00:38.539> wherever<00:00:38.690> but<00:00:39.640> behind

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
sold in in Europe or wherever but behind

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.000 
sold in in Europe or wherever but behind
is<00:00:40.789> this<00:00:40.969> lot<00:00:41.449> and<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.230> barge<00:00:42.440> to<00:00:42.649> come

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
is this lot and so the barge to come

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.619 
is this lot and so the barge to come
down<00:00:43.190> there<00:00:43.399> would<00:00:43.489> be<00:00:43.519> total<00:00:44.000> on<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.420> path

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
down there would be total on the path

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.509 
down there would be total on the path
that's<00:00:44.809> why<00:00:44.989> this<00:00:45.170> capacitor<00:00:45.949> was<00:00:46.039> traveling

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
that's why this capacitor was traveling

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.790 
that's why this capacitor was traveling
right<00:00:46.609> now<00:00:46.670> is<00:00:46.910> called<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.239> towpath<00:00:47.690> and<00:00:47.960> use

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
right now is called the towpath and use

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.540 
right now is called the towpath and use
and<00:00:49.840> other<00:00:50.840> workers<00:00:51.170> would<00:00:51.530> help<00:00:51.739> us<00:00:51.920> would

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
and other workers would help us would

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.340 
and other workers would help us would
tow<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:53.000> to<00:00:53.300> pass<00:00:53.539> along<00:00:53.780> a<00:00:53.929> day<00:00:54.109> for<00:00:54.260> the

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
tow the to pass along a day for the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.410 
tow the to pass along a day for the
routes<00:00:54.530> out<00:00:54.769> of<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.980> barges<00:00:55.399> off<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.210> side

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
routes out of the barges off to the side

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.750 
routes out of the barges off to the side
of<00:00:56.539> the<00:00:56.600> path<00:00:56.809> and<00:00:57.140> pull<00:00:57.800> those<00:00:57.980> barges<00:00:58.370> down

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
of the path and pull those barges down

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.029 
of the path and pull those barges down
the<00:00:58.910> river<00:00:59.089> so<00:00:59.449> this<00:00:59.960> is<00:01:00.109> a<00:01:00.140> lot<00:01:00.410> keepers<00:01:00.829> house
