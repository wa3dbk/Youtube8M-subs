00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
through him with him and I can remember

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.930 
through him with him and I can remember
a<00:01:12.729> lot<00:01:13.060> of<00:01:13.210> it<00:01:13.330> I<00:01:13.560> grew<00:01:14.560> up<00:01:14.619> on<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.890> farm<00:01:14.920> and<00:01:15.580> I

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
a lot of it I grew up on the farm and I

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.870 
a lot of it I grew up on the farm and I
had<00:01:16.149> two<00:01:16.360> brothers<00:01:16.720> and<00:01:16.930> a<00:01:17.020> sister<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:17.880> we

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
had two brothers and a sister and we

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.430 
had two brothers and a sister and we
started<00:01:19.240> helping<00:01:19.390> with<00:01:19.690> chores<00:01:19.930> at<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.229> very

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
started helping with chores at a very

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.200 
started helping with chores at a very
young<00:01:20.619> age<00:01:20.680> I<00:01:21.070> think<00:01:21.280> it's<00:01:21.460> as<00:01:21.670> soon<00:01:22.000> as<00:01:22.090> we

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
young age I think it's as soon as we

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.330 
young age I think it's as soon as we
could<00:01:22.330> probably<00:01:22.509> walk<00:01:22.840> feeding<00:01:23.800> cattle<00:01:24.040> and

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
could probably walk feeding cattle and

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.150 
could probably walk feeding cattle and
and<00:01:24.490> feeding<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.240> pigs<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:25.780> we<00:01:26.770> just

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
and feeding the pigs and we just

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.430 
and feeding the pigs and we just
progressed<00:01:27.940> from<00:01:28.000> there<00:01:28.270> doing<00:01:28.690> doing<00:01:29.170> jobs

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
progressed from there doing doing jobs

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.100 
progressed from there doing doing jobs
as<00:01:29.680> we<00:01:29.860> kind<00:01:29.979> of<00:01:30.100> grew<00:01:30.220> into<00:01:30.490> those<00:01:30.640> jobs<00:01:31.110> when

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
as we kind of grew into those jobs when

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.139 
as we kind of grew into those jobs when
I<00:01:32.140> graduate<00:01:32.590> from<00:01:32.619> high<00:01:32.860> school<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.490> I

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
I graduate from high school and I

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.790 
I graduate from high school and I
actually<00:01:34.600> went<00:01:34.899> off<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.110> college<00:01:35.289> for<00:01:35.680> one

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
actually went off to college for one

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.950 
actually went off to college for one
year<00:01:36.070> I<00:01:36.250> knew<00:01:36.759> I<00:01:36.789> wanted<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.149> come<00:01:37.360> back<00:01:37.539> and

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
year I knew I wanted to come back and

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.440 
year I knew I wanted to come back and
and<00:01:38.860> so<00:01:39.009> I<00:01:39.039> took<00:01:39.130> agribusiness<00:01:39.880> in<00:01:40.060> college

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
and so I took agribusiness in college

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.950 
and so I took agribusiness in college
and<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.850> during<00:01:43.180> that<00:01:43.210> year<00:01:43.570> was<00:01:43.720> probably

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
and but during that year was probably

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.270 
and but during that year was probably
the<00:01:44.050> best<00:01:44.229> thing<00:01:44.380> it<00:01:44.530> was<00:01:44.619> good<00:01:44.800> for<00:01:44.950> me<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.190> get

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
the best thing it was good for me to get

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.800 
the best thing it was good for me to get
away<00:01:45.399> from<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.760> farm<00:01:45.970> but<00:01:46.119> at<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.360> same<00:01:46.570> time

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
away from the farm but at the same time

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.300 
away from the farm but at the same time
it<00:01:46.960> made<00:01:47.110> me<00:01:47.229> realize<00:01:47.530> how<00:01:47.560> much<00:01:47.890> I<00:01:48.010> wanted<00:01:48.220> to

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
it made me realize how much I wanted to

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.149 
it made me realize how much I wanted to
come<00:01:48.490> back<00:01:48.670> and<00:01:48.729> be<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:49.299> hands-on<00:01:49.840> farmer<00:01:50.439> and

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
come back and be a hands-on farmer and

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.410 
come back and be a hands-on farmer and
so<00:01:51.340> I<00:01:51.400> went<00:01:51.549> to<00:01:51.580> college<00:01:51.729> for<00:01:52.030> one<00:01:52.119> year<00:01:52.330> and

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
so I went to college for one year and

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.609 
so I went to college for one year and
then<00:01:52.479> I<00:01:52.540> come<00:01:52.780> back<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.200> I<00:01:53.229> went<00:01:53.350> to<00:01:53.500> actually

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
then I come back and I went to actually

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.469 
then I come back and I went to actually
to<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:53.950> technical<00:01:54.460> school<00:01:54.640> for<00:01:54.909> two<00:01:55.060> years<00:01:55.090> for
