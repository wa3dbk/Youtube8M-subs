00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
some people are reporting that it's

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.000

working on the newest version of itunes
for<00:00:18.220> them<00:00:18.460> but<00:00:18.970> obviously<00:00:19.119> it's<00:00:19.660> not<00:00:19.720> working

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:20.259

everybody so i think if you do downgrade
it's<00:00:25.480> probably<00:00:25.810> going<00:00:25.960> to<00:00:26.080> work<00:00:26.259> a<00:00:26.410> hundred

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710

percent<00:00:26.949> of<00:00:26.980> the<00:00:27.070> time<00:00:27.130> otherwise<00:00:28.119> you<00:00:28.509> can

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
percent of the time otherwise you can

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.210 
percent of the time otherwise you can
always<00:00:28.929> try<00:00:29.320> it<00:00:29.380> with<00:00:29.589> the<00:00:29.679> newest<00:00:29.859> version<00:00:29.919> of

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220

always try it with the newest version of
itunes<00:00:30.580> and<00:00:30.759> if<00:00:30.820> it<00:00:30.939> doesn't<00:00:31.269> work<00:00:31.300> then

obviously<00:01:49.719> see<00:01:50.229> that<00:01:50.649> i'm<00:01:50.799> on<00:01:50.950> 8.4<00:01:51.549> because<00:01:51.790> i

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
obviously see that i'm on 8.4 because i

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.609

have this music icon right here which is

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.980 
have this music icon right here which is
new<00:01:53.799> to<00:01:53.950> 8.4<00:01:54.549> because<00:01:55.180> apple<00:01:55.509> music<00:01:55.630> was

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
new to 8.4 because apple music was

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.630 
new to 8.4 because apple music was
released<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.500> that's<00:01:56.890> why<00:01:57.100> you<00:01:57.159> actually

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
released and that's why you actually

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.510 
released and that's why you actually
want<00:01:57.909> to<00:01:58.000> upgrade<00:01:58.240> to<00:01:58.689> 8.4<00:01:59.469> to<00:02:00.009> jailbreak

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
want to upgrade to 8.4 to jailbreak

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.060 
want to upgrade to 8.4 to jailbreak
rather<00:02:00.759> than<00:02:00.909> staying<00:02:01.270> on<00:02:01.479> 8.3<00:02:02.259> so<00:02:02.770> i<00:02:02.799> know
