00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
 i am 

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.030
 Rather than the pitch 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.570
 Again outside the pitch 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.570
 pressure 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:17.710
 After all supporters are completely different, too 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.680
 Please do not allow the Tteyuu players to each other 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.289
 It also takes a picture of showing play ability 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.910
 That's the basic, but besides that 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.910
 It is amazing to talk in the player life 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.940
 And it must affect in the base 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.510
 There is a different creamer of the words in which the song is being played 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:45.040
 joy 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:47.730
 I can't show you my senses around me while I feel 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.200
 Even if you have the ability 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.100
 I can not go out to the match 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:59.579
 There is a Japanese sword 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:04.049
 The big fish in foreign countries and what I'm doing after all on the pitch are Japanese soccer and foreign soccer 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.519
 Because the football is also a writer whose football has hunting children are good players 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:11.830
 Is evaluated what or 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:16.330
 That means and Japan because the process leading up to the elsewhere evaluation is outside the pitch 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.810
 Become commonplace to need that sort of overseas but that you do not need to think in Japan 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.610
 Come you 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.000
 Soccer players repeatedly repeat such fine-grained play in daily practice 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.920
 I practice repeatedly 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.060
 There is not all that written in the team practice there 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.000
 Take it higher just how aware of the practice 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.270
 We can work on 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:45.909
 There is already another player's right hand in front of the individual consciousness 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:48.140
 I think that it is shooting I myself stuck in such a place and enter from the trap 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.430
 It is a sense of values ​​of 5m 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.430
 I will stick to such a place 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.040
 Well your opponent 's speed 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.530
 While thinking about the pullback of the art ally 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.430
 It is quite natural but 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:09.789
 If you can give a pass to the child while being aware of such things 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.939
 Is it easy for the next ally player to play? 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.460
 It was a day while finding the answer for myself 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:19.680
 Hmm 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:23.350
 Well, soccer has to always play in the situation where it is 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.540
 I do not think that the same situation or need 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:30.510
 In it 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:35.500
 Where do you most dislike it? 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.590
 Say where he or she is should we face 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.450
 It is amazingly simple 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:46.110
 It only from the perspective while judging at that every moment 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.950
 Say to receive a pass 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.950
 And you know 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:56.200
 After all when it is the first position 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.650
 Always Tteyuu horse racing intense press 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.450
 There are many cases that protect the ball while also receiving the situation 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.769
 It 's time to get it pulled back 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:12.200
 Then there is a situation that can be played in the space there is quite 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:15.440
 You can play in a comparatively free in the free In it's given the way the situation of Tteyuu time a little space 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.170
 Well then what position in the midfield 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.680
 In on whether you play thus um 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.800
 The pressure after opening is pretty 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.760
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.000
 It's going to be Kumoha army sky-kun 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.710
 The issue number keeper at that time 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.090
 It's that radical, but it's not where it was put 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:44.760
 part There is also a table today in the wall 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:49.650
 Basically, I can not accept it because I think that I have not practiced well from usual . 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:52.450
 And that's a big assumption, but after all it kicked to a good place and read by the keeper 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.849
 Because it is often stopped 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.849
 Do you want to reverse the opponent below 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:04.880
 There was also when suddenly not determine the direction in which the kick to Gigi divided into care 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.880
 It is the last time to kick and change direction 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:14.760
 I do n't like what I do 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:17.530
 I a going to have to and go in a hurry or fall keep or reflect the thinking that say 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:22.970
 Bessa then 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.870
 Tsu whether it is that choice as a wife that I own 8 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.630
 Yup 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.190
 It is said that there is a master 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.610
 Already now 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:35.620
 Name of the moment 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.620
 The whole thing is always moving 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:44.090
 The moment is n't coming any longer, as we did recently 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:48.500
 How can you make the best chons in that moment ? 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.790
 Basically, I myself 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.390
 Ummm 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:57.449
 I 'm not the one to cast a feint against my opponent 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:02.569
 Relatively reasonable that 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.569
 I try to aim for an effective frame
