a<00:00:15.809> lot<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.350> same<00:00:16.650> questions<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.900> recently

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
a lot of the same questions and recently

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.290 
a lot of the same questions and recently
i<00:00:19.020> guess<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:20.189> just<00:00:20.340> become<00:00:20.730> very<00:00:21.060> very

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
i guess it's just become very very

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.870 
i guess it's just become very very
repetitive<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.170> i'm<00:00:22.590> pretty<00:00:22.949> sure<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.369> every

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
repetitive and i'm pretty sure in every

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.730

single<00:00:24.330> video<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.779> i<00:00:24.840> filmed<00:00:25.350> there's

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
single video that i filmed there's

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.800 
single video that i filmed there's
always<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.160> one<00:00:26.220> person<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:27.000> would<00:00:27.330> ask<00:00:27.539> me
