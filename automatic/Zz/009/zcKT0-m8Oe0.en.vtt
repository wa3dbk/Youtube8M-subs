superior education system I don't know

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.980 
superior education system I don't know
or<00:00:23.340> was<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.609> my<00:00:23.730> own<00:00:23.850> theory<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.840> that

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
or was it my own theory and that is that

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.359 
or was it my own theory and that is that
most<00:00:25.109> Scottish<00:00:25.500> people<00:00:25.800> are<00:00:25.949> actually<00:00:26.220> from

the future this is slightly contentious
I<00:00:30.119> know<00:00:31.369> but<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.610> do<00:00:32.790> believe<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.750> the

lenient licensing hours I know it's a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.970 
lenient licensing hours I know it's a
tricky<00:00:50.340> theory<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.640> know<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.680> I'll<00:00:52.680> tell<00:00:52.860> you

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
tricky theory I know but I'll tell you

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.819 
tricky theory I know but I'll tell you
why<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.030> true<00:00:54.270> because<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.230> lot<00:00:55.800> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
why that this is true because a lot of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.740 
why that this is true because a lot of
Scottish<00:00:56.160> people<00:00:56.309> talk<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.180> way<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.600> is

actually from another century all right
way<00:01:00.719> into<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> future<00:01:01.500> where<00:01:02.129> they<00:01:02.219> can

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
way into the future where they can

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.240 
way into the future where they can
predict<00:01:02.809> time<00:01:03.809> travel<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.350> tell<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.010> what<00:01:05.100> you

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
predict time travel I tell you what you

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.670 
predict time travel I tell you what you
can<00:01:05.400> spot<00:01:05.640> them<00:01:05.790> after<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> meal<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> meal
