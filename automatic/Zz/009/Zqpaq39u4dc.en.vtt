think about Jesus because I'm a
Christian<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.439> think<00:01:34.680> about<00:01:34.920> how<00:01:35.340> Jesus

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
Christian and I think about how Jesus

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.940 
Christian and I think about how Jesus
dealt<00:01:36.479> with<00:01:36.689> authority<00:01:37.229> particularly<00:01:37.770> people

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
dealt with authority particularly people

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.060 
dealt with authority particularly people
in<00:01:38.189> power<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.850> he<00:01:39.420> knew<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.930> they<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:41.040> know

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
in power and he knew that they you know

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.740 
in power and he knew that they you know
there<00:01:41.250> was<00:01:41.340> nothing<00:01:41.640> invested<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.270> them<00:01:42.479> to

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
there was nothing invested in them to

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.749 
there was nothing invested in them to
talk<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> little<00:01:43.619> guy<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.310> guy<00:01:44.700> who

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
talk to the little guy the guy who

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.670 
talk to the little guy the guy who
didn't<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> power<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.380> when<00:01:46.530> Jesus

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
didn't have the power and so when Jesus

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.090 
didn't have the power and so when Jesus
dealt<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:47.820> authority<00:01:48.450> he<00:01:49.140> often<00:01:49.439> did<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.979> in

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
dealt with authority he often did it in

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.330 
dealt with authority he often did it in
a<00:01:50.189> very<00:01:50.220> public<00:01:50.670> way<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.960> fairly<00:01:52.340> theatrical

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
a very public way in a fairly theatrical

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.819 
a very public way in a fairly theatrical
way<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.729> think<00:01:53.939> about<00:01:54.149> how<00:01:54.509> Jesus<00:01:55.020> went<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.619> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
way I think about how Jesus went in and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.800 
way I think about how Jesus went in and
turned<00:01:56.100> over<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.520> money<00:01:56.759> tape<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.390> money

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
turned over the money tape the money

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.260 
turned over the money tape the money
changers<00:01:57.899> tables<00:01:59.030> actually<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> really

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
changers tables actually a really

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.410 
changers tables actually a really
violent<00:02:00.869> act<00:02:01.469> I'm<00:02:01.950> much<00:02:02.790> more<00:02:02.969> violent<00:02:03.180> than

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
violent act I'm much more violent than

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.139 
violent act I'm much more violent than
anything<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.869> would<00:02:04.020> ever<00:02:04.170> do<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:05.490> guess<00:02:06.030> he

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
anything I would ever do and I guess he

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.429 
anything I would ever do and I guess he
could<00:02:06.329> have<00:02:06.360> seen<00:02:06.659> about<00:02:06.869> setting<00:02:07.259> up<00:02:07.320> a

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
could have seen about setting up a

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.749 
could have seen about setting up a
meeting<00:02:07.469> with<00:02:07.829> one<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.580> head

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
to talk and really feeling uncomfortable

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
to talk and really feeling uncomfortable
about<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.690> whole<00:02:12.870> money

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290

Lord but he had a lot of messages to say

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.789 
Lord but he had a lot of messages to say
to<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.299> lot<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.540> different<00:02:18.689> people<00:02:19.109> and<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.650> he

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
to a lot of different people and so he

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.830

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
wouldn't have had and perhaps it's the
