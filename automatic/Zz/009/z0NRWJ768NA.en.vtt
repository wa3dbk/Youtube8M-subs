ones they'll actually even help incubate
so<00:01:51.090> they<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.630> learn<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.899> behavior<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
so they have to learn that behavior and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.370 
so they have to learn that behavior and
then<00:01:53.939> once<00:01:54.119> they're<00:01:54.329> four<00:01:54.570> years<00:01:54.600> old<00:01:55.020> then

then once they're four years old then

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.530 
then once they're four years old then
they'll<00:01:55.560> strike<00:01:55.950> out<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.430> they'll<00:01:56.969> go<00:01:57.180> ahead

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
they'll strike out in they'll go ahead

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.109 
they'll strike out in they'll go ahead

and find their own territory so that's

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.179 
and find their own territory so that's
kind<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.509> learned<00:02:00.750> behavior<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.409> them<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.770> one

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
kind of a learned behavior on them a one

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.649 
kind of a learned behavior on them a one
other<00:02:02.340> thing<00:02:02.549> with<00:02:02.640> these<00:02:02.790> giant<00:02:03.000> kingfishers
