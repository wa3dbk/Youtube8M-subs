this unit you can see here just barely
mounts<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:18.850> actual<00:01:19.240> top<00:01:19.630> of<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.960> tank<00:01:20.259> and

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
mounts to the actual top of the tank and

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:21.899 
mounts to the actual top of the tank and
puts<00:01:21.040> it<00:01:21.159> in<00:01:21.310> place

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
puts it in place

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.120 
puts it in place
so<00:01:22.300> this<00:01:23.080> in-line<00:01:23.920> barrel<00:01:24.760> topper<00:01:26.130> downspout

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
so this in-line barrel topper downspout

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.540

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
to pre-filter on top of the barrel this

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.450 
to pre-filter on top of the barrel this
is<00:01:37.780> also<00:01:38.020> a<00:01:38.170> good<00:01:38.409> unit<00:01:38.770> to<00:01:38.920> use<00:01:39.130> on<00:01:39.340> those

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
is also a good unit to use on those
