 part of the portfolio to represent the center-west of Brazil was 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:16.679
 It has one million and three hundred thousand inhabitants 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.630
 the delegate adriana the year before 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.599

 tonight 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.269
 will bring many surprises first of course 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.819
 A good night for everyone 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:30.669
 like in the whole city here in goiânia 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.909
 We were also the best and worst school in the area but when we 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:36.970
 schools were surprised 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.540
 You'll know why. 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.830
 what injuries do we take from these dams? 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.080
 because this search for a broken cable 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.930
 what are the elements of these surprises to know because you are awaiting 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.629
 we made the support of our daughter from here in goiânia 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.629
 tv the ii war let's go to the report 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.450
 the playtime 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.450
 but so far that organization and discipline 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.800
 at the other school time when he left math class 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.460
 our work process 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.650
 announced as of the endangered fund others about 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.790
 and corn recorded stocks 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.360
 the other is simpler I made some poor neighborhoods 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.109
 but that's where it lands. 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:21.860
 all the prejudices 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.539
 was the poor neighborhood school that got 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.539
 the highest average of all visited by us so far 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.830
 seven comma 1 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.980
 to tell this incredible story by Brazilian standards I try oars 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.100
 in 1820 kilometers 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.759
 from fortaleza to goiânia were two hours and 25 minutes of travel 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.200
 The day dawned when we arrived at the school that has the lowest grade in the capital of 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.440
 goias 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.890
 all visited by jn british in the air 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.420
 the promoters to our surprise is a school with good looks 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.500
 large installations 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.080
 apparently there were no floods 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.830
 which does not differentiate from other schools to be of quality disliked by 11 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.330
 buildings we have apparatus 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.310
 not even a little 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.610
 classrooms 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.119
 installations 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.159
 seemingly quality in what happens here the director has a 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:18.169
 explanation she receives students from other schools supposedly would have to pick up 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.070
 these children are more or less affected by the disease 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.450
 recognizing the letters recognized words and this is not what happens in the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.449
 truth 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.760
 for these kids to own school goal 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.659
 a period to study reinforcements 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.939
 and what is happening now in a room of the teacher gisele isaacs graduated in 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.399
 pedagogy and with salary of one thousand and six hundred reais 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:40.449
 a child who is already in the fourth year nine years old 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:44.579
 It arrives for us unfortunately I could not test people have to do what was 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.519
 prepared by presentation day and try to put it your grouping the 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.849
 ideal for field control 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.320
 education expert gustavo ioschpe 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.279
 I want to understand how reinforcement is 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:03:01.329
 we do a could to listen to the students he asks about duty class time 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.299
 From home 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.480
 has a culture of acceptance of failure and of pushing with the belly 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.209
 people notice that the school does not have an indignation 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.709
 is not concerned with solving this problem that is crucial to our 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:13.600
 dissuasion 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.680
 at the right age 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.149
 this generates that in this plan 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:20.690
 the shambles damaging the target of the repsol protest 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.580
 He has a degree in mathematics. 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.360
 the psb one thousand and 600 reais per month 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.019
 nor at the time of the interview 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.269
 the class calmed down with the curacy of Emmanuel Moreira in command 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.870
 shows the amount increases the risk of some crime 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:38.889
 commitment to parents at home - who have no commitment to education at 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:43.019
 epidemic just to mess you up you carry sterling silver drinks that glasses 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.229
 and delicate clothes fascinates in our 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:47.699
 in our area 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.759
 to her 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:51.719
 the demand for the cup of italy 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.340
 if subject and discipline 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.379
 Let's hear what the headmistress of the school says that has the best grade in the region. 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.769
 an average equal to deputed schools from developed countries 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.689
 but to work but with the heat storms in the 10,000 companies 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:05.990
 work with the child 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.990
 the storm has to learn from the load 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.329
 a typical case of good management 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.329
 the director took over at the age of eight at a critical time 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.309
 the city hall even thought to close the unit because it had few students and the 

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:21.769
 unfavorable results 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.539
 how she turned the game let's see in practice what happens here 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.630
 the facilities are good 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.210
 but nothing exceptional 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.340
 in classes the reason for the success mariza is formed in pedagogy the salary of a thousand and 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.319
 hundred reais blend concentration many travel in result 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.930
 nine-year-olds with fluent reading 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:52.309
 at the time of turning the chalkboard was accounting for three digits 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.889
 everybody wants 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:04.940
 I realized that if I get excited 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.690
 An example of this is always so good, so it's always fantastic to 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.880
 people here really have a director that they as the heroine of education 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.529
 Brazilian 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:16.089
 a professional who took over this school eight years she was almost closing 

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:20.149
 with 67 students and since then has been struggling to become a school but 

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:23.209
 level of the first world which is what she achieved today what is the secret of this 

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:24.439
 change in school 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:25.930
 commitment 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.639
 the word bought to use 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.180
 compromising all the professionals who transport committed to doing 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.870
 every year ago 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.360
 we can 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.169
 we do not have time to wait for the student to learn 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.099
 we have to teach 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:42.419
 to all students and other students who arrive here 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.370
 I leave with possibilities of life 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.750
 the biggest peaks and that dreamed this school is really fantastic a 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.900
 example was arrested 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.300
 the raw material works 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.529
 in politics 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.449
 did not agree to the purchase as the product counted
