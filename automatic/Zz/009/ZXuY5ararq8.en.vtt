00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
extended periods of use it might have

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.199 
extended periods of use it might have
some<00:02:46.580> hot<00:02:46.730> spots<00:02:46.970> in<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.480> hand<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.910> really

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
some hot spots in the hand and I really

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.820 
some hot spots in the hand and I really
haven't<00:02:50.360> used<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.840> a<00:02:50.900> whole<00:02:51.080> lot<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.560> can't

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
haven't used it a whole lot so I can't

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.589 
haven't used it a whole lot so I can't
really<00:02:52.010> speak<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.400> that<00:02:52.549> but<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:55.209> guess<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.390> could

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
really speak to that but I guess I could

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.940 
really speak to that but I guess I could
I<00:02:56.780> could<00:02:56.870> stand<00:02:57.260> those<00:02:57.500> down<00:02:57.709> if<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:58.040> wanted<00:02:58.370> to

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
I could stand those down if I wanted to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.720 
I could stand those down if I wanted to
but<00:03:02.230> overall<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:03.500> seems<00:03:03.709> like<00:03:04.099> really<00:03:04.430> really

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
but overall it seems like really really

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.970 
but overall it seems like really really
well-made<00:03:05.239> knife<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:06.440> look<00:03:06.620> forward<00:03:06.830> to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
well-made knife and look forward to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.949 
well-made knife and look forward to
using<00:03:07.099> that<00:03:07.310> more<00:03:08.680> next<00:03:09.680> we<00:03:09.830> have<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.069> tops

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
using that more next we have the tops

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.750 
using that more next we have the tops

large but I got a good deal at it last

large but I got a good deal at it last
last<00:03:24.859> year's<00:03:25.160> blades<00:03:25.459> show<00:03:25.940> so<00:03:26.239> I<00:03:26.299> thought<00:03:26.780> I'd

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
last year's blades show so I thought I'd

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.180 
last year's blades show so I thought I'd
try<00:03:27.380> it<00:03:27.650> out<00:03:27.799> and<00:03:27.829> see<00:03:28.040> how<00:03:28.310> it<00:03:28.489> works<00:03:29.120> outside

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
try it out and see how it works outside

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.620

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
quite a bit and have not had any

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.490 
quite a bit and have not had any
problems<00:03:50.540> at<00:03:50.630> all<00:03:50.720> with<00:03:50.780> this<00:03:50.989> knife<00:03:51.200> it's<00:03:51.440> a

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
problems at all with this knife it's a

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.879 
problems at all with this knife it's a
great<00:03:51.709> knife<00:03:52.269> it's<00:03:53.269> not<00:03:53.510> as<00:03:53.989> thick<00:03:54.859> as<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:58.120> the

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
great knife it's not as thick as the the

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.670 
great knife it's not as thick as the the
111<00:04:00.889> a<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.760> it's<00:04:02.239> actually<00:04:02.450> i<00:04:02.720> think<00:04:03.350> this

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
111 a so it's actually i think this

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.309 
111 a so it's actually i think this
knife<00:04:03.889> is<00:04:03.920> actually<00:04:04.430> lighter<00:04:04.730> even<00:04:05.269> though<00:04:05.480> it

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
knife is actually lighter even though it

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.500 
knife is actually lighter even though it
looks<00:04:07.040> like<00:04:07.400> a<00:04:07.430> larger<00:04:07.880> knife<00:04:08.060> but<00:04:08.389> it's

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
looks like a larger knife but it's

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.230 
looks like a larger knife but it's
actually<00:04:08.690> lighter<00:04:09.139> than<00:04:09.440> the

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
actually lighter than the

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.800 
actually lighter than the
111<00:04:11.240> a<00:04:12.580> great<00:04:13.580> knife<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:14.300> handle<00:04:14.720> is

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
111 a great knife the handle is

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.470 
111 a great knife the handle is
extremely<00:04:15.530> large<00:04:15.770> and<00:04:16.310> I<00:04:16.820> don't<00:04:17.000> have<00:04:17.150> the

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480

largest hands but I've had no problem

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.710 
largest hands but I've had no problem

on here to help out but really haven't

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.990

had<00:04:27.140> any<00:04:27.350> any<00:04:27.740> problem<00:04:28.220> using<00:04:28.400> this<00:04:28.580> knife<00:04:28.790> at

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
had any any problem using this knife at

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.240 
had any any problem using this knife at
all<00:04:29.120> and<00:04:29.780> have<00:04:30.230> the<00:04:30.350> time<00:04:30.500> with<00:04:30.830> it<00:04:30.980> chopped

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
all and have the time with it chopped

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.780 
all and have the time with it chopped
with<00:04:31.490> it<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:31.940> just<00:04:32.750> overall<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:33.140> great<00:04:33.320> knife

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
with it and just overall a great knife

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.010 
with it and just overall a great knife
it'd<00:04:34.790> be<00:04:34.940> really<00:04:35.120> hard<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:35.450> pick<00:04:35.720> a<00:04:35.750> favorite

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
it'd be really hard to pick a favorite

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.280 
it'd be really hard to pick a favorite
here<00:04:36.980> but<00:04:37.760> if<00:04:38.030> i<00:04:38.150> had<00:04:38.390> to<00:04:38.660> i<00:04:38.960> would<00:04:39.020> actually

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
here but if i had to i would actually

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.580 
here but if i had to i would actually
probably<00:04:39.710> pick<00:04:40.100> the<00:04:40.250> BK<00:04:40.610> 2<00:04:40.930> just<00:04:41.930> because<00:04:42.230> it's

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
probably pick the BK 2 just because it's

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.050 
probably pick the BK 2 just because it's
it's<00:04:42.919> a<00:04:43.040> more<00:04:43.810> it's<00:04:44.810> not<00:04:44.960> overly<00:04:45.380> large<00:04:46.190> and<00:04:47.169> so

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
it's a more it's not overly large and so

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.240 
it's a more it's not overly large and so
it's<00:04:50.060> and<00:04:50.510> it's<00:04:50.720> thick<00:04:50.990> enough<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.350> do<00:04:51.770> the

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
it's and it's thick enough to do the

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.909 
it's and it's thick enough to do the
Patani<00:04:52.580> task<00:04:53.390> that<00:04:54.080> i<00:04:54.200> would<00:04:54.950> use<00:04:55.160> it<00:04:55.340> for<00:04:55.690> I

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
Patani task that i would use it for I

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.710 
Patani task that i would use it for I
you<00:04:57.919> might<00:04:58.100> be<00:04:58.250> limited<00:04:58.700> into<00:04:59.030> into<00:04:59.390> the<00:04:59.480> width

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
you might be limited into into the width

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.390 
you might be limited into into the width
the<00:04:59.990> wood<00:05:00.140> that<00:05:00.320> you<00:05:00.410> can<00:05:00.530> process<00:05:00.800> with<00:05:01.220> this

the wood that you can process with this

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
but this will actually because because

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.750 
but this will actually because because
you<00:05:05.030> can<00:05:05.210> pound<00:05:05.450> it<00:05:05.600> through<00:05:05.960> wood<00:05:06.860> and

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
you can pound it through wood and

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.930 
you can pound it through wood and
because<00:05:08.000> it<00:05:08.120> is<00:05:08.150> so<00:05:08.480> thick<00:05:09.340> this<00:05:10.340> this<00:05:10.760> will

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
because it is so thick this this will

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.820 
because it is so thick this this will
actually<00:05:11.090> process<00:05:11.750> pretty<00:05:12.020> thick<00:05:12.290> pieces<00:05:12.530> of

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
actually process pretty thick pieces of

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.460 
actually process pretty thick pieces of
wood<00:05:12.980> because<00:05:13.820> it<00:05:13.940> is<00:05:14.060> so<00:05:14.300> thick<00:05:15.050> it's<00:05:15.290> like<00:05:15.440> a

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
wood because it is so thick it's like a

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.159 
wood because it is so thick it's like a
wedge<00:05:15.770> so<00:05:16.430> I<00:05:16.460> have<00:05:16.970> to<00:05:17.150> say<00:05:17.300> this<00:05:17.510> is<00:05:17.690> probably

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
wedge so I have to say this is probably

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.450 
wedge so I have to say this is probably
my<00:05:18.590> number<00:05:18.620> one<00:05:19.390> go-to<00:05:20.770> and<00:05:21.770> I<00:05:21.860> have<00:05:22.040> used<00:05:22.310> this

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
my number one go-to and I have used this

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.800 
my number one go-to and I have used this
quite<00:05:22.700> a<00:05:22.729> bit<00:05:22.820> although<00:05:23.120> I've<00:05:23.330> cleaned<00:05:23.630> this

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
quite a bit although I've cleaned this

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.530 
quite a bit although I've cleaned this
knife<00:05:24.050> and<00:05:24.760> you<00:05:25.760> can't<00:05:25.970> hardly<00:05:26.180> tell<00:05:26.360> i've

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
knife and you can't hardly tell i've

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.670 
knife and you can't hardly tell i've
used<00:05:26.780> it<00:05:27.020> but<00:05:27.169> i<00:05:27.229> have<00:05:27.440> used<00:05:27.680> it<00:05:27.890> quite<00:05:28.040> a<00:05:28.100> bit

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
used it but i have used it quite a bit

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.030 
used it but i have used it quite a bit
and<00:05:31.060> and<00:05:32.060> then<00:05:32.270> i<00:05:32.510> guess<00:05:33.200> i'd<00:05:33.350> have<00:05:33.380> to<00:05:33.620> say<00:05:33.890> the

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
and and then i guess i'd have to say the

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.890 
and and then i guess i'd have to say the
art<00:05:34.190> tattoo<00:05:34.580> is<00:05:34.760> probably<00:05:35.060> my<00:05:35.180> next<00:05:35.450> favorite

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
art tattoo is probably my next favorite

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.540 
art tattoo is probably my next favorite
just<00:05:36.590> because<00:05:36.620> i<00:05:36.860> have<00:05:36.950> the<00:05:37.220> most<00:05:37.370> experience

just because i have the most experience
with<00:05:38.030> it<00:05:38.330> and<00:05:38.800> it's<00:05:39.800> never<00:05:39.979> let<00:05:40.220> me<00:05:40.310> down<00:05:40.840> i
