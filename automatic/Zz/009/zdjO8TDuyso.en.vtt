00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.900
 today is here in anime fight stark a 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.699
 map that mixes several characters from 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.189
 Animes for you, he's fighting 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.529

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.869
 so much of friends to be able to fight and let's go 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.360
 there that version 2.4 of the map I do not know if 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.770
 when they see this video is another 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.129
 version but this version will have the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.930
 description or select a level 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.219
 I put the first ac that should be the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:49.440
 level the isi nÃ© 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:51.510
 and here I come, finding there 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.520
 top must be people who have created maps 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.350
 people who have credit then just got the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:05.040
 image even with her so decided 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:06.510
 put the background has the various character 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.380
 animals one thing I did not like this 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:15.360
 thing that shining same mold let's 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:23.340
 choose a character they can not see 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:27.570
 that has the character several animals nor 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:35.840
 I know this idea is that I have never seen it 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.840
 Let's get a nice group, my dear. 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.150
 character 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.340
 there he come here without clicking in the name of 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.320
 down until the other character I 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.320
 putting ne and artificial intelligence 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.150
 played a game of martelly hart no 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:06.500
 in realengo knew that there I do not know if 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.149
 it was this map but it has a map that had 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.229
 Darling is the same 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:15.020
 You can see that they 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:17.810
 added anime audio in the game 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.770
 This is very cool, although this is 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.230
 problem and that of background music that 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:29.150
 For nothing, but it was very interesting. 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:33.590
 I think the first map thus solved 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.299
 the cry of the cry there we will try 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.910
 delete this quick face I never 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:45.580
 I came to determine this affection that 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:45.580
 I always played with someone else in the city. 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:03:05.380
 The problem is that ritthammer does not kill 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.380
 my son 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:14.180
 if you do not want to listen to music and 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:19.670
 20 health options and decrease the sound of 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:23.870
 music but I think I 'll just stay in 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:29.260
 then listened often 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.260
 closing up being embarrassing to hit him 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.570
 york does not die to leave the team 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:45.940
 confused 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:50.340
 just ask about the fourth phase there 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.340
 nathan apple 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.280
 after it ends so far, no 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.020
 I do not know if it will back up 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.100
 on something with my team 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:08.890
 main or here for me to win 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:11.710
 I do not know, let's see the palms and 21 in 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.390
 basically the template is the map mode is this 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.940
 If I like the video, I'll leave it online. 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:20.799
 very simple video is a game in this frame 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:23.050
 but 45 times only so one is not 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.200
 I know a lot about an act but how I found it 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.190
 interesting and decided and recorded as I 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.280
 said it's the only thing I did not like 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:35.590
 even it was that part of the mouse 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.370
 shining thought vanished whatever bright 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.990
 too much tiring cable is also and 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.250
 You liked the video, it leaves a liquid. 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.470
 are favorites not yet registered 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.360
 in the end is sign up to follow 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.360
 the new videos and went
