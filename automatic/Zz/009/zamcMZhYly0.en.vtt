some shooting with both of these and
with<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> smaller<00:02:02.040> bore<00:02:02.280> sizes<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.790> thing<00:02:02.939> is

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
with a smaller bore sizes this thing is

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.550 
with a smaller bore sizes this thing is
absolutely<00:02:03.240> amazing<00:02:03.630> now<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:06.320> wouldn't<00:02:07.320> say

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
absolutely amazing now I wouldn't say

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.960 
absolutely amazing now I wouldn't say
that<00:02:07.590> there<00:02:07.979> are<00:02:08.099> amazing<00:02:08.700> improvement

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
that there are amazing improvement

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.699 
that there are amazing improvement
between<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.599> two<00:02:09.750> stock<00:02:09.989> barrels<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> dye

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
between the two stock barrels of the dye

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.030 
between the two stock barrels of the dye
ultra<00:02:11.069> light<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.790> shaft<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.330> but<00:02:13.290> then

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
ultra light and the shaft for but then

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.220 
ultra light and the shaft for but then
you<00:02:14.189> could<00:02:14.340> see<00:02:14.489> in<00:02:14.549> an<00:02:15.230> in-flight

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
you could see in an in-flight

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.959 
you could see in an in-flight
improvement<00:02:16.829> it<00:02:17.159> cuts<00:02:17.400> down<00:02:17.579> on<00:02:17.760> weight

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:17.969 
improvement it cuts down on weight

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.990 
improvement it cuts down on weight
mostly<00:02:18.209> yeah<00:02:18.750> I'm<00:02:19.019> mainly<00:02:19.469> a<00:02:19.620> week<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.099> mean<00:02:20.549> for

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
mostly yeah I'm mainly a week I mean for

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.640 
mostly yeah I'm mainly a week I mean for
me<00:02:21.030> it's<00:02:21.299> a<00:02:21.390> slight<00:02:21.719> adjustment<00:02:22.290> because<00:02:22.409> I'm

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
me it's a slight adjustment because I'm

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.459 
me it's a slight adjustment because I'm
used<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.040> being<00:02:23.430> just<00:02:23.519> a<00:02:23.819> little<00:02:24.060> bit<00:02:24.180> longer

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.469 
used to being just a little bit longer

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:28.039 
used to being just a little bit longer
but<00:02:25.469> it's<00:02:25.769> minuscule<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:27.209> like<00:02:27.359> one<00:02:27.750> problem

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
but it's minuscule it's like one problem

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.289 
but it's minuscule it's like one problem
between<00:02:28.349> these<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.579> the<00:02:29.670> metal<00:02:29.939> free<00:02:30.150> though

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
between these in the metal free though

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.500 
between these in the metal free though
since<00:02:30.659> they<00:02:30.840> are<00:02:31.079> a<00:02:31.109> little<00:02:31.439> thinner<00:02:32.510> compared

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
since they are a little thinner compared

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.720 
since they are a little thinner compared
in<00:02:33.629> comparison<00:02:34.290> if<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:34.799> look<00:02:35.010> really<00:02:35.310> close

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
in comparison if you look really close

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.300 
in comparison if you look really close
on<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.840> one<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.290> can<00:02:37.319> see<00:02:37.439> that<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.099> will

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
on this one you can see that it will

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.129 
on this one you can see that it will
chip<00:02:38.640> on<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.970> end<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.299> stuff<00:02:39.569> like<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:39.810> it's

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
chip on the end and stuff like that it's

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.319 
chip on the end and stuff like that it's
not<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.319> big<00:02:40.560> deal<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:41.040> if<00:02:41.639> you're<00:02:41.849> going<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.150> be

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
not a big deal but if you're going to be

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.360 
not a big deal but if you're going to be
beating<00:02:42.689> up<00:02:42.840> on<00:02:42.989> your<00:02:43.139> barrels<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:44.310> either

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
beating up on your barrels you either

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.800 
beating up on your barrels you either
want<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.760> go<00:02:44.879> with<00:02:45.060> one<00:02:45.269> of<00:02:45.359> these<00:02:45.450> aluminum

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
want to go with one of these aluminum

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.080 
want to go with one of these aluminum
ones<00:02:46.230> or<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:47.189> metal<00:02:47.430> for<00:02:47.609> you<00:02:47.700> because<00:02:47.879> it's<00:02:48.030> a

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
ones or the metal for you because it's a

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.170 
ones or the metal for you because it's a
little<00:02:48.359> thicker<00:02:48.599> mm-hmm<00:02:49.379> I<00:02:49.530> mean<00:02:50.340> again<00:02:50.730> the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
little thicker mm-hmm I mean again the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.690 
little thicker mm-hmm I mean again the

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
downside about these Carly's to carbon

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.319 
downside about these Carly's to carbon
fiber<00:02:53.879> ones<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.680> they<00:02:55.680> are<00:02:55.709> one<00:02:56.099> piece<00:02:56.400> which

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
fiber ones is they are one piece which

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.240 
fiber ones is they are one piece which
in<00:02:57.689> occasion<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.590> can<00:02:58.769> be<00:02:58.919> a<00:02:58.950> big<00:02:59.159> problem

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
in occasion you can be a big problem

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
the shaft for but between the weight the

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.050 
the shaft for but between the weight the
shaft<00:03:20.220> for<00:03:20.519> chef<00:03:21.329> for<00:03:21.540> is<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:22.280> like<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.310> ton<00:03:23.669> more

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
shaft for chef for is a like a ton more

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.719 
shaft for chef for is a like a ton more
than<00:03:24.599> the<00:03:24.810> classic<00:03:24.959> it's<00:03:25.560> like<00:03:25.739> air<00:03:26.040> yeah<00:03:26.519> it's

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:26.729 
than the classic it's like air yeah it's

than the classic it's like air yeah it's
literally<00:03:27.030> like<00:03:27.239> hair<00:03:27.510> dye<00:03:28.199> ultra<00:03:28.530> light<00:03:28.680> and

literally like hair dye ultra light and

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.930 
literally like hair dye ultra light and
the<00:03:30.419> classic<00:03:30.900> very<00:03:31.799> similar<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.340> porting<00:03:32.699> on

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
the classic very similar the porting on

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.210 
the classic very similar the porting on
the<00:03:33.209> dial<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.870> light<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.229> better<00:03:34.500> than<00:03:34.949> on<00:03:35.099> the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
the dial to light is better than on the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.399 
the dial to light is better than on the
classic<00:03:35.459> i<00:03:35.879> will<00:03:36.299> say<00:03:36.479> that<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:36.959> will<00:03:37.379> have
