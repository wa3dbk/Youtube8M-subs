scientific experiment designed by Henrik
to<00:00:15.690> play<00:00:15.990> with<00:00:16.289> our<00:00:16.470> subconscious<00:00:17.250> mind<00:00:17.550> sense

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029

of<00:00:18.449> who<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.109> where<00:00:19.590> we<00:00:19.830> are<00:00:20.100> well<00:00:20.820> we<00:00:20.970> knew

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
of who and where we are well we knew

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.550 
of who and where we are well we knew
that<00:00:21.240> there's<00:00:21.390> lots<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.720> processes<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
that there's lots of processes in the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.470 
that there's lots of processes in the
brain<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.430> are<00:00:23.490> not<00:00:23.580> aware<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.910> that

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
brain that we are not aware of that

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.660 
brain that we are not aware of that
happens<00:00:24.810> at<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.080> subconscious<00:00:25.560> level<00:00:25.859> but<00:00:26.490> we

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
happens at the subconscious level but we

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.029 
happens at the subconscious level but we
try<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.880> understand<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.630> what<00:00:28.410> makes<00:00:28.740> those

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
try to understand is what makes those

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.099 
try to understand is what makes those
signals<00:00:29.099> become<00:00:29.849> part<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.510> our<00:00:30.630> conscious

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109

other for a small doll it's important
that<00:00:51.230> you<00:00:51.410> try<00:00:51.560> not<00:00:51.739> to<00:00:51.800> move<00:00:52.010> during<00:00:52.280> the

that you try not to move during the
experiment<00:00:52.970> okay<00:00:53.800> we<00:00:54.800> use<00:00:54.830> head<00:00:55.340> mounted

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
experiment okay we use head mounted

experiment okay we use head mounted
displays<00:00:56.150> that<00:00:56.480> we<00:00:56.600> connect<00:00:56.930> cameras<00:00:58.120> so<00:00:59.120> it's

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
displays that we connect cameras so it's

video camera which we can mount on the
head<00:01:06.770> of<00:01:07.010> a<00:01:07.310> mannequin<00:01:07.729> or<00:01:07.940> a<00:01:08.000> doll<00:01:08.770> so<00:01:09.770> when

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
head of a mannequin or a doll so when

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.440 
head of a mannequin or a doll so when
you<00:01:10.010> look<00:01:10.130> down<00:01:10.340> you<00:01:10.640> don't<00:01:11.090> see<00:01:11.270> your<00:01:11.390> own

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
you look down you don't see your own

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.930 
you look down you don't see your own
body<00:01:11.780> anymore<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:12.650> see<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.979> doll<00:01:13.250> from<00:01:13.850> the

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
body anymore you see the doll from the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.639 
body anymore you see the doll from the
natural<00:01:14.810> first-person<00:01:15.619> perspective<00:01:17.649> the

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
natural first-person perspective the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.120 
natural first-person perspective the
subject<00:01:19.190> feels<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.790> stroking<00:01:20.240> on<00:01:20.420> his<00:01:20.840> leg

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
subject feels the stroking on his leg

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.749 
subject feels the stroking on his leg
but<00:01:22.130> seized<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.790> stroking<00:01:23.270> on<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.960> dolls<00:01:24.200> leg

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
but seized the stroking on the dolls leg

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.910 
but seized the stroking on the dolls leg
so<00:01:25.759> his<00:01:26.000> brain<00:01:26.300> is<00:01:26.899> fooled<00:01:27.350> into<00:01:27.770> thinking

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
so his brain is fooled into thinking

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.940 
so his brain is fooled into thinking
that<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:29.210> dolls<00:01:29.630> legs<00:01:30.050> are<00:01:30.740> actually<00:01:31.160> his<00:01:32.119> own

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
that the dolls legs are actually his own

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.070 
that the dolls legs are actually his own
it<00:01:33.950> happens<00:01:34.280> then<00:01:34.430> is<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.610> brain<00:01:34.759> yes<00:01:35.360> fuses

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
it happens then is the brain yes fuses

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.139 
it happens then is the brain yes fuses
what<00:01:36.229> you<00:01:36.320> see<00:01:36.500> in<00:01:36.590> what<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:36.860> feel<00:01:36.890> um

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
what you see in what you feel um

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:39.760 
what you see in what you feel um
boom<00:01:38.570> you<00:01:38.899> feel<00:01:39.140> like<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.410> doll<00:01:39.590> or<00:01:39.740> the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
boom you feel like the doll or the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.820 
boom you feel like the doll or the
mannequin<00:01:40.420> but<00:01:41.420> we<00:01:41.540> think<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.960> brain<00:01:42.170> creates

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
mannequin but we think the brain creates

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.870 
mannequin but we think the brain creates
like<00:01:43.580> an<00:01:43.759> internal<00:01:44.319> model<00:01:45.319> of<00:01:45.500> your<00:01:46.160> own<00:01:46.399> body

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
like an internal model of your own body

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.719 
like an internal model of your own body
and<00:01:47.330> we<00:01:48.110> think<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.380> brain<00:01:48.560> does<00:01:48.830> that<00:01:49.069> by

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
and we think the brain does that by

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.120 
and we think the brain does that by
integrating<00:01:50.240> all<00:01:51.140> available<00:01:51.619> information

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
integrating all available information

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.219 
integrating all available information
from<00:01:52.670> all<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.060> senses<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:53.630> be<00:01:53.780> part<00:01:54.110> of

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
from all the senses and be part of

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.169 
from all the senses and be part of
making<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.590> decision<00:01:55.069> that<00:01:55.399> this<00:01:55.520> is<00:01:55.670> me<00:01:55.880> or

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
making that decision that this is me or

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.199 
making that decision that this is me or
this<00:01:56.330> is<00:01:56.509> not<00:01:56.660> me<00:01:57.220> having<00:01:58.220> tricked<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.970> brain

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
this is not me having tricked the brain

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:02.650 
this is not me having tricked the brain
into<00:01:59.720> a<00:01:59.750> false<00:02:00.140> reality<00:02:01.090> Henrik<00:02:02.090> can<00:02:02.450> now

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
into a false reality Henrik can now

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.320 
into a false reality Henrik can now
tweak<00:02:03.080> that<00:02:03.410> reality<00:02:03.830> and<00:02:04.280> reveal<00:02:04.880> how

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
tweak that reality and reveal how

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.749 
tweak that reality and reveal how
powerful<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:06.619> subconscious<00:02:07.270> actually<00:02:08.270> is

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
powerful the subconscious actually is

have the same reaction when the illusion
is<00:02:29.180> repeated<00:02:29.720> his<00:02:30.650> conscious<00:02:31.280> experience

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
is repeated his conscious experience

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.080 
is repeated his conscious experience
cannot<00:02:32.900> override<00:02:33.560> his<00:02:34.220> subconscious

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
cannot override his subconscious

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.050 
cannot override his subconscious
reaction<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:36.709> can<00:02:36.920> think<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.310> away<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:37.880> know

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
reaction you can think it away you know

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.660 
reaction you can think it away you know
it's<00:02:38.090> just<00:02:38.540> an<00:02:38.959> experiment<00:02:39.319> but<00:02:40.280> you<00:02:40.400> can't

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
it's just an experiment but you can't

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.780 
it's just an experiment but you can't
help<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:41.180> bodily<00:02:41.510> feeling<00:02:41.930> up

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
help that bodily feeling up

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.780 
help that bodily feeling up
because<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.870> feel<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:44.650> doll<00:02:45.040> is<00:02:45.340> you

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
because you feel that this doll is you

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.390 
because you feel that this doll is you
so<00:02:46.150> your<00:02:46.300> brain<00:02:46.750> just<00:02:46.810> reacts<00:02:47.650> in<00:02:48.159> a<00:02:48.220> very

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
so your brain just reacts in a very

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.390 
so your brain just reacts in a very
basic<00:02:49.030> way<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.690> that<00:02:49.840> signal<00:02:50.440> this<00:02:50.769> reaction

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
basic way and that signal this reaction

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.280 
basic way and that signal this reaction
is<00:02:51.489> what<00:02:51.819> be<00:02:52.120> measuring<00:02:52.659> to<00:02:52.840> really<00:02:53.019> prove

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
is what be measuring to really prove

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.709 
is what be measuring to really prove
that<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.590> illusion
