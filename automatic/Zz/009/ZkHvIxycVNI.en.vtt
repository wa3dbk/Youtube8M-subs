00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
all right let's talk about some foot and

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.450 
all right let's talk about some foot and
hand<00:00:03.419> techniques<00:00:03.990> we'll<00:00:04.770> start<00:00:05.009> off<00:00:05.100> with<00:00:05.339> the

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
hand techniques we'll start off with the

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.990 
hand techniques we'll start off with the
feet<00:00:06.470> now<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:08.010> setup<00:00:08.189> I<00:00:08.370> have<00:00:08.400> right<00:00:08.670> here<00:00:08.849> is

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
feet now the setup I have right here is

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.030 
feet now the setup I have right here is
pretty<00:00:09.269> similar<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.719> setup<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.080> have<00:00:10.110> with

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
pretty similar to the setup I have with

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.930 
pretty similar to the setup I have with
my<00:00:11.280> acoustic<00:00:11.610> acoustic<00:00:12.509> kit<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.769> bass<00:00:14.639> drums

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
my acoustic acoustic kit the bass drums

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.000 
my acoustic acoustic kit the bass drums
are<00:00:15.179> moved<00:00:15.599> forward<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.170> little<00:00:16.289> bit<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.920> I'll

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
are moved forward a little bit and I'll

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.390 
are moved forward a little bit and I'll
explain<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.580> why<00:00:18.710> you'll<00:00:19.710> notice<00:00:19.980> also<00:00:20.250> my

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
explain to you why you'll notice also my

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.109 
explain to you why you'll notice also my
stool<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.990> a<00:00:21.990> certain<00:00:22.769> height<00:00:22.949> where<00:00:23.699> I'm<00:00:23.910> not

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
stool is a certain height where I'm not

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.849 
stool is a certain height where I'm not
my<00:00:24.510> legs<00:00:24.750> aren't<00:00:24.900> completely<00:00:25.260> flat<00:00:25.619> they're<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
my legs aren't completely flat they're a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.859 
my legs aren't completely flat they're a
bit<00:00:26.039> angled<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.550> what's<00:00:27.090> very<00:00:27.150> important<00:00:27.779> is

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
bit angled and what's very important is

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.009 
bit angled and what's very important is
that<00:00:27.930> my<00:00:28.380> leg<00:00:28.859> itself<00:00:29.220> from<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> knee<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.539> not

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
that my leg itself from the knee is not

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.130 
that my leg itself from the knee is not
at<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.230> 90<00:00:31.500> degree<00:00:31.560> angle<00:00:31.940> it's<00:00:32.940> it's<00:00:33.750> moved<00:00:33.989> up

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
at a 90 degree angle it's it's moved up

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.530 
at a 90 degree angle it's it's moved up
forward<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.770> little<00:00:35.010> bit<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:36.059> reason<00:00:36.390> is

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
forward a little bit and the reason is

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.590 
forward a little bit and the reason is
when<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> do<00:00:37.110> fast<00:00:37.680> double<00:00:38.040> bass<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.520> even<00:00:39.360> slow

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
when I do fast double bass and even slow

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.780 
when I do fast double bass and even slow
double<00:00:39.930> bass<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.290> don't<00:00:40.469> want<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.739> be<00:00:40.890> hitting

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
double bass I don't want to be hitting

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.940 
double bass I don't want to be hitting
underneath<00:00:42.510> me<00:00:42.809> because<00:00:43.170> what<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.350> does<00:00:43.469> is

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
underneath me because what that does is

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.700 
underneath me because what that does is
it<00:00:44.280> sets<00:00:44.489> me<00:00:44.670> off<00:00:44.700> balance<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:46.110> move<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.379> leg

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
it sets me off balance so I move the leg

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.830 
it sets me off balance so I move the leg
up<00:00:46.980> sorry<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.850> move<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> bass<00:00:48.300> drums<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:48.719> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
up sorry I move the bass drums up a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.340 
up sorry I move the bass drums up a
little<00:00:48.989> bit

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
little bit

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.630 
little bit
to<00:00:49.710> create<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.850> kind<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.559> angle<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:53.520> you

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
to create this kind of angle that you

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.770 
to create this kind of angle that you
see<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:53.940> my<00:00:54.059> leg<00:00:54.239> right<00:00:54.750> now<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.850> technique

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
see with my leg right now the technique

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.279 
see with my leg right now the technique
I<00:00:57.960> use<00:00:58.199> when<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.739> play<00:00:59.100> slower<00:00:59.730> stuff<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.960> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
I use when I play slower stuff is a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.650 
I use when I play slower stuff is a
technique<00:01:02.100> where<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.340> just<00:01:02.399> lift<00:01:02.730> off<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.390> ball

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
technique where I just lift off the ball

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.310 
technique where I just lift off the ball
of<00:01:03.809> my<00:01:03.989> foot<00:01:04.549> and<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.760> come<00:01:05.939> back<00:01:06.119> down<00:01:09.260> sort<00:01:10.260> of

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
of my foot and I come back down sort of

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.260 
of my foot and I come back down sort of
squashing<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.979> pedal<00:01:11.280> if<00:01:11.880> you'll<00:01:12.060> notice

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
squashing the pedal if you'll notice

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.880 
squashing the pedal if you'll notice
though<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> ball<00:01:12.810> my<00:01:13.049> foot<00:01:13.320> doesn't<00:01:13.740> leave

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
though the ball my foot doesn't leave

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:24.770 
though the ball my foot doesn't leave
the<00:01:14.880> pedal<00:01:15.360> board<00:01:23.150> this<00:01:24.150> gives<00:01:24.420> me<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> power

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
the pedal board this gives me the power

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.320 
the pedal board this gives me the power
that<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.170> need<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:26.070> stability<00:01:26.250> as<00:01:26.610> well<00:01:26.820> if

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
that I need and the stability as well if

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.969 
that I need and the stability as well if
I<00:01:27.540> use<00:01:27.570> both<00:01:27.990> feet<00:01:28.320> I'll<00:01:28.500> show<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.799> just<00:01:28.829> a

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
I use both feet I'll show you just a

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:39.249 
I use both feet I'll show you just a
little<00:01:29.189> beat<00:01:29.400> doing<00:01:30.030> this

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.330 

it's<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.320> movement<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.829> flows<00:01:41.039> really<00:01:41.250> well

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
it's a movement that flows really well

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.309 
it's a movement that flows really well
and<00:01:41.640> gives<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> power<00:01:42.149> I<00:01:42.299> need<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
and gives you the power I need the

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.099 
and gives you the power I need the
technique<00:01:43.679> I<00:01:43.770> use<00:01:43.950> when<00:01:44.219> I<00:01:44.250> play<00:01:44.929> faster<00:01:45.929> a

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
technique I use when I play faster a

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.160 
technique I use when I play faster a
double<00:01:46.740> bass<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.159> faster<00:01:47.520> single<00:01:47.819> bass<00:01:48.170> is

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
double bass and faster single bass is

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.130 
double bass and faster single bass is
this<00:01:49.469> I<00:01:49.710> lift<00:01:50.340> off<00:01:50.520> my<00:01:51.060> leg<00:01:51.299> using<00:01:51.539> my<00:01:51.750> tensor

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
this I lift off my leg using my tensor

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.789 
this I lift off my leg using my tensor
muscle<00:01:52.500> up<00:01:52.649> here<00:01:52.679> and<00:01:53.630> put<00:01:54.630> my<00:01:54.810> heel<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:55.530> about

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
muscle up here and put my heel up about

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.219 
muscle up here and put my heel up about
an<00:01:56.009> inch<00:01:56.250> off<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.880> ground<00:01:57.000> off<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.840> pedal<00:01:58.109> and

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
an inch off the ground off the pedal and

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.919 
an inch off the ground off the pedal and
I<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.219> use<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.609> ball<00:01:59.789> of<00:01:59.880> my<00:01:59.969> foot<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.689> push

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
I just use the ball of my foot to push

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.270 
I just use the ball of my foot to push
the<00:02:01.920> pedal<00:02:02.219> board<00:02:02.299> down<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.740> as<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.799> snaps

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
the pedal board down and as it snaps

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.949 
the pedal board down and as it snaps
back<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.909> push<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.420> down<00:02:06.450> again

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
back I push it down again

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.390 
back I push it down again
it's<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.160> bouncing<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.119> basketball<00:02:10.310> but<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
it's like bouncing a basketball but the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.770 
it's like bouncing a basketball but the
same<00:02:11.610> kind<00:02:11.880> of<00:02:11.940> thing<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.299> you<00:02:12.390> do<00:02:12.569> with<00:02:12.750> your

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
same kind of thing that you do with your

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.870 
same kind of thing that you do with your
with<00:02:13.200> your<00:02:13.230> wrist<00:02:13.560> but<00:02:14.130> you're<00:02:14.489> doing<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.730> with

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
with your wrist but you're doing it with

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.870 
with your wrist but you're doing it with
the<00:02:14.970> ankle<00:02:15.410> I'll<00:02:16.410> do<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.829> slow<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.370> exaggerate

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
the ankle I'll do it slow and exaggerate

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:26.170 
the ankle I'll do it slow and exaggerate
it<00:02:18.000> for<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.239> so<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.420> can<00:02:18.720> see<00:02:19.440> how<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.650> works

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.839 

as<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.500> see<00:02:28.680> I'm<00:02:28.799> not<00:02:28.950> using<00:02:29.010> any<00:02:29.579> leg

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
as you can see I'm not using any leg

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.550 
as you can see I'm not using any leg
movement<00:02:30.269> whatsoever<00:02:30.450> it's<00:02:31.079> the<00:02:31.230> ankle

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
movement whatsoever it's the ankle

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:44.330 
movement whatsoever it's the ankle
that's<00:02:31.709> doing<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.970> whole<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.450> whole<00:02:33.569> job<00:02:43.340> if

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
that's doing the whole the whole job if

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.979 
that's doing the whole the whole job if
I<00:02:44.430> use<00:02:44.579> both<00:02:44.790> feet<00:02:50.599> that's<00:02:51.599> what<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.840> looks

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
I use both feet that's what it looks

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.050 
I use both feet that's what it looks
like<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.470> sounds<00:02:52.620> like<00:02:52.950> it's<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.849> very

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
like and sounds like it's a very

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.849 
like and sounds like it's a very
important<00:02:54.569> technique<00:02:55.349> that<00:02:55.590> I've<00:02:55.680> developed

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
important technique that I've developed

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.150 
important technique that I've developed
in<00:02:56.549> order<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:57.389> make<00:02:57.569> it<00:02:57.720> comfortable<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.980> make

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
in order to make it comfortable and make

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.309 
in order to make it comfortable and make
it<00:02:59.310> easy<00:02:59.489> to<00:03:00.060> go<00:03:00.209> fast<00:03:00.540> for<00:03:00.750> long<00:03:00.930> periods<00:03:01.290> of

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
it easy to go fast for long periods of

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.960 
it easy to go fast for long periods of
time<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.769> at<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.250> same<00:03:02.280> time<00:03:02.669> it's<00:03:02.880> a

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
time and at the same time it's a

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.860 
time and at the same time it's a
technique<00:03:03.329> that<00:03:03.359> develops

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
technique that develops

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.050 
technique that develops
the<00:03:06.349> power<00:03:06.590> I<00:03:06.709> need<00:03:06.830> so<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.610> base<00:03:07.760> rooms

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
the power I need so that the base rooms

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.809 
the power I need so that the base rooms
are<00:03:08.270> heard<00:03:08.450> even<00:03:09.140> at<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.260> faster<00:03:09.739> faster<00:03:10.459> tempo

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
are heard even at a faster faster tempo

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.270 
are heard even at a faster faster tempo
that's<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.870> foot<00:03:12.050> technique<00:03:12.260> that<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.709> that<00:03:13.250> I

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
that's the foot technique that I that I

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.990 
that's the foot technique that I that I
use<00:03:13.520> and<00:03:13.670> have<00:03:13.790> used<00:03:13.819> for<00:03:14.300> a<00:03:14.330> long<00:03:14.450> time<00:03:14.690> now

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
use and have used for a long time now

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.080 
use and have used for a long time now
all<00:03:17.000> right<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.510> hand<00:03:17.959> technique<00:03:18.940> now<00:03:19.940> this

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
all right the hand technique now this

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.490 
all right the hand technique now this
may<00:03:20.360> be<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.540> little<00:03:20.780> bit<00:03:20.900> redundant<00:03:21.440> because

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
may be a little bit redundant because

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.530 
may be a little bit redundant because
it's<00:03:21.739> covered<00:03:21.920> in<00:03:22.099> a<00:03:22.160> lot<00:03:22.310> of<00:03:22.459> drumming<00:03:23.090> videos

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
it's covered in a lot of drumming videos

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.170 
it's covered in a lot of drumming videos
but<00:03:24.200> it's<00:03:24.349> important<00:03:24.800> to<00:03:24.890> get<00:03:25.010> right<00:03:25.340> from<00:03:26.060> the

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
but it's important to get right from the

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.890 
but it's important to get right from the
get-go<00:03:26.620> so<00:03:27.940> you<00:03:28.940> have<00:03:29.060> your<00:03:29.180> fulcrum<00:03:29.630> here

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
get-go so you have your fulcrum here

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.410 
get-go so you have your fulcrum here
between<00:03:30.800> your<00:03:30.950> index<00:03:31.280> finger<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.819> your<00:03:32.390> thumb

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
between your index finger and your thumb

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.020 
between your index finger and your thumb
and<00:03:32.860> it's<00:03:33.860> important<00:03:34.310> to<00:03:34.370> get<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:34.819> right

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
and it's important to get the right

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.930 
and it's important to get the right
balance<00:03:35.330> point<00:03:36.140> of<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.410> stick<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:37.130> that<00:03:37.790> you

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
balance point of the stick and that you

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.370 
balance point of the stick and that you
can<00:03:38.150> mess<00:03:38.780> around<00:03:38.810> with<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:41.060> see<00:03:41.989> what<00:03:42.140> suits

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
can mess around with and see what suits

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.140 
can mess around with and see what suits
you<00:03:42.500> better<00:03:42.680> but<00:03:42.950> there<00:03:43.100> is<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.250> place<00:03:43.880> in<00:03:43.940> the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
you better but there is a place in the

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.460 
you better but there is a place in the
stick<00:03:44.450> that<00:03:44.569> you<00:03:44.690> should<00:03:44.870> grab<00:03:45.049> that<00:03:45.260> bounce

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
stick that you should grab that bounce

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.130 
stick that you should grab that bounce
is<00:03:45.680> better<00:03:45.890> than<00:03:46.750> anywhere<00:03:47.750> else<00:03:47.810> in<00:03:48.049> the

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
is better than anywhere else in the

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.930 
is better than anywhere else in the
stick<00:03:48.910> so<00:03:49.910> I<00:03:50.590> use<00:03:51.590> my<00:03:51.769> arms<00:03:52.099> I<00:03:52.220> use<00:03:52.370> my<00:03:52.549> wrists<00:03:52.849> I

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
stick so I use my arms I use my wrists I

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.789 
stick so I use my arms I use my wrists I
use<00:03:53.060> my<00:03:53.209> fingers<00:03:53.630> when<00:03:53.989> I'm<00:03:54.110> going<00:03:54.470> slower

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
use my fingers when I'm going slower

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.910 
use my fingers when I'm going slower
I'll<00:03:55.250> use<00:03:55.489> more<00:03:56.180> arm<00:03:56.599> and<00:03:57.170> wrist<00:03:57.410> and<00:03:57.650> a<00:03:57.709> little

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
I'll use more arm and wrist and a little

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.339 
I'll use more arm and wrist and a little
bit<00:03:58.010> of<00:03:58.099> finger<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.760> when<00:03:59.330> I<00:03:59.360> go<00:03:59.540> faster<00:04:00.110> I'll

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
bit of finger and when I go faster I'll

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.809 
bit of finger and when I go faster I'll
use<00:04:00.970> less<00:04:01.970> arm<00:04:02.209> or<00:04:02.450> no<00:04:02.780> arm<00:04:03.610> wrists<00:04:04.610> and

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
use less arm or no arm wrists and

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.150 
use less arm or no arm wrists and
fingers<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:05.750> then<00:04:06.110> it<00:04:06.319> gets<00:04:06.410> so<00:04:06.680> point<00:04:06.950> where

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
fingers and then it gets so point where

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.190 
fingers and then it gets so point where
it's<00:04:07.310> basically<00:04:07.819> only<00:04:08.030> fingers<00:04:09.130> so<00:04:10.600> if<00:04:11.600> I'm

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
it's basically only fingers so if I'm

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.800 
it's basically only fingers so if I'm
going<00:04:12.380> slow<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:12.890> want<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:13.190> hit<00:04:13.280> hard<00:04:13.690> make<00:04:14.690> an

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
going slow I want to hit hard make an

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.370 
going slow I want to hit hard make an
impact<00:04:15.140> I'm<00:04:16.039> using<00:04:16.400> my<00:04:16.820> arm<00:04:17.060> my<00:04:17.450> wrist<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:17.959> a

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
impact I'm using my arm my wrist and a

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.830 
impact I'm using my arm my wrist and a
little<00:04:18.590> bit<00:04:18.680> of<00:04:18.769> finger<00:04:19.209> just<00:04:20.209> basically

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
little bit of finger just basically

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:28.120 
little bit of finger just basically
bringing<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.560> stick<00:04:22.120> into<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.210> hand<00:04:27.100> when<00:04:28.100> I

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
bringing the stick into the hand when I

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.390 
bringing the stick into the hand when I
go<00:04:28.280> a<00:04:28.310> little<00:04:28.370> bit<00:04:28.610> faster<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:30.950> arm<00:04:31.130> moves

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
go a little bit faster the arm moves

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.129 
go a little bit faster the arm moves
less<00:04:31.640> and<00:04:32.030> it's<00:04:32.180> more<00:04:32.419> of<00:04:32.570> wrist<00:04:33.020> and<00:04:33.320> fingers

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
less and it's more of wrist and fingers

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.260 
less and it's more of wrist and fingers
and<00:04:36.280> as<00:04:37.280> I<00:04:37.400> go<00:04:37.520> even<00:04:37.639> faster

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
and as I go even faster

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:45.700 
and as I go even faster
less<00:04:38.690> wrist<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:39.260> more<00:04:39.470> fingers<00:04:44.560> it's<00:04:45.560> also

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
less wrist and more fingers it's also

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.770 
less wrist and more fingers it's also
