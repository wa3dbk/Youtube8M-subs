00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.570
 inch full iran gate going to 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.600
 complete the range stages so as to have 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.980
 today from 15 inches up to 20 inches is 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.560
 a device just as I had read 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.410
 will clean Ã¡ngel with which it occurs in 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.689
 android version with the zx1 effe in 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.090
 windows 8 version on the web and with the 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.610
 usability model and one we have for 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.210
 android has a 1.7 processor 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.770
 gigahertz while for windows it is a 2.3 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.680
 both have a quad core processor 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.980
 qualcomm regarding love is 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.550
 a 2 gb daemon plus 32 gb for memory 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.500
 flash 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.890
 the battery certainly very important 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.590
 and as all our devices tend to 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.329
 buy the whole working day 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.329
 in our case it is the battery or on 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.610
 some covers 14 hours with an access 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.929
 I continue the data 23 hours in conversation 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.939
 and up to 1000 hours in standby and per 

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:14.990
 as for the girl of 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.249
 This product is a certified ip68 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.720
 which means that it is a device 

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:19.850
 immersible 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.900
 up to a meter and a half in the water for 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.580
 about 30 minutes 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.990
 as for another 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.290
 certification we have a soldier 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.170
 standard 810g with falls up to three 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.820
 meters tremors may seem excessive 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.040
 we actually have to think about environments 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.960
 like for example warehouse that we have 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.580
 very high shelves so the falls 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.310
 they can even reach tremors 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.850
 rather than to trucks that have precisely 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.590
 a height that reaches almost three months 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.630
 we are also talking about temperatures 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.170
 devices that resist temperatures 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.170
 extreme 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.420
 let's go from minus 20 degrees to 60 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.000
 degrees could be absolutely 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.409
 normal to leave this vehicle device 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.749
 in August on a very hot day 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.700
 it will therefore no longer be possible to lose 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:06.700
 time because the device does not go into standby 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.410
 precisely it reaches 60 sixty years 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.519
 as regards instead the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.739
 configuration we have one 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:16.870
 sundown configuration with micro usb port 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:20.640
 gps integrated wifi and bluetooth 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.810
 integrated and is accurate up to 24 meters 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.209
 as regards the boat the 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.060
 barcode and optional integrated is a 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:34.510
 barcode 1 and 2 b is also integrated one 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:36.340
 light that can then be disabled on 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.870
 path can be used 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.849
 directly in the google bar 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.120
 search in such a way as to search for a 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.599
 particular device a detail 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.040
 5 inch tablet product model of 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.530
 panasonic and it was thought 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.209
 exclusively for those people who 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.430
 they work in the field in particular 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.549
 transport is born for logistics and 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.099
