00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.660
 with the word man from the field 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.560
 patronage boots malacara and boutiques and 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.450
 higher 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.330
 the rustic with the right measure of 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.130
 sophisticated daniel spores writes of 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.710
 a genius of castro rio grande do sul 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.050
 account that he made a vaccine between 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.960
 muscle on the horse thinks he got a 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.550
 nerve in the neck because in show and created 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.449
 a kind of stone 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.250
 also says that the presenting horse 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.009
 we are looking for veterinarian aline lived 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.070
 to explain what can be done 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.550
 Good daniel is depends on where you made the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.260
 injection and the severity of that abscess 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.030
 The truth that formed was an abscess 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.610
 who also says she has sensitivity 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.739
 have pain to the touch because this forms a 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.920
 wrist in there and presses and that 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.289
 pressure on the skin ends up hurting a lot 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.120
 sometimes horses that make an abscess 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.160
 very large can not sometimes 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.140
 I drank water and I did not even eat because I 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.899
 they can lower their necks then 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.110
 the life of the animal that 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.780
 abscess does not decrease in one week 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.049
 indicated is to call a veterinarian to 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.310
 evaluate and possibly make a 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.680
 Drain it open and clean it 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.320
 with hydrogen peroxide or with other 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.509
 physiological and makes the depredation 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.540
 people call that is to shoot every 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.580
 and then you can pass an ointment 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.700
 place to that very quickly 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.310
 to avoid problems it is important to be 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.800
 attentive to the application site 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.380
 in the case of the vaccine between the muscle 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.770
 choice has to be for a region with 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:47.140
 musculature full as a hip board 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.750
 neck or chest that this part 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.710
 a well muscled chest not in the middle 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.170
 always in the part with greater muscular mass 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.670
 for veterinarians this place is the most 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:05.540
 recommended if an abscess is an 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.600
 place of easy drainage because 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.510
 at the bottom at the eight moment 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.300
 ropes and cuts the drainage is very 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.310
 faster and does not interfere with the 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.500
 feeding and what are the 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.390
 care of the person 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.720
 which makes applying this vaccine needs 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.200
 be good if the person does not have gloves 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.070
 disposable at home she should wash well 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.620
 hands with soap and water and also the 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.380
 do local asepsis prior to vaccination 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.300
 or any type of injection 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.239
 I'm going to make a little animal doing it. 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.400
 with the 2 percent and alcohol or 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.250
 do not have it can be just with alcohol 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.670
 the care with hygiene are the best 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.910
 How to prevent abscesses is 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.560
 important not to reuse the needle or 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.030
 syringe and sometimes the personnel with the 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.519
 economy function 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.620
 lava or passing a target and thinks that 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.050
 is stereo it is not stereo and the 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.989
 what happens when he will apply the 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.519
 bacteria enters close to the edge input and 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.519
 ends up causing your excess
