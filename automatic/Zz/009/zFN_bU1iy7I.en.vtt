00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.290
 movie 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.520
 in agreement, guys 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.680
 I did not want to touch this topic 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.869
 mainly because there are already many 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.240
 youtube channels have touched it and that 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.029
 but I have been bombarded with the box 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.890
 comments as well as my facebook and everything 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.949
 the rest of what I speak or my opinion 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.690
 about this movie I did not think 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.390
 I would like my opinion on this 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.400
 news but good here goes first 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.949
 that nothing like everyone should know if it is 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.170
 that do not live under a rock anymore 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.269
 confirmed the fight night sad movie 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.670
 price has been announced everywhere 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.010
 and it is said that it will be directed by the 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.140
 warner studies and what good Scotland gave 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.330
 green light to this project and it will be the 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.460
 in charge of directing the plot before 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.080
 give my direct opinion about what I think 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.710
 of this movie I guess we should 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.580
 do a little reflection 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.950
 unfortunately the world of 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.770
 video games and movies do not usually 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.119
 take too much truth just so 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.189
 you have to remember deliveries like 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.049
 I level up not fit in 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.760
 the head like so many movies did 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.760
 and each one worse than the previous one 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.590
 of that rotten muck of 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.630
 Supermario 1990 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.299
 is that at the time it was an excuse for 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.580
 fiasco that was this damn movie 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.380
 Hi, I'm a group 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.210
 in fact the actor who did mario in 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.040
 this movie confessed to having 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.890
 completely repented of having 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.170
 participated in it although good being 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.120
 Franco has always been difficult to adapt 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.830
 a video game to a movie since by 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.690
 example in the case of supermario a 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.850
 act a world as fanciful as 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.650
 a plumber who can jump several 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.290
 meters high to crush their 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.720
 enemies among them mushrooms and 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.630
 mutant turtles as well as dragons 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.460
 turtles and giant cures or something 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.170
 it is quite complicated and at the same 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.030
 time that is true and is that 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.460
 many times when they adapt a game to 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.380
 cinema tend to abuse too much of the 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.120
 creative freedoms and they do not care 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.270
 To degenerate too much the original product 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.950
 how am I a video game based on a 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.080
 movie that is based on a 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.270
 video game because my creators were missing 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.240
 the day they taught when not from 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.310
 generate too much a product and that is 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.980
 the games usually have a theme 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.050
 both fanciful and exaggerated where the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.870
 strong point is usually the 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.510
 playability and not the history of it 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.370
 however finestrat fredys is a game 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.970
 that does not stand out exactly for its 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.340
 playability 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.380
 but for the terror and especially for its 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.360
 history without forgetting the mysteries that 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.040
 they wrap up this franchise so they 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.410
 all the gold that wraps these 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.480
 video games could easily write 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.860
 one or two movies beyond what 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.140
 can think a lot is that simply 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.090
 the movie would be a guy who sits 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.130
 in a security booth and tries to 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.410
 keep animatronics from wanting it 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.180
 kill in one night because it would be 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.220
 absolutely boring then my 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.950
 opinion would be a fine film 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.410
 ice &amp; fred is undoubtedly a very good 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.270
 idea as long as it is well executed 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.310
 yes scott is enough 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.490
 influential both in the movie and 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.230
 especially in the plot of this I do not doubt 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.510
 to be able to make a good product 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.400
 end let's go with the 3d that is now 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.350
 fashionable in theaters animatronics 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.820
 Internet favorites can give you 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.510
 several subsidies to the fans in the 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.510
 big screen 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.120
 whatever it is freddy finances is without 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.920
 place to doubt a more exploitable material 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.210
 what's left to do practically 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.010
 anything not just video games 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.350
 before leaving I'll do a few 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.540
 questions do you think the movie will cover 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.060
 one or several games and which do you think 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.130
 would you believe that fai nation freddy 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.620
 will be starred by one or several 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.300
 characters of the games if so what 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.880
 do you think that you think the movie 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.250
 will have a completely original script 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.260
 different from video games or is it 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.210
 will base or even complement the 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.050
 history of the games in my opinion 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.460
 I would like it to be set in 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.040
 1992-93 in the vicinity of the 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.990
 pizzeria of the first game being mike and 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.940
 the man on the phone the protagonists 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.250
 of the movie since it would be weird that 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.290
 only they would appear true to me 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.780
 would like for example that mike knew 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.850
 or was a friend of the victim of 87 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.590
 making him have personal reasons 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.020
 to find the truth in the pizzeria 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.000
 while the phone type is 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.290
 trying to hide the bad reputation 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.420
 what this can bring to 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.130
 establishment and I hope that I wish the 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.720
 purple man appear in this movie 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.270
 that once and for all we can 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.430
 know his personality and know his 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.380
 reasons I think with this would be more than 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.600
 enough to make the movie so 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.940
 that it is not necessary to use 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.010
 at the end they are freddy 3 and that the plot of the 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.310
 second game is only mentioned for 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:58.650
 talk about the events of '87 and well that 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.650
 it's all here they are English or act see you
