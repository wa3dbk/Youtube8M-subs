like to do a little tutorial some people
have<00:00:43.590> been<00:00:43.739> asking<00:00:43.770> me<00:00:44.219> about<00:00:44.969> my<00:00:45.239> unbreakable

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
have been asking me about my unbreakable

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.080 
have been asking me about my unbreakable
achievement<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:47.070> if<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.489> scroll<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:47.940> way

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
achievement so if you scroll the way

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.459 
achievement so if you scroll the way
down<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.390> look<00:00:48.570> at<00:00:48.719> unbreakable<00:00:49.350> unbreakable

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
down you look at unbreakable unbreakable

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.400 
down you look at unbreakable unbreakable
is<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.149> successfully<00:00:51.840> defend

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
is you have to successfully defend

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.360 
is you have to successfully defend
against<00:00:52.949> 5000<00:00:53.640> attacks<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.829> to<00:00:55.829> do<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.129> it

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
against 5000 attacks and to do that it

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.110 
against 5000 attacks and to do that it
is<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:57.149> exactly<00:00:57.930> difficult<00:00:58.190> but<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.879> just

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
is not exactly difficult but it's just

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.500 
is not exactly difficult but it's just
very<00:01:00.239> very<00:01:00.359> mundane<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:02.039> way<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.190> do

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
very very mundane so the way to do

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.210 
very very mundane so the way to do
unbreakable<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.710> draw<00:01:04.979> all

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
unbreakable is you just have to draw all

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.520 
unbreakable is you just have to draw all
the<00:01:05.549> way<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:07.369> 220<00:01:08.369> cups<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.200> then<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.409> go

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the way to 220 cups and then just go

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.130 
the way to 220 cups and then just go
offline<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.150> are<00:01:12.299> at<00:01:12.390> 300<00:01:12.780> cups<00:01:12.960> all

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
offline so now we are at 300 cups all

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.410 
offline so now we are at 300 cups all
the<00:01:13.229> way<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.530> drop<00:01:13.860> copses<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:14.790> drop<00:01:15.240> a

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the way I drop copses just drop a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.080 
the way I drop copses just drop a
barbarian<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:16.799> just<00:01:17.040> enter<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.060> I

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
barbarian and then just enter it so I

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.270 
barbarian and then just enter it so I
lose<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> rear<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.560> lose<00:01:19.830> some<00:01:20.040> cups

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
lose the rear and then I lose some cups

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.820 
lose the rear and then I lose some cups
so<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:22.049> keep<00:01:22.200> repeating<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.770> process

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
so I just keep repeating this process

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.429 
so I just keep repeating this process
until<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:24.150> reach<00:01:25.400> 220<00:01:26.400> cups<00:01:26.720> so<00:01:27.720> why<00:01:28.200> do<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.380> do

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
until I reach 220 cups so why do I do

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.859 
until I reach 220 cups so why do I do
this<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:29.040> because<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.240> have<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.479> drop

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
this is because you just have to drop

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.469 
this is because you just have to drop
cups<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.380> once<00:01:31.650> when<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.009> go<00:01:32.189> offline<00:01:32.479> people

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
cups and once when you go offline people

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.450 
cups and once when you go offline people
will<00:01:33.600> come<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.869> attack<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:35.250> go<00:01:35.400> on

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
will come and attack you you go on

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.370 
will come and attack you you go on
defend<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.030> then<00:01:36.299> people<00:01:36.720> will<00:01:36.960> do<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> same

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
defend and then people will do the same

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.630 
defend and then people will do the same
thing<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.799> which<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.159> they<00:01:38.310> will<00:01:38.460> drop<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
thing to you which is they will drop a

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.749 
thing to you which is they will drop a
troop<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.180> they<00:01:39.810> will<00:01:39.960> lose<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.799> making

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
troop and they will lose to you making

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.050 
troop and they will lose to you making

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.310 
accidentally going offline just now so
I'm<00:01:52.590> slowly<00:01:53.070> dropping<00:01:53.430> my<00:01:53.610> comes<00:01:53.820> back<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.320> 220

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
I'm slowly dropping my comes back to 220

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.760 
I'm slowly dropping my comes back to 220
so<00:01:56.159> y<00:01:56.549> 220<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.719> magical<00:01:58.229> number<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.619> actually

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
so y 220 the magical number is actually

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.429 
so y 220 the magical number is actually
220<00:01:59.759> I've<00:01:59.880> tested<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.570> lot<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.899> times<00:02:01.170> if

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
220 I've tested this a lot of times if

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.289 
220 I've tested this a lot of times if
you<00:02:01.500> try<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.310> go<00:02:02.490> below<00:02:02.820> 220<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.840> trophy's<00:02:04.619> a

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
you try to go below 220 the trophy's a

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.930 
you try to go below 220 the trophy's a
deduction<00:02:06.299> will<00:02:06.570> reduce<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> negative<00:02:07.350> form

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
deduction will reduce to a negative form

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.570 
deduction will reduce to a negative form
which<00:02:08.940> will<00:02:09.270> reduce<00:02:09.599> your<00:02:09.929> speed<00:02:10.289> by<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> lot<00:02:10.800> so

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
which will reduce your speed by a lot so

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.850 
which will reduce your speed by a lot so
I<00:02:12.300> don't<00:02:12.569> recommend<00:02:12.629> going<00:02:13.140> all<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.530> way

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
I don't recommend going all the way

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.570 
I don't recommend going all the way
like<00:02:14.250> 200<00:02:15.000> or<00:02:15.030> 100's<00:02:15.720> by<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.590> time<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.280> cups

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
like 200 or 100's by the time the cups

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.840 
like 200 or 100's by the time the cups
deduction<00:02:18.210> will<00:02:18.360> only<00:02:18.510> be<00:02:18.720> minus<00:02:19.230> one<00:02:19.410> or<00:02:19.530> so

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
deduction will only be minus one or so

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.620 
deduction will only be minus one or so
minus<00:02:20.850> one<00:02:21.030> minus<00:02:21.240> two

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
minus one minus two

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.190 
minus one minus two
sometimes<00:02:22.200> even<00:02:22.500> no<00:02:23.100> cups<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.820> deter<00:02:24.540> when<00:02:25.110> you

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
sometimes even no cups to deter when you

sometimes even no cups to deter when you
reach<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> certain<00:02:25.860> level<00:02:26.130> but<00:02:26.400> all<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.820> way

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.430 
reach to a certain level but all the way
that's<00:02:27.210> all<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.600> way<00:02:27.720> do<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.020> reach<00:02:28.200> almost

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
that's all the way do you reach almost

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.900 
minutes then you will get some

online

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
online

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.160 
online
so<00:03:44.160> we'll<00:03:44.370> go<00:03:44.580> offline<00:03:44.850> for<00:03:45.120> around<00:03:45.630> 5<00:03:46.140> minutes

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
so we'll go offline for around 5 minutes

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.630 
so we'll go offline for around 5 minutes
and<00:03:46.680> we<00:03:46.769> will<00:03:46.860> see<00:03:47.040> what<00:03:47.190> happens

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
and we will see what happens

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.720 
and we will see what happens
so<00:03:48.180> targeting<00:03:49.110> will<00:03:49.230> be<00:03:49.320> 5<00:03:49.650> defense<00:03:50.010> wins<00:03:50.430> I

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
so targeting will be 5 defense wins I

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.030 
so targeting will be 5 defense wins I
would<00:03:51.090> think<00:03:51.450> so<00:03:51.720> so<00:03:52.170> here<00:03:52.470> we<00:03:52.530> go<00:03:52.650> we'll<00:03:52.920> go

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
would think so so here we go we'll go

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.370 
would think so so here we go we'll go
offline<00:03:53.280> now<00:03:55.700> ok<00:03:56.700> so<00:03:56.760> we<00:03:57.120> are<00:03:57.150> back<00:03:57.269> so<00:03:57.720> as<00:03:58.230> you

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
offline now ok so we are back so as you

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.350 
offline now ok so we are back so as you
can<00:03:58.500> see<00:03:58.709> on<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.890> top<00:03:59.370> left<00:03:59.580> we<00:03:59.910> have<00:04:00.120> sprung

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
can see on a top left we have sprung

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.020 
can see on a top left we have sprung
back<00:04:00.600> up<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.959> 280<00:04:01.620> 4<00:04:01.860> cups<00:04:02.160> from<00:04:02.549> 2<00:04:02.760> -<00:04:02.880> OH

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
back up to 280 4 cups from 2 - OH

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.880 
back up to 280 4 cups from 2 - OH
so<00:04:03.600> if<00:04:03.720> we<00:04:03.810> look<00:04:03.959> at<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.140> defense<00:04:04.320> lock<00:04:04.680> we

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
so if we look at the defense lock we

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.539 
so if we look at the defense lock we
have<00:04:05.420> 1/4<00:04:06.420> defenses<00:04:07.170> so<00:04:07.920> if<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.280> look<00:04:08.430> at

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
have 1/4 defenses so if you look at

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.400 
have 1/4 defenses so if you look at
every<00:04:08.760> place<00:04:08.970> some<00:04:09.360> of<00:04:09.510> them<00:04:09.690> also<00:04:10.019> do<00:04:10.290> the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
every place some of them also do the

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.650 
every place some of them also do the
same<00:04:10.620> as<00:04:10.739> what<00:04:10.920> you<00:04:11.040> are<00:04:11.100> doing<00:04:11.250> which<00:04:12.090> is<00:04:12.120> they

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
same as what you are doing which is they

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.120 
same as what you are doing which is they
were<00:04:12.750> drop<00:04:12.930> one<00:04:13.110> troop<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.470> they'll<00:04:13.799> end<00:04:14.040> the

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
were drop one troop and they'll end the

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.310 
were drop one troop and they'll end the
battle<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:15.060> technically<00:04:15.720> speaking<00:04:15.810> they<00:04:16.229> are

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
battle so technically speaking they are

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.420 
battle so technically speaking they are
doing<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.620> same<00:04:16.799> as<00:04:16.950> what<00:04:17.100> you<00:04:17.190> are<00:04:17.250> doing

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430

way<00:05:20.520> to<00:05:20.580> replenish<00:05:21.060> your<00:05:21.420> go<00:05:22.320> and<00:05:22.620> a<00:05:23.610> bit<00:05:24.000> of

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
way to replenish your go and a bit of

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.780 
way to replenish your go and a bit of
your<00:05:24.180> elixir<00:05:24.720> if<00:05:24.900> you<00:05:25.140> need<00:05:25.410> to<00:05:25.590> get<00:05:26.340> for<00:05:26.640> your

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
your elixir if you need to get for your

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.850 
your elixir if you need to get for your
troops<00:05:27.150> because<00:05:27.690> I'm<00:05:27.990> using<00:05:28.170> barbarians<00:05:28.770> for

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
troops because I'm using barbarians for

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.710 
troops because I'm using barbarians for
some<00:05:29.040> people<00:05:29.340> they<00:05:29.460> want<00:05:30.150> to<00:05:30.240> use<00:05:30.420> their

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
some people they want to use their

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.230 
some people they want to use their
heroes<00:05:31.080> and<00:05:31.110> they<00:05:31.380> don't<00:05:31.560> have<00:05:31.680> to<00:05:31.800> use<00:05:31.920> any

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
heroes and they don't have to use any

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.840 
heroes and they don't have to use any
elixir<00:05:33.240> so<00:05:33.870> this<00:05:34.560> is<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.830> way<00:05:34.980> how<00:05:35.220> to<00:05:35.280> get<00:05:35.760> by

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
elixir so this is the way how to get by

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.400 
elixir so this is the way how to get by
your<00:05:36.000> resources<00:05:36.390> which<00:05:36.690> is<00:05:36.870> you<00:05:36.990> have<00:05:37.020> to<00:05:37.260> get

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
your resources which is you have to get

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.770 
your resources which is you have to get
back<00:05:37.590> to<00:05:37.620> sub<00:05:38.460> 200<00:05:38.880> so<00:05:38.970> once<00:05:39.150> you<00:05:39.240> reach<00:05:39.390> to<00:05:39.540> sub

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
back to sub 200 so once you reach to sub

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.080 
back to sub 200 so once you reach to sub
200<00:05:40.230> you<00:05:40.410> will<00:05:40.560> see<00:05:40.770> this<00:05:41.160> kind<00:05:41.460> of<00:05:41.490> basis<00:05:41.910> you

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
200 you will see this kind of basis you

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.810 
200 you will see this kind of basis you
will<00:05:42.240> see<00:05:42.690> those<00:05:42.870> town<00:05:43.770> whore<00:05:43.980> two<00:05:44.190> or<00:05:44.460> two<00:05:44.640> or

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
will see those town whore two or two or

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.250 
will see those town whore two or two or
three<00:05:44.850> bases<00:05:45.360> anymore<00:05:45.720> you'll<00:05:45.870> start<00:05:46.140> to<00:05:46.230> see

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
three bases anymore you'll start to see

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.830 
three bases anymore you'll start to see
this<00:05:46.980> kind<00:05:47.220> of<00:05:47.340> town<00:05:47.580> it<00:05:47.850> even<00:05:48.360> up<00:05:48.510> to<00:05:48.630> ten<00:05:48.810> or

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
this kind of town it even up to ten or

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.280 
this kind of town it even up to ten or
ten<00:05:49.230> bases<00:05:49.770> so<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:51.000> way<00:05:51.150> to<00:05:51.210> get<00:05:52.020> by<00:05:52.140> your

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
ten bases so the way to get by your

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.890 
ten bases so the way to get by your
resources<00:05:52.650> is<00:05:52.830> to<00:05:52.860> rate<00:05:53.550> them<00:05:53.760> and<00:05:53.970> of<00:05:54.600> course

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
resources is to rate them and of course

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.560 
resources is to rate them and of course
a<00:05:54.990> game<00:05:55.770> bag<00:05:55.950> of<00:05:56.070> resources<00:05:56.520> so<00:05:57.090> as<00:05:57.150> you<00:05:57.420> can

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
a game bag of resources so as you can

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.220 
a game bag of resources so as you can
see<00:05:57.750> the<00:05:57.900> search<00:05:58.170> down<00:05:58.800> at<00:05:59.100> sub<00:05:59.460> 200<00:05:59.970> is<00:06:00.330> really

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
see the search down at sub 200 is really

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.610 
see the search down at sub 200 is really
weird<00:06:01.500> that's<00:06:02.010> one<00:06:02.250> and<00:06:02.460> also<00:06:02.610> the<00:06:02.850> search<00:06:03.060> can

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
weird that's one and also the search can

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.350 
weird that's one and also the search can
make<00:06:04.620> the<00:06:04.770> magnifying<00:06:05.250> glass<00:06:05.370> spin<00:06:05.850> for<00:06:06.120> quite

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
make the magnifying glass spin for quite

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.310 
make the magnifying glass spin for quite
a<00:06:06.390> while<00:06:06.570> so<00:06:07.370> it's<00:06:08.370> kind<00:06:09.150> of<00:06:09.240> like<00:06:09.420> in<00:06:10.080> high

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
a while so it's kind of like in high

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.050 
a while so it's kind of like in high
champions<00:06:10.890> where<00:06:11.040> value<00:06:11.340> it's<00:06:11.580> called

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
champions where value it's called

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.150 
champions where value it's called
clouding<00:06:12.570> you<00:06:12.690> have<00:06:12.810> to<00:06:12.930> clock<00:06:13.170> a<00:06:13.200> bit<00:06:13.470> but

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
clouding you have to clock a bit but

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.620 
clouding you have to clock a bit but
it's<00:06:14.370> not<00:06:14.520> so<00:06:14.640> bad<00:06:14.820> so<00:06:14.940> as<00:06:15.060> you<00:06:15.180> can<00:06:15.300> see<00:06:15.480> this

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
it's not so bad so as you can see this

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.080 
it's not so bad so as you can see this
one<00:06:15.840> is<00:06:15.870> a<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.800> load<00:06:16.980> is<00:06:17.130> 400<00:06:17.580> thousand<00:06:17.910> 400

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
one is a the load is 400 thousand 400

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.560 
one is a the load is 400 thousand 400
dollar<00:06:18.360> is<00:06:18.540> a<00:06:18.570> tower<00:06:18.810> 10<00:06:19.350> so<00:06:20.390> wondering<00:06:21.390> why<00:06:21.510> is

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
dollar is a tower 10 so wondering why is

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.140 
dollar is a tower 10 so wondering why is
this<00:06:21.780> here<00:06:22.020> I<00:06:22.170> do<00:06:22.290> not<00:06:22.470> know<00:06:22.650> so<00:06:23.430> probably<00:06:24.000> they

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
this here I do not know so probably they

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.280 
this here I do not know so probably they
are<00:06:24.240> doing<00:06:24.450> the<00:06:24.540> same<00:06:24.720> as<00:06:24.810> what<00:06:24.990> you<00:06:25.080> are<00:06:25.140> doing

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
are doing the same as what you are doing

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.050 
are doing the same as what you are doing
but<00:06:25.560> with<00:06:25.740> a<00:06:25.920> lot<00:06:26.070> of<00:06:26.130> resources<00:06:26.460> so<00:06:26.820> this<00:06:27.000> is

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
but with a lot of resources so this is

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.580 
but with a lot of resources so this is
the<00:06:27.150> kind<00:06:27.390> of<00:06:27.450> pace<00:06:27.690> that<00:06:28.080> you<00:06:28.140> have<00:06:28.290> to<00:06:28.410> rate

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
the kind of pace that you have to rate

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.670 
the kind of pace that you have to rate
to<00:06:28.830> get<00:06:29.220> back<00:06:29.580> your<00:06:29.730> resources<00:06:30.090> so<00:06:30.680> yeah

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
to get back your resources so yeah

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.710 
to get back your resources so yeah
that's<00:06:31.980> how<00:06:32.280> you<00:06:32.340> have<00:06:32.850> to<00:06:33.030> sustain<00:06:33.360> your

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
that's how you have to sustain your

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.320 
that's how you have to sustain your
resources<00:06:34.080> so<00:06:34.410> usually<00:06:35.370> once<00:06:35.610> I<00:06:35.790> reach<00:06:36.030> to

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
resources so usually once I reach to

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.609 
resources so usually once I reach to
like<00:06:36.690> around

00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:39.619 

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:42.320 

20,000<00:06:40.619> go<00:06:41.159> I<00:06:41.369> was<00:06:41.610> taught<00:06:41.759> to<00:06:41.789> draw<00:06:42.119> all<00:06:42.270> the

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
20,000 go I was taught to draw all the

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.389 
20,000 go I was taught to draw all the
way<00:06:42.509> down<00:06:42.719> to<00:06:42.839> sub<00:06:43.020> 200<00:06:43.439> to<00:06:43.619> Farmer<00:06:44.189> B<00:06:44.309> of

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:44.399 
way down to sub 200 to Farmer B of

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:46.579 
way down to sub 200 to Farmer B of
resources<00:06:44.909> fun<00:06:45.149> back<00:06:45.330> to<00:06:45.449> around<00:06:45.659> 200<00:06:45.869> K<00:06:46.289> or<00:06:46.439> so

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:46.589 
resources fun back to around 200 K or so

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:49.519 
resources fun back to around 200 K or so
then<00:06:47.159> after<00:06:47.399> that<00:06:47.490> continue<00:06:47.939> the<00:06:48.529> routine

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:49.529 
then after that continue the routine

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:51.379 
then after that continue the routine
again<00:06:49.770> which<00:06:49.979> is<00:06:50.099> to<00:06:50.219> drop<00:06:50.429> back<00:06:50.550> to<00:06:50.610> 200<00:06:51.059> and

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:51.389 
again which is to drop back to 200 and

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:53.089 
again which is to drop back to 200 and
then<00:06:51.539> go<00:06:51.689> offline<00:06:52.050> for<00:06:52.199> 5<00:06:52.469> minutes<00:06:52.770> and

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:53.099 
then go offline for 5 minutes and

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:55.249 
then go offline for 5 minutes and
eventually<00:06:53.639> you'll<00:06:54.240> gain<00:06:54.479> cups<00:06:54.839> again<00:06:55.110> then

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:55.259 
eventually you'll gain cups again then

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:56.779 
eventually you'll gain cups again then
just<00:06:55.469> repeat<00:06:55.679> the<00:06:55.800> whole<00:06:55.949> process<00:06:56.099> over<00:06:56.490> and

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789 
just repeat the whole process over and

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:59.600 
just repeat the whole process over and
over<00:06:56.909> again<00:06:57.149> so<00:06:57.479> by<00:06:58.409> doing<00:06:58.469> that<00:06:58.830> roughly<00:06:59.429> in

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
over again so by doing that roughly in

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.600 
over again so by doing that roughly in
around<00:06:59.990> 1<00:07:00.990> hour<00:07:01.020> so<00:07:01.559> you<00:07:01.619> should<00:07:02.009> be<00:07:02.219> able<00:07:02.249> to

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
around 1 hour so you should be able to

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.299 
around 1 hour so you should be able to

previously<00:07:08.309> when<00:07:08.490> I<00:07:08.580> was<00:07:08.729> doing<00:07:09.029> it<00:07:09.179> I<00:07:09.330> did

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 
previously when I was doing it I did

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:13.369 
previously when I was doing it I did
around<00:07:09.869> that<00:07:10.559> amount<00:07:10.979> around<00:07:11.129> 18<00:07:11.639> per<00:07:11.969> hour<00:07:12.379> so

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:13.379 
around that amount around 18 per hour so

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:15.649 
around that amount around 18 per hour so
that's<00:07:14.189> how<00:07:14.339> to<00:07:14.399> do<00:07:14.610> defense<00:07:15.240> wins

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:15.659 
that's how to do defense wins

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:17.629

unbreakable achievement that's the only

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:19.459 
unbreakable achievement that's the only
and<00:07:17.819> fastest<00:07:18.269> way<00:07:18.449> that<00:07:18.629> I<00:07:18.659> can<00:07:18.839> think<00:07:19.019> of<00:07:19.229> and

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:19.469 
and fastest way that I can think of and

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:21.919 
and fastest way that I can think of and
most<00:07:19.860> people<00:07:20.189> are<00:07:20.610> doing<00:07:20.909> it<00:07:21.149> this<00:07:21.449> way<00:07:21.659> as<00:07:21.719> you

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:21.929 
most people are doing it this way as you

00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:24.589 
most people are doing it this way as you
can<00:07:21.990> see<00:07:22.289> from<00:07:22.919> the<00:07:23.099> defense<00:07:23.429> law<00:07:23.610> so<00:07:23.909> people

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 
can see from the defense law so people

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:26.929 
can see from the defense law so people
are<00:07:24.659> doing<00:07:24.929> it<00:07:25.050> the<00:07:25.169> same<00:07:25.319> way<00:07:25.379> so<00:07:26.309> I<00:07:26.339> hope<00:07:26.789> this
