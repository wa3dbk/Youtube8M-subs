little gadget and I can show you a bit
of<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.899> microscopic<00:01:01.590> view<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:02.160> spider<00:01:02.489> mites<00:01:02.820> so

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
of a microscopic view on spider mites so

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.870 
of a microscopic view on spider mites so
let's<00:01:04.080> see<00:01:04.260> how<00:01:04.439> these<00:01:04.710> buggers<00:01:05.070> look<00:01:05.670> like

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
let's see how these buggers look like

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.910 
let's see how these buggers look like
and<00:01:06.180> then<00:01:06.450> I'm<00:01:06.540> gonna<00:01:06.689> talk<00:01:06.990> about<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.439> gadget

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
and then I'm gonna talk about the gadget

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.460 
and then I'm gonna talk about the gadget
that<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.100> used<00:01:08.540> okay<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> closer

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
that I used okay so this is a closer

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.070 
that I used okay so this is a closer
look<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.310> exact<00:01:11.970> same<00:01:12.270> orchid<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.780> showed

you earlier these are the spider mites
and<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:15.960> actually<00:01:16.110> see<00:01:16.470> how<00:01:16.680> many<00:01:17.070> they

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
and you can actually see how many they

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.490 
and you can actually see how many they
are<00:01:17.490> practically<00:01:18.450> they're<00:01:18.720> invisible<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
naked eye but zoomed 500 times this is

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.380 
naked eye but zoomed 500 times this is
how<00:01:22.530> they<00:01:22.680> look<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:22.920> there's<00:01:23.490> there<00:01:24.270> are

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
how they look like there's there are

how they look like there's there are
quite<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.720> few<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:25.110> are<00:01:25.140> moving<00:01:25.650> around<00:01:26.180> it's

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
quite a few they are moving around it's

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.310 
quite a few they are moving around it's
not<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.450> pretty<00:01:27.720> sight

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
not a pretty sight

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.620 
not a pretty sight
here<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.920> go<00:01:29.100> another<00:01:29.520> look<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.060> them<00:01:30.270> they

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
here you go another look at them they

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.510 
here you go another look at them they
are<00:01:30.659> really<00:01:31.020> red<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.829> now<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.369> actually

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
are really red and now you can actually

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.219 
are really red and now you can actually
see<00:01:32.729> why<00:01:33.119> they're<00:01:33.329> called<00:01:33.600> spider<00:01:33.930> mites

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
see why they're called spider mites

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.590 
see why they're called spider mites
actually<00:01:34.740> they<00:01:34.829> look<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.250> spiders<00:01:35.729> now<00:01:36.329> some

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
actually they look like spiders now some

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.830 
actually they look like spiders now some
of<00:01:36.630> them<00:01:36.840> are<00:01:37.079> not<00:01:38.009> doing<00:01:38.310> much<00:01:38.420> they<00:01:39.420> seem<00:01:39.659> to

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
of them are not doing much they seem to

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.770 
of them are not doing much they seem to
be<00:01:40.460> fixed<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.549> one<00:01:41.729> point<00:01:41.909> maybe<00:01:42.420> there<00:01:42.689> are

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
be fixed in one point maybe there are

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.490 
be fixed in one point maybe there are
nymphs<00:01:43.259> or<00:01:43.439> eggs<00:01:44.009> I'm<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:44.909> sure<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.990> just

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
nymphs or eggs I'm not sure I have just

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.850 
nymphs or eggs I'm not sure I have just
been<00:01:46.880> starting<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.090> notice<00:01:48.899> them<00:01:49.380> better<00:01:49.619> now

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
been starting to notice them better now

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.609 
been starting to notice them better now
and<00:01:50.130> Here<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.549> am<00:01:50.640> trying<00:01:50.880> out<00:01:51.240> some<00:01:51.450> stuff<00:01:51.689> this

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.289 
download it and install it now I run
Windows<00:03:49.049> 8.1<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:50.099> it<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.370> compatible<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.180> I'm

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
Windows 8.1 and it is compatible and I'm

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.420 
Windows 8.1 and it is compatible and I'm
pretty<00:03:51.510> sure<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:52.019> older<00:03:52.919> versions<00:03:53.310> of

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
pretty sure that older versions of

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.750 
pretty sure that older versions of
Windows<00:03:53.489> are<00:03:54.000> compatible<00:03:54.419> as<00:03:54.810> well<00:03:55.519> it<00:03:56.519> has

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
Windows are compatible as well it has

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.270 
Windows are compatible as well it has
two<00:03:57.090> programs<00:03:57.689> one<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:58.379> actually<00:03:58.739> lets<00:03:59.159> you

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
two programs one that actually lets you

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.479 
two programs one that actually lets you
record<00:03:59.519> what<00:04:00.329> you<00:04:00.510> film<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.169> I<00:04:02.010> think

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
record what you film and I think

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.939 
record what you film and I think
possibly<00:04:03.060> take<00:04:03.299> snapshots<00:04:03.900> as<00:04:04.169> well<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.769> have

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
possibly take snapshots as well you have

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.099 
possibly take snapshots as well you have
some<00:04:05.159> buttons<00:04:05.519> here<00:04:05.939> on<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.359> little<00:04:06.510> gadget<00:04:06.989> I

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
some buttons here on the little gadget I

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.869 
some buttons here on the little gadget I
didn't<00:04:07.680> make<00:04:07.769> them<00:04:07.979> work<00:04:08.189> just<00:04:08.400> yet

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
didn't make them work just yet

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.640 
didn't make them work just yet
I<00:04:08.909> need<00:04:09.419> to<00:04:09.569> install<00:04:09.900> some<00:04:10.139> stuff<00:04:10.439> but<00:04:10.620> I

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
I need to install some stuff but I

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.830 
I need to install some stuff but I
didn't<00:04:10.889> bother<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.340> much<00:04:11.459> I<00:04:11.609> just<00:04:11.639> I<00:04:12.150> just

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
didn't bother to much I just I just

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.839 
didn't bother to much I just I just
wanted<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.139> film<00:04:13.349> the<00:04:13.470> little<00:04:13.680> buggers<00:04:13.979> and

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
wanted to film the little buggers and

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.360 
wanted to film the little buggers and
also<00:04:15.449> it<00:04:15.599> has<00:04:15.750> another<00:04:15.949> software<00:04:16.949> which<00:04:17.190> is

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
also it has another software which is

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.310 
also it has another software which is
measurement<00:04:17.729> I<00:04:18.060> think<00:04:18.299> it<00:04:18.419> lets<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:18.840> edit<00:04:19.019> to

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
measurement I think it lets you edit to

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.199 
measurement I think it lets you edit to
the<00:04:19.440> pictures<00:04:19.859> or<00:04:20.130> snapshots<00:04:20.700> you<00:04:20.820> do<00:04:21.060> I
