00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 madame dumas lives in an apartment with 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.230
 a lot of potential 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.240
 the guest room is located just in 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.880
 below a common part badly 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.469
 heated and boiling 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.109
 Madame dumas wishes to realize 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.279
 the acoustic and thermal insulation of the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.100
 ceiling of this room 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.650
 indeed she wishes to delete the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.019
 heat loss and limit 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.359
 noise 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.820
 I would advocate the realization of a 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.239
 suspended ceiling more commonly 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.030
 called false ceiling with plates of 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.930
 acoustic plasterboard plaster and wool 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.079
 mineral 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.230
 it will not have the guarantee of 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.809
 create a contact book to adapt 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.750
 the majority of media by choosing 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.750
 the right lines to recover a fake 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.210
 level and create a plenum for nothing 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.370
 castrated despot 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.329
 that's what we're going to ask 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:04.019
 suspensions are said he f 530 adapted to 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.610
 our support here a wood floor of 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:12.510
 furs style f 530 style splints 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.590
 f 530 a mineral wool of a thickness 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.420
 10 cm is coated on kraft 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.400
 plasterboard plasterboard for 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.270
 improve the sound insulation of 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.310
 our false ceilings and davis ttp its 35 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.860
 and at the level of the tools 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.440
 here is what we need a rule of 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.470
 mason a master a screwdriver 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.230
 bordeaux a nibbler a shrink or a 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.060
 cutter and alex plate often 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.800
 available for rent and which 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.800
 simplify the laying of 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.410
 plaster before we always start our 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.540
 face checks one works on 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.160
 a healthy carrier and it is checked what 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.560
 can support the burden of 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.450
 structure that we will ask you must 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.170
 imperatively wear equipment 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.510
 suitable 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.480
 always wear gloves 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.540
 goggles disposable masks and awaken to 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.060
 wear long-sleeved clothes 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.470
 here is how we will proceed 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.070
 first we will fix the lines 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.940
 long style f500 30 then furs 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:19.810
 f 530 style then the mineral wool he 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.460
 at comfort 35 coated kraft and finally the 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.770
 phonic tray plasterboard 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.260
 we will start by setting the 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.440
 with a spacing of 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.720
 60 cm maximum between the lines of his 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.270
 cure and a spacing of one meter twenty 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.220
 between the attachment points 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.459
 we start by fixing the lines 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.709
 world is it f 530 in every corner of 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.600
 the piece we draw a mark for 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.810
 the location of the first line 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.260
 you must leave a maximum of 10 cm between 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.820
 the wall and hang it then we trace a 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.530
 benchmark corresponding to the height 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.420
 desired for the mignard ceiling 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.180
 the thickness of the plasterboard in 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.950
 alignment of the first marker on place 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.620
 now hang on the first 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.230
 landmark perpendicular to the solid 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.070
 then fix the suspend you went from life 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.060
 adapted to 35 mm minimum length in 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.060
 bis in two points 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.550
 the line is now between 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.440
 hangers put a board to fix the 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.319
 string perform a turn in the notch 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.480
 of the supplant goes around the room 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.030
 we will now put in place 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.850
 the intermediate lines are installed 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.920
 every 60 cm maximum along the body 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:43.310
 back just align the notches 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:47.180
 facing the chalk high school does the same 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.060
 name of the solid of the opposite wall on 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.870
 materialize break lines 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.940
 perpendicular to the previous ones 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.810
 hearing the cord from one end to the other 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.300
 of the piece then we fix the lines 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.810
 every 1 m 20 maximum aligned at 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.300
 line and every 60 cm maximum between 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.680
 the framing lines it's only 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.540
 when all hangers are 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.549
 willing that we can remove the line 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:17.070
 we then measure the length of the 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:22.009
 piece and then postpone the measure minus one 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.009
 centimeter on a fur style f 530 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.680
 cut with the help of the nibbler 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.960
 my clip that fur on the lines 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.500
 here one of the furs is not enough 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:45.250
 so long assembling fur 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:49.300
 using a high school style i 530 and one 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:54.520
 the clip on the lines made of 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.320
 even on each line to suspend at 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.900
 louvre now a roll of wool 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.850
 mineral cutter you have to take 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.100
 carefully cut the packaging at the level of 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.690
 beginning of the roll is to avoid 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.660
 cut their clothes in kraft paper 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.430
 to avoid damaging your floor use 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.920
 a wooden board as a support when 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.590
 of cutting we measure the space between 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.320
 joists have made benchmarks at each 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.660
 end of the roll to the measured width 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.300
 is more a centimeter using the maxi 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.670
 couple n 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:29.590
 then cut with the help of the rule 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:32.350
 from mason we have now used wool 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.540
 between the joists and the furs the 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.000
 kraft coating must be positioned from 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.890
 side heat up if the ceiling is by a 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.350
 heated space of unheated spaces 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:44.020
 have made landmarks at each end 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.410
 from the roll to the right width using 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.960
 of maxi couple n we now insert the 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.180
 wool between solids and forests on 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.750
 continues to cut out the following at the 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.620
 good width then we are sincere we 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.270
 place well edge to edge with the previous 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.410
 did the same for each of 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.410
 the paragraph put it 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.800
 the leff plates will help you to 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.680
 position the plates against the mad 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:22.830
 laughs we load the first placo plate 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:26.180
 sound on the hooks on 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.180
 do not forget to block the brakes 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.630
 Now is raised at all 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:35.190
 using the crank 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.010
 until the plates touch the 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:40.050
 furs f 530 think to arrange a 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.990
 space of a few millimeters between the 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:46.830
 plasterboard and walls being lowered 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:50.130
 the hooks of the leff slap one screws the 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:52.110
 plates using 35 tpc screws with 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.450
 the screwdriver with a special tip 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.930
 plasterboard like that on each 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.639
 fur the plate is fixed have made 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.700
 go down the plate of the leff plate for 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:04.860
 clear the plate and place the 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.180
 vices along the furs every 30 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.520
 maximum cm 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.260
 there are markers on the plate for 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.350
 help you locate the location of 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.780
 intermediate amounts does the same on 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.100
 the entire area to cover 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:20.100
 it will cut a plate to 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.350
 finish the pose for that we measure the 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.060
 width needed in two places 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:27.530
 different 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.530
 we now postpone the measure 

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:31.559
 we trace a lair on each side of the 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.389
 plate aco phonic 

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:37.479
 then we draw the cut line in 

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:39.219
 using the rule of massot one cut 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:41.800
 the plasterboard using a saw 

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:45.429
 while holding it now you can also 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:48.990
 use a cutter for cutting then 

00:07:45.429 --> 00:07:48.990
 it is fixed as before 

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:55.679
 I recap the states of mind
