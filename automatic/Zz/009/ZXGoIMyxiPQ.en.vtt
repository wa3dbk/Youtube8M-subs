videos soon this is just a very
rudimentary<00:00:16.170> test<00:00:16.830> here<00:00:17.390> depending<00:00:18.390> on<00:00:18.600> how

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
rudimentary test here depending on how

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.359 
rudimentary test here depending on how
much<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.199> lubricate<00:00:19.710> your<00:00:19.740> line<00:00:20.039> when<00:00:20.279> you

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
much you lubricate your line when you

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.439 
much you lubricate your line when you
fasten<00:00:20.760> your<00:00:20.850> knots<00:00:21.029> can<00:00:21.240> make<00:00:21.420> a

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
fasten your knots can make a

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.359 
fasten your knots can make a
considerable<00:00:22.080> amount<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.350> difference<00:00:22.980> and

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
considerable amount of difference and

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.070 
considerable amount of difference and
the<00:00:23.939> brake<00:00:24.119> strength<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.570> you're<00:00:24.720> not<00:00:24.869> but

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
the brake strength that you're not but

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.109 
the brake strength that you're not but
I'm<00:00:25.199> just<00:00:25.230> gonna<00:00:25.410> do<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> rough<00:00:25.980> overall<00:00:26.880> just

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.469 

there<00:01:01.900> it<00:01:02.020> goes<00:01:02.400> hook<00:01:03.400> broke<00:01:03.700> loose<00:01:04.059> and<00:01:04.420> that

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
there it goes hook broke loose and that

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.400 
there it goes hook broke loose and that
was<00:01:04.780> about

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:27.570 

okay<00:01:10.410> now<00:01:10.740> for<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:11.130> trial<00:01:11.430> I'm<00:01:11.670> not

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.610

all I'm trying to keep my hand stable

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.640 
all I'm trying to keep my hand stable
therefore<00:01:29.950> it

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.050 

looked<00:01:37.650> about<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.010> be<00:01:38.130> seven<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.730> a<00:01:38.760> half<00:01:38.790> or

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
looked about to be seven and a half or

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.749 
looked about to be seven and a half or
so

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.359 

now<00:01:45.759> for<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.210> improved<00:01:46.659> clinch<00:01:47.020> knot<00:01:47.369> once

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
now for the improved clinch knot once

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.819 
now for the improved clinch knot once
again<00:01:48.579> Bo's<00:01:48.789> knots<00:01:49.060> are<00:01:49.240> tied<00:01:49.390> on<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.619> lure

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
again Bo's knots are tied on the lure

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.419 
again Bo's knots are tied on the lure
right<00:01:51.280> here<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.579> the<00:01:51.670> hook<00:01:53.130> see<00:01:54.130> what<00:01:54.250> type<00:01:54.399> of

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
right here to the hook see what type of

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:04.859 
right here to the hook see what type of
strength<00:01:54.820> we're<00:01:55.090> dealing<00:01:55.420> with<00:01:55.450> here<00:02:03.869> trying

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
strength we're dealing with here trying

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.550 
strength we're dealing with here trying
to<00:02:04.990> stab<00:02:05.289> myself<00:02:05.500> in<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:05.860> hand<00:02:06.069> with<00:02:06.189> her

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.089 

about<00:02:11.560> six<00:02:11.769> and<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:12.040> half<00:02:12.069> knots<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:12.940> good

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:24.569 

okay<00:02:18.099> now<00:02:18.459> for<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:18.970> Palomar<00:02:19.390> knot<00:02:23.310> it's<00:02:24.310> not<00:02:24.549> a

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
okay now for the Palomar knot it's not a

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.199 
okay now for the Palomar knot it's not a
personal<00:02:25.569> favorite<00:02:26.049> of<00:02:26.140> mine<00:02:26.380> so<00:02:27.090> let's<00:02:28.090> see

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
personal favorite of mine so let's see

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:48.050 
personal favorite of mine so let's see
how<00:02:28.360> much<00:02:28.569> of<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.810> believer<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.230> am<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:29.769> it<00:02:29.860> now

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.129 

is<00:02:49.060> seven<00:02:49.510> 10<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:52.209> it<00:02:52.359> turns<00:02:52.569> out<00:02:52.810> that<00:02:52.870> the

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
is seven 10 so it turns out that the

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.069 
is seven 10 so it turns out that the
Rapala<00:02:53.650> knot<00:02:53.829> and<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.190> improved<00:02:54.519> clinch<00:02:54.730> knot

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
Rapala knot and the improved clinch knot

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.870 
Rapala knot and the improved clinch knot
actually<00:02:56.079> both<00:02:56.470> broke<00:02:56.920> on<00:02:57.190> than<00:02:57.430> not<00:02:57.609> the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
actually both broke on than not the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.729 
actually both broke on than not the
others<00:02:58.120> actually<00:02:58.359> broke<00:02:58.780> on<00:02:59.049> the<00:02:59.260> mainline

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
others actually broke on the mainline

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.479 
others actually broke on the mainline
that<00:03:00.700> could<00:03:00.880> have<00:03:00.970> depended<00:03:01.450> on<00:03:01.540> how<00:03:01.840> much

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
that could have depended on how much

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.520 
that could have depended on how much
lubrication<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.639> I've<00:03:03.760> put<00:03:03.940> on<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.239> not<00:03:04.530> but

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
lubrication that I've put on the not but

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.370 
lubrication that I've put on the not but
the<00:03:05.920> Rapala<00:03:06.700> knot<00:03:06.850> itself<00:03:07.299> is<00:03:07.569> a<00:03:07.600> loop<00:03:07.870> nut<00:03:08.139> so

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
the Rapala knot itself is a loop nut so

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.500 
the Rapala knot itself is a loop nut so
it's<00:03:08.560> not<00:03:09.040> designed<00:03:09.549> for<00:03:09.730> overall<00:03:10.180> strength

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
it's not designed for overall strength

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.199 
it's not designed for overall strength
it's<00:03:10.780> designed<00:03:11.170> for<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.500> rigging<00:03:12.010> but<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.120> know

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
it's designed for a rigging but you know

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.670 
it's designed for a rigging but you know
we'll<00:03:13.389> see<00:03:13.420> we'll<00:03:13.840> try<00:03:14.019> it<00:03:14.049> some<00:03:14.319> more

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
we'll see we'll try it some more

we'll see we'll try it some more
next<00:03:15.069> time<00:03:15.190> I<00:03:15.280> do<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.549> we'll<00:03:15.700> try<00:03:15.850> a<00:03:15.880> few
