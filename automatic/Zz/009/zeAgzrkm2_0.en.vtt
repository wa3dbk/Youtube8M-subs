on a kilt because that was the only way
I<00:00:24.600> could<00:00:24.750> build<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.230> outside<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.740> map<00:00:25.890> and

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
I could build it outside of the map and

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.609 
I could build it outside of the map and
it<00:00:26.250> was<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.460> hill<00:00:27.170> unfortunately<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> only

curtains<00:00:58.969> here<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:01.219> zip<00:01:02.219> line<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:03.449> works

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
curtains here is the zip line it works

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.119 
curtains here is the zip line it works
only<00:01:04.049> one<00:01:04.290> way<00:01:04.470> because<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.100> drop

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
only one way because you can just drop

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.730 
only one way because you can just drop
down<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.630> only<00:01:06.780> works<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:07.200> few<00:01:07.530> mins

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
down but it only works for few mins

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.320 
down but it only works for few mins
because<00:01:08.040> only<00:01:08.280> humans<00:01:08.760> can<00:01:08.790> use<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> custom

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330

power<00:01:09.689> trade<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.320> where<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.470> makes<00:01:10.590> them

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
power trade to where it makes them

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.440 
power trade to where it makes them
lighter<00:01:11.040> for<00:01:11.340> about<00:01:11.520> three<00:01:11.790> seconds<00:01:12.210> just

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
lighter for about three seconds just

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.929 
lighter for about three seconds just
long<00:01:12.689> enough<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:13.049> them<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.320> get<00:01:13.530> over<00:01:13.710> there

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
long enough for them to get over there

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.330 
long enough for them to get over there
and<00:01:14.939> I'll<00:01:15.060> switch<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.330> my<00:01:15.540> guy<00:01:15.750> really<00:01:15.990> quick

the map of it but that would completely

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.830 
the map of it but that would completely
cripple<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.020> gameplay<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.990> bridge<00:01:37.290> with<00:01:38.250> a

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
get to like wave 108 except in this game

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.550 
get to like wave 108 except in this game
it's<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.520> lot<00:02:05.759> harder<00:02:07.700> I<00:02:08.899> got<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.989> same<00:02:10.170> basic

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
it's a lot harder I got the same basic

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.619 
it's a lot harder I got the same basic
layout<00:02:10.769> and<00:02:11.129> everything<00:02:11.190> comes<00:02:12.150> with<00:02:12.239> pallets

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
layout and everything comes with pallets

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.100 
layout and everything comes with pallets
on<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.780> windows<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.590> doesn't<00:02:14.010> matter<00:02:15.110> you

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
on the windows but it doesn't matter you

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.809 
on the windows but it doesn't matter you
absolutely<00:02:16.709> cannot<00:02:17.099> get<00:02:17.310> out<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.610> time

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
absolutely cannot get out this time

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.140 
absolutely cannot get out this time
because<00:02:18.030> i<00:02:18.239> made<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.480> windows<00:02:18.840> higher<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:21.000> i

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
because i made the windows higher and i

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.089 
because i made the windows higher and i
put<00:02:21.329> ramps<00:02:21.540> on<00:02:21.840> them<00:02:22.019> so<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> zombies<00:02:22.860> can

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
put ramps on them so the zombies can
