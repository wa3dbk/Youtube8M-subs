00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.480 

I'll<00:00:09.360> be<00:00:09.510> demonstrating<00:00:10.290> how<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.590> work

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
I'll be demonstrating how to work

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.030 
I'll be demonstrating how to work
Kitchener<00:00:12.059> in<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.570> round<00:00:12.870> when<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.770> have<00:00:14.010> a

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
Kitchener in the round when you have a

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.690 
Kitchener in the round when you have a
long<00:00:14.370> tube<00:00:14.760> and<00:00:15.059> we<00:00:15.299> need<00:00:15.510> to<00:00:15.690> join<00:00:16.200> the<00:00:16.980> ends

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.700 
long tube and we need to join the ends

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.510 
long tube and we need to join the ends
of<00:00:17.849> the<00:00:18.119> tube<00:00:18.360> together<00:00:18.599> to<00:00:19.110> form<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.740> circle<00:00:20.340> as

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
of the tube together to form a circle as

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.010 
of the tube together to form a circle as
in<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.300> cowl<00:00:22.160> that<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.189> have<00:00:23.490> here<00:00:23.990> so<00:00:24.990> I

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
in this cowl that I have here so I

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.950 
in this cowl that I have here so I
started<00:00:25.859> with<00:00:26.130> these<00:00:27.119> stitches<00:00:27.600> on<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
started with these stitches on a

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.470 
started with these stitches on a
provisional<00:00:28.710> cast<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.490> which<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.850> have<00:00:30.000> removed

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
provisional cast on which I have removed

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.710 
provisional cast on which I have removed
and<00:00:30.810> placed<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> circular<00:00:32.400> needle<00:00:32.790> these

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
and placed on a circular needle these

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.229 
and placed on a circular needle these
are<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.590> stitches<00:00:34.830> that<00:00:35.340> where<00:00:35.519> I<00:00:35.550> ended<00:00:36.180> my

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
are the stitches that where I ended my

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.939 
are the stitches that where I ended my
knitting<00:00:36.720> so<00:00:36.930> they're<00:00:37.080> live<00:00:37.290> stitches<00:00:37.769> on

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
knitting so they're live stitches on

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.969 
knitting so they're live stitches on
their<00:00:38.220> circular<00:00:38.790> needle<00:00:39.150> so<00:00:39.720> both<00:00:40.110> ends<00:00:40.470> of

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:40.979 
their circular needle so both ends of

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:43.579 
their circular needle so both ends of
the<00:00:41.430> tube<00:00:41.640> need<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.269> their<00:00:42.720> own<00:00:42.930> separate

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
the tube need to have their own separate

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.009 
the tube need to have their own separate
circular<00:00:44.129> needle<00:00:44.489> now<00:00:45.360> we're<00:00:45.570> going<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.839> be

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
circular needle now we're going to be

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.630 
circular needle now we're going to be
kitchen<00:00:46.470> airing<00:00:46.680> them<00:00:46.860> closed<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.519> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
kitchen airing them closed and the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.700 
kitchen airing them closed and the
Kitchener<00:00:48.120> stitch<00:00:48.150> is<00:00:48.629> worked<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:49.350> much<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
Kitchener stitch is worked in much the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.189 
Kitchener stitch is worked in much the
same<00:00:50.010> way<00:00:50.519> that<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:51.299> kids<00:00:51.510> nurse<00:00:51.720> stitch<00:00:51.960> is

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
same way that the kids nurse stitch is

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.710 
same way that the kids nurse stitch is
worked<00:00:52.229> when<00:00:52.799> you're<00:00:52.979> closing<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:54.000> one<00:00:54.360> tube

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
worked when you're closing just one tube

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.009 
worked when you're closing just one tube
so<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.979> would<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.369> a<00:00:56.670> close-up<00:00:57.420> tutorial

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
with the duplicate stitch so that way it

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.249 
with the duplicate stitch so that way it
will<00:06:49.860> close<00:06:50.370> up<00:06:50.820> any<00:06:51.150> little<00:06:51.389> gap<00:06:51.690> here

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259 
will close up any little gap here

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:56.120
