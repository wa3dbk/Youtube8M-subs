not locks right I agree you know in five
years<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.850> believe<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.509> all<00:01:39.569> walks<00:01:40.109> will<00:01:40.709> be

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
years we believe that all walks will be

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.609 
years we believe that all walks will be
board<00:01:41.729> locks<00:01:41.999> that<00:01:42.509> number<00:01:43.139> locks<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.590> a

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
board locks that number locks are a

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.199 
board locks that number locks are a
thing<00:01:43.889> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.039> past<00:01:44.130> they're<00:01:44.700> gonna<00:01:44.850> go<00:01:45.090> away

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
thing of the past they're gonna go away

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.749

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
and people will be using word locks

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.339 
and people will be using word locks
because<00:01:47.999> they're<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.569> much<00:01:48.719> easier<00:01:48.779> to

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:49.349 
because they're so much easier to

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:51.319 
because they're so much easier to
remember<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.920> numbers<00:01:50.279> why<00:01:50.939> have<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.209> been
