00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.090
 the minister also plays in the rush 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.360
 I decided to record a ghetto if we go 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.490
 stay here with me to give you 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.590
 together and began to create with you 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.570
 Beautiful makeup today know how to make 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.310
 a local revenue and with the plans of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.970
 God are much better and greater than the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.039
 our 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.470
 I was going to do something else but I'm going to do it 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.490
 A cleanup, I hope to make this you, but 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.900
 totally changes 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.480
 I remembered that the women's congress in 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.040
 church is today so I changed everything will be 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.140
 Much better, I'll do light makeup. 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.550
 around you and you will follow this 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.440
 makeup preparation 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.460
 applying tonic and that says that you 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.940
 You're so quick that I'm very 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:48.020
 late on the skin he was doing 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.020
 with me then to know the skin needs 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.930
 to use this here it is only natural that I made a 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.730
 example I found this week the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.640
 I will not let go I will not use 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.760
 give anything so with the kabuki's clothing 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.760
 King 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.180
 This makes me look pretty because the church 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.510
 does not do a very basic thing 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.490
 but as today is a special event as well 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:26.460
 cool I'm going to use some makeup 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.909
 and I will try to use products that hold 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.520
 well and if I cry I'll use this diploma 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.650
 from here at nymex to take a 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.650
 A little of that whiteness I do not like 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.490
 the net current voice traces and this 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.130
 My color 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:16.819

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:20.840
 Of course 03 and I'm going to use it with a sponge 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.140

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.140

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.689
 Translucent here will only give a trap 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:45.180
 the shadow of tatum color and a bronze 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:47.310
 sparkling little slack even though I 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.930

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.150

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.200
