00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.540
 hello all are welcome to a new 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.090
 video our community thank you for 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.469
 tune our channel on this occasion 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.809
 we are going to install the rom that the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.190
 contribution of samsung galaxy s 6 is that 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.160
 is based on the latest version of 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.720
 5.1.1 lollipop android with all the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.949
 samsung customization the only thing that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.420
 we have to do is download from the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.250
 description of the necessary video file 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.660
 that only one but before this 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.250
 I remember is the backup to your folder 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.750
 fs as well as in android backup for 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.759
 that we avoid problems after the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.440
 installation once understood this let's 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.850
 to pay our device we are entered 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.500
 in recovery mode we will not go and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.120
 where it says white we're going to go advanced 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.860
 let's select the four white that 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.329
 the developer recommends us to 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.829
 have maximum performance in this 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.809
 device with the snore demo sitting to 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.520
 next we are going to select dalÃ­ 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.800
 how to select system we are going to inform 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.870
 what are the data and finally 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.460
 select cache once selected 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.930
 these four wise simply 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.000
 we move and we hope that our 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.170
 device that format once 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.180
 completed the cleaning process 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.190
 we just go back and go 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.780
 where does install say we go 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.339
 our microsd memory where we have 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.840
 copied what is the rom that we download 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.329
 from the description of the video 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.909
 and then only afterwards the 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:14.520
 we installed we passed here and we hope that 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.679
 is installed will start with what is the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.509
 aroma install which will allow us 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:20.929
 perform what is the little installation 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.929
 easier 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.540
 well let's select the language 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.340
 English let's give it next here then we 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.049
 allows you to select what the model is 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.240
 of the device as you know 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.340
 we use the international name and 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.500
 9.005 but you can also observe that 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.539
 it can be enabled or it can work 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.549
 in 9 thousand tn 9000 w is 8 also the 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.369
 other variants that gives us what 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.770
 that is the alarm install it let's go next 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.560
 here will allow us to then select the 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.780
 what is the modem I live in europe 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.060
 he just selected it this I do not know how 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.340
 you will do it depending on the country 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.679
 but if not, then you just leave it out 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.440
 default or automatic and simply because 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.660
 have been installed we give you next here we 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.340
 will allow to modify what the kernel I 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.480
 I recommend that that reader since 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.760
 previously we saw is the classroom to 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.130
 to haunt it we had selected the kernel 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.690
 darwin and it gave us the time to 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.340
 start the triangle then you 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.170
 I recommend using the mode 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.430
 how real this here will allow us 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.590
 select the type of camera we are going to 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.630
 select on the camera the galaxy s 6 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.590
 we can also install directly what 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.780
 what is the husband 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.360
 once you have already selected everything as you can 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.709
 see the rom in the 6th revolution is 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.760
 based on the latest version of android with 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.830
 all the personification of sants or 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.590
 we just give you net and we hope that 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.940
 are installed well as you can see already 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.610
 finished what the process of 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.569
 installation simply subtracts us 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.280
 restart our device we pull 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.720
 finalize and we hope that our 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.549
 device to restart let's do the 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.170
 relevant configurations well as 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.730
 can observe and finished masters in the 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.290
 configuration of our rom let's 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.599
 do a quick little review of what 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.310
 has in itself what is this rom installed 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.140
 our device we will start by 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.459
 the wallpapers already everyone knows 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.440
 who has the personation of samsung 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.819
 galaxy s 6 went after will have what 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.170
 are your wallpapers what are 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.030
 the widgets will depend on the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.040
 applications that we will have installed 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.569
 currently on our device the 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.069
 topics and everyone knows that to be able to 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.480
 download themes from the store 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.940
 samsung we will have to create a 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.620
 account to be able to enjoy what the 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.349
 content of the samsung palau store 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.629
 to modify what is the aspect of the 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.120
 desk we can set it 4 x 55 x 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.160
 5 or depends on each one the hidden 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.390
 we now move to the 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.700
 status bar and we can see that 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.200
 we have what are the adjustments like 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.460
 can see to access them 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.570
 we simply move 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.520
 left to right to the right to 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.710
 left or we can also access 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.290
 directly to the system settings 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.850
 let's go up to near the 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.590
 device to show them that we have 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.170
 What is the version of android 5.1.1 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.460
 lollipop for this device too 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.470
 It shows us what is the 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.480
 information of the rom in this section 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.040
 the rom other itself additional adjustments 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.140
 that you include what is the 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.010
 developer but yes we can 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.960
 optimize it and improve what the aspect 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.200
 visual with the settings that brings what 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.060
 is the rom this we are back we go to 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.590
 application drawer here we can see 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.780
 that come with some applications that 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.570
 has left what the developer like 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.010
 is the 'lock up' that is like a measure 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.380
 Security a security application 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.060
 which we can use then well then 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.410
 we can uninstall it but the truth 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.180
 because until now the rom works 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.560
 very well I have tried only the 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.630
 today I have not had any 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.950
 negative experience but yes let me 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.660
 tell him that we have created a 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.880
 Article our website where 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.260
 we explain what book blogs are that 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.720
 presents the rom must be taken into account 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.280
 than the first version so treat 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.450
 trying to improve what is the 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.440
 developer is rom so that no 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.710
 works correctly 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.350
 now we go up 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.970
 applications to show them what is 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.160
 the network as it has managed the 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.570
 resources this rom more than everything that is 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.220
 the memory run since what we 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.250
 Worried as you can see we have free 1 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.290
 8 GB also you have to remind them that 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.230
 they are roms the contribution skips the 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.850
 samsung galaxy s 66 therefore if in 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.740
 some time they have some saturation 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.360
 in ram memory you have to have in 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.790
 account that samsung walt has not 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.680
 solved completely in this version what 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.940
 what is the bad management of ram 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.230
 that's why we have to restart our 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.390
 device at least once a day 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.010
 now very enter what is the part 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.600
 administration of tasks as they can 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.950
 see here we have what are the tasks 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.450
 in the background simply to 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.220
 close it we press the button and it 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.780
 closes what are the second tasks 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.660
 plan and we are completely free what 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.220
 which is the ram if we enter the 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.290
 section of the camera we can see that 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.820
 we have an error therefore the 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.950
 developer recommends us to use 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.480
 an additional camera what is of the 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.830
 google camera so I can get it for you 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.900
 comment so that you have installed and 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.820
 that this one works the section the camera 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.750
