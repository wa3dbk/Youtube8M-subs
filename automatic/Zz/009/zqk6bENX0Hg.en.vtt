screws in right here you charge your
blaze<00:00:19.680> with<00:00:20.010> an<00:00:20.130> integrated<00:00:20.460> USB<00:00:20.939> cable<00:00:21.330> it's

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
got a magnetic connector just like a

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.650 
got a magnetic connector just like a
MacBook<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.490> little<00:00:23.850> indicator<00:00:24.240> lights<00:00:24.510> to

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
MacBook and little indicator lights to

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.120 
MacBook and little indicator lights to
show<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.869> whether<00:00:25.050> it's<00:00:25.260> charging<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.740> so

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
show you whether it's charging on so

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.349 
show you whether it's charging on so
it's<00:00:26.279> pretty<00:00:26.400> cool<00:00:26.640> because<00:00:26.880> no<00:00:27.029> matter<00:00:27.180> which

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
it's pretty cool because no matter which

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.109 
it's pretty cool because no matter which
way<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.570> connect<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.230> still<00:00:28.500> works

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
way you connect it it still works

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.179 
way you connect it it still works
this<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> 300<00:00:30.810> lumen<00:00:31.140> LED<00:00:31.260> light<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.070> it's

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
this is a 300 lumen LED light so it's

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.220 
this is a 300 lumen LED light so it's
very<00:00:32.369> high-powered<00:00:32.820> anything<00:00:33.540> more<00:00:33.690> than<00:00:33.840> 300

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
very high-powered anything more than 300

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.049 
very high-powered anything more than 300
lumen<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.649> definitely<00:00:35.190> better<00:00:35.460> for<00:00:35.579> kind<00:00:36.000> of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
lumen is definitely better for kind of

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.310 
lumen is definitely better for kind of
like<00:00:36.239> nighttime<00:00:36.510> trekking<00:00:37.110> through<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
like nighttime trekking through the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.049 
like nighttime trekking through the
wilderness<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> city<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.670> kind<00:00:39.030> of

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
wilderness but for the city you kind of

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.670 
wilderness but for the city you kind of
don't<00:00:39.239> want<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.450> blind<00:00:39.719> people<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.230> are<00:00:40.469> con

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
don't want to blind people that are con

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.319 
don't want to blind people that are con
coming<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.399> hopefully<00:00:41.940> they'll<00:00:42.090> still<00:00:42.300> be

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
coming to you hopefully they'll still be

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.030 
coming to you hopefully they'll still be
able<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.600> see<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.960> after<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.290> pass<00:00:43.530> by<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
able to see you after you pass by and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.400 
able to see you after you pass by and
that's<00:00:44.610> why<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.090> really<00:00:45.570> dig<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.170> laser

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
that's why I really dig the laser

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.020 
that's why I really dig the laser
function<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.280> light<00:00:47.460> because<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:48.000> only

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
function of this light because not only

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.090 
function of this light because not only
does<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.930> your<00:00:49.110> attention<00:00:49.559> from<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
does it get your attention from the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.680 
does it get your attention from the
flashing<00:00:50.610> kind<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.969> luminescence

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
flashing kind of luminescence

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.240 
flashing kind of luminescence
what<00:00:51.989> would<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> added<00:00:52.530> dimension<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:53.129> a

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
what would the added dimension of a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.459 
what would the added dimension of a
laser<00:00:53.489> projected<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> ground<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.260> really

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
laser projected on the ground it really

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.740 
laser projected on the ground it really
kind<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.739> brings<00:00:56.489> people's<00:00:56.850> heads<00:00:57.090> up<00:00:57.300> the

think<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> good<00:01:20.400> feature<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:21.299> green<00:01:21.600> laser

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
think is a good feature the green laser

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.140 
think is a good feature the green laser
is<00:01:22.259> really<00:01:22.650> quite<00:01:23.130> bright<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.640> flashing

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
is really quite bright with flashing

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.390 
is really quite bright with flashing
modes<00:01:24.360> solid<00:01:25.229> modes<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.040> combine

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
modes solid modes and you can combine

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.030 
modes solid modes and you can combine
that<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.820> steady<00:01:27.689> light<00:01:27.990> or<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.619> flashing

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
that with a steady light or a flashing
