00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.920
 welcome back to you 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.770
 my youtube channel 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.270
 today it's all about that 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.660
 skimmer like the one or the other 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.000
 others here can already think in wehn 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.490
 now more than 15 years by 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.609
 I have a few different experiences 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.920
 tried out types of scanners and there 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.920
 I want you my experiences today 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.710
 achieve in particular interesting 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.780
 after of course for all those who form 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.020
 of the construction or would be conceivable 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.020
 because the neighbors decide themselves 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.750
 you inevitably ever considered 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.500
 for which doctor you always shift one 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.890
 now decides my first cinema de 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.710
 had not installed was easy and 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.399
 primitive at the same time it was nothing else 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.729
 alba can do it easily 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.850
 was placed obliquely in the pond and 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:15.570
 is we channel tube now trying times 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.880
 to do it by hand was like this 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.700
 pond built 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.270
 that means obliquely about two 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.570
 dipped in thirds water and has 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.960
 by the difference between filters 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.259
 chamber and right here the dirt of 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.850
 The surface from worried important 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.299
 was that here at this opening 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.280
 but smaller crossbars are installed with it 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.409
 now no small fish and the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.200
 but fourth chamber could swim 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.939
 this primitive and simple room 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.670
 who actually has the fullest 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.310
 Satisfaction works only 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.560
 disadvantage of this type forms was climate 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.860
 that he is very water dependent 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.229
 is 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:04.590
 that means you have here a maximum of 5 to 7 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.520
 cm level difference or level 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.590
 had tolerance and depending on where the 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.620
 water level in the pond was that went 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.610
 either well pulled now 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.560
 and well tuned or almost not at all 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.840
 which, of course, not necessarily 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.900
 ideal is probably the same now 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.659
 The most common is always this is 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.790
 simple and simple almost always like that 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.220
 a horst I have used this one 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.860
 almost always around here inside you can 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:44.000
 they recognize foam or styrofoam 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.069
 in which he boosted certain orders 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.329
 water has you now have this 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.900
 skimmer here in the water 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.720
 there is then swims so by itself and 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.829
 by the upcoming the club pressure 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.489
 with filter then depending on strength and 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.670
 the water is taken care of and starts to 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.220
 vote 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.640
 the big advantage of this skimmer was 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.010
 just the extreme tolerance height 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.690
 when it comes to the water level that is 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.799
 is with this skimmer can 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.730
 easily in normal case 10 to 15 cm 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.250
 balance level difference 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.299
 and he should still be quite 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.209
 well working 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.780
 the big disadvantage of this kind of 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.419
 skipper is that over time 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.970
 here between the skipper that kids 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:34.629
 were themselves and the pipe was on it 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.359
 sits deposits form 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:40.760
 then fight through these deposits 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.739
 sometimes the climate and that leads 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:49.699
 in turn, that he is not flawless 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:52.579
 works and at the moment I have to 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:56.200
 honestly so far for me to say 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:59.950
 Far best skimmer works here 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.519
 far always with me and that is in 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.519
 principle nothing else than a black one 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:09.640
 is always like getting it from just about anyone 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:12.340
 conventional swimming pool camp are 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.880
 if now even overflow channel installed 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.430
 is and this climate is mine 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.940
 sight or from today's perspective absolutely 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.729
 the best thing in the pond is why 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.440
 I come to this decision 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.750
 and through this children flap in the 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.210
 inside is also installed here 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:35.520
 level differences 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:39.400
 then this skimmer has wide mouth 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.190
 can be beautifully integrated into the edge 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.860
 with me now will not as beautiful as 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.260
 I tell you also tell why by 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.510
 that this topic was retrofitted 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.270
 because unfortunately can not sit so deep 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.610
 ours really wanted that 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.860
 look relatively far over the 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.300
 water level out normally 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:04.360
 This should always be at least 7 cm 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.810
 deep so that you sit almost nothing 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.870
 more 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.520
 Above the water edge , what I see 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.169
 here now afterwards made 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.440
 I have and you can do it well 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:17.710
 These are the people who aspire to recognize 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.229
 I built in stainless steel rods with it 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.440
 no fish swim into the child 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.440
 can 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.690
 there is again important that you in the 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:33.940
 height or water level normally 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:36.520
 is the aspiration leaves out otherwise 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.099
 swim here again risky whole 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.930
 dirt caught at the bars and that 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:44.050
 would certainly not sense and purpose of 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:47.740
 thing will show now like that 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:50.200
 climate inside look and then I do 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.710
 also explain where has changed 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.789
 last 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.300
 that this swimming pool is always with 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.190
 me 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.190
 and since I also work 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.860
 this swimming pool cinema became now 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:11.650
 something usually optimized is he 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.839
 rehearse inside only half the running 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:17.020
 faith is obstructing or maybe just 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:20.830
 Two to expire I was but we wanted 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:23.139
 primarily with 110 kg was why 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:26.409
 I then sawed off the bow 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:29.199
 and pushed 160 channels over it 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:32.050
 fits perfectly with the dimension 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:34.629
 rubber lip seals it well 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.879
 In addition, I have the sewer pipe then 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:38.939
 still screwed that is not 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:41.409
 can fall out and so I have now 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:44.319
 continuous line here from the skimmer 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:46.930
 to the filter in the 110th 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:48.219
 which, of course, is changing leaves 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.809
 be announced 

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:51.809
 is a huge advantage 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:58.560
 so much on the topic of climate and mine 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.120
 experience is likely to 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.500
 Here everyone has their own experiences 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.800
 have made 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:08.780
 for me personally is the wall installation 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.520
 skimmer is still the best solution 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:14.580
 Of course you have to do something here 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.520
 you want to improve the normal 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.530
 For sale in the trade but gets for it 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.310
 this theme really does its job 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.310
 work was missing
