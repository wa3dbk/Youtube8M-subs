00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
alright this is my 29 gallon biocube

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.330 
alright this is my 29 gallon biocube
just<00:00:06.290> showing<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.319> some<00:00:07.500> modifications<00:00:08.189> i

other<00:00:13.370> top<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.639> biocube<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:16.640> didn't

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
other top to the biocube and didn't

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.689 
other top to the biocube and didn't
really<00:00:17.940> want<00:00:18.119> power<00:00:18.480> compacts<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.070> got<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
really want power compacts so I got the

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.050 
really want power compacts so I got the

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
right here is took this off of the old

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.109 
right here is took this off of the old
old<00:01:13.470> top<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:13.979> biocube<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:16.729> modified<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
old top to the biocube and modified the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.539 
old top to the biocube and modified the
moon<00:01:18.330> lights<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.780> there<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.549> one

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
moon lights in there you can see one

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.120 
moon lights in there you can see one
little<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:21.090> there<00:01:21.570> there's<00:01:22.409> three<00:01:22.740> little

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
little on there there's three little

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.539 
little on there there's three little
bulbs<00:01:24.229> no<00:01:25.280> they're<00:01:26.280> pretty<00:01:26.490> cool<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
bulbs no they're pretty cool and in the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:37.580 
bulbs no they're pretty cool and in the
back<00:01:29.939> here<00:01:31.400> made<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:34.400> media<00:01:35.400> rack<00:01:36.200> which<00:01:37.200> runs

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
back here made a media rack which runs

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.050 
back here made a media rack which runs
into<00:01:38.520> filter<00:01:39.240> floss<00:01:39.799> carbon<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.130> then<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.520> have

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
into filter floss carbon and then I have

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.950 
into filter floss carbon and then I have
cheat<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.659> morphic<00:01:43.079> algae<00:01:43.530> down<00:01:43.770> beneath<00:01:44.960> which

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
cheat a morphic algae down beneath which

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.760 
cheat a morphic algae down beneath which
keeps<00:01:46.619> nitrates<00:01:47.159> down<00:01:47.399> they<00:01:47.670> eat<00:01:48.270> nitrates

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
keeps nitrates down they eat nitrates

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.350 
keeps nitrates down they eat nitrates
that's<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.920> little<00:01:50.009> might<00:01:50.549> get<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> rig<00:01:51.090> blight<00:01:51.329> I

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
that's a little might get a rig blight I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.510 
that's a little might get a rig blight I
made<00:01:52.399> got<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.430> pin<00:01:54.299> skimmer<00:01:54.689> back<00:01:55.110> there<00:01:55.520> here's

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
made got a pin skimmer back there here's

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.639 
made got a pin skimmer back there here's
my<00:01:56.700> old<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> old<00:02:00.799> media<00:02:01.799> rack<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.070> made

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
my old this is the old media rack I made

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.870 
my old this is the old media rack I made
basically

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
basically

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.979 
basically
again<00:02:09.229> basically<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:11.300> have<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> little<00:02:12.540> shelf

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
again basically I have a little shelf

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.509 
again basically I have a little shelf
that<00:02:13.950> came<00:02:14.280> across<00:02:14.430> here<00:02:16.190> shelf<00:02:17.190> i<00:02:17.340> came

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
that came across here shelf i came

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.780 
that came across here shelf i came
across<00:02:17.640> right<00:02:18.000> there<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.739> egg<00:02:19.739> crate<00:02:20.040> this

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
across right there of egg crate this

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.350 
across right there of egg crate this
stuff<00:02:21.030> just<00:02:21.410> sits<00:02:22.410> in<00:02:22.560> there<00:02:22.819> then<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:23.849> had

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
stuff just sits in there then I had

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.750 
stuff just sits in there then I had
filter<00:02:24.780> floss<00:02:24.930> beneath<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.890> had<00:02:26.340> bag<00:02:26.580> of

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
filter floss beneath it I had bag of

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.759 
filter floss beneath it I had bag of
carbon<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:28.970> then<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.599> had<00:02:30.840> filter<00:02:31.230> floss<00:02:31.349> above

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
carbon and then I had filter floss above

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.979 
carbon and then I had filter floss above
it<00:02:31.920> then<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:33.810> runs<00:02:34.440> down<00:02:34.800> into<00:02:35.930> this<00:02:36.930> hole

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
it then it runs down into this hole

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.860 
it then it runs down into this hole
chamber<00:02:37.860> here<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.880> where<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.599> cheetah

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
chamber here is where the cheetah

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.500 
chamber here is where the cheetah
morphic<00:02:40.170> algae<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.950> basically<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.299> water

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
morphic algae is and basically the water

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.039 
morphic algae is and basically the water
just<00:02:42.870> runs<00:02:43.470> up<00:02:43.739> side<00:02:44.580> there<00:02:44.849> this<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.720> an<00:02:45.900> old

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
just runs up side there this is an old

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.130 
just runs up side there this is an old
one<00:02:46.140> before<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.160> had<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.900> didn't<00:02:48.900> have<00:02:49.019> my

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
one before I had the didn't have my

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.160 
one before I had the didn't have my
skimmer<00:02:49.819> at<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.940> time<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.720> doesn't<00:02:51.930> fit

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
skimmer at the time it that doesn't fit

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.620 
skimmer at the time it that doesn't fit
anymore<00:02:52.380> so<00:02:52.769> this<00:02:53.610> one<00:02:53.819> I<00:02:53.849> made<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.269> definitely

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
anymore so this one I made is definitely

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.309 
anymore so this one I made is definitely
better<00:02:54.750> made<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> little<00:02:55.769> bit<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:57.319> thicker

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
better made a little bit of thicker

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:05.539 
better made a little bit of thicker
acrylic<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:01.190> works<00:03:02.190> good<00:03:03.049> have<00:03:04.049> my<00:03:04.549> heater

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
acrylic so works good have my heater
