00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
going to go much like two or three more

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.290 
going to go much like two or three more
of<00:02:15.470> these<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:15.830> after<00:02:16.430> year<00:02:16.610> tutorial

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
of these and after year tutorial

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.380 
of these and after year tutorial
probably<00:02:17.990> yes<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.550> if<00:02:19.730> this<00:02:20.150> gets

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
probably yes this is if this gets

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.670 
probably yes this is if this gets
popular<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.470> popular<00:02:22.250> enough<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:23.650> when<00:02:24.650> I

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
popular in a popular enough and when I

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.760 
popular in a popular enough and when I
get<00:02:24.950> them<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.990> because<00:02:26.990> if<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.320> smarter

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
get them and because if I the smarter

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.160 
get them and because if I the smarter
this<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.070> mean<00:02:28.280> not<00:02:28.880> know<00:02:29.120> how<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.330> rebuild<00:02:29.930> or

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
this I mean not know how to rebuild or

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.510 
this I mean not know how to rebuild or
something<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:32.150> guess<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.080> could<00:02:33.320> put<00:02:33.530> instead

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
something I guess you could put instead
