Strike Fighter I flew first flight on
the<00:00:19.170> airplane<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.710> since<00:00:20.010> then<00:00:20.220> I've<00:00:20.369> flown<00:00:20.610> a

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
the airplane and since then I've flown a

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.190 
the airplane and since then I've flown a
little<00:00:21.060> over<00:00:21.240> 50<00:00:21.599> flights<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.320> f-35<00:00:22.890> area

little over 50 flights in the f-35 area

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.510 
little over 50 flights in the f-35 area
in<00:00:25.200> the<00:00:25.290> early<00:00:25.500> days<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.890> Stovall<00:00:26.250> flying

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
in the early days of Stovall flying

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.189 
in the early days of Stovall flying
there<00:00:26.820> was<00:00:26.940> the<00:00:27.060> Harrier<00:00:27.390> but<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.840> was<00:00:27.960> very

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
there was the Harrier but it was very

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.830 
there was the Harrier but it was very
work<00:00:28.650> intensive<00:00:29.190> for<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.430> pilot<00:00:29.789> since<00:00:30.630> then

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
work intensive for the pilot since then

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.510 
work intensive for the pilot since then
one<00:00:31.110> of<00:00:31.199> our<00:00:31.289> contract<00:00:31.800> requirements<00:00:32.400> has

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
one of our contract requirements has

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.660 
one of our contract requirements has
been<00:00:32.699> to<00:00:32.820> make<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.750> Stovall<00:00:34.350> flying<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:35.489> be

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
been to make this Stovall flying to be

been to make this Stovall flying to be
very<00:00:35.910> easy<00:00:36.180> for<00:00:36.330> the<00:00:36.540> pilot<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.500> technology

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
very easy for the pilot the technology

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.009 
very easy for the pilot the technology
advancements<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.820> computers<00:00:39.300> basically<00:00:39.900> the

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
advancements in computers basically the

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.870 
advancements in computers basically the

the<00:00:44.100> integration<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.790> two<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.180> really

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the integration of the two is really

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.080 
the integration of the two is really
what's<00:00:45.600> made<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.020> possible<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> f-35

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
what's made this possible in the f-35

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.940 
what's made this possible in the f-35
the<00:00:48.480> way<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> pilot<00:00:48.989> controls<00:00:49.350> his<00:00:49.500> height<00:00:49.739> is

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
the way the pilot controls his height is

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.250 
the way the pilot controls his height is
with<00:00:50.399> his<00:00:50.520> right<00:00:50.760> hand<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.180> stick<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.989> same

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
with his right hand is stick the same

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.350 
with his right hand is stick the same
way<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.710> zero<00:00:52.980> knots<00:00:53.219> as<00:00:53.430> he<00:00:53.520> does<00:00:53.700> at<00:00:53.820> 500

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
way and zero knots as he does at 500

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.330 
way and zero knots as he does at 500
knots<00:00:54.540> pushed<00:00:55.350> forward<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.860> go<00:00:55.980> down<00:00:56.219> and

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
knots pushed forward you go down and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.069 
knots pushed forward you go down and
pull<00:00:56.489> back<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.879> go<00:00:57.000> up<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:57.930> all

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
pull back you go up so it's all

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.170 
pull back you go up so it's all
consistent<00:00:58.559> learning<00:00:58.950> but<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.640> important

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
consistent learning but the important

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.090 
consistent learning but the important
thing<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.690> pilot<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.440> let's<00:01:01.920> go

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
thing is the pilot if you just let's go

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.500 
thing is the pilot if you just let's go
with<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.309> stick<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.700> airplane<00:01:03.000> will<00:01:03.120> stay<00:01:03.300> Ward

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
with a stick the airplane will stay Ward

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.450 
with a stick the airplane will stay Ward
is<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.690> Harrier<00:01:04.140> doesn't<00:01:04.470> do<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.770> it

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
is the Harrier doesn't do that it

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.980 
is the Harrier doesn't do that it
requires<00:01:05.820> constant<00:01:06.210> attention<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.750> stay

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
requires constant attention to stay

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.550 
requires constant attention to stay
there

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.069 

as<00:01:10.549> you<00:01:10.790> look<00:01:10.970> at<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.180> video<00:01:11.420> of<00:01:11.720> Graham

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
as you look at the video of Graham

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.719 
as you look at the video of Graham
Tomlinson<00:01:12.649> coming<00:01:12.950> in<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.280> do<00:01:13.399> the<00:01:13.520> first

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
Tomlinson coming in to do the first

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.510 
Tomlinson coming in to do the first
vertical<00:01:13.970> landing<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:15.170> notice<00:01:15.530> what<00:01:16.280> looks

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
vertical landing you notice what looks

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.550 
vertical landing you notice what looks
almost<00:01:16.759> like<00:01:17.090> graty's<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.140> in<00:01:18.200> fact<00:01:18.409> that's

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
almost like graty's and in fact that's

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.200 
almost like graty's and in fact that's
what<00:01:18.680> Graham<00:01:18.979> said<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:19.369> was<00:01:19.549> was<00:01:19.759> very<00:01:19.970> easy

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
what Graham said it was was very easy

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.179 
what Graham said it was was very easy
we'd<00:01:21.020> worked<00:01:21.259> very<00:01:21.470> hard<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.829> make<00:01:21.979> that

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
we'd worked very hard to make that

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:22.719 
we'd worked very hard to make that
happen

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
happen

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.460 
happen
conventional<00:01:23.600> airplanes<00:01:23.930> when<00:01:24.079> you<00:01:24.170> come<00:01:24.350> in

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
conventional airplanes when you come in

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.960 
conventional airplanes when you come in
there'd<00:01:24.619> be<00:01:24.710> a<00:01:24.740> great<00:01:24.979> deal<00:01:25.159> of<00:01:25.189> wondering

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
there'd be a great deal of wondering

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.029 
there'd be a great deal of wondering
about<00:01:26.380> positioning<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.560> those<00:01:27.740> type<00:01:28.009> of

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
about positioning and those type of

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.190 
about positioning and those type of
things<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:28.850> controlling<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:29.750> hover<00:01:29.929> very

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
things and controlling the hover very

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.100 
things and controlling the hover very
precisely<00:01:30.619> well<00:01:31.220> with<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.490> f-35<00:01:32.090> because<00:01:32.960> the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
precisely well with the f-35 because the

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.620 
precisely well with the f-35 because the
integrated<00:01:33.530> flight<00:01:33.679> propulsion<00:01:34.310> system<00:01:35.210> it

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
integrated flight propulsion system it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.080 
integrated flight propulsion system it
it<00:01:36.409> was<00:01:36.560> very<00:01:36.740> easy<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.280> systems<00:01:37.610> doing<00:01:37.880> most

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
it was very easy the systems doing most

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.520 
it was very easy the systems doing most
of<00:01:38.179> the<00:01:38.270> hard<00:01:38.450> work<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:38.869> pilots<00:01:39.229> simply

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
of the hard work the pilots simply

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.630 
of the hard work the pilots simply
making<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.950> decision<00:01:40.220> where<00:01:40.549> he<00:01:40.640> wants<00:01:40.909> to<00:01:41.030> go

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
making a decision where he wants to go

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.830 
making a decision where he wants to go
you<00:01:43.640> know<00:01:43.729> one<00:01:43.909> of<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.060> truly<00:01:44.270> incredible
