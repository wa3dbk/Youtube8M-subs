00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
the main vent for the console no vents

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.970 
the main vent for the console no vents
on<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.180> bottom<00:02:38.540> also<00:02:39.110> there's<00:02:39.290> event<00:02:39.680> on<00:02:39.830> each

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
on the bottom also there's event on each

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.930 
on the bottom also there's event on each
side<00:02:40.280> let's<00:02:41.120> take<00:02:41.300> a<00:02:41.330> look<00:02:41.570> at<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.870> front<00:02:42.940> so

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
side let's take a look at the front so

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.640 
side let's take a look at the front so
you<00:02:43.970> can<00:02:44.240> see<00:02:44.570> it's<00:02:44.750> pretty<00:02:45.170> much<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.500> same

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
you can see it's pretty much the same

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.260 
you can see it's pretty much the same
layout<00:02:45.860> as<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.250> first<00:02:46.550> console<00:02:47.000> that<00:02:47.120> ever

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
layout as the first console that ever

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.440 
layout as the first console that ever
came<00:02:47.480> out<00:02:47.540> for<00:02:47.990> xbox<00:02:48.980> 360<00:02:49.370> except<00:02:49.760> these

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
came out for xbox 360 except these

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.530 
came out for xbox 360 except these
buttons<00:02:50.959> now<00:02:51.200> are<00:02:51.440> now<00:02:51.830> touch<00:02:52.430> sensors<00:02:52.850> so

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
buttons now are now touch sensors so

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.270 
buttons now are now touch sensors so
that<00:02:53.570> is<00:02:54.050> a<00:02:54.080> touch<00:02:54.320> sensor<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.040> power

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
that is a touch sensor and the power

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.490 
that is a touch sensor and the power
button<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.580> attention<00:02:55.880> sir<00:02:56.180> under<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.260> store

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
button is attention sir under the store

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.500

just<00:02:57.530> like<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.010> old<00:02:58.100> console<00:02:58.580> is<00:02:58.760> two<00:02:59.000> USB

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
just like the old console is two USB

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.610 
just like the old console is two USB
ports<00:02:59.650> so<00:03:00.650> now<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:02.020> will<00:03:03.020> show<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.440> a

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
ports so now I will show you a

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.490 
ports so now I will show you a
comparison<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.910> old<00:03:05.030> console<00:03:05.420> alright<00:03:06.320> so

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
comparison to the old console alright so

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.800 
comparison to the old console alright so
here<00:03:06.770> it<00:03:06.980> is<00:03:07.010> next<00:03:07.670> right<00:03:07.730> next<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.420> my<00:03:08.570> old

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
here it is next right next to the my old

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.740 
here it is next right next to the my old
console<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.380> can<00:03:09.410> see<00:03:09.770> it<00:03:09.980> is<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:11.180> fair<00:03:11.630> bit

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
console you can see it is a fair bit

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.710 
console you can see it is a fair bit
smaller<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.620> it's<00:03:13.310> just<00:03:13.610> less<00:03:14.030> bulky<00:03:14.690> than

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
smaller and it's just less bulky than

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.410 
smaller and it's just less bulky than
the<00:03:15.260> old<00:03:15.470> one<00:03:15.650> go<00:03:16.370> ahead<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.760> take<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.030> look<00:03:17.120> at

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
the old one go ahead and take a look at

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.820 
the old one go ahead and take a look at
the<00:03:17.540> bottom<00:03:17.989> all<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.260> way<00:03:18.290> up<00:03:18.440> you<00:03:18.560> can<00:03:18.680> see

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
the bottom all the way up you can see

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.220 
the bottom all the way up you can see
they<00:03:18.950> are<00:03:18.980> pretty<00:03:19.250> much<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.640> same<00:03:19.820> layout

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
they are pretty much the same layout

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.440 
they are pretty much the same layout
just<00:03:21.230> right<00:03:21.739> at<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:21.950> top<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.430> black<00:03:23.030> one<00:03:23.269> is<00:03:23.300> a

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
just right at the top the black one is a

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.320 
just right at the top the black one is a
little<00:03:23.690> bit<00:03:23.780> shorter<00:03:24.200> so<00:03:25.190> as<00:03:25.580> you<00:03:25.820> can<00:03:25.940> see<00:03:26.150> the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
little bit shorter so as you can see the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.690 
little bit shorter so as you can see the
black<00:03:26.600> one<00:03:26.840> is<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:26.989> little<00:03:27.230> bit<00:03:27.350> longer<00:03:27.709> than

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
black one is a little bit longer than

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.590 
black one is a little bit longer than
the<00:03:29.180> white<00:03:29.750> one<00:03:30.040> so<00:03:31.040> setting<00:03:31.519> them<00:03:31.670> side<00:03:32.570> by

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
the white one so setting them side by

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.120 
the white one so setting them side by
side<00:03:32.780> as<00:03:33.320> they<00:03:33.470> would<00:03:33.590> sit<00:03:33.800> under<00:03:34.010> your

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
side as they would sit under your

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.680 
side as they would sit under your
television<00:03:34.580> set<00:03:34.790> or<00:03:34.820> wherever<00:03:35.300> you<00:03:35.390> would<00:03:35.480> put

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
television set or wherever you would put

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.530 
television set or wherever you would put
them<00:03:35.980> you<00:03:36.980> can<00:03:37.160> see<00:03:37.400> that<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.940> new<00:03:38.060> slim<00:03:38.209> is

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
them you can see that the new slim is

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.960 
them you can see that the new slim is
slightly<00:03:38.870> smaller<00:03:39.230> in<00:03:40.190> most<00:03:40.430> aspects

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
slightly smaller in most aspects

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.930 
slightly smaller in most aspects
compared<00:03:41.840> to<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.019> old<00:03:42.170> one<00:03:42.340> as<00:03:43.340> I<00:03:43.400> stated<00:03:43.730> in

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
compared to the old one as I stated in

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.780 
compared to the old one as I stated in
the<00:03:44.060> unboxing<00:03:44.810> part<00:03:45.080> of<00:03:45.170> this<00:03:45.290> video<00:03:45.890> the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
the unboxing part of this video the

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.000 
the unboxing part of this video the
controllers<00:03:47.420> are<00:03:47.450> very<00:03:48.200> slightly<00:03:48.530> different

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
controllers are very slightly different

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.490 
controllers are very slightly different
you<00:03:49.580> can<00:03:49.760> see<00:03:49.940> that<00:03:49.970> this<00:03:50.390> is<00:03:50.660> actually<00:03:50.930> shiny

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
you can see that this is actually shiny

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.890 
you can see that this is actually shiny
and<00:03:51.769> this<00:03:52.400> is<00:03:52.580> actually<00:03:52.730> mat<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:53.480> is<00:03:53.750> the

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
and this is actually mat so that is the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.229 
and this is actually mat so that is the
only<00:03:54.050> difference<00:03:54.320> in<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:54.860> controllers<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.580> was

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
only difference in the controllers I was

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.110 
only difference in the controllers I was
hoping<00:03:56.660> that<00:03:56.920> on<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.160> new<00:03:58.310> one<00:03:58.550> they<00:03:58.970> would

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
hoping that on the new one they would

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.720 
hoping that on the new one they would
have<00:03:59.269> that<00:03:59.480> transforming<00:04:00.140> d-pad<00:04:00.530> but<00:04:01.250> they

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
have that transforming d-pad but they

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.130 
have that transforming d-pad but they
didn't<00:04:02.000> include<00:04:02.150> that<00:04:02.269> type<00:04:02.600> of<00:04:02.630> controller

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
didn't include that type of controller

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.140 
didn't include that type of controller
so<00:04:03.380> it<00:04:03.500> is<00:04:03.590> exactly<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.160> same<00:04:04.340> except<00:04:05.000> for

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
so it is exactly the same except for

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.860 
so it is exactly the same except for
that<00:04:05.239> very<00:04:06.080> minor<00:04:06.320> detail<00:04:07.360> alright<00:04:08.360> so<00:04:08.630> now<00:04:08.810> we

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
that very minor detail alright so now we

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.640 
that very minor detail alright so now we
are<00:04:09.290> going<00:04:09.470> to<00:04:09.799> do<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.070> sound<00:04:10.760> comparison
