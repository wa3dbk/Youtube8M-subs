00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
so how do you straighten a crooked image

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.640 
so how do you straighten a crooked image
this<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.130> picture<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.269> sea<00:00:15.690> with<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
this is a picture of the sea with the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
now I want to create a new image from

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.860 
now I want to create a new image from
the<00:02:15.300> copy<00:02:15.540> excel<00:02:16.050> file<00:02:16.320> new<00:02:16.830> image<00:02:17.870> create

the copy excel file new image create
image<00:02:19.290> from<00:02:19.590> clipboard<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:22.140> I've<00:02:22.350> got<00:02:22.560> to

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
image from clipboard and I've got to

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.330 
image from clipboard and I've got to
here's<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.850> new<00:02:24.300> image<00:02:24.810> with<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:26.010> straight

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.000 
so the image on the left is the original
the<00:02:33.750> one<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.200> right<00:02:34.410> is<00:02:34.650> with<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
the one on the right is with the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.680 
the one on the right is with the
straight<00:02:35.400> horizon<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.180> probably<00:02:36.510> could<00:02:36.630> have

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
straight horizon a probably could have

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.530 
straight horizon a probably could have
tilted<00:02:36.960> it<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.320> bit<00:02:37.470> more<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.120> changed

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
tilted it a bit more and it's changed

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.960 
tilted it a bit more and it's changed
slightly<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:40.020> size<00:02:40.290> now<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:41.460> reaching<00:02:41.670> over

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
slightly the size now in reaching over

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.810 
slightly the size now in reaching over
640<00:02:42.540> by<00:02:42.660> 4<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.050> 6<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:43.620> one<00:02:43.800> is<00:02:43.920> now<00:02:44.100> 6<00:02:44.370> 8<00:02:44.550> 2

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
640 by 4 to 6 and this one is now 6 8 2

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.890 
640 by 4 to 6 and this one is now 6 8 2
times<00:02:45.750> 3<00:02:46.080> 8<00:02:46.200> 5<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:47.060> then<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.090> can<00:02:48.390> adjust<00:02:48.540> it

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
times 3 8 5 and then you can adjust it

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.690 
times 3 8 5 and then you can adjust it
if<00:02:49.020> you<00:02:49.110> want<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:49.710> normal<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.520> image

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
if you want to so normal the image

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.280 
if you want to so normal the image
brightness<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.270> contrast<00:02:51.390> may<00:02:51.990> be<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.170> little

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
brightness and contrast may be a little

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.110 
brightness and contrast may be a little
brighter

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
brighter

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.730 
brighter

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
what if you want to do adjust and change

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.840 
what if you want to do adjust and change
it<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.220> then<00:02:56.750> save<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.310> can<00:02:59.460> close<00:02:59.640> this

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
it and then save it so I can close this

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.270 
it and then save it so I can close this
one<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.290> don't<00:03:01.350> want<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.740> save<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:01.950> one

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
one and I don't want to save that one

this<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.670> my<00:03:02.910> new<00:03:03.150> one<00:03:04.130> file<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.640> save<00:03:05.940> and

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
this is my new one file and save and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.240 
this is my new one file and save and

JPEG<00:03:08.730> get<00:03:08.880> 100%<00:03:10.910> okay<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:13.560> give<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.130> another

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
JPEG get 100% okay and give it another

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.110 
JPEG get 100% okay and give it another
name<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.760> it's<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:18.000> straight<00:03:18.300> horizon<00:03:19.940> into<00:03:20.940> the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
name so it's a straight horizon into the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.800 
name so it's a straight horizon into the
Downloads<00:03:21.330> folder<00:03:21.630> there's<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.680> original

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
Downloads folder there's the original

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.470 
Downloads folder there's the original
with<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.930> yellow<00:03:25.110> line<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:26.210> the<00:03:27.210> straight

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
with the yellow line and the straight

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.290 
with the yellow line and the straight
one<00:03:28.790> so<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:29.910> it's<00:03:30.300> somewhat<00:03:30.630> straighter

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
one so this it's somewhat straighter

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.600 
one so this it's somewhat straighter
that's<00:03:33.300> all<00:03:33.420> for<00:03:33.570> now
