00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:16.040
 Hello, I would like to say 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.040
 a few words about this knives ganzo g704 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.220
 I would like to briefly just talk about 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.220
 features of operation of this 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.220
 unit 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.680
 as I said earlier you can 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.440
 watch about this video 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.379
 this knife is on my pocket 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.070
 constantly that is both in the city and in the forest on 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:48.960
 fishing and everywhere 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:51.180
 It means globally this knife did not drag 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.280
 in general, that is, not as cut out of the box 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.160
 so cuts the only thing that his 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.859
 corrected the misfortune there and then it came 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.680
 already up to simple that is, to me roughly speaking 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.060
 too lazy to get a sharpener there to deploy 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.119
 and and 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:16.409
 soak in the water to me yes and sharpen a knife 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:18.720
 and I ordered small such pebbles and on 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.270
 these stones roughly speaking on hands in 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.790
 field conditions just undermines the knife 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.610
 what is it 4 times respectively 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.079
 of course so exactly perfect even 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:38.540
 cutting edge per pixel slope of apex 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:43.229
 van does not work but the knife cuts shaves 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:46.670
 does anything but this knife 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.670
 Came without a cover and yes 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.710
 in order to wear this little 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.850
 set naborchik to me and took this 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.760
 Cheholchik from someone else Chinese 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.770
 Knife Russians rest up 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.280
 in which there are two offices then 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.530
 I have a knife in one 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.530
 friend here in this pimply film 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:19.020
 there are stones like this 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.440
 rude yes im practically i'm not 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:27.680
 used at all these little ones 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.390
 just stuck 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:35.250
 I can of course be mistaken now by 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:40.190
 grains but this one is a stone 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.580
 my according to the seller 8000 is 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:47.810
 10-12 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.810
 this is grit 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:59.530
 5-6 thousand and this strange variation was 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.180
 listed there is one and a half to two thousand 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:07.520
 in principle to me with my work 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:10.220
 copes and that is just on hand 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.480
 take and our task in the field 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.540
 pretty comfortable 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:23.920
 no problem one more thing which 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.920
 I would like to voice a knife 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.050
 made of steel 447 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.380
 seemingly stainless steel 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.330
 but it is really stainless that is 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.720
 if I'm fishing let's say I cleaned it 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:55.100
 some kind of fish there was cutting planed 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:59.180
 derevyahu moistened pro mac washed in water 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.730
 closed well and put it in his pocket he 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.120
 lay in a pocket that is flesh there until 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.820
 arrival at home, and the water became again 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.840
 under water, that is, dried everything and everything 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:17.260
 well spent with my everything is fine everything 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:23.020
 fine but i live in the far east and 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:27.170
 we are very high humidity 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.780
 in the summer and in the winter, too, but in the summer is very 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:33.920
 high humidity meaning percent up 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.960
 90 humid climate and accordingly 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.660
 you have worked intensively once 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.070
 moving yes you sweat so much 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.430
 drew attention to the following that is 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.100
 that literally gets a drop just by 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:54.650
 then yes here on this knife on the blade somewhere 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:56.840
 here something like this or are you there for them 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.910
 doing at home there is dirty and steaming 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.950
 you just take this one yourself 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.810
 so the shirt is there that they hop hop it 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:07.520
 udir quick shirt wet and 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.590
 soaked with yours then yes then literally 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:15.070
 after a few hours on the blade 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:18.920
 appear right here appear 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.070
 stains fine rust stains stains 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:25.060
 petting 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:30.720
 but as it would be quickly noticed 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:35.220
 to this the problem there was no 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:41.020
 just takes its this thing 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:45.880
 water 40 and the blade is wiped by her all 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:48.700
 quickly removes them but for some reason 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.700
 here is a drop of sweat when it hits 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.960
 it is from salty that this is Wednesday 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:58.960
 I don't even know why, although in principle 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.970
 repeatedly there was a lemon cut and even 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.900
 this one must be thrown simply and 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:09.010
 there 5-6 mm hours lay there did not wash 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:13.030
 smiling at all there was nothing then just 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:17.940
 picked up a damp cloth rubbed or brushed 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.940
 with its soap and everything is fine here and here 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:25.300
 very strange behavior 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.290
 this steel is salty 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:31.090
 let's say environment 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:33.550
 namely human specifically so 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.919
 be careful and watch your 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:40.720
 knives 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.720
 all thanks, goodbye
