00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.080
 Hello everybody, How are you 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.280
 Today I came to bring a recipe from a 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.010
 Nail Strengthener 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.509
 the strengthening pump as they are saying 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.130
 around 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:22.380
 good my nails they are like this 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:25.650
 very short and super fragile them 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.949
 have grown until last year but they 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.640
 They have always been very fragile and begins a 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.390
 white march on the nail and quickly 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.180
 break and I liked I always have to 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.570
 put a dark enamel looks like this and 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.879
 Maybe it's just more for me. 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.559
 It seems to work and if I leave 6 mode 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.260
 quickly she breaks very fragile 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.079
 even then I saw this recipe had and 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.910
 I'll share with you and for once. 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.609
 in when I'll do an update and 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.000
 show my nails to see if 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.830
 It really works and it's us. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.240
 need garlic 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:13.290
 we need a stud we also need 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.619
 one base I'll use this horse bark and 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.220
 I also thought I'd use this pot here. 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.799
 enamel dune that is very light 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.759
 because my empowering base is 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.890
 full 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:31.049
 I think I do not want to throw away 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.360
 Here the good garlic in there with oo 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.360
 car so I think I'll use 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.030
 in that first and fuck the effect I 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.540
 I'll also do it on the basis of it 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.049
 We're going to need a garlic roaster. 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.030
 For us it is but next to it, there are some 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.869
 that cuts if you wanted too can 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:56.100
 cut but I think I'm going to but the good 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.939
 My agent is here I will cascado 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.939
 write him 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:24.210
 and I'll put in that non-base part is 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.960
 but he is very bright will serve as 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.960
 low 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.640
 I'll start by putting nail 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.670
 I'll put it with the help of this toothpick 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.670
 here to make things easier 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:06.939
 the pac mix is ready with 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:14.590
 lemon will be as follows you 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:18.730
 cut the lemon and please in this tip of the 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.909
 lemon here if you do it at night or 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.329
 make a place in which you do not only 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:29.909
 because otherwise it can stain us 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.909
 pass the lemon the nails like that 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.670
 and we'll leave it for more or less 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.670
 five minutes 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.580
 so the nail lines are now 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.930
 It's five past five 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.600
 with lemon and now we're going 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.380
 passing our base is I'm going to try to use 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.830
 at least twice a week but if 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:09.170

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.170
