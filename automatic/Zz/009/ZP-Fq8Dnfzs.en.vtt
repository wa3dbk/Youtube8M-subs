my name is Joe North I'm the vice
president<00:00:25.950> of<00:00:26.430> littoral<00:00:26.730> ship<00:00:27.090> systems<00:00:27.539> we're

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.290 
president of littoral ship systems we're

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.859 
president of littoral ship systems we're
in<00:00:28.410> Paris<00:00:28.860> at<00:00:29.189> urine<00:00:29.850> eval<00:00:30.150> which<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
in Paris at urine eval which is the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.979 
in Paris at urine eval which is the
largest<00:00:31.350> naval<00:00:32.309> show<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.540> held<00:00:33.750> within

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.490 

this<00:00:45.920> ship<00:00:46.280> class<00:00:46.579> in<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:47.570> US<00:00:47.840> Navy<00:00:48.140> is

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
this ship class in the US Navy is

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.670 
this ship class in the US Navy is
replacing<00:00:49.219> three<00:00:49.750> three<00:00:50.750> other<00:00:50.899> ship<00:00:51.199> classes

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
replacing three three other ship classes

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.069 
replacing three three other ship classes
so<00:00:52.220> we<00:00:52.250> got<00:00:52.489> one<00:00:52.730> ship<00:00:53.030> coming<00:00:53.300> in<00:00:53.510> replacing

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
so we got one ship coming in replacing

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.830 
so we got one ship coming in replacing
three<00:00:54.410> others<00:00:54.940> those<00:00:55.940> ships<00:00:56.210> do<00:00:56.390> mine<00:00:56.600> warfare

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
three others those ships do mine warfare

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.619 
three others those ships do mine warfare
those<00:00:57.379> ships<00:00:57.649> do<00:00:57.860> ASW<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.030> those<00:00:59.149> ships<00:00:59.420> do

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
those ships do ASW and those ships do

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.170 
those ships do ASW and those ships do
surface<00:01:00.019> warfare<00:01:00.489> what<00:01:01.489> what<00:01:02.030> if<00:01:02.120> the

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
surface warfare what what if the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.200 
surface warfare what what if the
modularity<00:01:02.629> concept<00:01:03.320> is<00:01:03.699> we<00:01:04.699> can<00:01:04.879> bring<00:01:05.089> the

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
modularity concept is we can bring the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.330 
modularity concept is we can bring the
weapons<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:05.930> technology<00:01:06.619> develop<00:01:07.190> it

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
weapons and the technology develop it

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.810 
weapons and the technology develop it
off<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:08.240> ship<00:01:08.479> on<00:01:08.750> land<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.619> bring<00:01:10.340> that<00:01:10.520> back

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
off the ship on land and bring that back

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.670 
off the ship on land and bring that back
to<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.180> ship<00:01:11.420> when<00:01:11.720> it's<00:01:11.869> ready<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:12.409> it's

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
to the ship when it's ready and it's

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.520 
to the ship when it's ready and it's
it's<00:01:13.040> designed<00:01:13.490> to<00:01:13.640> a<00:01:13.670> standard<00:01:14.270> interface

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
it's designed to a standard interface

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.169 
it's designed to a standard interface
which<00:01:15.530> allows<00:01:15.860> them<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.250> plug<00:01:16.550> and<00:01:16.729> play<00:01:16.910> on

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
which allows them to plug and play on

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:23.780 
which allows them to plug and play on
the<00:01:17.300> ship

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.780 

we<00:01:24.540> worked<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.140> Navy<00:01:25.370> quite<00:01:26.370> a<00:01:26.400> bit<00:01:26.640> at

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
we worked with the Navy quite a bit at

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.580 
we worked with the Navy quite a bit at
the<00:01:26.880> beginning<00:01:27.380> clarifying<00:01:28.380> what

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the beginning clarifying what

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.140 
the beginning clarifying what
requirements<00:01:29.250> they<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.670> wanted<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> make

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
requirements they really wanted to make

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.400 
requirements they really wanted to make

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:44.070 
littoral ship systems
I<00:02:41.820> think<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.910> inherent<00:02:43.330> capabilities<00:02:43.930> of

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
I think the inherent capabilities of

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.370 
I think the inherent capabilities of
this<00:02:44.260> ship<00:02:44.560> meaning<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.160> it's<00:02:45.570> three<00:02:46.570> 3,500

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
this ship meaning that it's three 3,500

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.310 
this ship meaning that it's three 3,500
tons<00:02:47.620> or<00:02:47.800> less<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:49.090> she<00:02:49.209> has<00:02:49.300> shallow-draft

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
tons or less that she has shallow-draft

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.500 
tons or less that she has shallow-draft
it<00:02:50.830> has<00:02:50.980> some<00:02:51.160> great<00:02:51.340> functionality<00:02:51.610> in<00:02:52.300> the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
it has some great functionality in the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.490 
it has some great functionality in the
stern<00:02:53.080> ramp<00:02:53.350> area<00:02:53.620> of<00:02:54.120> reconfigurable<00:02:55.120> zones

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
stern ramp area of reconfigurable zones

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.720 
stern ramp area of reconfigurable zones
those<00:02:56.500> are<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:56.800> key<00:02:56.950> features<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.490> I<00:02:57.550> have
