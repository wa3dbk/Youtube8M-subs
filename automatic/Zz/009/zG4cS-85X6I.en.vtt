00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
to give it a rating i'll probably give

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.279 
to give it a rating i'll probably give
an<00:04:14.549> 8<00:04:14.730> out<00:04:14.879> of<00:04:14.910> 10<00:04:15.120> just<00:04:15.690> because<00:04:15.930> there's<00:04:16.109> no

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
an 8 out of 10 just because there's no

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.930 
an 8 out of 10 just because there's no
differences<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.889> the<00:04:16.919> original<00:04:17.400> version<00:04:17.519> and

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
differences to the original version and

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.979 
differences to the original version and
it<00:04:18.239> would<00:04:18.329> have<00:04:18.419> been<00:04:18.479> nice<00:04:18.660> see<00:04:18.810> some

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
it would have been nice see some

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.810 
it would have been nice see some
accelerometer<00:04:19.650> use<00:04:19.799> in<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.070> game<00:04:20.220> would<00:04:20.760> I

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
accelerometer use in the game would I

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.880
