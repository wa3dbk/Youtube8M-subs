00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
first up we haven't altered them the

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.979 
first up we haven't altered them the
motors<00:00:44.860> in<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:45.070> cars<00:00:45.309> they<00:00:45.580> are<00:00:45.610> standard<00:00:46.300> the

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
motors in the cars they are standard the

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.720 
motors in the cars they are standard the
only<00:00:47.170> things<00:00:47.350> that<00:00:47.500> have<00:00:47.530> changed<00:00:47.620> on<00:00:48.340> this

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.219 
and out the box this is going to show
the<00:01:05.680> difference<00:01:05.890> of<00:01:06.490> having<00:01:06.940> the<00:01:07.660> standard

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
the difference of having the standard

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.260 
the difference of having the standard
magnet<00:01:08.830> you<00:01:08.920> get<00:01:09.100> every<00:01:09.580> other<00:01:09.700> single<00:01:09.940> scalar

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
magnet you get every other single scalar

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.330 
magnet you get every other single scalar
car<00:01:10.630> that<00:01:10.810> they've<00:01:10.930> made<00:01:11.140> compared<00:01:12.100> to<00:01:12.220> the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
car that they've made compared to the

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.359 
car that they've made compared to the
new<00:01:12.520> much<00:01:13.180> smaller<00:01:13.539> much<00:01:14.140> worse<00:01:14.500> which<00:01:15.190> will

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
new much smaller much worse which will

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.000 
new much smaller much worse which will
stupid<00:01:15.960> magnet<00:01:16.960> in<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.380> new<00:01:18.070> cup<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:20.020> also<00:01:20.619> to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
stupid magnet in the new cup and also to

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.469 
stupid magnet in the new cup and also to
make<00:01:21.190> sure<00:01:21.220> to<00:01:21.909> show<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:22.119> that<00:01:22.330> we're<00:01:22.450> not

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
make sure to show you that we're not

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.500 
make sure to show you that we're not
like<00:01:23.460> slate<00:01:24.460> in<00:01:24.610> this<00:01:24.760> car<00:01:24.970> we're<00:01:25.180> going<00:01:25.360> to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
like slate in this car we're going to

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.539 
like slate in this car we're going to
have<00:01:25.630> compare<00:01:26.170> it<00:01:26.320> to<00:01:26.500> say<00:01:26.710> one<00:01:27.400> of<00:01:27.490> the

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
have compare it to say one of the

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.080 
have compare it to say one of the
best-selling<00:01:27.970> cars<00:01:28.299> the<00:01:29.049> Audi<00:01:29.380> r8<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:29.950> we<00:01:30.880> may

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
best-selling cars the Audi r8 and we may

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.080 
best-selling cars the Audi r8 and we may
compare<00:01:31.659> it<00:01:32.110> to<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.680> Aston<00:01:33.159> Martin<00:01:33.189> which<00:01:33.939> is

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
compare it to the Aston Martin which is

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.830 
compare it to the Aston Martin which is
another<00:01:34.299> detail<00:01:34.540> car<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:37.240> this<00:01:37.659> will

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
another detail car so this will

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.280 
another detail car so this will
basically<00:01:37.960> show<00:01:38.409> what's<00:01:39.280> wrong<00:01:39.520> with<00:01:40.290> above

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
basically show what's wrong with above

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.480 
basically show what's wrong with above
obviously<00:01:41.770> both<00:01:41.920> of<00:01:42.010> these<00:01:42.070> cars<00:01:42.280> will<00:01:42.400> be

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
obviously both of these cars will be

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.039 
obviously both of these cars will be
detailed<00:01:42.760> that<00:01:43.090> we<00:01:43.180> are<00:01:43.270> testing<00:01:43.570> against<00:01:43.810> and

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
detailed that we are testing against and

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.440 
detailed that we are testing against and
then<00:01:44.290> for<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:44.920> super-resistant<00:01:45.520> video<00:01:46.150> we'll

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
then for the super-resistant video we'll

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.660 
then for the super-resistant video we'll
test<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:47.020> against<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.380> super<00:01:47.650> resistant<00:01:48.040> LD<00:01:48.369> and

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
test it against a super resistant LD and

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.500 
test it against a super resistant LD and
the<00:01:49.210> super<00:01:49.540> resistant<00:01:50.080> Jaguar<00:01:50.920> XKR

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.480 

okay<00:01:56.510> so<00:01:57.050> what<00:01:57.530> we're<00:01:57.620> gonna<00:01:57.680> do<00:01:57.830> is<00:01:57.950> five<00:01:58.220> laps

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
okay so what we're gonna do is five laps

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.850 
okay so what we're gonna do is five laps
of<00:01:58.640> this<00:01:58.820> track<00:01:59.300> and<00:01:59.510> it's<00:02:00.350> got<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.560> crossover

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
of this track and it's got a crossover

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.110 
of this track and it's got a crossover
in<00:02:01.010> it<00:02:01.160> so<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.310> have<00:02:01.430> to<00:02:01.490> go<00:02:01.580> around<00:02:01.640> tries<00:02:01.970> to

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
in it so you have to go around tries to

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.660 
in it so you have to go around tries to
get<00:02:02.240> on<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.930> we're<00:02:03.860> just<00:02:03.890> driving<00:02:04.220> the

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
get on that and we're just driving the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.260 
get on that and we're just driving the
Corvette<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.500> as<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:06.620> can<00:02:06.740> see<00:02:06.890> is<00:02:07.270> really

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
Corvette and as you can see is really

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.460 
Corvette and as you can see is really
hard<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.570> keep<00:02:08.750> on<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.020> track

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
hard to keep on the track

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.310 
hard to keep on the track
it's<00:02:10.300> terrible<00:02:11.300> round<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.600> corners<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.230> this

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
it's terrible round the corners and this

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.710 
it's terrible round the corners and this
is<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.590> unmodified<00:02:12.920> one<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.460> just<00:02:13.720> will

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
is the unmodified one that I just will

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.930 
is the unmodified one that I just will
not<00:02:14.840> stay<00:02:15.110> on<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.800> you<00:02:16.100> have<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.250> be<00:02:16.340> so

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.270 
for like a second
you<00:02:28.130> will<00:02:28.280> fall<00:02:28.520> off<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.820> trap<00:02:29.030> it's<00:02:29.300> like

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
you will fall off the trap it's like

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.440 
you will fall off the trap it's like
I've<00:02:31.280> never<00:02:31.520> driven<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:32.060> car<00:02:32.090> so<00:02:36.130> grip<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:37.450> that

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
I've never driven a car so grip and that

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.300 
I've never driven a car so grip and that
you<00:02:38.570> can<00:02:38.720> barely<00:02:38.900> put<00:02:39.170> any<00:02:39.350> power<00:02:39.680> down<00:02:39.950> before

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
you can barely put any power down before

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.820 
you can barely put any power down before
it<00:02:40.400> falls<00:02:40.640> off<00:02:40.910> it's<00:02:41.870> basically<00:02:42.500> driving

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
it falls off it's basically driving

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.920 
it falls off it's basically driving
about<00:02:43.100> our<00:02:43.280> magnet<00:02:43.700> I<00:02:43.880> mean<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.330> think<00:02:44.570> without

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
about our magnet I mean I think without

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.470 
about our magnet I mean I think without
a<00:02:45.080> magnet<00:02:45.590> you'd<00:02:46.310> actually<00:02:46.459> be<00:02:46.670> more<00:02:47.000> careful

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
a magnet you'd actually be more careful

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.330 
a magnet you'd actually be more careful
because<00:02:47.630> you<00:02:47.780> know<00:02:47.959> you've<00:02:48.140> got<00:02:48.350> you<00:02:49.100> know<00:02:49.250> you

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
because you know you've got you know you

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.850 
because you know you've got you know you
haven't<00:02:49.550> got<00:02:49.670> one<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.060> you're<00:02:50.270> like<00:02:50.860> drive

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
haven't got one so you're like drive

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.240 
haven't got one so you're like drive
better<00:02:52.130> but<00:02:52.510> just<00:02:53.709> it's<00:02:54.709> just<00:02:54.770> not<00:02:54.950> good

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
better but just it's just not good

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.370 
better but just it's just not good
enough<00:02:55.280> we<00:02:55.880> need<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.300> needs<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.570> lot<00:02:56.780> of<00:02:57.020> much

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
enough we need it needs a lot of much

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.520 
enough we need it needs a lot of much
better<00:02:57.590> magnet<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:59.090> did<00:02:59.390> that<00:03:00.110> this

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
better magnet and it did that this

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.990 
better magnet and it did that this
fastest<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:01.040> was<00:03:01.220> eight<00:03:01.489> point<00:03:01.880> three

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
fastest that was eight point three

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.900 
fastest that was eight point three
seconds<00:03:02.630> which<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:02.810> very<00:03:03.680> very<00:03:03.920> slow<00:03:04.070> for<00:03:04.790> this

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
seconds which is very very slow for this

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:12.370 
seconds which is very very slow for this
lane<00:03:05.810> it's<00:03:06.320> just<00:03:06.470> slow<00:03:10.660> same<00:03:11.660> set<00:03:11.900> up<00:03:11.989> five

magnet the correct size magnet shall we

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.050 
magnet the correct size magnet shall we
say<00:03:22.610> now<00:03:23.380> as<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:24.560> can<00:03:24.620> see<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.860> much<00:03:25.370> different

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
say now as you can see a much different

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.170 
say now as you can see a much different
like<00:03:26.750> much<00:03:27.680> larger<00:03:28.370> difference<00:03:28.730> compared<00:03:29.120> to

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
like much larger difference compared to

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.150 
like much larger difference compared to
the<00:03:29.239> car<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:30.200> car<00:03:30.440> will<00:03:30.620> go<00:03:30.799> around<00:03:30.980> the

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
the car the car will go around the

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.000 
the car the car will go around the
corner<00:03:31.640> you<00:03:32.420> can<00:03:32.570> push<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:33.019> more<00:03:33.230> it's<00:03:33.500> much

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
corner you can push it more it's much

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.640 
corner you can push it more it's much
more<00:03:34.220> faster<00:03:34.880> grip<00:03:35.420> smart<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:36.049> there's<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.350> lot

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
more faster grip smart and there's a lot

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.350 
more faster grip smart and there's a lot
more<00:03:36.799> fun<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.160> drive<00:03:37.310> and<00:03:37.910> like<00:03:38.180> its

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
more fun to drive and like its

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.539 
more fun to drive and like its
predecessor<00:03:39.230> which<00:03:39.380> is<00:03:39.530> difficult<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.310> drive

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
predecessor which is difficult to drive

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.220 
predecessor which is difficult to drive
and<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.989> shoots<00:03:42.709> round<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.280> mean<00:03:43.519> look<00:03:44.230> it

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
and it shoots round I mean look it

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.949 
and it shoots round I mean look it
really<00:03:46.070> kicks<00:03:46.340> out<00:03:46.549> its<00:03:46.880> slide<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.630> then<00:03:47.810> it

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
really kicks out its slide and then it

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.410 
really kicks out its slide and then it
just<00:03:48.170> it<00:03:48.730> flipped<00:03:49.730> in<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:49.940> middle<00:03:50.239> of<00:03:50.299> the

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
just it flipped in the middle of the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.039 
just it flipped in the middle of the
track<00:03:50.720> that's<00:03:50.930> how<00:03:51.140> I<00:03:51.700> like<00:03:52.700> how<00:03:53.540> far<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:53.959> can

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
track that's how I like how far you can

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.720 
track that's how I like how far you can
slide<00:03:54.410> that<00:03:54.590> car<00:03:54.830> before<00:03:54.950> actually<00:03:55.340> crashes

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
slide that car before actually crashes

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.330 
slide that car before actually crashes
I'm<00:03:55.880> going<00:03:56.750> round<00:03:56.870> it<00:03:57.200> as<00:03:57.500> fast<00:03:57.799> as<00:03:57.920> I<00:03:57.980> can<00:03:58.130> now

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
I'm going round it as fast as I can now

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.120 
I'm going round it as fast as I can now
it<00:03:58.760> was<00:03:59.209> falling<00:03:59.450> off<00:03:59.570> a<00:03:59.660> few<00:03:59.810> times<00:03:59.840> but<00:04:00.290> even

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
it was falling off a few times but even

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.599 
it was falling off a few times but even
with<00:04:01.549> that<00:04:01.580> it's<00:04:02.090> still<00:04:02.570> a<00:04:02.840> lot<00:04:03.799> lot<00:04:04.100> faster

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
with that it's still a lot lot faster

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.790 
with that it's still a lot lot faster
and<00:04:04.910> it<00:04:05.329> is<00:04:05.900> 5.9

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.990 

so<00:04:09.800> that<00:04:10.040> is<00:04:10.220> its<00:04:12.370> 3.4<00:04:13.370> seconds<00:04:13.730> faster<00:04:14.530> so

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
so that is its 3.4 seconds faster so

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.159 
so that is its 3.4 seconds faster so
that's<00:04:17.000> a<00:04:17.239> major<00:04:19.690> two<00:04:20.690> point<00:04:23.020> no<00:04:24.020> it's

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
that's a major two point no it's

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.420 
that's a major two point no it's
actually<00:04:24.320> a<00:04:24.560> two<00:04:25.130> point<00:04:26.169> something<00:04:27.430> anyway

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
actually a two point something anyway

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.000 
actually a two point something anyway
this<00:04:28.700> is<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:28.880> Aldi<00:04:29.210> now<00:04:29.330> same<00:04:29.780> cell<00:04:29.990> five<00:04:30.800> laps

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
this is the Aldi now same cell five laps

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.680 
this is the Aldi now same cell five laps

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
this is completely unmodified this car

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.170 
this is completely unmodified this car
it's<00:04:33.760> got<00:04:34.760> notes<00:04:35.120> under<00:04:35.630> tires<00:04:35.870> it's<00:04:36.200> got<00:04:36.440> the

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
it's got notes under tires it's got the

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.719 
it's got notes under tires it's got the
and<00:04:38.680> it's<00:04:39.680> straight<00:04:39.950> out<00:04:39.979> the<00:04:40.190> box<00:04:40.340> and<00:04:40.639> it's

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
and it's straight out the box and it's

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.540 
and it's straight out the box and it's
the<00:04:40.790> first<00:04:40.970> time<00:04:41.090> I'm<00:04:41.240> using<00:04:41.479> this<00:04:41.740> so<00:04:42.740> we'll

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
the first time I'm using this so we'll

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.230 
the first time I'm using this so we'll
just<00:04:43.729> watch<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.330> see<00:04:44.479> how<00:04:44.570> I'm<00:04:44.660> good<00:04:46.240> so

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
just watch and see how I'm good so

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.969 
just watch and see how I'm good so
that's<00:04:47.660> just<00:04:47.900> half<00:04:48.139> a<00:04:48.229> lap<00:04:48.350> and<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:48.680> only<00:04:48.860> bit

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
that's just half a lap and the only bit

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.580 
that's just half a lap and the only bit
of<00:04:49.010> struggles<00:04:49.430> out<00:04:49.520> it's<00:04:49.669> the<00:04:49.760> radius<00:04:50.030> one

of struggles out it's the radius one

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.870 
of struggles out it's the radius one
when<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.680> was<00:04:51.800> driving<00:04:51.950> it<00:04:52.190> it<00:04:52.280> didn't<00:04:52.460> feel<00:04:52.639> as

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
when I was driving it it didn't feel as

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.340 
when I was driving it it didn't feel as
fast<00:04:53.150> as<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:55.160> Corvette<00:04:55.610> I<00:04:55.850> was<00:04:56.840> pushing<00:04:57.139> it<00:04:57.290> as

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
fast as the Corvette I was pushing it as

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.830 
fast as the Corvette I was pushing it as
much<00:04:57.560> because<00:04:57.740> of<00:04:57.979> the<00:04:58.130> non<00:04:58.790> sanded<00:04:59.270> tires<00:04:59.479> and

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
much because of the non sanded tires and

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.240 
much because of the non sanded tires and
the<00:04:59.900> fact<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:00.169> he<00:05:00.770> hasn't<00:05:00.979> got<00:05:03.250> basically

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
the fact that he hasn't got basically

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.100 
the fact that he hasn't got basically
yeah<00:05:04.430> sounded<00:05:04.910> hurt<00:05:05.060> and<00:05:05.240> it's<00:05:05.389> a<00:05:05.479> new<00:05:05.660> car<00:05:05.960> as

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
yeah sounded hurt and it's a new car as

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.770 
yeah sounded hurt and it's a new car as
well<00:05:06.260> trying<00:05:06.800> to<00:05:06.860> damage<00:05:07.160> it<00:05:07.400> and<00:05:07.639> it<00:05:08.540> goes

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
well trying to damage it and it goes

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.310 
well trying to damage it and it goes
very<00:05:09.139> well<00:05:09.669> little<00:05:10.669> I<00:05:10.940> don't<00:05:11.660> think<00:05:11.990> I<00:05:12.080> crashed

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
very well little I don't think I crashed

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.620 
very well little I don't think I crashed
it<00:05:12.470> all<00:05:12.560> with<00:05:12.710> this<00:05:12.800> car<00:05:13.039> it's<00:05:13.789> hasn't<00:05:14.479> crashed

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
it all with this car it's hasn't crashed

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.170 
it all with this car it's hasn't crashed
yet<00:05:14.750> so<00:05:15.340> it's<00:05:16.340> just<00:05:16.520> going<00:05:16.729> around<00:05:16.880> quite

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
yet so it's just going around quite

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.020 
yet so it's just going around quite
nicely<00:05:17.389> it's<00:05:17.979> smooth<00:05:18.979> and<00:05:19.280> it's<00:05:19.400> consistent

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
nicely it's smooth and it's consistent

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:28.330 
nicely it's smooth and it's consistent
and<00:05:21.400> with<00:05:22.400> a<00:05:22.430> lap<00:05:22.700> time<00:05:22.970> on<00:05:25.000> 6.6<00:05:26.000> it's<00:05:27.340> just

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
and with a lap time on 6.6 it's just

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.070 
and with a lap time on 6.6 it's just
over<00:05:28.700> half<00:05:28.910> a<00:05:29.030> second<00:05:29.330> slower<00:05:29.389> but<00:05:29.810> you<00:05:29.960> can

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
over half a second slower but you can

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.450 
over half a second slower but you can
easily<00:05:30.200> make<00:05:30.440> that<00:05:30.560> up<00:05:30.710> with<00:05:30.889> sanding<00:05:31.370> the

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
easily make that up with sanding the

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.659 
easily make that up with sanding the
tires<00:05:31.700> and<00:05:32.200> changing<00:05:33.200> some<00:05:33.350> things<00:05:33.590> on<00:05:33.740> it

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
did and I'm just checking it to see if

so again in five laps and it's going to

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.180 
so again in five laps and it's going to
see<00:05:52.400> we're<00:05:52.550> going<00:05:52.669> to<00:05:52.760> see<00:05:52.820> how<00:05:53.240> it<00:05:53.919> matches<00:05:54.919> up

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
see we're going to see how it matches up

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.029 
see we're going to see how it matches up
to<00:05:55.250> the<00:05:55.520> modified<00:05:56.450> cover<00:05:56.750> the<00:05:57.620> whole<00:05:57.740> point<00:05:57.950> of

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
this test was to show that we weren't

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.100 
this test was to show that we weren't
just<00:06:00.970> modifying<00:06:01.970> the<00:06:02.090> Corvette<00:06:02.450> beyond<00:06:02.870> the

iron it was a bit stiff and it did have

a digital chip in it which would have

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.550 
a digital chip in it which would have
slightly<00:06:15.410> altered<00:06:15.800> the<00:06:17.200> effects<00:06:18.200> of<00:06:18.289> a<00:06:18.380> car

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
slightly altered the effects of a car

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
to drive if you've seen the test drive

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.210

all of them the Corvair felt lighter

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.719 
all of them the Corvair felt lighter
