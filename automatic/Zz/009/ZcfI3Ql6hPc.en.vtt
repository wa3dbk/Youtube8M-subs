00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:24.080
 apart for the part of me to carry 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:27.710
 something that costs us so much 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.230
 to the Argentines to make our 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.180

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.490
 good repercussion in general 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.440

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.550
 people 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.840
 of some means and that even 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:52.840
 flies over the fact of emotion 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.840
 like he's touching that fiber 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.720
