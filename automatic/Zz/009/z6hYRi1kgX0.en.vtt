hey<00:00:00.570> what's<00:00:00.780> going<00:00:00.840> on<00:00:01.050> guys<00:00:01.290> it's<00:00:01.319> Penn<00:00:01.800> today

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
hey what's going on guys it's Penn today

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.470 
hey what's going on guys it's Penn today
we<00:00:02.250> are<00:00:02.340> going<00:00:02.460> to<00:00:02.520> take<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.730> look<00:00:03.030> at<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.240> iron

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
we are going to take a look at the iron

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.539 
we are going to take a look at the iron
dimension<00:00:04.049> mod<00:00:04.259> and<00:00:04.620> as<00:00:05.069> you<00:00:05.190> could<00:00:05.310> probably

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
dimension mod and as you could probably

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.730 
dimension mod and as you could probably
imagine<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:06.240> adds<00:00:06.450> an<00:00:06.600> iron<00:00:06.870> dimension<00:00:07.410> into

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
imagine it adds an iron dimension into

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.990 
imagine it adds an iron dimension into
the<00:00:07.830> game<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.340> this<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.670> portal<00:00:08.970> right

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
the game and this is the portal right

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.430 
the game and this is the portal right
here<00:00:09.360> it's<00:00:09.480> made<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.750> iron<00:00:09.929> blocks<00:00:10.290> is

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
here it's made of iron blocks is

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.540 
here it's made of iron blocks is
probably<00:00:10.650> what<00:00:10.769> you<00:00:10.830> would<00:00:10.889> have<00:00:11.010> guessed<00:00:11.280> so

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
probably what you would have guessed so

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.310 
probably what you would have guessed so
I<00:00:11.849> guess<00:00:12.210> before<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.599> went<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:12.870> here<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.049> yeah

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
I guess before I went in here and yeah

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.930 
I guess before I went in here and yeah
that's<00:00:13.530> what<00:00:13.650> it's<00:00:13.769> made<00:00:13.889> out<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.070> it's<00:00:14.519> also<00:00:14.730> a

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
that's what it's made out of it's also a

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.460 
that's what it's made out of it's also a
gold<00:00:15.269> dimension<00:00:15.719> though<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.230> diamond

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
gold dimension though and a diamond

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.830 
gold dimension though and a diamond
dimension<00:00:17.039> which<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.250> awesome<00:00:17.850> only<00:00:18.480> thing<00:00:18.630> is

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
dimension which is awesome only thing is

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.540 
dimension which is awesome only thing is
these<00:00:19.080> two<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.920> know<00:00:20.010> it's<00:00:20.130> still<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> work<00:00:20.400> in

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
these two you know it's still a work in

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.740 
these two you know it's still a work in
progress<00:00:20.730> mod<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.270> there<00:00:21.420> isn't<00:00:21.660> as<00:00:21.720> much

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
progress mod so there isn't as much

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.420 
progress mod so there isn't as much
content<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.500> these<00:00:22.590> dimensions<00:00:23.070> yet<00:00:23.220> there's

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
content in these dimensions yet there's

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.849 
content in these dimensions yet there's
very<00:00:23.880> little<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> diamond<00:00:24.689> dimension<00:00:25.080> and

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
very little in the diamond dimension and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.500 
very little in the diamond dimension and
obviously<00:00:26.310> it's<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.670> take<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.029> quite<00:00:27.449> a

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
obviously it's going to take you quite a

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.390 
obviously it's going to take you quite a
while<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.109> gather<00:00:28.260> up<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> materials<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.250> get

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
while to gather up the materials to get

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.679 
while to gather up the materials to get
here<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.670> mean<00:00:29.849> that's<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.119> lot<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.330> blocks

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
here I mean that's a lot of blocks

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.970 
here I mean that's a lot of blocks
you're<00:00:30.869> gonna<00:00:30.990> need<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.349> actually<00:00:31.529> get<00:00:31.830> into

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
you're gonna need to actually get into

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.560 
you're gonna need to actually get into
the<00:00:32.130> dimensions<00:00:32.579> but<00:00:32.969> once<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.270> get<00:00:33.420> there

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the dimensions but once you get there

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.850 
the dimensions but once you get there
you<00:00:33.630> should<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.780> no<00:00:34.020> problem<00:00:34.500> getting<00:00:34.530> them

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
you should have no problem getting them

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.260 
you should have no problem getting them
back<00:00:35.100> except<00:00:35.460> for<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.640> diamond<00:00:35.940> one<00:00:36.090> which

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
back except for the diamond one which

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.209 
back except for the diamond one which
really<00:00:36.540> um<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.469> gonna<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.680> tough<00:00:37.980> for<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.160> to

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
really um it's gonna be tough for you to

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.220 
really um it's gonna be tough for you to
get<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.489> hell<00:00:38.610> back<00:00:38.850> at<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.809> point<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.079> there

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
get the hell back at this point in there

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.690 
get the hell back at this point in there
but<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> other<00:00:40.649> ones<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.370> should<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.579> no

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
but the other ones you should have no

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.680 
but the other ones you should have no
problem<00:00:42.000> getting<00:00:42.030> your<00:00:42.239> materials<00:00:42.600> back

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
problem getting your materials back

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.420 
problem getting your materials back
super<00:00:43.140> quick<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:44.250> you're<00:00:44.340> probably

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
super quick but you're probably

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.799 
super quick but you're probably
wondering<00:00:44.789> how<00:00:44.910> do<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.059> how<00:00:45.480> do<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.629> light

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
wondering how do you how do you light

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:46.340 
wondering how do you how do you light
this

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
this

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.510 
this
and<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.680> light<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.010> you're<00:00:47.190> gonna<00:00:47.280> need<00:00:47.460> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
and to light this you're gonna need a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.130 
and to light this you're gonna need a
special<00:00:47.969> flint<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.300> steel<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.750> one<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
special flint and steel this one is the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.720 
special flint and steel this one is the
iron<00:00:49.379> flint<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.800> steel<00:00:49.829> its<00:00:50.280> flint<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.700> steel

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
iron flint and steel its flint and steel

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.090 
iron flint and steel its flint and steel
surrounded<00:00:51.329> by<00:00:51.480> iron<00:00:51.809> ingots<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.010> know

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
surrounded by iron ingots so you know

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.139 
surrounded by iron ingots so you know
it's<00:00:53.190> cool<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.460> they<00:00:53.550> use<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:53.910> their<00:00:54.030> own

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
it's cool that they use like their own

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.490 
it's cool that they use like their own
custom<00:00:54.660> one<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.899> thought<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.170> was<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.379> know

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
custom one I thought it was you know

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.810 
custom one I thought it was you know
unique<00:00:55.860> they<00:00:56.070> didn't<00:00:56.309> use<00:00:56.399> just<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> regular

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
unique they didn't use just the regular

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.670 
unique they didn't use just the regular
Flint<00:00:57.180> steel<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.600> kind<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.780> boring<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.230> yeah

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
Flint steel it's kind of boring so yeah

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.869 
Flint steel it's kind of boring so yeah
there's<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> custom<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.340> for<00:00:59.489> each<00:00:59.640> one

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
there's a custom one for each one

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.459 
there's a custom one for each one
there's<00:01:00.210> also<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.510> gold<00:01:00.780> one<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.260> gold

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
there's also a gold one so it's gold

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.830 
there's also a gold one so it's gold
ingots<00:01:01.920> around<00:01:02.370> Flint<00:01:02.670> steel<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.449> diamond

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
ingots around Flint steel in the diamond

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.780 
ingots around Flint steel in the diamond
one<00:01:04.019> I'm<00:01:04.409> sure<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.860> guess<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.220> diamonds

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
one I'm sure you can guess it's diamonds

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.179 
one I'm sure you can guess it's diamonds
around<00:01:06.330> flint<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.320> steel<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.680> think<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.040> like

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
around flint and steel I think I like

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.350 
around flint and steel I think I like
the<00:01:08.310> look<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.670> kind<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.850> looks<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.090> an<00:01:09.210> ice

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the look of it kind of looks like an ice

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.690 
the look of it kind of looks like an ice
thing<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.080> kind<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.470> school<00:01:10.799> but<00:01:11.430> yeah<00:01:11.520> let's

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
thing to kind of school but yeah let's

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.700 
thing to kind of school but yeah let's
head<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:12.180> guys<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.390> check<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.049> out<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
head in here guys and check this out and

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.320 
head in here guys and check this out and
though<00:01:14.400> there<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> decent<00:01:14.939> amount<00:01:15.090> of

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
though there is a decent amount of

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.090 
though there is a decent amount of
content<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.320> first<00:01:16.560> dimension<00:01:16.950> which<00:01:17.040> is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
content in this first dimension which is

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.230 
content in this first dimension which is
probably<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.490> only<00:01:17.610> one<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.850> I'd<00:01:18.030> say<00:01:18.210> is

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
probably the only one that I'd say is

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.539 
probably the only one that I'd say is
close<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.869> being<00:01:18.990> done<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:20.040> yeah<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.369> mod

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
close to being done but yeah this mod

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.070 
close to being done but yeah this mod
does<00:01:20.729> look<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.119> good<00:01:21.420> mod<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:21.840> probably

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
does look like a good mod it's probably

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.210 
does look like a good mod it's probably
gonna<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> lot<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.799> when<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.040> actually

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
gonna be a lot in it when it's actually

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.820 
gonna be a lot in it when it's actually
complete<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.780> obviously<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.380> colors<00:01:25.680> are<00:01:25.799> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
complete and obviously the colors are a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.320 
complete and obviously the colors are a
little<00:01:25.979> dim<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.640> obviously<00:01:27.090> supposed

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
little dim but it's obviously supposed

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.090 
little dim but it's obviously supposed
to<00:01:27.420> be<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.780> know<00:01:27.900> iron<00:01:28.320> dimension<00:01:28.860> so

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
to be the you know iron dimension so

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.649 
to be the you know iron dimension so
everything<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.729> iron<00:01:29.909> colored<00:01:30.329> iron

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
everything is like iron colored iron

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.520 
everything is like iron colored iron
dirt<00:01:30.960> iron<00:01:31.380> golems<00:01:31.829> iron<00:01:32.100> cows<00:01:33.200> hired<00:01:34.200> cows

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
dirt iron golems iron cows hired cows

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.830 
dirt iron golems iron cows hired cows
but<00:01:35.310> yeah<00:01:35.400> iron<00:01:35.700> cows<00:01:35.970> iron<00:01:36.420> golems<00:01:36.720> those

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
but yeah iron cows iron golems those

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.940 
but yeah iron cows iron golems those
with<00:01:36.960> two<00:01:37.110> mobs<00:01:37.320> you're<00:01:37.470> gonna<00:01:37.560> see<00:01:37.740> around

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
with two mobs you're gonna see around

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.670 
with two mobs you're gonna see around
here<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.400> yeah<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> mean<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.689> colors<00:01:39.990> are<00:01:40.229> all

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
here and yeah I mean the colors are all

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.530 
here and yeah I mean the colors are all
iron<00:01:40.979> colored<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> little<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.360> you

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
iron colored so it is a little like you

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.730 
iron colored so it is a little like you
know<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> little<00:01:42.899> boring<00:01:43.170> color<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
know it's a little boring color but the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.870 
know it's a little boring color but the
diamond<00:01:44.070> dimension<00:01:44.340> actually<00:01:44.430> looks<00:01:44.700> really

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
diamond dimension actually looks really

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.520 
diamond dimension actually looks really
cool<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.899> let's<00:01:46.020> check<00:01:46.140> out<00:01:46.259> some<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
cool so let's check out some of the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.740 
cool so let's check out some of the
stuff<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:47.009> make<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:48.329> first<00:01:48.540> thing

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
stuff you can make here the first thing

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.569 
stuff you can make here the first thing
is<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> super<00:01:49.439> iron<00:01:49.710> set

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
is the super iron set

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.399 
is the super iron set
I<00:01:50.610> like<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.060> super<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:52.020> sounds<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.350> much

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
I like that super just sounds so much

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.440 
I like that super just sounds so much
better<00:01:52.500> doesn't<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:54.000> radioactive

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
better doesn't it and the radioactive

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.510 
better doesn't it and the radioactive
iron<00:01:55.259> set<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.590> love<00:01:55.770> these<00:01:55.950> names<00:01:56.219> those<00:01:56.399> are

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
iron set I love these names those are

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.940 
iron set I love these names those are
cool<00:01:56.670> names<00:01:56.939> but<00:01:57.689> basically<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.409> recipes<00:01:58.799> for

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
cool names but basically the recipes for

quick just to show you so a super iron

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.410 
quick just to show you so a super iron
sword<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.070> out<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.399> two<00:02:05.579> super<00:02:05.880> iron<00:02:06.090> ingots

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
sword it's out of two super iron ingots

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.690 
sword it's out of two super iron ingots
in<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.659> stick<00:02:07.229> they<00:02:07.799> are<00:02:07.979> planning<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.489> adding

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
in a stick they are planning on adding

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.490 
in a stick they are planning on adding
in<00:02:08.940> iron<00:02:09.209> sticks<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:09.810> those<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.170> aren't<00:02:10.259> in

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
in iron sticks but those just aren't in

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.960 
in iron sticks but those just aren't in
it<00:02:10.619> yet<00:02:10.800> that's<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.310> here<00:02:11.520> but<00:02:11.640> there<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.849> no

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
it yet that's in here but there is no

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.260 
it yet that's in here but there is no
recipe<00:02:12.150> for<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.629> and<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.810> can't<00:02:12.989> use<00:02:13.110> it

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
recipe for it and you can't use it

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.640 
recipe for it and you can't use it
make<00:02:13.420> them<00:02:13.540> yep<00:02:13.690> so<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.230> will<00:02:14.350> probably

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
make them yep so that will probably

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.800 
make them yep so that will probably
change<00:02:14.680> at<00:02:15.100> some<00:02:15.310> point<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:15.760> yeah<00:02:16.510> all<00:02:16.690> the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
change at some point and yeah all the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.120 
change at some point and yeah all the
recipes<00:02:17.080> are<00:02:17.200> exactly<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.590> same<00:02:17.800> except

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
recipes are exactly the same except

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.380 
recipes are exactly the same except
they're<00:02:18.280> made<00:02:18.370> out<00:02:18.490> of<00:02:18.610> super<00:02:18.700> iron<00:02:19.000> ingots

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
they're made out of super iron ingots

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.530 
they're made out of super iron ingots
and<00:02:19.540> out<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:20.080> radioactive<00:02:20.740> iron<00:02:21.040> ingots

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
and out of radioactive iron ingots

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.670 
and out of radioactive iron ingots
obviously<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.660> get<00:02:22.810> those<00:02:23.050> would<00:02:23.410> be<00:02:23.530> made

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
obviously to get those would be made

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.320 
obviously to get those would be made
from<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.920> ore<00:02:24.010> but<00:02:24.310> I'm<00:02:24.520> not<00:02:24.700> sure<00:02:25.030> these<00:02:25.180> are

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
from the ore but I'm not sure these are

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.850 
from the ore but I'm not sure these are
in<00:02:25.510> yet<00:02:25.780> because<00:02:25.960> I<00:02:26.050> couldn't<00:02:26.290> find<00:02:26.560> any<00:02:26.770> I

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
in yet because I couldn't find any I

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.260 
in yet because I couldn't find any I
looked<00:02:27.100> all<00:02:27.310> over<00:02:27.340> for<00:02:27.700> these<00:02:27.940> whores<00:02:28.150> I

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
looked all over for these whores I

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.660 
looked all over for these whores I
searched<00:02:28.570> down<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:29.770> far<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.640> just

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
searched down and far and I just

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.370 
searched down and far and I just
couldn't<00:02:31.180> find<00:02:31.300> any<00:02:31.570> but<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:31.900> can<00:02:32.230> actually

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
couldn't find any but you can actually

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.260

he<00:02:42.700> dropped<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.030> couple<00:02:43.210> right<00:02:43.390> there<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:44.050> you

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
he dropped a couple right there so you

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.540 
he dropped a couple right there so you
should<00:02:44.140> have<00:02:44.380> no<00:02:44.530> problem<00:02:44.950> making<00:02:45.130> that<00:02:45.250> first

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
should have no problem making that first

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.920 
should have no problem making that first
set<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.000> um<00:02:46.240> if<00:02:46.390> you're<00:02:46.510> wanting<00:02:46.690> about<00:02:46.780> the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
set and um if you're wanting about the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.180 
set and um if you're wanting about the
strength<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.290> it<00:02:47.380> is<00:02:47.650> about<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:47.980> same<00:02:48.160> as

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
strength of it is about the same as

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.430 
strength of it is about the same as
diamond<00:02:48.880> if<00:02:49.360> you<00:02:49.540> notice<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:49.900> took<00:02:50.020> me<00:02:50.140> three

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
diamond if you notice it took me three

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.170 
diamond if you notice it took me three
hits<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.830> kill<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.190> cow<00:02:51.430> now<00:02:51.760> we<00:02:51.820> are<00:02:52.090> going

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
hits to kill that cow now we are going

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.020 
hits to kill that cow now we are going
to<00:02:52.240> test<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:53.010> against<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.070> actual<00:02:54.460> weapons<00:02:54.910> in

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
to test it against the actual weapons in

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.640 
to test it against the actual weapons in
the<00:02:55.090> game<00:02:55.150> radioactive<00:02:55.960> iron<00:02:56.140> sword<00:02:56.440> and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
the game radioactive iron sword and

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.050 
the game radioactive iron sword and
super<00:02:56.980> iron<00:02:57.130> sword<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:57.700> shouldn't<00:02:57.880> it<00:02:58.030> be

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
super iron sword so shouldn't it be

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.520 
super iron sword so shouldn't it be
about<00:02:58.300> three<00:02:58.570> hits<00:02:58.750> in<00:02:58.900> my<00:02:59.020> test<00:02:59.290> that's

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
about three hits in my test that's

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.260 
about three hits in my test that's
pretty<00:03:00.220> much<00:03:00.310> what<00:03:00.490> it<00:03:00.580> was<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.910> drop<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.090> couple

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
pretty much what it was to drop a couple

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.600 
pretty much what it was to drop a couple
there<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:02.470> they<00:03:02.530> actually<00:03:02.650> drop<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:02.980> lot<00:03:03.280> just

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
there and they actually drop a lot just

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.340 
there and they actually drop a lot just
so<00:03:03.820> you're<00:03:03.970> curious<00:03:04.210> there's<00:03:04.510> 18<00:03:04.900> I<00:03:04.930> have<00:03:05.170> I'll

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
kill one and we'll see how many drops

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.870 
kill one and we'll see how many drops
all<00:03:08.290> right<00:03:08.440> we'll<00:03:08.560> pick<00:03:08.830> these<00:03:09.010> up<00:03:09.070> and<00:03:09.520> now<00:03:09.820> we

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
all right we'll pick these up and now we

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.760 
all right we'll pick these up and now we

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
really get a ton of these in iron golems

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.300 
really get a ton of these in iron golems
don't<00:03:20.020> drop<00:03:20.200> anything<00:03:20.470> different<00:03:21.100> than<00:03:21.190> they

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
don't drop anything different than they

normally do what they just drop is you

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.510 
normally do what they just drop is you
know<00:03:23.230> iron<00:03:23.680> ingots<00:03:24.010> which<00:03:24.070> is<00:03:24.250> how<00:03:24.370> you're

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
know iron ingots which is how you're

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.710 
know iron ingots which is how you're
gonna<00:03:24.580> get<00:03:24.730> your<00:03:24.790> materials<00:03:25.240> back<00:03:25.330> you<00:03:25.510> spent

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
this I just got to do it got a kill at

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.430 
this I just got to do it got a kill at
least<00:03:35.709> one<00:03:35.830> if<00:03:36.280> even<00:03:36.700> if<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:36.850> takes<00:03:36.940> an<00:03:37.090> hour

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
least one if even if it takes an hour

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.900 
least one if even if it takes an hour
got<00:03:38.440> so<00:03:38.620> many<00:03:38.740> hit<00:03:38.890> points<00:03:38.920> but<00:03:39.730> yeah<00:03:39.790> he

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
got so many hit points but yeah he

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.940 
got so many hit points but yeah he
basically<00:03:40.270> just<00:03:40.420> dropped<00:03:40.900> iron<00:03:41.260> in<00:03:41.470> gots<00:03:41.650> and

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
basically just dropped iron in gots and

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.520 
basically just dropped iron in gots and
I<00:03:42.760> still<00:03:42.970> have<00:03:43.060> 23<00:03:43.510> super<00:03:43.660> iron<00:03:43.990> so<00:03:44.200> at<00:03:44.380> this

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
I still have 23 super iron so at this

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.410 
I still have 23 super iron so at this
moment<00:03:44.740> right<00:03:45.070> now<00:03:45.130> he<00:03:46.000> doesn't<00:03:46.300> drop

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
moment right now he doesn't drop

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.820 
moment right now he doesn't drop
anything<00:03:46.690> special<00:03:47.110> it<00:03:47.170> probably<00:03:47.440> be<00:03:47.500> good<00:03:47.680> if

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
anything special it probably be good if

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.960 
anything special it probably be good if
they<00:03:47.920> got<00:03:48.040> them<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.370> drop<00:03:48.550> maybe<00:03:48.790> the

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
they got them to drop maybe the

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.640 
they got them to drop maybe the
radioactive<00:03:49.630> set<00:03:49.870> that<00:03:50.080> would<00:03:50.170> make<00:03:50.320> sense

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
radioactive set that would make sense

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.220 
radioactive set that would make sense
Oh<00:03:50.880> also<00:03:51.880> I<00:03:52.090> mentioned<00:03:52.540> that<00:03:52.810> these<00:03:52.930> are<00:03:53.080> as

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
Oh also I mentioned that these are as

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.290 
Oh also I mentioned that these are as
strong<00:03:53.590> as<00:03:53.650> diamond<00:03:54.400> but<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.670> durability<00:03:55.000> is

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
strong as diamond but the durability is

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.600 
strong as diamond but the durability is
a<00:03:55.330> bit<00:03:55.600> less<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.920> there's<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.310> couple<00:03:57.550> cool

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
a bit less and there's a couple cool

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.310 
a bit less and there's a couple cool
blocks<00:03:57.910> as<00:03:58.060> well<00:03:58.090> decoration<00:03:58.900> blocks<00:03:59.110> there's

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
blocks as well decoration blocks there's

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.170 
blocks as well decoration blocks there's
some<00:03:59.440> bricks<00:03:59.680> some<00:04:00.340> wood<00:04:00.610> I<00:04:00.640> don't<00:04:00.910> think<00:04:01.090> the

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
some bricks some wood I don't think the

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.610 
some bricks some wood I don't think the
trees<00:04:01.480> are<00:04:01.660> added<00:04:01.930> in<00:04:02.020> yet<00:04:02.260> but<00:04:02.410> I'm<00:04:02.590> sure

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
trees are added in yet but I'm sure

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.810 
trees are added in yet but I'm sure
they're<00:04:02.950> coming<00:04:03.160> soon<00:04:03.430> since<00:04:03.670> obviously

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
they're coming soon since obviously

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.280 
they're coming soon since obviously
they're<00:04:04.240> like<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.600> materials<00:04:05.110> are<00:04:05.170> already

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
they're like the materials are already

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.320 
they're like the materials are already
here<00:04:05.650> or<00:04:05.770> maybe<00:04:06.310> they're<00:04:06.490> just<00:04:06.520> really<00:04:06.880> rare<00:04:07.090> I

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
here or maybe they're just really rare I

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.460 
here or maybe they're just really rare I
don't<00:04:07.540> know<00:04:07.600> I<00:04:07.630> looked<00:04:07.840> around<00:04:07.959> I<00:04:08.170> just<00:04:08.200> didn't

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
don't know I looked around I just didn't

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.699 
don't know I looked around I just didn't
see<00:04:08.620> any<00:04:08.709> also<00:04:09.520> the<00:04:09.760> super<00:04:10.300> iron<00:04:10.600> block<00:04:11.050> I<00:04:11.440> love

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
see any also the super iron block I love

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.979 
see any also the super iron block I love
that<00:04:11.860> um<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.430> there's<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.790> soft<00:04:13.540> iron<00:04:13.750> right

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
that um and there's a soft iron right

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.750 
that um and there's a soft iron right
here<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:14.500> there's<00:04:14.800> a<00:04:14.890> crafting<00:04:15.220> recipes<00:04:15.580> for

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
here and there's a crafting recipes for

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.310 
here and there's a crafting recipes for
these<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.120> iron<00:04:16.330> bricks<00:04:16.600> are<00:04:16.840> basically<00:04:17.230> just

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
these the iron bricks are basically just

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.590 
these the iron bricks are basically just
out<00:04:17.590> of<00:04:17.739> some<00:04:17.890> iron<00:04:18.220> ingots<00:04:18.549> and<00:04:18.820> of<00:04:19.419> course

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
out of some iron ingots and of course

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.940 
out of some iron ingots and of course
you<00:04:19.720> know<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.959> wood<00:04:20.109> turns<00:04:20.440> into<00:04:20.620> you<00:04:20.830> know

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
you know the wood turns into you know

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.190 
you know the wood turns into you know
planks<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.970> super<00:04:22.419> iron<00:04:22.750> blocks<00:04:22.990> out<00:04:23.169> of

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
planks and the super iron blocks out of

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.530 
planks and the super iron blocks out of
nine<00:04:23.470> super<00:04:23.770> iron<00:04:24.130> ingots<00:04:24.430> so<00:04:25.180> I<00:04:25.210> think<00:04:25.330> this

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
nine super iron ingots so I think this

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.950 
nine super iron ingots so I think this
is<00:04:25.690> like<00:04:25.750> a

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
is like a

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.090 
is like a
really<00:04:26.080> cool<00:04:26.289> one<00:04:26.440> for<00:04:26.590> building<00:04:26.949> obviously

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
really cool one for building obviously

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.890 
really cool one for building obviously
like<00:04:27.520> everything<00:04:27.970> like<00:04:28.090> blends<00:04:28.419> in<00:04:28.600> here<00:04:28.780> so

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
like everything like blends in here so

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.300 
like everything like blends in here so
it<00:04:28.990> doesn't<00:04:29.020> look<00:04:29.350> as<00:04:29.470> cool<00:04:29.650> right<00:04:29.860> now<00:04:29.889> but<00:04:30.280> uh

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
it doesn't look as cool right now but uh

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.980 
it doesn't look as cool right now but uh
I<00:04:30.580> think<00:04:30.669> the<00:04:30.850> bricks<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.449> the<00:04:31.569> super<00:04:31.840> iron

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
I think the bricks and the super iron

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.570 
I think the bricks and the super iron
block<00:04:32.229> would<00:04:32.740> be<00:04:32.770> useful<00:04:33.190> for<00:04:33.310> building

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
block would be useful for building

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.100 
block would be useful for building
something<00:04:33.729> pretty<00:04:33.970> cool<00:04:34.180> so<00:04:34.780> that's<00:04:34.900> about

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
something pretty cool so that's about

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.990 
something pretty cool so that's about
all<00:04:35.380> there<00:04:35.710> is<00:04:35.830> in<00:04:36.220> higher<00:04:36.400> dimensions<00:04:36.880> so<00:04:36.970> we

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
all there is in higher dimensions so we

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.730 
all there is in higher dimensions so we
are<00:04:37.210> going<00:04:37.360> to<00:04:37.419> check<00:04:37.599> out<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:37.900> gold<00:04:38.139> one<00:04:38.380> next

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
are going to check out the gold one next

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.529 
are going to check out the gold one next
and<00:04:39.039> I've<00:04:39.550> actually<00:04:39.669> noticed<00:04:39.940> like<00:04:40.180> maybe<00:04:40.449> a

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
and I've actually noticed like maybe a

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.150 
and I've actually noticed like maybe a
small<00:04:40.840> glitch<00:04:41.080> with<00:04:41.289> the<00:04:41.470> diamond<00:04:41.830> one<00:04:42.009> you're

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
small glitch with the diamond one you're

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.680 
small glitch with the diamond one you're
gonna<00:04:42.220> see<00:04:42.430> when<00:04:42.550> I<00:04:42.580> get<00:04:42.759> in<00:04:42.880> here<00:04:43.060> actually<00:04:43.509> I

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
gonna see when I get in here actually I

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.620 
gonna see when I get in here actually I
made<00:04:44.380> a<00:04:44.410> portal<00:04:44.919> in<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.490> in<00:04:45.849> the<00:04:46.030> diamond<00:04:46.449> one

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
made a portal in the in the diamond one

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.559 
made a portal in the in the diamond one
and<00:04:47.050> it<00:04:47.740> brought<00:04:48.099> up<00:04:48.190> portal<00:04:48.490> in<00:04:48.610> here<00:04:48.940> so<00:04:49.300> yeah

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
and it brought up portal in here so yeah

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.570 
and it brought up portal in here so yeah
that's<00:04:49.810> definitely<00:04:50.020> some<00:04:50.470> kind<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:50.800> issue<00:04:51.009> but

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
that's definitely some kind of issue but

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.820 
that's definitely some kind of issue but
we're<00:04:52.210> here<00:04:52.509> now<00:04:52.539> there's<00:04:52.870> gold<00:04:53.139> golems<00:04:53.590> is

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
crack gold bricks which are made out of

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.219 
crack gold bricks which are made out of
gold<00:05:39.849> in<00:05:40.000> guys<00:05:40.150> just<00:05:40.389> like<00:05:40.509> that<00:05:40.810> we'll<00:05:41.050> take<00:05:41.199> a

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
gold in guys just like that we'll take a

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.080 
gold in guys just like that we'll take a
look<00:05:41.440> at<00:05:41.500> these<00:05:41.680> and<00:05:42.009> actually<00:05:42.849> think<00:05:43.000> these

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
look at these and actually think these

look at these and actually think these
would<00:05:43.270> be<00:05:43.360> great<00:05:43.509> for<00:05:43.810> building<00:05:43.960> something

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:44.259 
would be great for building something

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:46.020 
would be great for building something
some<00:05:44.560> kind<00:05:44.740> of<00:05:44.800> like<00:05:44.979> cool<00:05:45.190> gold<00:05:45.520> building

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
some kind of like cool gold building

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.520 
some kind of like cool gold building
because<00:05:46.300> you<00:05:46.389> know<00:05:46.509> usually<00:05:46.990> you<00:05:47.169> know<00:05:47.289> it's

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
because you know usually you know it's

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.950 
because you know usually you know it's
it<00:05:48.099> just<00:05:48.130> looks<00:05:48.400> cool<00:05:48.580> gold<00:05:48.940> but<00:05:49.630> anyway<00:05:49.780> since

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
it just looks cool gold but anyway since

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.180 
it just looks cool gold but anyway since
what<00:05:50.050> about<00:05:50.259> all<00:05:50.440> there<00:05:50.590> is<00:05:50.680> in<00:05:50.949> the<00:05:51.009> gold

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
what about all there is in the gold

dimension we're gonna now check out the

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.930 
dimension we're gonna now check out the
diamonds<00:05:53.199> one<00:05:53.409> and<00:05:53.979> I<00:05:54.310> notice<00:05:54.610> that<00:05:54.729> you<00:05:54.820> to

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
end up spawning in this tree before go

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.779 
end up spawning in this tree before go

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
diamond dimension which obviously looks

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.089 
diamond dimension which obviously looks
the<00:06:07.900> coolest<00:06:08.020> this<00:06:08.320> is<00:06:08.469> the<00:06:08.530> best-looking<00:06:08.800> one

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 
here yet not to the diamond one

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:22.230 
here yet not to the diamond one
obviously<00:06:21.400> the<00:06:21.520> golden<00:06:21.789> iron<00:06:21.969> those<00:06:22.150> are

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240

diamonds back yeah I'm assuming we'll

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.749 
diamonds back yeah I'm assuming we'll
add<00:06:32.830> probably<00:06:33.039> iron

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 
add probably iron

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.170 
add probably iron
I<00:06:33.789> mean<00:06:34.000> um<00:06:34.210> diamond<00:06:35.080> golems<00:06:35.560> or<00:06:35.740> something

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
I mean um diamond golems or something

I mean um diamond golems or something
diamond<00:06:37.180> cows<00:06:37.419> if<00:06:38.080> I<00:06:38.199> had<00:06:38.320> to<00:06:38.409> guess

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
diamond cows if I had to guess

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.950 
diamond cows if I had to guess
but<00:06:39.400> here<00:06:39.580> is<00:06:39.760> you<00:06:39.940> know<00:06:40.060> the<00:06:40.180> diamond<00:06:40.570> dumb
