his house so I don't know how common
that<00:02:13.239> is<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:13.599> because<00:02:13.930> they'll<00:02:14.110> pick<00:02:14.379> him<00:02:14.530> up

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680

these birds don't have a very powerful
beak<00:02:52.329> or<00:02:52.540> feet<00:02:53.139> so<00:02:53.440> they<00:02:53.650> need<00:02:53.859> to<00:02:53.889> rely<00:02:54.400> on

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
beak or feet so they need to rely on

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
easy to swallow well I would think if

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.789 
easy to swallow well I would think if
you<00:02:58.420> could<00:02:58.569> take<00:02:58.750> anything<00:02:58.989> that<00:02:59.169> high<00:02:59.470> up<00:02:59.650> and

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
you could take anything that high up and

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.360 
you could take anything that high up and
drop<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.220> it's<00:03:00.400> gonna<00:03:00.700> create<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.150> mess<00:03:01.389> right

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
drop it it's gonna create a mess right
