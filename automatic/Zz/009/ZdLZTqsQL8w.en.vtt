00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:09.809
 the new metallic 3d software has the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.429
 option of calculation and dimensioning of 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.410
 wooden structures 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:22.380
 the software already has the Brazilian standard 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:25.859
 of wood at 71 90 from the standard 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:31.380
 selected, we can also make the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:34.620
 selection of sawn timber and 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:39.059
 glued laminate or 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:43.350
 reconstituted the class of 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.350
 resistance to the category and 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.719
 humidity for the profile option of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.840
 wood we can also make the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.260
 verification of fire resistance 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.890
 from the European standard once 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.370
 selected the standard and given the 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:06.290
 characteristics we can design our own 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.290
 structure we are going to make a small 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.290
 postage 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.550
 just to exemplify the wooden module 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:28.220
 and at the moment we draw but our 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:31.430
 bars can select the option to 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.450
 describe the profile as a profile 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:39.830
 wood entering the option to write 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.270
 profiles we will find the profile of 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.540
 wood 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.970
 selecting the display option emusa 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:53.090
 library with rafters teras 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:56.870
 round or rectangular profiles of height 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:01.910
 variable we can select for example 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:04.450
 an option when describing bars such as 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.830
 profile is already possible. 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:15.470
 view the wooden structure 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:19.370
 drawn once profiles are described 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.709
 the software will calculate or size 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.209
 the profiles of wood 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:28.270
 by giving to accept we view the 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.270
 results 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:40.450
 by not going through one of the items 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:45.560
 the software indicates and we can on the screen 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:49.939
 change to a profile that passes in case 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:56.200
 here we are making the change due 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:56.200
 to fire resistance 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.620
 we can also generate the 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.620
 reports 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:18.030
 where we can see the norm 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.050
 considered in situations of 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:26.730
 project 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:31.290
 resistance to fire 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.920
 the table and the result of the 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.920
 bars 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:45.999
 the software will generate the report with the 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.999
 same options of metal profiles 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:04:02.360
 it is also possible to generate the drawings of the 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:06.430
 same way as for metal profiles 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.430
 the software brings all the options 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:19.230
 of metallica 3d for steel options 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:23.430
 also for wood and visualize emos 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:26.610
 plies that will be generated and the 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:31.580
 standard that was used and the 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.580
 considerations for wood used
