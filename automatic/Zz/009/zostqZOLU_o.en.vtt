00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 hello my name is jean louis 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.040
 vaxelaire I run the granite company 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.470
 small rice since 1997 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.240
 we are in the first three 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.340
 French since we currently have 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.340
 90 employees for a turnover 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.760
 of 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.760
 a 1000 euros 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.609
 currently we are working with on 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.109
 the site of the stone quarry with a 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.520
 box of the 21st 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.330
 it's been almost 24 months since she's 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.330
 in the business 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.890
 the machine here she used in terms 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.430
 of a lot of block transport and 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.760
 handling so use them at 70 80% 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.190
 with the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.469
 with the tips so we have a machine that 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.730
 is unstable allows us to load 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.769
 safely trucks 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.039
 but that was an important point for 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.039
 we 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.300
 the three points for us from this 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.750
 machine it was already the quality ratio 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:15.450
 price it was the presence of a service 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.450
 strong after-sale nearby 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.929
 it's a power-to-weight ratio 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.850
 we could transport blocks 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:30.859
 up to 20 m roof criteria 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.659
 important more content choices 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:36.280
 our job heavy loads that 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.049
 we transport that we opted for the purchase 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.729
 by a special configuration of the 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.789
 machine with rear tires 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.920
 inflated with water which we increase 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:51.109
 on one hand the stability on the other hand the 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.299
 power of yeast one consumes 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:54.939
 currently average 26 me on 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.560
 year 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.509
 2012 jockey in vaccines to spend 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.180
 to lecce nique on mine to kill the 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.940
 national part in common always 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.290
 between us if we on machines and 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.920
 it is true that this magic did not pose 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.550
 no problem and not what concerns me 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.550
 I repeat the league
