00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
at different levels on the string this

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.810 
at different levels on the string this
is<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.230> make<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.980> we<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.460> leave<00:00:56.670> it
