00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello falls so I look at day in 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.609
 a video to make the presentation 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.990
 of a box so I do not want to do 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.030
 this kind of videos simply because 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.050
 it's a culinary box I'm 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.150
 I said it could be nice to 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.429
 you introduce it as you 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.000
 are more supportive of my videos 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.289
 receipts 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.539
 so I apologize for the brightness 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.300
 because if I'm yellow it's late 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.449
 I have a shooter head I have not slept 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.430
 this night and jesus christ pascal barbot 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.650
 right next so that's how 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.529
 right away I received boxing in a 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.270
 cardboard like this with boxing at 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.320
 inside so boxing presents itself 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.329
 as these were created discover 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.780
 cooking on took its marks and 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.410
 hitcher boxing because the box's name 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.180
 seeming so inside there are some 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.160
 little fliers which one must know that the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.559
 boxing costs 20 euros and that this one 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.760
 Boxing on the theme of Valentine's Day 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.860
 so first of all nothing could do what we 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.489
 does if to present different 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.340
 kitchen machines are then associates 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.650
 so that's how to use one of 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.479
 boxing products and then it's the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.299
 small recipe cards that shows you 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.799
 a little what to do as recipes by 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.830
 compared to the products we had at 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.369
 inside the boxing so the first 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.159
 product 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.540
 they are redon buttons 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.909
 exciting in a little bag like 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.070
 that's really the oath of the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.890
 real flowers in brief buttons 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.330
 pink in fact it smells super super good and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.710
 so it's true that fortunately putting 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.860
 little cards like that because we 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.460
 may not know what to do 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.770
 with 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.170
 so there and the little girl introduces herself 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.110
 like these and offers a pavement of 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.280
 Salmon pollutants rosebuds 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.720
 this is then the second product and the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.520
 chocolate so that I think I have more 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.450
 soon after these games present like those 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.460
 this is the brand 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.220
 Camille Bloch Camille Bloch I pass 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.610
 so it's in Switzerland and it's a 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.190
 milk chocolate with hands 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.920
 it's inside and praline I think 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.240
 and superb salaries i'm doing five 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.490
 days produce this boxing so I 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.500
 expected to commenced before the 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.740
 video but I think tonight is a 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.230
 good felt the young platelets 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.600
 then third product is 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.450
 mark tÃ©zier so it's calm the 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.940
 square wanted and stuff that presents itself 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.459
 like this one to do like 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.880
 species of little paws in fact so 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.790
 it can be fun never tested so 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.940
 it is to try then we are a con 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.100
 as I say so it's antwerp and that's 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.500
 ginger so I never tasted 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.230
 ginger gives who m but clinton 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.060
 that you hear a little bit more and 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.380
 so it 's skin like that but 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.720
 it's great to protect it because the law 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.950
 was filled with mermaid rain 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.840
 I think you can see a little bit at 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.580
 what does it look like but it's true that 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.590
 again thankfully there is 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.850
 small flyers to detail the 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.080
 products and what to do because 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.440
 otherwise I would not be at all 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.820
 then use another product that's 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.890
 a kind of snack like that so 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.010
 it's an alcohol it seems to me that a big 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.049
 marnier liqueur orange and cognac so 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.360
 it really looks like that or 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.340
 may be I think me in the cooking of 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.190
 the standard of everything like that so that's 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.810
 also to test 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.400
 then we had all this is a little 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.799
 no longer really looking forward to testing but 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.239
 I love intense and so was that 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.630
 is like these is to have 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:27.440
 that vegas and who as south is to the east 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.090
 a special sorbet sugar so who would 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.549
 as you know in fact you believe 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.060
 mixed fruit you should note that marc and the 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.350
 sugar 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.700
 the preparation of sugar and you put 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.320
 in the freezer apparently that makes you 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.680
 other form and it's really being its 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.810
 poached 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.630
 so I tightened this summer so that we 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.100
 do not really leave the season 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:51.470
 then as a product has had a small 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:54.019
 reminder we had a small cookie cutter 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.519
 front in the form of heart for the 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.290
 Valentine's Day sorry to move to 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.360
 level went through there 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.890
 a cape night so it's to make a 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.690
 small 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.319
 of a heart shape it was so cute 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.180
 then it's like football France 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.160
 lives we had that so we tested it that 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.780
 margot precisely five minutes ago where 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.900
 it was the little candy its success of the 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.250
 Brand and water and it's a dirty trick 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.850
 of the rose actually and that's really 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.160
 superb 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.709
 or when you open like these there are 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.980
 several individual backups so that 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.690
 all that really good and so his 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.000
 estate is really super great 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.380
 good so then last product is 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.440
 a music like otherwise I knew 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.650
 really not that it existed so notice 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.070
 to passionate lovers it's an oil 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.320
 massage that is eaten so it's 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.510
 rare what do you want it's a city of 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.090
 the greedy body temptation 8 to 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.350
 burnt margarita taste so there is 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:53.260
 many you there margarita mojito 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:56.080
 banana varying a lot of taste 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.940
 and I had this one so seen at 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.190
 lovers 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.080
 that's the boxing is really filled with 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.950
 full of polystyrene as I said to 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.900
 a cost of 20 euros 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.970
 and there are also different ranges of 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.190
 boxing there are several boxes that vary 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.740
 between prayers and your more 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.000
 expensive but there are more products or 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.440
 higher quality products 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.690
 in everything something this concept 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.640
 really well I did not even know it 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.650
 existed so I'm delighted to have been able to 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.750
 test this box tell me if you have 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.560
 already tested this kind of boxing and tell me 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.360
 if this appeal to you 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.979
 in any case I hope that my video you 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.250
 will have pleased I make you videos and to
