 and although only everyone is that 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.220
 that you know how we feel today for 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.160
 a very very fast video that lasts to 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.359
 about five minutes in the bottom there will be 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.890
 a small a small challenge map village finally 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.230
 to village the contract a rogue 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.329
 free or scratch yeah I believe that 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.530
 it's free 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.699
 so that's okay you'll see that there is 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.019
 no need to make networks for 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.239
 beat some cunning especially when he 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.110
 play like that so he was playing it 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.469
 well that is, they play and 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.909
 far from me he was playing pretty far from 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.470
 me so I could not have the cabbage of the 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.600
 pick up view on a fire mode by the 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.409
 flamish is still I had a staff 6 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.470
 and 6 2 p oh so that's okay 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:02.079
 especially video explanations and geese 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.610
 explanations so already thank you 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.829
 for the 3000 subscribers it's just great 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.869
 even when I have no activity on the 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.700
 chain breast to continue to mount so 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.630
 this is the proof that most love and 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.470
 video and that it makes me really happy 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.790
 currently I have a very good 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.979
 community and I mean there is no 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.310
 problem is that there is no 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.810
 arguing is not there is not a success 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.450
 well, frankly, there are no worries 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.320
 that thank you it's really cool 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.930
 some of the times started with a 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.080
 community and who goes that was worth soul and 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.040
 that's going to be boring for the future so 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.830
 that's why I'm going to put some 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.470
 rules directly if I really see 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.520
 in the tx is an insult but really 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.530
 who is there to insult I mean 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.510

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.310

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.380

 do that insult people and finally 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.480
 time anyway I normally speak 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.590
 but made for those who want when 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.150
 they want and who pretends who want me 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.200
 to know two from another angle I 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.850
 invite you to come on twitter 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.230
 frankly there's no problem 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.020
 you will see I'm not at all 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.370
 same as videos but but that 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.480
 become funny too you do not hurt 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.310
 especially also I want to tell you that 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.830
 for the 3000 subscribers there will be a 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.650
 assembly of mons ram level 200 that will 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.740
 last about two minutes 53 minutes 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.660
 yeah pretty much I think is not 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.690
 still finished I think it will be 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.760
 nice so it will be mostly on the putsch 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.400
 to show the rox there will be another 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.350
 montage that will show list and stats 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.790
 every time but this is really 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.340
 rock it's also and some challenges in 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.520
 the heap anyway I hope that you 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.280
 we will see well and then and then 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.810
 we have it we have been ruining it 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.520
 sent who wants he still wants 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.110
 move away from the action area follows and 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.660
 that he's right and so I'm going 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.640
 push these bombs very far for him 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.930
 avoid placing a good bombay game this 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.420
 that it hurts a lot with two 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.660
 bombs that's up and in two rounds 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.580
 where it is 400 x 2 so it stings when 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.070
 even he has about 1000 acis 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.220
 unrest almost 5000 health 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.040
 basic 4800 selected the basic without 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.030
 count the rose have there so it's 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.070
 really nice it's a very good 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.630
 rogue and it was really hot when 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.700
 even 2 I drive there by passing too I 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.440
 still do a little action a 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.870
 small concentration to our traps 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.500
 sneaky there a little spotting so a 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.970
 less 1000 e 6 years old it's always 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.320
 well the games you it good for not they 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.370
 can put me in and then that's it 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.280
 so a good it was mostly a video 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.540
 explanations after also speaking in 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.570
 activity on the chain 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:08.160
 he will come back after the bac because 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:12.460
 that I will have my days off and then 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.930
 then it will be like that quiet so he 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.790
 has nothing to do with a little bug no it's 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.290
 good like that I 'll be quiet and there 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.060
 it really resume there will be no 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.700
 worry but hey I have to work 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.350
 like that, I'll do some 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.390
 long studies and all and then those of 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.860
 come to adhere to me and then here I play and 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.660
 I could give you money if 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.600
 there too where we do like that 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.670
 no problem 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.740
 and then here I am, I invite you to 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.050
 really groland shot on twitter because 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.970
 that it's really fun I do not make the 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.460
 even on my videos that on twitter you 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.590
 see the difference 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.919
 and then even passing heretics had 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.200
 make a short video on the twitt game 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.960
 he explained a little the characters of 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.400
 every person then me he had said 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.020
 that I spent my time insulting 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.830
 people and that was fun anyway so 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.790
 hello to ethics by the way 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.580
 so that was a pretty video 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.470
 fast halal rogue it will be adorned me 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.419
 believe me there he'll get married like that 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.919
 you'll see he's still playing very 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.340
 well he still plays very very far from 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.750
 I think he had basic if I 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.520
 know this rogue had a tram 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.200
 so he knows about 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.060
 moves but if you play well 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.620
 your soul there is no problem at 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.290
 level of displacements 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.410
 if you have for example go 5 pm you 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.450
 can before 7.4 and moved back one 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.110

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.729
 widely your area of facts for 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.940
 that you found years missy unions 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.590
 necessarily or intra necessarily necessarily 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.530
 if we play on the words it's not okay 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.060
 but here is a little gg to him and 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.950
