00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.590
 n 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.680
 good dear friends with you again 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.849
 alexander is a regular newcomer cast and 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.720
 would especially like to talk today 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:30.009
 that very soon 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.529
 namely 23 May 30 nvidia company 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.710
 releases two new cards first 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.410
 card that comes out 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.540
 fastest by all counts May 20 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.030
 same force gtx780 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.250
 and the second video card which comes out 30 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.720
 May as well as for gtx770 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.940
 so we want to say it means let's 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.500
 right away 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:59.550
 something will give yourself to represent 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.550
 power means wine high card x 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:06.310
 783 this video card will be power 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.399
 closer to geforce gtx titan y 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.500
 slightly weaker than titanium 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:15.250
 rather than 680 that is, it will be the middle 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.500
 between 680 in power and geforce gtx 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.470
 titan accordingly she will have 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.940
 onboard memory is projected 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.310
 3 gigabytes and 5 any, that is, there will be two 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:32.409
 versions 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.930
 further 770 version of the video card geforce 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:40.690
 gtx770 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:42.780
 will be released on May 30th 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.900
 many analysts say 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.420
 geforce gtx770 this work on the bugs 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:54.220
 nvidia and the video card 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.590
 geforce gtx 680 thousand for power 770 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:02.580
 will be about a little bit more powerful than 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:06.580
 force gt gtx 680 i.e. current leader 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:10.420
 green camp is not really a leader do not take 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.220
 titan can be something lady here's that stone 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.260
 we mark by cost 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.889
 it means the cost of cards will not be the principle 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.310
 little do you understand the older model 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:23.069
 jafar plug 780 will be a little bit cheaper 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.230
 than titanium 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.049
 Well, again, yes, the amount of memory and 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.040
 it grows happy 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:36.900
 Well, shall I take it now for sure? 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.829
 how could I have 680 eyes for you well 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.219
 interesting video cards will be honest 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:45.310
 actually speaking here but I repeat 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:49.889
 that now and in the camp of Krasnov camp 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:56.709
 d is also very cool alternative is 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:58.239
 7990 7970 cards that are really tearing 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.159
 absolutely everything is a game at the maximum 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.889
 arbitrary performance as much as possible 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:05.709
 deliver here strictly speaking like this 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:08.560
 Well, you had Alexander with kondachka and 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.319
 little bit of these theories of opinion from me on 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.689
 about the release of the nearest exit because 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:20.049
 what is left not so long not so long 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:22.329
 to the same I would say very, very little 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.949
 just nothing left before the release of new 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.569
 graphics cards companies dzhifors 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:29.169
 that is, I remind you on May 23 that geforce comes out 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.319
 gtx780 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:36.569
 and on may 30 comes out for gtx770 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.569
 all the best of good holidays so far
