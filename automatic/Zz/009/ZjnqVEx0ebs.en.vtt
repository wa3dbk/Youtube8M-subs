00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:19.540
 and how to do 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.540
 an agent key my god 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.970
 let's remove this and we will teach 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.380
 how it works and how is this worth mother 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.060
 this is going to be a little complicated 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.039
 explained but I want you to go to 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.690
 understand perfectly let's see let's 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.820
 let's see let's see you have to see here 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.480
 ok to have in the little lamp is 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.910
 reston in which it is lit it is worth 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.710
 because it is on the torch and 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.480
 is looking up what red is worth 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.040
 we change it and it will go off 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.580
 and in all the positions of the iter in 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.830
 frame will be off less in this vale 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.199
 in this top now let's come to 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.150
 this and we are going to change it for example 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.030
 down is it's off 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.260
 Now therefore always it is going to ignite 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.350
 only in the under the law the rest 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.290
 not worth it this how this works 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.450
 I love this because this is pretty 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.100
 secret you will have here for example 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.250
 a wall is worth this simply for 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.810
 place where you want the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.020
 current input and simply in the 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.090
 wall then this 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.649
 and here this post would go on 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.340
 secret that I would have sitting in another 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.570
 part 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.570
 in the 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.810
 and well let's teach a psychic and 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.160
 how this works without luck and just 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.600
 because we are going to start the program 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.250
 always by the creation tutorial 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.680
 of our input that in this case will be 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.900
 an idem frame with a goal gives you 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.280
 whatever the object I use a 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.890
 mouse omelet because it's easy to see 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.870
 the position that is valid and good 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.550
 to start with this is worth the first thing 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.640
 you have to know is that an item in an item 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.050
 frame has eight positions is worth here 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.060
 they are all valid until you reach the 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.830
 initials that's fine let's go 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.350
 over here with a comparator as you know 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.050
 the comparators detect in the position 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.930
 in which it is linked in frame for its 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.580
 current power I explain the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.850
 current has 15 power as 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.009
 maximum and one frame item will give one or the other 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.600
 according to the position that is by 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.000
 example in the first one is one of 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.000
 current as you see it is on in the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.160
 second tarados third three four or 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.319
 five etcetera etcetera is worth up to eight 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.079
 in current as it is here good 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.420
 this this this how it works well these 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.849
 are two circuits in one is worth first 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.469
 let's do this circuit and then this 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.379
 unless we're going to go first by 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.909
 the main one is that it will be with two of 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.219
 reston here is worth this we 're going to 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.530
 raise vale there are two positions 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:44.299
 This is the normal one and this is the one 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.959
 current subtraction is worth then let's 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.230
 get here 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.239
 two and two ballets let's put fast to 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.760
 a quick tick to a tick and we're going to put 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.370
 here comparator with this elevated toward 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.049
 up to subtract and here one of 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.090
 reston and here we are going to put a 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.329
 reston lamp for you to see if 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.669
 it works or it is not worth it goes well this is very 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.370
 sencillito it mean now 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:09.169
 it will only be on in the part 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.480
 superior is all the others will be 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:14.180
 off as you see is worth this one is 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.760
 it turned off and all turned off this one 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.219
 is because why this happens well is 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.859
 very simple right now is in the ape 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.900
 the first in the first position is worth 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:26.510
 the first provision only sends one 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.509
 of the rest some power so 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.860
 only this one will be on and 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:33.410
 only this fast 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.110
 be activating and giving power to 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.630
 is this comparator normal to 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.930
 to pass in a straight line is and will be 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.660
 here it's worth then we give it two will have 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.620
 this current and this current so 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.549
 will send 15 power this one 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.140
 this repeater here and will enter here 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.060
 canceling thus the current that arrives to him 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.360
 from here to this comparator we are going to 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.060
 check it or turn it on it arrives by 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.370
 team and blocks why this happens 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.480
 my mother, I'm not marking people 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.150
 explaining I think it's staying 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.500
 pretty bad oil I already have this 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.510
 built here is worth to show you 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.280
 how does this work when it blocks 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.549
 when it does not block etc. let's go up 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.139
 this here is worth subtracting and this 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.720
 how it's going to work ok we're going to give it 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.979
 current from here it's worth we put this 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.560
 block remainder put current 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.620
 directly here it's worth and here will be the 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.990
 epicenter let's say the current more 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.180
 powerful it will be 15 power 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.130
 therefore it will lose power to 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.340
 As a block advances, therefore, 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.860
 are 15 14 and 13 here are coming 13 of 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.350
 power to this comparator is worth in this 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.880
 case let's give it here let's put it 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.600
 a little further so that a 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.680
 little less is it worth 15 14 13 and 12 of 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.260
 power that will be arriving this 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.610
 comparator and is not blocking bis 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.249
 that is not blocked not to find the 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.729
 current but if the current that reads 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:05:01.099
 is equal or less therefore it is going to 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.929
 put the same for you to see and be 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:06.319
 it's going to block out I'm not going to let it go 

00:05:02.929 --> 00:05:09.499
 the current and it's just going to 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:12.469
 block voucher and this is going to pay is the 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:14.299
 with value will continue on but here not 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:16.879
 will be giving good for example 

00:05:14.299 --> 00:05:19.369
 here here it is blocked too and so on 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:20.379
 etcetera we begin to see here comes what 

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:23.299
 hard 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:25.279
 Let's see if you understand 

00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:27.739
 because I find it hard to understand me 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:30.229
 sometimes and of course this is difficult 

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:31.969
 well this this circuit that we are going to 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.119
 do here is totally independent 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:38.449
 of this voucher this serves to place 

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:41.360
 here another frame item and this is going to be the 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:44.839
 that define when it will turn this 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.159
 ok and here we are going to put a comparator 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:48.860
 without this lifted up it's going to be 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:52.159
 normal and 2t reston here is worth as you see 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.720
 being this up is only 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.940
 sending a pulse and 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.890
 it only arrives here is worth right now the 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.290
 circuit is not interacting one with 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.990
 another one is good, this one is still working 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.120
 exactly the same, but the thing 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.360
 change when we give this once 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.760
 you see it has paid well this does 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.910
 this means that the hair points 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:18.950
 here it's worth it that the hair signal but 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:21.230
 this signal is more powerful than this one 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.240
 therefore it is blocking him to be 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.090
 more powerful than this one is blocking you 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.740
 good in this case is equal is worth the 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.280
 power because here is learning 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.720
 one is equal power and to match 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.760
 the power and make it not be 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.220
 blocked we will have to give it once 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.220
 here and let pass the current vale 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:43.670
 but here change the matter if you 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.020
 we return to give again will not be no 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.240
 will be blocked by this but that 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:51.770
 it will be blocking for this reason or 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:55.370
 it is difficult to explain it 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:57.530
 that I am doing I said the 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.379
 people I really hope you had 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:03.139
 understood because he's inviting me up 

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:05.840
 the diary and everything I hope has 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:08.740
 liked this sensual tutorial and we 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.740
 we see in the following video
