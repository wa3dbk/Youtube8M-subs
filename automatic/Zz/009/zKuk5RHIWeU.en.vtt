00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.840
 well once we have seen that it is 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.760
 twitter we have created an account 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.680
 twitter the next thing we're going to see is 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.900
 a little how to work and especially the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.360
 work philosophy that has has 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.279
 this social network a little peculiar or 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.890
 different especially in regards to many 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.949
 sometimes terminology regarding others to 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.949
 other networks like facebook or google plus 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.540
 so the first thing that we are going to 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.260
 see is what the philosophy is to say 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.940
 us on twitter that we are looking for in 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.520
 principle the idea is to answer the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.820
 ask what are you doing or what are you 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.410
 doing or what am I doing is saying 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.930
 communicate answering then to that 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.910
 simple question how are we going to do that 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.450
 Well, we are going to do it very simple 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.870
 through messages of no more than 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.309
 140 characters and within which 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.649
 for good mainly we are going to 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.289
 find us text but we are also going to 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.660
 to be able to include images or links 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:07.690
 for example videos that we find in the 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.600
 net 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:16.450
 or links to web pages or articles for 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.880
 let's say reinforce that message that 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.380
 we want we want to give these messages 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.600
 they have a special name they are called 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.480
 tweets in English 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.350
 or in Spanish tweet 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.450
 and through these messages then we 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.490
 we will communicate but of course how are we going to 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.430
 get what we write in 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.380
 our twitter account as they can 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.360
 see others or see what others write in 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.490
 the twitter account good for that 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.230
 the main idea is going to be the line of 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.700
 twitter time is really formed 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.030
 by a timeline would become 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.640
 as a set of ordered messages 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.960
 chronologically also the line 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.610
 of good time because it is usually summarized 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.140
 many times as the dt in the 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.670
 abbreviations are very common in 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.410
 twitter because I already say that we have few 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.140
 messages then when we see the dt or 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.820
 English people usually tele 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.340
 write this refers to that line 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.899
 of time timeline then on us 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.670
 in this timeline I already say here 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.710
 we can see the messages but how are we going 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.840
 to see the messages that we want because very 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.880
 simple what we're going to do is follow 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.460
 to people with which we 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.930
 we will follow twitter accounts and in the 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.970
 moment that we follow an account of 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.950
 twitter all those tweets that 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.090
 write that account will appear to us in 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.280
 our timeline so 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.610
 automatic always organized and of 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.590
 chronological way 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.510
 and now how are we going to make everyone 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.150
 our messages those tweets read them 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.830
 other people so following us so 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.470
 anyone who follows us everything 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.380
 that we write we can see 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.390
 then all to the question of whether we can 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.420
 It is necessary to be a person to read 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.800
 your tweets as well is not necessary if 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.010
 that person has his account opened 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.960
 public we simply 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.640
 clicking on the link to your account 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.170
 we can read all the tweets that 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.360
 write that person the same with 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.650
 us if we have the open account what 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.060
 what happens what good is interesting is 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.240
 what comes to us automatically 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.760
 well all the tweets they write and 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.480
 then as soon as in our line of 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.860
 time will appear only those 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.390
 tweets from the people you 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.010
 we are still good because not only are they going to 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.780
 appear those tweets but also 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.680
 we are going to find a kind of 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:27.360
 tweet let's say shared or you also 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:30.180
 they call rt like retweet then those 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.070
 the retweets are nothing more then that 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.290
 to share a tweet from someone else 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.540
 so it is not necessary for 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.230
 I follow that third person so 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.150
 is for example 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.040
 I still imagine an account 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.530
 twitter and that twitter account then I 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.720
 I see all his tweets but what he does 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.520
 is he wants all his followers to see 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.750
 well what you have written so another account 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.270
 for example an account of a 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.910
 newspaper for example of the country then 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.470
 they write a news in the country and 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.570
 then that person that I follow makes a 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.550
 retweet that country tweet with what 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.190
 which I do not follow the country if I will see 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.410
 that that tweet in this way we can 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.510
 disclose other accounts of other 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.700
 people and good for me when it does 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.280
 that retweet could then access the 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.080
 account and see if I'm interested if it's me 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.580
 his tweets interest what he writes and 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.500
 then this way then maybe 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.180
 start to follow him I also turn 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.010
 I could retweet all the 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.630
 accounts that I follow or not follow that 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.970
 I could retweet any tweet 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.950
 published publicly on the network and 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:32.330
 well, well, my followers will see that 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:34.430
 that retweet and good she let's see 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.950
 a little bit some more features of 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.020
 that we can write within our 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.000
 tweets as well we will be able 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.440
 let's say categorize 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.690
 the tweets that we write 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.070
 through a series of keywords that 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.730
 they are called hashtags 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.730
 it is written like this 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.650
 and he is represented with a pad 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.150
 whereupon when we create a 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.080
 pad and a word behind by 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.030
 example networks 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.650
 what we are going to do is create a 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.780
 hyperlink in such a way that 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.509
 all tweets that contain these 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.360
 Network pads will be rated 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:12.310
 following this hashtag and they will appear if 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.130
 I pulse on 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.690
 the hashtag networks will appear post of 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.200
 chronologically all the tweets that 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.750
 be written in the wake of the 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.280
 hashtag appears a new terminology or 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.620
 concept that is the trending topic 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.630
 trending topic is those hashtags 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.520
 most used in a region because 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.009
 example in madrid 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.990
 if there is any kind of important event or 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.699
 anything, usually 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.870
 appear a hashtag related to that 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.250
 event and Madrid will be the 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.750
 principal if it's in Barcelona because 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.819
 same in any city or country 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.099
 then we can configure that 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:46.389
 and then we see it in our account 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.639
 twitter to show us those 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:49.990
 trending topic or hashtag most used 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.759
 and well it's a way too 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.349
 many times of getting known because 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.690
 if we include within our 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:58.120
 tweet that trending topic any 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.379
 person that link click on envelope 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.169
 the trending topic, even if it does not follow 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:04.389
 You will see our our tweet and then 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:07.419
 finally like when we 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:09.250
 within those of the tweets we can 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.050
 also talk about other people 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.319
 or rather said of other accounts 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.840
 then how are we going to mention that 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.030
 account then very simple with we will put a 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.500
 at and the account for example my account 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:24.130
 of twitter is 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.800
 oriol upm anyone who inside 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:29.500
 of a tweet include oral upm will be me 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.360
 mentioning and I will get a 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.340
 notification as that person has 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.470
 mentioned here and you also have to have 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.990
 one thing in mind that if a tweet 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.960
 starts with a mention really is a 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.810
 replay or a reply with which 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.420
 those tweets are a bit special 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.000
 because he will not see them all the world is 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.440
 tell my followers and as I said 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.900
 before they can see any tweet but 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.110
 when I tweet a mention is made and 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.970
 start with an arroba and an account that 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.470
 tweet only those followers will see 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.250
 that also follow the account to which 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.780
 mentioned if I mention is between 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.520
 szyszlo tweet tights see any 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:10.270
 person that's only in the case where 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:13.600
 start with the arroba and he and he and the 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.730
 account then if the two people yes 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.940
 wants to follow that account if I 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.560
 I would see logically 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.790
 and I say that are very useful 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.680
 mentions to continue talking 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:30.230
 commenting on any topic with other 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.230
 people or include them in our tweets 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.720
 ah
