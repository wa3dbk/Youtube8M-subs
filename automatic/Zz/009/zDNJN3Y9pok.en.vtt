00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hello dear friends today 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.760
 look at the game gta Vasiti legendary 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.420
 the game that we played for another ten years 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:18.330
 back above she is very very recently 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:24.359
 and I downloaded version 101 of the official game 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:28.980
 weighs about 1.3 gigabytes is the average 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:33.989
 indicator for games of this magnitude with 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.790
 such graphics but in general let's 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.280
 miss all sorts of videos are not needed and 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.989
 let's see what you imagine the game 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.340
 here you can Russian localization 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.430
 see everything done very well 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.670
 let's go setup see what 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.289
 here is such a very significant long in them 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.399
 we will not dig here we look at 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.520
 graphics settings resolution here 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.949
 screen to maximum visual effects 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.930
 dynamic shadows subtitles 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.229
 on subtitles this is not some 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.900
 effect frame limiter well and in 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.100
 In general, all of this I turned on unscrewed 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.560
 on the maximum and give already start playing 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.110
 let's see how much she has changed since 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.110
 times of the computer version since 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.790
 mobile version of gta 3 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:33.150
 of course there is a change and now we are 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:36.590
 let's see clearly go now 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.310
 some movie note on 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.680
 motion animations of all characters 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:50.399
 everything looks very cool me and so 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:52.200
 I think that's what they say she'll miss 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.820
 The main thing is not the video, I myself play 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.960
 naturally here is such a strange somehow 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.920
 way we get a hammer but that's all 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.740
 However, the game is not surprising 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.770
 Well, so drove 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.030
 wait now how 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.100
 comfortable on the tape although it is written here 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:20.890
 need to kill two jurors they are not 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:26.400
 on the contrary do not need need to intimidate but ax 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:29.730
 scare we get into the car without it nowhere 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.250
 what about performance and 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.960
 playing in principle does not slow down there 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.240
 Of course the brakes are after 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.110
 long lasting makeup 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.840
 play time 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.000
 but comes from him through a very long 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.650
 time of course if the emphasis is to play this 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.800
 the game you can listen to the radio 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.130
 to switch the radio station we need 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.090
 svapnut left below the name 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:01.150
 radio station that plays this 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:04.060
 a moment like that for example x and spam dose to 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.790
 this radio is playing mexican by 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.950
 my 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.610
 what can be said about sound think here 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.510
 even without comment the sound is here 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.490
 exactly the same as when 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.620
 computer version reflects the atmosphere 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.230
 eighties all here at all without 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.700
 claims and even think talk about it 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.900
 especially not worth it all cool management 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.360
 management here is in principle very 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.900
 not bad but of course driving on 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:39.180
 on a small screen you are playing games like this 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:43.390
 kind of not very cool though this 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.970
 I wanted to say something 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.250
 the developers basically did everything that 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.060
 could and hardly could they have done 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.630
 better management made it 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:04:00.430
 most convenient to play in principle 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:05.140
 convenient and to management claims are very 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:08.380
 few though still happen as I understood 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.190
 can smash the car jury flag not 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.950
 fists 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:22.450
 a hammer you accidentally pressed the button 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:25.080
 to sit down car forget to say about 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.780
 that you can ride a motorcycle 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.750
 Of course, this is hardly surprising. 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.370
 brush for a sugary version too 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.390
 was riding motorcycles 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:40.000
 here all the same graphics are fair 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.240
 speaking from the time of gta 3 of course 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.180
 It changed for the better and about 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.940
 computer version is very honest special 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.479
 I did not notice such improvements 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.910
 of course this improvement seemed to me 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:58.720
 what is here somehow 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:01.630
 the animation looks better but it 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.550
 In general, it does not matter all the same game plays 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.690
 not because of the graphics though she is very here 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.690
 very nice but because of its atmosphere 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:13.390
 nostalgic 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.479
 Well, they drove something to carry out the mission to 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:20.820
 do we still have to go 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:22.740
 the camera can be brought so multitouch 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.140
 what in general 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:31.650
 Adds only advantages to the game such 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.650
 little let's take a motie 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:44.840
 oh you bastard they are so 13 lives with me 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:54.130
 in vain just time spent like that 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:57.250
 Do well, let's pick a freebie still 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:06:04.700
 gta wai city almost all freebies 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:10.220
 songs so look I forgot 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:12.980
 disadvantages of driving a motorcycle as well 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:16.820
 disadvantages if you do not have crooked hands 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:21.380
 everything will be fine but I always 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:25.580
 gta control in general any series with we 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:28.640
 neighbors and gta wasichi there it is three 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.220
 san andreas always had problems with 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.290
 running cars all the time 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:40.270
 crashed somewhere never traveled 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:40.270
 ok now almost arrived 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:50.140
 parked well what needs to be done 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.140
 hit the jury as I already understood 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:07:00.110
 cheat he somehow slowly went well let's 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:03.520
 a hammer in the face ran over the car but it 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:08.450
 I will not save him I already played this mission 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:11.110
 up smash juror's cars to 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:18.800
 make it come out let's give 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:27.370
 no problem there something muttered and a basin 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:27.370
 will not stop go there everyones look 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:49.790
 its finally higher but also ran away 

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:53.000
 Naturally from fear well, I think you can 

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.170
 By this end some I do not 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.100
 render the game 

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:59.870
 I think not play and naturally worth 

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:04.550
 Download game silver yes if you 

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:07.060
 of course did not want to buy everything but I think 

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.440
 what to buy this game is even worth 

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.570
 I will leave the download link in 

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.990
 Description Well, thank you all and to 

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.990
 dating
