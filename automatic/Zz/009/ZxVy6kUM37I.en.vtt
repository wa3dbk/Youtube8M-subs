and<00:03:11.829> they<00:03:12.189> have<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.340> barbed<00:03:12.639> end<00:03:12.879> that<00:03:13.239> can't

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
and they have a barbed end that can't

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.820 
and they have a barbed end that can't
pop<00:03:13.689> out<00:03:13.870> under<00:03:14.260> pressure

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
pop out under pressure

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.580 
pop out under pressure
however<00:03:16.730> one<00:03:17.120> main<00:03:17.360> problem<00:03:17.600> is<00:03:17.990> that<00:03:18.470> the

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
however one main problem is that the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.170 
however one main problem is that the
water<00:03:18.710> pressure<00:03:18.980> from<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.460> pump<00:03:19.700> isn't

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
water pressure from the pump isn't

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.940 
water pressure from the pump isn't
strong<00:03:20.630> enough<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:21.110> push<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.320> nice<00:03:21.620> flow

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
strong enough to push a nice flow

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.250 
strong enough to push a nice flow
through<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.430> drippers

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
through the drippers

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.440

to<00:03:25.010> remedy<00:03:25.159> this<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:25.819> basically<00:03:26.150> need<00:03:26.390> to

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
to remedy this you basically need to

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.750 
to remedy this you basically need to
widen<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.989> hole<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:27.439> poke<00:03:27.890> a<00:03:27.920> hot<00:03:28.250> drill<00:03:28.549> bit

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
widen the hole and poke a hot drill bit

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.320 
widen the hole and poke a hot drill bit
the<00:03:29.120> entire<00:03:29.390> way<00:03:29.629> through

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330
