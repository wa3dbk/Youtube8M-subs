00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.969
 Let's make people already putting a 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.989
 blender why is it so fast no 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.870
 It is not even worth putting the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.050
 ingredients a can of milk 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.050
 condensed

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.740
 found any bazaar assembled with 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.740
 margarine 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.390
 will now be 78 minutes in the microwave 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.970
 in high power 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.780
 Do you know the microwave? 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.810
 be the ideal power 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:11.920
 if it finishes on time and gets very soft 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:17.769
 puts another minute eight minutes into the 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:20.250
 not too strong and wait for a 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.690
 microwave time 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.910
 I checked it, it's a little more time. 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:31.620
 microwave cvm is well still liquid in the 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.989
 The month does not need it another minute 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.230
 it did not take another three minutes 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.900
 besides those 8 totaling 11 minutes 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.329
 I want you to look right side as it is 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.940
 that it is all of a homogeneous color 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.070
 it means that it is ready as a little 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.579
 darker than it was before 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.850
 go to the refrigerator until the 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:01.510
 two hours two hours after saying 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.690
 out a granulated chocolate 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:11.160

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.160
 hours of refrigerator with a knife 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:24.450

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.450
 circular movements 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:36.670
 made this way downstairs mischievous 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.630
 up and let gravity make your 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:47.590
 job 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:49.660
 The beauty of brigadeirÃ£o but still can 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.750
 improve 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.570
 like it 's true 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:02.400
 you must have nullified 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:02.400
 let's not be generous in the decoration 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:20.710
 I doubt that it made any difference. 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:24.850
 still on then just make it easy fast and 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:29.650
