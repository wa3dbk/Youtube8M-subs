all<00:00:02.780> right<00:00:02.900> today<00:00:03.140> I'm<00:00:03.260> going<00:00:03.380> to<00:00:03.440> show<00:00:03.590> you

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:03.650 
all right today I'm going to show you

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:14.410 
all right today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:03.950> to<00:00:03.980> do<00:00:04.400> partial<00:00:08.410> products<00:00:13.119> before<00:00:14.119> we

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
how to do partial products before we

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.240 
how to do partial products before we
start<00:00:14.660> let's<00:00:14.809> think<00:00:14.930> about<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:15.289> words<00:00:15.500> parcel

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
start let's think about the words parcel

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.859 
start let's think about the words parcel
and<00:00:16.340> products<00:00:16.730> again<00:00:17.000> with<00:00:17.150> parcel<00:00:17.600> or<00:00:17.690> think

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
and products again with parcel or think

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.009 
and products again with parcel or think
about<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.140> parts<00:00:18.529> of<00:00:19.390> the<00:00:20.390> number<00:00:20.750> and<00:00:20.929> we're

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:21.019 
about the parts of the number and we're

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.570 
about the parts of the number and we're
also<00:00:21.140> talking<00:00:21.410> about<00:00:21.560> products<00:00:22.130> which<00:00:22.279> means

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
also talking about products which means

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.050 
also talking about products which means
to<00:00:23.119> multiply<00:00:23.890> so<00:00:24.890> let's<00:00:25.669> start<00:00:25.910> with<00:00:25.970> the

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
to multiply so let's start with the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.079 
to multiply so let's start with the
number<00:00:26.330> like<00:00:26.900> 28<00:00:27.609> we're<00:00:28.609> going<00:00:28.730> to<00:00:28.789> multiply

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:29.089 
number like 28 we're going to multiply

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.540 
number like 28 we're going to multiply
that<00:00:29.269> by<00:00:29.330> 54<00:00:31.119> now<00:00:32.119> at<00:00:32.480> first<00:00:33.310> we<00:00:34.310> see<00:00:34.520> a

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
that by 54 now at first we see a

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.070 
that by 54 now at first we see a
two-digit<00:00:35.270> number<00:00:35.300> we<00:00:35.690> see<00:00:35.840> another

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
two-digit number we see another

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.140 
two-digit number we see another
two-digit<00:00:36.530> number<00:00:37.010> here's<00:00:37.730> what<00:00:37.910> we're<00:00:38.030> going

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
two-digit number here's what we're going

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.480 
two-digit number here's what we're going
to<00:00:38.180> do<00:00:38.650> 28<00:00:39.650> we're<00:00:39.920> going<00:00:40.040> to<00:00:40.100> break<00:00:40.250> it<00:00:40.370> into

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
to do 28 we're going to break it into

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
to do 28 we're going to break it into
parts<00:00:41.590> 28<00:00:42.760> well<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:43.940> number<00:00:44.150> in<00:00:44.240> the<00:00:44.300> tens

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
parts 28 well the number in the tens

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.440 
parts 28 well the number in the tens
place<00:00:44.630> is<00:00:45.020> 20<00:00:45.530> and<00:00:45.940> then<00:00:46.940> number<00:00:47.060> in<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.270> ones

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
place is 20 and then number in the ones

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.500 
place is 20 and then number in the ones
place<00:00:47.540> is<00:00:47.960> 8<00:00:48.380> so<00:00:49.130> if<00:00:49.190> we<00:00:49.340> do<00:00:49.460> 20<00:00:49.970> plus<00:00:50.210> 8<00:00:50.450> that's

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
place is 8 so if we do 20 plus 8 that's

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.710 
place is 8 so if we do 20 plus 8 that's
going<00:00:50.900> to<00:00:50.990> give<00:00:51.080> us<00:00:51.250> 28<00:00:52.450> 54<00:00:53.450> are<00:00:53.540> going<00:00:53.660> to

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
going to give us 28 54 are going to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.660 
going to give us 28 54 are going to
break<00:00:53.900> that<00:00:54.020> into<00:00:54.200> parts<00:00:54.590> number<00:00:55.190> in<00:00:55.280> our<00:00:55.340> tens

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
break that into parts number in our tens

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.950 
break that into parts number in our tens
place<00:00:55.970> is<00:00:56.240> 50<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:58.360> our<00:00:59.360> number<00:00:59.630> in<00:00:59.720> the<00:00:59.780> ones

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
place is 50 and our number in the ones

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.200 
place is 50 and our number in the ones
place<00:01:00.230> is<00:01:00.470> 4<00:01:00.860> now<00:01:01.460> I'm<00:01:01.730> going<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:02.000> draw<00:01:02.180> some

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
place is 4 now I'm going to draw some

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.760 
place is 4 now I'm going to draw some
parentheses<00:01:03.080> because<00:01:03.410> you're<00:01:03.530> going<00:01:03.650> to<00:01:03.710> be

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
parentheses because you're going to be

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.560 
parentheses because you're going to be
thinking<00:01:04.189> this<00:01:04.309> in<00:01:04.489> your<00:01:04.610> head<00:01:04.790> in<00:01:04.909> about<00:01:05.119> 6

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
thinking this in your head in about 6

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.040 
thinking this in your head in about 6
minutes<00:01:05.840> as<00:01:06.110> we<00:01:06.260> take<00:01:06.440> a<00:01:06.470> look<00:01:06.710> at<00:01:06.800> that<00:01:06.970> now

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
minutes as we take a look at that now

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.880 
minutes as we take a look at that now
what<00:01:09.050> we're<00:01:09.200> going<00:01:09.320> to<00:01:09.380> do<00:01:09.500> is<00:01:09.620> we're<00:01:09.740> going<00:01:09.770> to

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.640 
what we're going to do is we're going to
multiply<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:10.880> parts<00:01:11.450> I'm<00:01:11.990> gonna<00:01:12.230> use<00:01:12.320> my<00:01:12.440> red

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
multiply the parts I'm gonna use my red

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.370 
multiply the parts I'm gonna use my red
marker<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.250> show<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:14.780> ways<00:01:14.990> I'm<00:01:15.170> going<00:01:15.230> to

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
marker to show you the ways I'm going to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.460 
marker to show you the ways I'm going to
multiply<00:01:15.440> so<00:01:16.280> I'm<00:01:16.340> going<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.520> do<00:01:16.610> 20<00:01:17.150> times<00:01:17.750> 50

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
multiply so I'm going to do 20 times 50

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.290 
multiply so I'm going to do 20 times 50
now<00:01:18.860> if<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:19.190> remember<00:01:19.310> your<00:01:19.550> zeros<00:01:19.909> trick<00:01:20.150> we

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
now if you remember your zeros trick we

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.280 
now if you remember your zeros trick we
have<00:01:20.420> two<00:01:20.690> zeros<00:01:21.700> write<00:01:22.700> those<00:01:22.880> down<00:01:23.020> 2<00:01:24.020> times

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
have two zeros write those down 2 times

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.740 
have two zeros write those down 2 times
5<00:01:24.620> is<00:01:25.510> 10

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
5 is 10

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.830 
5 is 10
so<00:01:27.440> that's<00:01:27.620> 1000<00:01:28.570> next<00:01:29.570> we're<00:01:29.690> going<00:01:29.780> to

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
so that's 1000 next we're going to

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.390 
so that's 1000 next we're going to
multiply<00:01:30.200> 20<00:01:30.790> times<00:01:31.790> 4<00:01:32.210> again<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:33.440> have<00:01:33.560> a<00:01:33.590> 0<00:01:33.979> 2

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
multiply 20 times 4 again you have a 0 2

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.860 
multiply 20 times 4 again you have a 0 2
times<00:01:34.640> 4<00:01:35.000> is<00:01:35.030> 80<00:01:36.670> now<00:01:37.670> we're<00:01:37.850> going<00:01:37.940> to<00:01:38.000> do<00:01:38.150> 50

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
times 4 is 80 now we're going to do 50

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.110 
times 4 is 80 now we're going to do 50
times<00:01:39.770> 8<00:01:40.840> see<00:01:41.840> zero<00:01:42.170> there<00:01:42.320> as<00:01:42.409> well<00:01:42.650> 5<00:01:43.460> times<00:01:43.850> 8

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
times 8 see zero there as well 5 times 8

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.560 
times 8 see zero there as well 5 times 8
is<00:01:44.150> 40<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:46.270> then<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.540> last<00:01:48.340> do<00:01:49.340> 8<00:01:49.640> times<00:01:49.880> 4<00:01:50.330> 8

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
is 40 and then the last do 8 times 4 8

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.820 
is 40 and then the last do 8 times 4 8
times<00:01:50.840> 4<00:01:51.140> is<00:01:51.200> 32<00:01:53.170> now<00:01:54.170> here's<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.650> question

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
times 4 is 32 now here's the question

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.550 
times 4 is 32 now here's the question
how<00:01:55.790> do<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:55.940> know<00:01:56.060> 1<00:01:56.210> stop<00:01:56.600> well<00:01:57.290> you<00:01:57.470> know

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
how do you know 1 stop well you know

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.230 
how do you know 1 stop well you know
what<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:57.799> stop<00:01:58.070> when<00:01:58.850> you've<00:01:59.000> done<00:01:59.500> these<00:02:00.500> 4

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
what to stop when you've done these 4

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.969 
what to stop when you've done these 4
and<00:02:02.240> when<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.659> fill<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:03.200> in<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:06.350> looks<00:02:06.619> kind

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
and when you fill that in it looks kind

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.039 
and when you fill that in it looks kind
of<00:02:07.040> like<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.220> bowtie<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.360> if<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:08.539> do<00:02:08.690> that<00:02:08.869> you

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
of like a bowtie so if you do that you

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.779 
of like a bowtie so if you do that you
know<00:02:09.229> hey<00:02:09.470> I've<00:02:09.619> multiplied<00:02:10.129> all<00:02:10.279> the<00:02:10.429> numbers

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
know hey I've multiplied all the numbers

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.510 
know hey I've multiplied all the numbers
now<00:02:11.569> all<00:02:11.930> I<00:02:11.989> need<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.439> do<00:02:12.560> is<00:02:12.680> add

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
now all I need to do is add

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.830 
now all I need to do is add
zero<00:02:14.090> zero<00:02:14.300> zero<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:14.750> 2<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:16.330> 0<00:02:17.330> plus<00:02:17.630> eight

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
zero zero zero and 2 to 0 plus eight

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.520 
zero zero zero and 2 to 0 plus eight
plus<00:02:17.870> zero<00:02:18.110> plus<00:02:18.440> 3<00:02:18.740> is<00:02:18.890> 11<00:02:19.870> 1<00:02:20.870> plus<00:02:21.110> zero<00:02:21.350> plus

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
plus zero plus 3 is 11 1 plus zero plus

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.670 
plus zero plus 3 is 11 1 plus zero plus
four<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:22.070> five<00:02:22.760> or<00:02:23.240> one<00:02:24.200> come<00:02:24.380> straight<00:02:24.650> down

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
four is five or one come straight down

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.920 
four is five or one come straight down
and<00:02:25.070> we<00:02:25.130> have<00:02:27.010> 1512<00:02:28.240> so<00:02:29.240> we're<00:02:29.510> going<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.690> start

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
and we have 1512 so we're going to start

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.000 
and we have 1512 so we're going to start
off<00:02:30.050> with<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.440> I'll<00:02:30.620> show<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:30.860> another

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
off with that I'll show you another

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.780 
off with that I'll show you another
problem<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:33.080> we'll<00:02:33.200> use<00:02:33.440> our<00:02:33.790> thinking

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
problem and we'll use our thinking

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.110 
problem and we'll use our thinking
parentheses<00:02:35.780> over<00:02:36.260> there

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
parentheses over there

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.220 
parentheses over there
again<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.240> want<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.480> remember<00:02:38.570> that<00:02:38.900> you're

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
again you want to remember that you're

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.150 
again you want to remember that you're
going<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.380> separate<00:02:39.940> these<00:02:40.940> numbers<00:02:41.540> into

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
going to separate these numbers into

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.330 
going to separate these numbers into
parts<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.510> have<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.870> 10<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.770> 1<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.280> I'm

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
parts so you have a 10 and a 1 so I'm

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.270 
parts so you have a 10 and a 1 so I'm
going<00:02:46.460> to<00:02:46.520> give<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.760> number<00:02:47.000> 36

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
going to give you the number 36

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.760 
going to give you the number 36
multiplied<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.460> by<00:02:50.140> 47<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:52.310> parts<00:02:52.790> multiply

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
multiplied that by 47 so parts multiply

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.490 
multiplied that by 47 so parts multiply
products<00:02:55.300> 36<00:02:56.300> well<00:02:56.570> in<00:02:56.690> our<00:02:56.780> tens<00:02:57.050> place<00:02:57.320> we

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
products 36 well in our tens place we

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.790 
products 36 well in our tens place we
have<00:02:57.590> 30<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:59.150> our<00:02:59.240> ones<00:02:59.480> place<00:02:59.570> we<00:02:59.870> have<00:02:59.960> 6<00:03:00.320> for

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
have 30 in our ones place we have 6 for

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.720 
have 30 in our ones place we have 6 for
47<00:03:01.580> in<00:03:02.270> our<00:03:02.390> tens<00:03:02.630> place<00:03:02.840> we<00:03:03.020> have<00:03:03.110> 40<00:03:03.590> all<00:03:03.980> ones

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
47 in our tens place we have 40 all ones

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.920 
47 in our tens place we have 40 all ones
place<00:03:04.940> beyond<00:03:05.210> 7<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.020> 30<00:03:06.290> plus<00:03:06.590> 6<00:03:06.890> is<00:03:07.070> 36<00:03:07.930> 40

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
place beyond 7 so 30 plus 6 is 36 40

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.480 
place beyond 7 so 30 plus 6 is 36 40
plus<00:03:09.080> 7<00:03:09.440> equals<00:03:09.710> 47<00:03:10.960> again<00:03:12.010> let's<00:03:13.010> think<00:03:13.280> that

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
plus 7 equals 47 again let's think that

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.010 
plus 7 equals 47 again let's think that
both<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:14.620> 30<00:03:15.620> times<00:03:15.980> 40<00:03:16.400> so<00:03:17.000> here<00:03:17.330> I<00:03:17.360> have<00:03:17.450> two

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
both I 30 times 40 so here I have two

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:26.470 
both I 30 times 40 so here I have two
zeros<00:03:18.980> jot<00:03:19.940> those<00:03:20.120> down<00:03:20.180> 3<00:03:21.110> times<00:03:21.290> 4<00:03:21.770> is<00:03:22.420> 12<00:03:25.480> 30

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
zeros jot those down 3 times 4 is 12 30

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:35.830 
zeros jot those down 3 times 4 is 12 30
times<00:03:26.870> 7<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.740> see<00:03:28.460> 1<00:03:28.760> 0<00:03:29.620> now<00:03:30.620> 3<00:03:31.040> times<00:03:31.310> 7<00:03:31.760> is<00:03:31.880> 21<00:03:34.840> 40

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
times 7 I see 1 0 now 3 times 7 is 21 40

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:45.310 
times 7 I see 1 0 now 3 times 7 is 21 40

is<00:03:45.680> 42

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
is 42

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.150 
is 42
all<00:03:48.620> right<00:03:48.860> 42<00:03:49.490> down<00:03:50.170> now<00:03:51.170> I<00:03:51.200> see<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.860> we<00:03:51.980> do

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
all right 42 down now I see that we do

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.260 
all right 42 down now I see that we do
have<00:03:52.340> our<00:03:52.370> bowtie<00:03:54.670> which<00:03:55.670> means<00:03:55.910> we've<00:03:56.090> done

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
have our bowtie which means we've done

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.410 
have our bowtie which means we've done
all<00:03:56.600> the<00:03:56.960> correct<00:03:57.380> ones<00:03:57.970> all<00:03:58.970> we<00:03:59.090> have<00:03:59.210> to<00:03:59.300> do

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
all the correct ones all we have to do

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.610 
all the correct ones all we have to do
is<00:03:59.540> add<00:03:59.720> 0<00:04:00.560> plus<00:04:00.590> 0<00:04:00.830> plus<00:04:01.040> 0<00:04:01.130> is<00:04:01.430> 2<00:04:02.200> 0<00:04:03.200> plus<00:04:03.470> 1

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
is add 0 plus 0 plus 0 is 2 0 plus 1

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.570 
is add 0 plus 0 plus 0 is 2 0 plus 1
plus<00:04:03.860> 4<00:04:04.040> plus<00:04:04.100> 4<00:04:04.490> is<00:04:04.550> 9<00:04:05.170> 2<00:04:06.170> plus<00:04:06.350> 2<00:04:06.500> plus<00:04:06.680> 2<00:04:06.770> is<00:04:06.920> 6

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
plus 4 plus 4 is 9 2 plus 2 plus 2 is 6

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.390 
plus 4 plus 4 is 9 2 plus 2 plus 2 is 6
and<00:04:07.870> 1<00:04:08.870> comes<00:04:09.410> straight<00:04:09.620> down<00:04:09.830> so<00:04:10.100> we<00:04:10.190> have<00:04:10.310> an

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
and 1 comes straight down so we have an

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.910 
and 1 comes straight down so we have an
answer<00:04:10.670> of<00:04:12.250> 1692<00:04:13.780> so<00:04:14.780> once<00:04:15.410> you<00:04:15.500> remember<00:04:15.680> that

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
answer of 1692 so once you remember that

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.530 
answer of 1692 so once you remember that
anything<00:04:16.489> that<00:04:16.609> was<00:04:16.700> done<00:04:16.910> in<00:04:17.180> the

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
anything that was done in the

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.270 
anything that was done in the
parentheses<00:04:18.290> these<00:04:18.500> past<00:04:18.739> two<00:04:18.890> problems<00:04:19.190> are

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
parentheses these past two problems are

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.740 
parentheses these past two problems are
really<00:04:19.430> what<00:04:19.640> we're<00:04:19.790> thinking<00:04:20.060> about<00:04:20.330> in<00:04:20.630> our

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
really what we're thinking about in our

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.680 
really what we're thinking about in our
head<00:04:21.020> now<00:04:21.710> I'm<00:04:21.770> going<00:04:21.890> to<00:04:21.950> show<00:04:22.220> you<00:04:22.450> how<00:04:23.450> to<00:04:23.510> do

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
head now I'm going to show you how to do

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
write it down here though we'll take

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.330 
write it down here though we'll take
that<00:04:28.890> down<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:31.080> erase<00:04:31.380> these<00:04:31.620> parts<00:04:34.340> I'll

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
that down and erase these parts I'll

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.980 
that down and erase these parts I'll
give<00:04:35.520> you<00:04:35.640> another<00:04:35.880> example

give you another example
let's<00:04:37.350> do<00:04:37.560> 85<00:04:38.540> times<00:04:39.710> 41<00:04:40.790> now<00:04:41.790> let's<00:04:42.660> talk

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
let's do 85 times 41 now let's talk

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.520 
let's do 85 times 41 now let's talk
about<00:04:42.960> it<00:04:43.350> let's<00:04:43.440> think<00:04:43.680> about<00:04:43.830> what<00:04:44.160> makes<00:04:44.340> 85

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
about it let's think about what makes 85

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.020 
about it let's think about what makes 85
80<00:04:46.530> plus<00:04:47.400> 5

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
80 plus 5

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.330 
80 plus 5
what<00:04:48.780> makes<00:04:48.990> 41<00:04:49.910> 40<00:04:50.910> plus<00:04:51.600> 1<00:04:51.900> let's<00:04:52.560> think<00:04:52.980> that

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
what makes 41 40 plus 1 let's think that

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.180 
what makes 41 40 plus 1 let's think that
we're<00:04:53.760> going<00:04:53.850> to<00:04:53.910> do<00:04:54.060> this<00:04:54.150> in<00:04:54.330> our<00:04:54.420> head<00:04:55.190> so

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
we're going to do this in our head so

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.450 
we're going to do this in our head so
let's<00:04:56.310> start<00:04:56.520> by<00:04:56.640> doing<00:04:56.790> 80<00:04:57.410> times<00:04:58.410> 40

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
let's start by doing 80 times 40

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:06.430 
let's start by doing 80 times 40
well<00:04:59.850> 80<00:05:00.120> has<00:05:00.420> is<00:05:00.630> 0<00:05:01.130> 40<00:05:02.130> a<00:05:02.160> 0<00:05:02.730> 8<00:05:03.570> times<00:05:03.810> 4<00:05:04.110> is<00:05:04.170> 32

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.290 

okay<00:05:07.440> so<00:05:08.010> in<00:05:08.370> our<00:05:08.550> head<00:05:08.790> we<00:05:08.820> just<00:05:09.210> did<00:05:09.360> this<00:05:11.300> we

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
okay so in our head we just did this we

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.280 
okay so in our head we just did this we
just<00:05:12.540> found<00:05:13.140> this<00:05:13.470> answer<00:05:15.080> next<00:05:16.080> we're<00:05:16.200> going

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
just found this answer next we're going

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.350 
just found this answer next we're going
to<00:05:16.350> do<00:05:16.500> 80<00:05:16.770> times<00:05:18.560> 180<00:05:19.560> has<00:05:19.770> 1<00:05:20.040> 0<00:05:20.310> 8<00:05:20.520> times<00:05:20.850> 1<00:05:21.150> is

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
to do 80 times 180 has 1 0 8 times 1 is

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:28.280 
to do 80 times 180 has 1 0 8 times 1 is
8<00:05:22.550> off<00:05:23.550> we<00:05:23.910> remember<00:05:24.419> we<00:05:25.380> just<00:05:25.410> did<00:05:25.800> 80<00:05:27.140> times<00:05:28.140> a

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
8 off we remember we just did 80 times a

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:35.360 
8 off we remember we just did 80 times a
1<00:05:29.150> next<00:05:30.150> we<00:05:30.240> have<00:05:30.360> 40<00:05:31.010> times<00:05:32.010> 5<00:05:33.080> 40<00:05:34.080> has<00:05:34.260> 1<00:05:34.620> 0<00:05:34.950> 4

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
1 next we have 40 times 5 40 has 1 0 4

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:47.240 
1 next we have 40 times 5 40 has 1 0 4
times<00:05:35.610> 5<00:05:35.850> is<00:05:36.180> 20<00:05:37.220> so<00:05:38.220> we<00:05:38.250> just<00:05:38.490> did<00:05:38.669> this<00:05:38.790> one

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.150 

forty<00:05:47.970> times<00:05:48.720> five<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.560> last<00:05:49.800> part<00:05:50.100> you

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
forty times five the last part you

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.490 
forty times five the last part you
guessed<00:05:50.550> it<00:05:50.670> to<00:05:50.820> complete<00:05:51.150> our<00:05:51.180> bowtie<00:05:51.960> five

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
guessed it to complete our bowtie five

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.170 
guessed it to complete our bowtie five
times<00:05:52.830> one<00:05:53.130> or<00:05:54.710> five<00:05:55.710> times<00:05:55.890> one<00:05:56.160> here<00:05:56.520> gives

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
times one or five times one here gives

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.610 
times one or five times one here gives
us<00:05:57.360> five<00:05:57.810> we've<00:05:58.740> completed<00:05:59.250> our<00:05:59.430> bowtie<00:06:00.620> let's

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
us five we've completed our bowtie let's

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.790 
us five we've completed our bowtie let's
add<00:06:01.800> them<00:06:01.890> together<00:06:03.410> zero<00:06:04.410> plus<00:06:04.560> zero<00:06:04.620> plus

of 3485 now I'm going to give you a

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.330 
of 3485 now I'm going to give you a
problem<00:06:21.960> and<00:06:22.410> what<00:06:22.650> I'd<00:06:22.770> like<00:06:22.920> you<00:06:23.010> to<00:06:23.130> do<00:06:23.250> is

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
problem and what I'd like you to do is

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.470 
problem and what I'd like you to do is
come<00:06:23.520> back<00:06:23.610> to<00:06:23.670> part<00:06:24.030> two

come back to part two

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.790 
come back to part two
actually<00:06:24.810> I'm<00:06:24.870> gonna<00:06:24.990> give<00:06:25.110> you<00:06:25.170> two<00:06:25.320> problems

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
actually I'm gonna give you two problems

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.740 
actually I'm gonna give you two problems
when<00:06:26.460> you<00:06:26.520> come<00:06:26.670> back<00:06:26.790> to<00:06:26.940> part<00:06:27.150> two<00:06:27.390> we'll

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
when you come back to part two we'll

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.930 
when you come back to part two we'll
solve<00:06:28.110> both<00:06:28.350> of<00:06:28.410> those<00:06:28.710> and<00:06:28.980> let's<00:06:29.460> see<00:06:29.700> how

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
solve both of those and let's see how

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.660 
solve both of those and let's see how
you<00:06:30.000> did<00:06:30.390> in<00:06:30.630> solving<00:06:31.290> those<00:06:31.520> remember<00:06:32.520> that

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.670 
you did in solving those remember that

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.670 
you did in solving those remember that
if<00:06:32.790> you<00:06:32.940> want<00:06:32.970> to<00:06:33.180> use<00:06:33.390> this<00:06:33.870> bubble<00:06:34.440> right

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
if you want to use this bubble right

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.190 
if you want to use this bubble right
here<00:06:35.160> kind<00:06:36.030> of<00:06:36.210> just<00:06:36.330> symbolize<00:06:36.750> what<00:06:36.780> we're

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
here kind of just symbolize what we're

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.370 
here kind of just symbolize what we're
thinking<00:06:37.440> about<00:06:37.860> you<00:06:38.760> should<00:06:39.000> have<00:06:39.380> two

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
thinking about you should have two

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.100 
thinking about you should have two
numbers<00:06:40.800> in<00:06:41.070> the<00:06:41.130> tens<00:06:42.120> place<00:06:42.270> and<00:06:42.690> two

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
numbers in the tens place and two

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.830 
numbers in the tens place and two
numbers<00:06:43.470> in<00:06:43.650> the<00:06:43.710> ones<00:06:44.100> place<00:06:44.250> so<00:06:44.730> I'm<00:06:45.720> going

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
numbers in the ones place so I'm going

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.970 
numbers in the ones place so I'm going
to<00:06:45.870> give<00:06:46.020> you<00:06:46.140> these<00:06:47.630> problems

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:51.980 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:57.280 

I'll<00:06:52.980> give<00:06:53.160> you<00:06:53.280> 62<00:06:55.130> times

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:57.290 
I'll give you 62 times

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.580 
I'll give you 62 times
47<00:06:59.210> so<00:07:00.210> that's<00:07:00.330> the<00:07:00.450> first<00:07:00.660> problem<00:07:00.870> if<00:07:01.470> you'd

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
47 so that's the first problem if you'd

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.900 
47 so that's the first problem if you'd
like<00:07:01.740> to<00:07:01.890> use<00:07:02.010> your<00:07:02.040> memory<00:07:02.310> bubble<00:07:02.790> you<00:07:02.850> can

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:02.910 
like to use your memory bubble you can

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.840 
like to use your memory bubble you can
do<00:07:03.150> that<00:07:03.360> and<00:07:04.100> then<00:07:05.100> for<00:07:05.220> the<00:07:05.310> second<00:07:05.669> problem

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:05.850 
do that and then for the second problem

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:12.830 
do that and then for the second problem
