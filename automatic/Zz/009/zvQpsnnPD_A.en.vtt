00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 and an entire block in the center again 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.080
 Hamburg will be the integration point 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.760
 for all means of transport 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.800
 available in the municipality 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.799
 the multimodal terminal will be located 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.980
 next to the last train station at 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.890
 new hamburg station 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.840
 the train coming to the city has changed 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.970
 hamburger life 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.119
 The newest project is a terminal 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.250
 which should be ready by 2013 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.470
 the work will have benefits for 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.620
 all independent of transport 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.360
 used this work has access to 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.750
 on the east side 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.170
 the opposite side of the mall and a 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.070
 access this shopping side also 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.360
 transurb has to do with planning 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.160
 is on that side is also to expose the access of 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.390
 stage allows the car 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.530
 bikes and bikes and also inside 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.790
 a policy of encouraging migration 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.070
 from the private dock for the 3 to the subway 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.409
 we will also provide an area 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.930
 for car parking 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.659
 the main purpose of the work is to do 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.500
 with which more people use the train with 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.689
 the terminal 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.640
 the population will be able to reach the station 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.740
 through the main bus lines 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.439
 of the city and also the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.960
 metropolitan areas in addition who is up to 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.030
 There by motorcycle or bike will power 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.409
 leave the vehicle parked at a location 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.430
 a criticism that the company suffers 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.250
 systematically is precisely because of the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.340
 sometimes not available with the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.320
 stations an area for parking of 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.899
 vehicles that can then encourage 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.659
 use of the subway is and that the owner of the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.740
 vehicle to leave a safe place is 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:56.280
 comfortable, right? 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.979
 then using the subway is exactly the fact that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.229
 be an end station z o 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.530
 travel to Porto Alegre where a 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.009
 greater and fully justified in 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.250
 role of this planning that is being 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.410
 elaborate 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.610
 the idea is to build the terminal 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.710
 multimodal right here in the center of this 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.510
 saadi in the future new hamburg station 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.120
 so that people who come with some 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.940
 other means of transport as motorcycle 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.000
 your trip 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.280
 with train but for the accomplishment of the work goes 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.400
 necessary the expropriation of all 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.980
 the block next to the station and for that the 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.860
 trades that work there will need 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.130
 to leave the seat that remains is the one of dwelling 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.230
 particularly though still remains in 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.300
 some of those facilities in the 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.600
 reality all owners already 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.650
 were contacted by our 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.730
 coordination of expropriations and 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.739
 several of these situations are already 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.720
 even concluded in terms of 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:03.580
 expropriation nÃ© 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:07.239
 I have to trensurb it 's a way is the 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.910
 indemnification of the area and the 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.720
 existing improvements and possibly 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.040
 another may have through a lawsuit 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.100
 judicial 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.260
 some trades have stopped working 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.290
 but others will still have to leave the 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.510
 area like mac donald music palace 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.519
 spanish weapons ammunition and box 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.530
 federal economy and now we 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.750
 received the information that we have to 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.000
 leaving with this area is already the union 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.220
 So we're building with a lot of 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.680
 hurry and with little money 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.380
 another store for us down the street 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.350
 April 5th 200 meters from here it does not have 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.660
 problem to reformulate the structure 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.299
 and it has to be done right. 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.280
 the problem i like the idea of a 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.400
 fair compensation is far away 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.799
 It's not fair, it's not the commercial point. 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.230
 is evaluated or I can not buy 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.360
 with which I receive a land in 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.640
 Similar situation, then I have to 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.100
 turn me on thirty means it 's a 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.350
 little is an invitation to close a 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.269
 company of 50 years here 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.190
 changes are evident for the 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.810
 population and for those working in 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.610
 near the work 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.959
 the main bus lines that today 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.120
 go to the center 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.310
 you direct data to the terminal 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.450
 for James who works as a taxi driver there 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.140
 14 years 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.760
 the movement can I believe a 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.750
 little helps reduce our movement 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.790
 right here 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.370
 even because everything is very central there 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.010
 then it will be a personal reference already 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.230
 will get off there by train 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.420
 Let's get the bus there then we'll go 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.460
 be the taxi there too so they do not 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.070
 have because it's sudden that I'm going to get a 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.280
 taxi but as we are already a point 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.750
 here very traditional of many years I 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.890
 I believe it will not influence so much 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:56.530
 in our parish and not yet 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.060
 have a total value of the work but are 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.790
 estimated an investment of 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.450
 approximately R $ 15 million to 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.450
 the expropriations
