00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.500 
area gas stations were so much fun in JC
-<00:02:15.650> we<00:02:15.890> decided<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:16.520> we<00:02:16.670> wanted<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.000> take<00:02:17.330> them

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
- we decided that we wanted to take them

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.500 
- we decided that we wanted to take them
out<00:02:17.690> of<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.990> core<00:02:18.260> chaos<00:02:18.709> progression<00:02:19.280> system

out of the core chaos progression system

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.060 
out of the core chaos progression system
and<00:02:20.510> just<00:02:20.660> allow<00:02:20.930> players<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.440> destroy<00:02:21.860> them

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
and just allow players to destroy them

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.770 
and just allow players to destroy them
as<00:02:22.190> many<00:02:22.370> times<00:02:22.640> as<00:02:22.760> they<00:02:22.880> want<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.630> our
