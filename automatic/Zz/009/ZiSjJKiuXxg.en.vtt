00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
look at those in a second 50 foot of cat

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.320 
look at those in a second 50 foot of cat
5<00:00:19.500> cable<00:00:21.020> and<00:00:22.020> then<00:00:22.199> over<00:00:22.560> here<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:22.949> we'll<00:00:23.100> just

5 cable and then over here so we'll just

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.570 
5 cable and then over here so we'll just
hit<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.570> switch<00:00:25.820> on<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:27.090> comes<00:00:28.039> and<00:00:29.039> right

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
hit the on switch on it comes and right

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.540 
hit the on switch on it comes and right
away<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.820> see<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.779> says<00:00:31.340> disarmed<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:34.399> you<00:00:35.399> can

you<00:00:37.800> which<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.809> nodes<00:00:40.050> are<00:00:40.290> active<00:00:40.710> which

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
you which of the nodes are active which

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.430 
you which of the nodes are active which
ones<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.610> good<00:00:41.879> nichrome<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.600> them<00:00:42.780> which

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
ones have good nichrome in them which

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.930 
ones have good nichrome in them which
ones<00:00:43.680> are<00:00:43.829> running<00:00:44.100> well<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.700> see<00:00:44.910> right

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
ones are running well so you see right

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.420 
ones are running well so you see right
there<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.930> all<00:00:46.079> lit<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:46.739> control<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
there it's all lit up we can control the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.200 
there it's all lit up we can control the
brightness<00:00:47.640> by<00:00:48.059> turning<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.750> knob<00:00:48.809> up<00:00:49.260> here

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
brightness by turning this knob up here

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.650 
brightness by turning this knob up here
you<00:00:51.210> need<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> little<00:00:51.960> bit<00:00:52.079> better

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
you need to see that a little bit better

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.599 
you need to see that a little bit better
you<00:00:54.660> can<00:00:54.780> go<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.500> more<00:00:55.680> switch<00:00:55.980> turn<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:57.590> armed

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
you can go one more switch turn to armed

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.340 
you can go one more switch turn to armed
so<00:00:59.609> now<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.789> system<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.329> armed<00:01:03.229> turn<00:01:04.229> that

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
so now the system is armed turn that

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.000 
so now the system is armed turn that
brightness<00:01:04.680> back<00:01:04.890> down<00:01:06.710> there<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.830> go<00:01:07.950> you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
brightness back down there you go you

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.030 
brightness back down there you go you
can<00:01:08.100> see<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.340> well<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.760> way<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.180> then<00:01:10.170> still

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
can see it well that way and then still

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.830 
can see it well that way and then still
shows<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.549> all<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.909> nodes<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.390> green<00:01:12.630> that

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
shows you it all the nodes in green that

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.429 
shows you it all the nodes in green that
are<00:01:12.960> ready<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.470> go<00:01:13.650> then<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.700> turn<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
are ready to go then you can turn it to

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.690 
are ready to go then you can turn it to
armed<00:01:16.439> all<00:01:16.650> if<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.920> want<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.130> launch<00:01:17.250> all<00:01:17.520> your

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
fireworks at once you see right there

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.310 
fireworks at once you see right there
every<00:01:20.250> button<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.670> lit<00:01:20.930> because<00:01:21.930> every<00:01:22.140> one<00:01:22.290> of

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
every button is lit because every one of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.870 
every button is lit because every one of
those<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.680> active<00:01:23.100> same<00:01:23.970> as<00:01:24.150> up<00:01:24.270> here<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.630> green

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
those is active same as up here in green

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.260 
those is active same as up here in green
armed<00:01:27.020> they're<00:01:28.020> all<00:01:28.140> lit<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:29.700> we'll<00:01:29.909> walk<00:01:30.060> out

banana clips this is lead number one and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.120 
banana clips this is lead number one and
now<00:02:04.610> here<00:02:04.880> we've<00:02:05.030> got<00:02:05.210> our<00:02:05.980> nighter

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
now here we've got our nighter

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.380 
now here we've got our nighter
see<00:02:07.400> a<00:02:07.430> little<00:02:07.640> fuse<00:02:08.030> in<00:02:08.210> there<00:02:08.390> at<00:02:08.540> the<00:02:08.720> end<00:02:10.390> so

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
see a little fuse in there at the end so

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.000 
see a little fuse in there at the end so
we'll<00:02:11.570> we'll<00:02:11.990> give<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.320> test<00:02:12.500> run<00:02:12.680> here<00:02:12.950> in

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
we'll we'll give it a test run here in

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.490 
we'll we'll give it a test run here in
one<00:02:13.130> second
