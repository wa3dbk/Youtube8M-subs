which was stitched to his back right
there<00:00:31.960> but<00:00:32.529> I<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:33.880> it<00:00:34.000> better<00:00:34.120> detached<00:00:34.630> so<00:00:34.810> I

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
there but I like it better detached so I

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.320 
there but I like it better detached so I
cut<00:00:35.110> the<00:00:35.490> string<00:00:36.720> but<00:00:38.700> I've<00:00:39.700> had<00:00:40.180> him<00:00:40.300> for

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
cut the string but I've had him for

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.390 
cut the string but I've had him for
quite<00:00:40.660> a<00:00:40.690> while<00:00:40.870> so<00:00:40.930> I'm<00:00:41.320> not<00:00:41.500> sure<00:00:41.560> if<00:00:42.010> he's

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
quite a while so I'm not sure if he's

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.120 
quite a while so I'm not sure if he's
still<00:00:42.700> available<00:00:43.330> at<00:00:44.140> the<00:00:44.320> Disney<00:00:44.680> Store<00:00:44.920> but

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
still available at the Disney Store but

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.860 
still available at the Disney Store but
I<00:00:45.190> would<00:00:45.340> think<00:00:45.580> so

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
I would think so

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.400 
I would think so
if<00:00:47.740> he<00:00:47.980> is<00:00:48.250> I<00:00:48.700> didn't<00:00:49.630> see<00:00:49.660> him<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:50.080> last<00:00:50.230> time

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
if he is I didn't see him the last time

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.260 
if he is I didn't see him the last time
I<00:00:50.530> was<00:00:50.740> at<00:00:50.860> the<00:00:51.160> Disney<00:00:51.520> Store<00:00:51.760> but<00:00:51.940> I<00:00:51.970> haven't

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
been there for a while but I believe

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.950

when<00:00:55.720> I<00:00:55.780> got<00:00:55.960> him<00:00:56.110> he<00:00:56.140> was<00:00:56.290> about<00:00:57.960> sixteen

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
when I got him he was about sixteen

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.600 
when I got him he was about sixteen
fifty<00:00:59.410> or<00:00:59.500> so<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:02.140> if<00:01:02.470> you<00:01:03.040> were<00:01:03.130> looking<00:01:03.250> for

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.310 
fifty or so so if you were looking for
him<00:01:03.790> hopefully<00:01:04.030> he's<00:01:04.330> still<00:01:04.480> that<00:01:04.780> price<00:01:04.989> if
