hamburger<00:00:08.130> things<00:00:08.550> but<00:00:08.940> it's<00:00:09.090> really<00:00:09.240> not<00:00:09.450> a

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
I'm going to let that sit for for quite

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.889 
I'm going to let that sit for for quite
some<00:00:58.170> time<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.469> I'll<00:00:58.890> probably<00:00:59.449> the<00:01:00.449> video

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
some time so I'll probably the video

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.810 
some time so I'll probably the video
said<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.890> meat<00:01:02.039> needs<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.430> really

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
said that the meat needs to be really

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.219 
said that the meat needs to be really
cold<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.359> I'm<00:01:03.449> probably<00:01:03.600> going<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.899> put<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.170> in

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
cold so I'm probably going to put it in

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.390 
cold so I'm probably going to put it in
the<00:01:04.320> freezer<00:01:04.530> for<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.890> little<00:01:04.949> bit<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.309> then

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
indirect heat so I've got these two

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.500 
indirect heat so I've got these two
burners<00:05:06.650> over<00:05:06.680> here<00:05:07.280> on<00:05:07.460> and<00:05:07.970> they're<00:05:08.060> on<00:05:08.210> high

alright<00:05:25.670> you<00:05:25.850> can<00:05:26.000> see<00:05:26.030> where<00:05:26.420> I'm

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
alright you can see where I'm

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.830 
alright you can see where I'm
maintaining<00:05:27.110> a<00:05:27.470> little<00:05:27.740> over<00:05:28.720> 300<00:05:29.720> degrees

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
maintaining a little over 300 degrees

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.890 
maintaining a little over 300 degrees
out<00:05:30.770> here<00:05:30.830> I<00:05:31.520> came<00:05:32.030> out<00:05:32.210> here<00:05:32.360> about<00:05:32.390> halfway

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
out here I came out here about halfway

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.310 
out here I came out here about halfway
done<00:05:33.890> and<00:05:34.310> I<00:05:34.880> wasn't<00:05:35.120> very<00:05:35.360> happy<00:05:35.690> with<00:05:35.930> the

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
done and I wasn't very happy with the

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.780 
done and I wasn't very happy with the
with<00:05:36.650> the<00:05:36.770> progress<00:05:37.040> so<00:05:37.520> what<00:05:37.730> I<00:05:37.760> did<00:05:37.910> is<00:05:38.570> I

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
with the progress so what I did is I

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.270 
with the progress so what I did is I
initially<00:05:40.790> had<00:05:41.060> these<00:05:41.480> two<00:05:41.810> two<00:05:42.530> burners<00:05:43.010> on

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
initially had these two two burners on

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.790 
initially had these two two burners on
and<00:05:43.790> these<00:05:44.720> two<00:05:45.110> off<00:05:46.540> so<00:05:47.540> I<00:05:48.050> thought<00:05:48.290> we'll

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
and these two off so I thought we'll

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.670 
and these two off so I thought we'll
shoot<00:05:49.130> if<00:05:50.060> I<00:05:50.240> want<00:05:50.450> indirect<00:05:50.930> heat<00:05:51.260> and<00:05:51.530> even

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
shoot if I want indirect heat and even

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.780 
shoot if I want indirect heat and even
cook<00:05:52.160> so<00:05:52.790> I<00:05:52.820> turned<00:05:53.210> this<00:05:53.660> burner<00:05:53.990> on<00:05:54.520> this<00:05:55.520> one

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
cook so I turned this burner on this one

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.480 
cook so I turned this burner on this one
off<00:05:56.000> the<00:05:56.870> two<00:05:57.080> middle<00:05:57.380> ones<00:05:57.410> off<00:05:57.680> and<00:05:57.980> then<00:05:58.370> the

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
off the two middle ones off and then the

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.610 
off the two middle ones off and then the
two<00:05:58.670> on<00:05:58.820> the<00:05:58.940> sides<00:05:59.180> on<00:05:59.540> and<00:05:59.930> I<00:06:00.260> think<00:06:00.500> they're

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
two on the sides on and I think they're

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.770 
two on the sides on and I think they're
going<00:06:00.740> to<00:06:00.800> cook<00:06:00.980> a<00:06:01.100> little<00:06:01.220> more<00:06:01.490> evenly<00:06:02.060> so

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
going to cook a little more evenly so

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.110 
going to cook a little more evenly so
we're<00:06:02.960> about<00:06:03.050> halfway<00:06:03.380> done<00:06:03.740> that's<00:06:04.700> a<00:06:04.880> pretty

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
we're about halfway done that's a pretty

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.990 
we're about halfway done that's a pretty
steady<00:06:05.630> like<00:06:06.050> 325<00:06:06.919> is<00:06:07.250> what<00:06:07.430> I<00:06:07.460> cooked

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
steady like 325 is what I cooked

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.530 
steady like 325 is what I cooked
not<00:06:08.420> because<00:06:08.690> I<00:06:09.520> wanted<00:06:10.520> to<00:06:10.730> but<00:06:11.030> just<00:06:11.060> because

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
not because I wanted to but just because

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.510 
not because I wanted to but just because
that's<00:06:11.660> kind<00:06:11.930> of<00:06:11.960> what<00:06:12.110> my<00:06:12.260> girl<00:06:12.470> did<00:06:12.740> so<00:06:13.070> I<00:06:13.100> had

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
that's kind of what my girl did so I had

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.380
