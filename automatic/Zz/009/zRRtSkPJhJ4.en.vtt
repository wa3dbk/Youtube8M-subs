00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.930
 here in tixtla in chilpancingo guerrero 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.910
 where from early on we have 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.160

 15,000 families affected and up to 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.540
 this place up to this area how can you 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.339
 see the problem is that the water is 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.760
 stalled since last Sunday we are going 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:45.860

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.720
 community that has done the work that 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.030
 would correspond to the army to the 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.710
 marine because until this place has not

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.420
 sheltering but do not dare to 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.340
 point to point out what can be the 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.950
 delinquency because with the theft the 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.590

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.540
