00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.039 
you've got this here in the eye brow
we've<00:01:23.130> got<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.400> white<00:01:23.700> spot<00:01:24.030> now<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
we've got this white spot now the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
this because if we go back to the Spot

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.560 
this because if we go back to the Spot
Healing<00:01:27.990> Brush<00:01:28.229> tool<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.710> try<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.909> it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
Healing Brush tool and try to do this it

Healing Brush tool and try to do this it
does<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> pretty<00:01:31.079> average<00:01:31.290> job<00:01:31.829> there<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.579> can

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
does a pretty average job there you can

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.700 
does a pretty average job there you can
see<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.030> hasn't<00:01:33.240> continued<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.960> line<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
see it hasn't continued this line and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.789 
see it hasn't continued this line and
it's<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.180> pretty<00:01:36.450> ugly<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.350> we<00:01:37.680> go

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
it's just it's just pretty ugly so we go

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.980 
it's just it's just pretty ugly so we go
into<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.100> Healing<00:01:38.430> Brush<00:01:38.460> tool<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.000> the

into the Healing Brush tool and the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.569 
into the Healing Brush tool and the
difference<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.530> with<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.250> Healing<00:01:41.549> Brush

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
difference is with the Healing Brush

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.810 
difference is with the Healing Brush
tool<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.150> can<00:01:42.299> specify<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.990> source<00:01:43.500> point<00:01:43.860> so

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
tool you can specify the source point so

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.429 
tool you can specify the source point so
if<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.240> hold<00:01:45.420> down<00:01:45.600> alt<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.170> click
