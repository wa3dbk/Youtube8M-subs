00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.060 

in<00:00:08.730> brains<00:00:09.240> there<00:00:10.080> are<00:00:10.230> all<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.410> these<00:00:10.680> neurons

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
in brains there are all of these neurons

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.670 
in brains there are all of these neurons
and<00:00:11.370> they<00:00:12.150> make<00:00:12.360> connections<00:00:12.660> with<00:00:13.260> each

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680 
and they make connections with each

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.710 
and they make connections with each
other<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.370> they<00:00:14.670> talk<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.180> each<00:00:15.210> other<00:00:15.510> and

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:15.720 
other so they talk to each other and

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.450 
other so they talk to each other and
communicate<00:00:16.199> with<00:00:16.349> each<00:00:16.500> other<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
communicate with each other and the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.720 
communicate with each other and the
really<00:00:17.880> strong<00:00:18.270> idea<00:00:19.020> strong<00:00:19.440> hypothesis<00:00:20.190> is

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
really strong idea strong hypothesis is

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.670 
really strong idea strong hypothesis is
that<00:00:20.789> everything<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.779> brain<00:00:22.020> all<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
that everything in a brain all the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.769 
that everything in a brain all the
memories<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.670> brain<00:00:23.940> the<00:00:24.119> personality

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
memories of that brain the personality

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.830 
memories of that brain the personality
of<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.080> brain<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.619> skills<00:00:25.949> fears<00:00:26.550> etc<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.359> in

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
of that brain the skills fears etc is in

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.810 
of that brain the skills fears etc is in
the<00:00:27.930> map<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.199> those<00:00:28.560> connections<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.550> if<00:00:29.670> you

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the map of those connections so if you

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.910 
the map of those connections so if you
knew<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.300> map<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.720> those<00:00:30.840> connections<00:00:31.470> you

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
knew the map of those connections you

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.680 
knew the map of those connections you
could<00:00:32.160> figure<00:00:32.399> out<00:00:32.550> all<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.090> these<00:00:33.449> other

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
could figure out all of these other

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.630 
could figure out all of these other
things<00:00:33.780> about<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.440> brain<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:35.280> I'm<00:00:35.370> deeply

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
things about a brain but I'm deeply

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.389 
things about a brain but I'm deeply
interested<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.600> how<00:00:36.780> brains<00:00:37.110> grow<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.620> how

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
interested in is how brains grow up how

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.299 
interested in is how brains grow up how
is<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.059> humans<00:00:39.809> are<00:00:39.989> formed<00:00:40.410> basically

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
is it that humans are formed basically

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.959 
is it that humans are formed basically
just<00:00:41.940> helpless<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.899> hapless<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.829> every<00:00:44.760> one

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
just helpless and hapless and every one

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.810 
just helpless and hapless and every one
of<00:00:45.000> us<00:00:45.270> turns<00:00:46.170> into<00:00:46.410> something<00:00:46.770> where<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.610> kind

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
of us turns into something where we kind

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.139 
of us turns into something where we kind
of<00:00:47.850> dominate<00:00:48.420> our<00:00:48.570> local<00:00:49.340> environments<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.700> my

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
of dominate our local environments so my

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.910 
of dominate our local environments so my
lab<00:00:51.329> works<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:52.020> trying<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.530> figure<00:00:52.739> out

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
lab works on is trying to figure out

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.430 
lab works on is trying to figure out
ways<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.250> map<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.450> connections<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.200> brains

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
ways to map the connections in brains

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.500 
ways to map the connections in brains
that's<00:00:55.980> called<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> connector<00:00:56.700> there's<00:00:57.420> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
that's called the connector there's a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.319 
that's called the connector there's a
lot<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.840> engineering<00:00:58.309> challenges<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.120> for

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
lot of engineering challenges so for

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.630 
lot of engineering challenges so for
example<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.289> turns<00:01:01.530> out<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.129> only<00:01:02.280> way

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
example it turns out that the only way

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.019 
example it turns out that the only way
you<00:01:02.699> can<00:01:03.059> fit<00:01:03.360> a<00:01:03.570> trillion<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:05.009> something<00:01:05.519> into

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:06.029 
you can fit a trillion of something into

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:08.120 
you can fit a trillion of something into
something<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.990> size<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.009> make

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
something this size is to make

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.769 
something this size is to make
everything<00:01:08.520> extremely<00:01:08.789> small<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.539> then<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:09.779 
everything extremely small and then the

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:11.989 
everything extremely small and then the
real<00:01:09.990> problem<00:01:10.439> has<00:01:10.590> emerged<00:01:10.950> which<00:01:11.429> is<00:01:11.639> that

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:11.999 
real problem has emerged which is that

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:14.209 
real problem has emerged which is that
to<00:01:12.539> collect<00:01:12.929> a<00:01:13.049> map<00:01:13.259> of<00:01:13.469> those<00:01:13.649> connections

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
to collect a map of those connections

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.279 
to collect a map of those connections
let's<00:01:14.729> say<00:01:14.909> not<00:01:15.090> even<00:01:15.209> a<00:01:15.389> brain<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:15.929> one<00:01:16.079> one

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
let's say not even a brain but one one

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.529 
let's say not even a brain but one one
thousandth<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.249> mouse<00:01:17.429> brain<00:01:17.639> would<00:01:18.149> still

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
thousandth of a mouse brain would still

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.779 
thousandth of a mouse brain would still
be<00:01:18.719> something<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.499> 2<00:01:19.859> million<00:01:20.069> gigabytes<00:01:20.490> of

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
be something like 2 million gigabytes of

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.730 
be something like 2 million gigabytes of
data<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.209> that's<00:01:21.299> more<00:01:21.630> data<00:01:21.929> than<00:01:22.560> has<00:01:22.709> been

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
data and that's more data than has been

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.319 
data and that's more data than has been
collected<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.429> the<00:01:23.459> history<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.090> world

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
collected in the history of the world

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.660 
collected in the history of the world
just<00:01:24.929> so<00:01:25.079> you<00:01:25.170> know<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.740> entire<00:01:26.189> genome

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
just so you know that the entire genome

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.359 
just so you know that the entire genome
can<00:01:27.240> fit<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.659> one<00:01:27.689> or<00:01:27.959> two<00:01:27.990> thumb<00:01:28.289> drives<00:01:28.560> just

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
can fit on one or two thumb drives just

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.469 
can fit on one or two thumb drives just
a<00:01:29.609> millimeter<00:01:30.149> cubed<00:01:30.689> would<00:01:31.380> fit<00:01:31.679> on<00:01:32.479> 400,000

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
a millimeter cubed would fit on 400,000

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.210 
a millimeter cubed would fit on 400,000
drives

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
drives

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.420 
drives
and<00:01:34.310> just<00:01:35.240> that<00:01:35.390> small<00:01:35.750> volume<00:01:36.380> is<00:01:36.770> much<00:01:37.190> more

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
and just that small volume is much more

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.240 
and just that small volume is much more
complicated<00:01:37.910> than<00:01:38.420> we<00:01:38.870> never<00:01:39.140> imagined<00:01:39.830> which

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
complicated than we never imagined which

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.590 
complicated than we never imagined which
is<00:01:40.400> good<00:01:40.640> because<00:01:40.850> it<00:01:41.090> means<00:01:41.210> we<00:01:41.420> have<00:01:41.510> to

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
is good because it means we have to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.480 
is good because it means we have to
account<00:01:41.870> for<00:01:42.020> this<00:01:42.290> our<00:01:42.710> theories<00:01:43.190> have<00:01:43.340> to

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
account for this our theories have to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.100 
account for this our theories have to
get<00:01:43.610> better<00:01:43.790> our<00:01:44.090> data<00:01:44.360> has<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:44.780> get<00:01:44.930> better

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
get better our data has to get better

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.490 
get better our data has to get better
and<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:46.010> real<00:01:46.550> possible<00:01:47.240> breakthrough<00:01:47.510> is<00:01:48.170> that

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
and a real possible breakthrough is that

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.980 
and a real possible breakthrough is that
when<00:01:48.650> we<00:01:48.770> do<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:48.920> brain<00:01:49.310> will<00:01:50.150> find<00:01:50.480> a<00:01:50.630> motif

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
when we do a brain will find a motif

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.170 
when we do a brain will find a motif
meaning<00:01:51.560> here<00:01:51.980> are<00:01:52.100> six<00:01:52.370> kinds<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:52.850> cells<00:01:53.120> that

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
meaning here are six kinds of cells that

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.910 
meaning here are six kinds of cells that
are<00:01:53.360> always<00:01:53.510> connected<00:01:54.020> together<00:01:54.380> in<00:01:54.800> the

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
are always connected together in the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.980 
are always connected together in the
same<00:01:55.160> pattern<00:01:55.550> and<00:01:55.910> when<00:01:56.330> you<00:01:56.420> repeat<00:01:56.810> that

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
same pattern and when you repeat that

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.320 
same pattern and when you repeat that
pattern<00:01:57.260> again<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:57.980> again<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:58.640> again<00:01:58.880> you

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
pattern again and again and again you

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.150 
pattern again and again and again you
build<00:01:59.570> up<00:01:59.720> a<00:01:59.810> brain<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.230> if<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:00.860> can<00:02:01.010> get

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
build up a brain and if you can get

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.790 
build up a brain and if you can get
those<00:02:01.370> rules<00:02:01.760> from<00:02:02.480> looking<00:02:02.780> at<00:02:02.930> a<00:02:02.990> adult

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
those rules from looking at a adult

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.650 
those rules from looking at a adult
connectome<00:02:04.400> and<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:04.730> baby<00:02:04.970> connect<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.540> them

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
connectome and a baby connect to them

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.270 
connectome and a baby connect to them
then<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.229> think<00:02:06.470> you've<00:02:06.560> gone<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.770> long<00:02:07.010> way<00:02:07.220> to

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
then I think you've gone a long way to

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.810 
then I think you've gone a long way to
understanding<00:02:08.030> what<00:02:08.179> it<00:02:08.270> means<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.540> be<00:02:08.630> human
