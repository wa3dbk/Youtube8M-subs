00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
a little less dry but you know this is

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.859

something<00:01:27.030> you're<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.450> going<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:27.720> to

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
something you're just going to have to

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.780 
something you're just going to have to
you<00:01:28.380> know<00:01:28.470> test<00:01:28.710> out<00:01:28.890> see<00:01:29.159> how<00:01:29.189> long<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.610> takes

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790

you know test out see how long it takes
because<00:01:29.939> humidity<00:01:30.540> plays<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> factor<00:01:31.549> as<00:01:32.549> well

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
because humidity plays a factor as well

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.940 
because humidity plays a factor as well
as<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> few<00:01:33.450> other<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.840> air<00:01:33.960> flow<00:01:34.259> all<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.799> good

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
as a few other to air flow all that good

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.090 
as a few other to air flow all that good
stuff<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.939> all<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.180> gotta<00:01:36.360> do<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:37.320> not

the tops off and you get a nice

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.889 
the tops off and you get a nice
random<00:01:44.560> texture<00:01:45.659> forget<00:01:46.659> everything<00:01:46.750> here

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
random texture forget everything here

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.789 
random texture forget everything here
and<00:01:50.430> that's<00:01:51.430> what<00:01:51.640> you<00:01:51.759> get<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:53.380> looks<00:01:53.590> pretty

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
and that's what you get it looks pretty

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.679 
and that's what you get it looks pretty
nice<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:54.399> will<00:01:54.580> hide<00:01:54.790> quite<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.360> few

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
nice and it will hide quite a few

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.670 
nice and it will hide quite a few
imperfections<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.930> like<00:01:58.930> if<00:01:59.140> your<00:01:59.289> seams

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
imperfections and like if your seams

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.200 
imperfections and like if your seams
aren't<00:01:59.979> perfect<00:02:00.810> it'll<00:02:01.810> be<00:02:01.899> good<00:02:02.020> for<00:02:02.080> those

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
aren't perfect it'll be good for those

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.490 
aren't perfect it'll be good for those
anyway<00:02:04.210> hope<00:02:04.899> this<00:02:05.110> helps<00:02:05.490> sleep
