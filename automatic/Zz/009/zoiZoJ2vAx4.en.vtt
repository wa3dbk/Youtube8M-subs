00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.049 
the GIGN and 50 countries but they they
wouldn't<00:00:49.770> necessarily<00:00:49.860> give<00:00:50.250> us<00:00:50.370> ideas<00:00:50.520> for

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
wouldn't necessarily give us ideas for

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.430 
wouldn't necessarily give us ideas for
missions<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.690> would<00:00:51.899> come<00:00:52.079> up<00:00:52.199> with<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
missions we would come up with the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
missions we would come up with the
missions<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.039> then<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.430> would<00:00:53.610> ask<00:00:53.760> them<00:00:54.000> to

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.420 
noticed that leveling seems a little bit
different<00:03:50.290> in<00:03:50.380> this<00:03:50.500> but<00:03:50.739> there's<00:03:50.950> been<00:03:51.100> so

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
different in this but there's been so

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.600 
different in this but there's been so
many<00:03:51.610> more<00:03:51.880> challenges<00:03:52.120> at<00:03:52.570> it<00:03:52.750> tori<00:03:53.320> is

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
many more challenges at it tori is

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.949 
many more challenges at it tori is
expensive<00:03:54.610> reward<00:03:54.970> is<00:03:55.120> constant<00:03:55.630> mean<00:03:55.750> even

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
expensive reward is constant mean even

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.110 
expensive reward is constant mean even
right<00:03:56.079> there<00:03:56.290> you<00:03:56.470> know<00:03:56.590> throughout<00:03:56.620> the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
right there you know throughout the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.640 
right there you know throughout the
we've<00:03:57.239> seen<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.900> have<00:03:57.989> constant<00:03:58.379> numbers

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
we've seen you have constant numbers
