00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello together today we learn again 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.980
 a new step in ours 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.319
 choreography when we are all ten 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.319
 the whole thing looks like this 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.710
 I am especially happy today 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.369
 Sonja Schemmann will welcome you here 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.550
 to be allowed 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.109
 the in corridors in beauty lifestyle and 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.570
 fashion exactly 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.310
 So it can start for you too 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.180
 out there today we learn how 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.510
 credit tip just shows like that 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.149
 Whole look will ultimately stay 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.629
 We are okay at the turn of the moves and 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.829
 We will learn this later 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.840
 At first complicated but is quite 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.039
 easy so i would do it asap 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.770
 simply explain are only four 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.000
 positions and we start with the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.789
 first position 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.430
 yes, we always catch that 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.640
 closed v like the antique whole 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.270
 just like that and the first position would be 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.610
 if we form an open v that we 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.900
 with the foot go out vocalists 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.400
 an extended leg is so accurate 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.960
 a bit uncomfortable at first 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:23.070
 the first position would be about as by 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.590
 Pay attention we will be with the left 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.860
 Bein alone only hit the right tip 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.250
 still that means we will only be on the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.259
 try to stretch your left leg 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.909
 maybe as an exercise 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.590
 Let's just try one leg 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.880
 to hit that is the right leg is 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.250
 a bit in the air always 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.860
 bit wet and he try with the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.700
 I come over to the other wine 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.310
 ok so if the position is one then 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.560
 would be about that position 2 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.909
 that it is a closed v but in the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.930
 air okay it is very uncomfortable 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.219
 behavior 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.259
 perhaps also needs so that's 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.329
 position two and the three would be us 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.219
 that open fire goes down my leg 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.580
 and then that goes down with me is tip 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.600
 just put on something offset forward 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.240
 yes not so far and piece back 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:20.090
 puts on about the whole front here 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.860
 easy is also just a tab and that it 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.140
 The fourth position is actually 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.060
 again so that closed form after 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.710
 Outside the awkward position like us 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.360
 just heard and then go 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:34.520
 we go back to the outside with the 5 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:38.750
 position one position 23 position four 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.240
 position five I will be single again 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.940
 a little bit faster 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.390
 I try and since six and seven 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.090
 and eight and one and two and three and 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:55.250
 four and five and six and seven and 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.390
 eight additional cashier balances means 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.640
 I still want to forward and 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.650
 in the back, exercise is a lot of exercise 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.320
 now we try again the poor 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.970
 to accept what I like to do is if 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.420
 I wind up the poor ones down here 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.910
 to have 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.790
 and then when I go up in my arms 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.510
 to take in or just to be so in 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.740
 swing in there 1 and 2 yes and 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.900
 How do you start the movement from here? 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.780
 to the top the movement actually comes 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.790
 so out of the turn out first turn on 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.820
 just the most practical 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.390
 straight movement upwards 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:36.410
 1 and 2 circle and that's how I count 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.380
 again 1 6 and 7 and 8 and one and two 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.860
 and three and four and five and six and 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:46.340
 seven and eight so I think that looks 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:50.860
 damn well we do 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.860
 again with music all clear music from 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.180
 56 71 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.540
 So I thought that was pretty good 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.090
 next week will be a bit 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.829
 easier we will travel to such 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.620
 have learned to try to turn emails 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.730
 okay we trends in space 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.680
 At this point I would like to completely 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.069
 especially because we also thank you 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.959

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.160
