00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.830
 It's really good time this time in English 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:13.259
 People who don't take points in English take points 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.539
 About what should be good people to do to get more points 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.870
 Shall we wash out for a moment ? 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.210
 First of all it's English but it's English 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.130
 English and 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.930
 It is English but 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:30.590
 I'm asked 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:32.060
 buzz reading writing listening not so much but speaking 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.489
 Is there a certain person 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.840
 Oh well there is an opinion smoked something ak I test of the drum 4 Tsudayonemaa is probably winter sealed 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.920
 I think most 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:46.120
 'S Well Raijingun rear Ja something like Well then stand 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.520
 Was a bitter important or say when the burden Pu 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:57.550
 What are these three, three , put reading and writing 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.829
 It's thing, but first one one and say what is important or in the fabrication and the long sentence reading that there is good correspondence 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.750
 After the turn 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.080
 After the turn does Mase 1'm more descriptive 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:11.050
 I think this is not read Once you become the wind say dumpling 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:15.590
 And that half later read that one by one of the words do not know that I mean what are you writing 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:20.270
 I can not do reading, and I will not bring it with you 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:25.159
 When the second in is not familiar with the grammar I grammar 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:29.539
 It is difficult to get married items basically out 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:34.380
 I'm saying something, but I wo n't understand well if it wins but it 's broken 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:37.649
 + + Common sense common sense 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.930
 For example, everyone is its other 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.289
 If you know all the English words and you are like a person who has memorized a screw book , you can not enter a girl 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.970
 It is 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:53.610
 First, no I want But such a thing speaking normally not come women 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.400
 Here to know this over the sentence was this there was a word you do not know spot here I bar 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.650
 But not 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:06.400
 But then from the text of the back or the front of the sentence Maybe Tteyuu would be such that mean this word 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:10.179
 The will be able to so-called guess reading is there is this common sense, but not this to some extent in Japan language 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:14.439
 So this is because I can understand this 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.420
 In Dan language this word can be roughly inferred 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.620
 Ne 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.440
 For that purpose is beyond common sense 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.160
 Furthermore, in addition to this power in listening 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.080
 I can hear you 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.080
 Pompe brother and voice 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.680
 I have never made it what this sounds like, but part 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.560
 Speaking but thinking 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.560
 Oh yeah but this is hardly out, oh 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.980
 This doesn't matter because we don't sell 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:51.420
 Remember the word and in say or to do by everyone that there is no 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:56.880
 After I understand grammar , I think that I do not study so much after common sense 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.290
 Well, there is a lot of saying that the American part is taken, and it will be English if it becomes Ayase after the fishing start 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.170
 Get points 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:09.299
 Reviewing from the beginning Exams in English are reading, writing and listening 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:15.269
 You will be heard that in writing tow reading 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:18.280
 If you know the grammar, you can read Taishan, and if it is a pragmatic common sense you can not understand the words 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:24.160
 It further's fine even if there is a 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:29.430
 If you can listen to spoken that if Disney I voice this dumpling is if I activate that the 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:35.010
 Listening points in the wind Tteyuu'll take English is your plan 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:38.909
 If everyone can not get points, do you not know the turn or the distribution? 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:45.860
 You do not hear a sound if there is any common sense of the English dot stations 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:52.070
 Somehow this plural may be bad, but there is a hole in the dopa here, so it can not be done 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:53.420
 I think it's really difficult to get points in English and it's actually difficult 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.920
 Well well 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:01.940
 If you think calmly, there are only these four 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:06.440
 I am Kobane Grammar this time 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:13.010
 Where is it related to grammar and grammar 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:17.840
 Kana Let's make now that the Tteyuu videos about I Yoshifumi how section's excitement from the high school students 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:21.930
 8 voice I probably is attached to the voice because it 's so much good at school 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.300
 Lion, which I think is better to native people were asked to do it I think is good Pato of this teacher 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.039
 I because there is Toka good 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:33.680
 Because there is no way to say only and do my best each other decided thanks to word word after I called the denitrificans 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:38.060
 I will tell you how to study specifics next time, but because I can not do anything I can not be honest 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:42.710
 Because with the word even with after common sense please work hard enough I think there everyone in its own way 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.320
 It's okay, for example, a small person who forgot the meaning of the word Mars 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.060
 Pee 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.660
 In Martian or something like such that the degree of common sense I say that this came hit from space 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.980
 Is that okay? 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.230
 It seems that somehow it seems like it's a smart day about this and everyone is already up 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:59.960
 Because I feel like you should do your best 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:05.449
 Grammar I 'm going to make a video about this 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:08.660
 So English is February when it comes to remember words or tell grammars or improve common sense or speech 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:11.780
 I was told that I should try to listen to 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:16.400
 Thank you for watching this video more than this time 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:20.960
 I said it differently in the video, but I remember the words but talk about time how to memorize the words 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.060
 Nde Tteyuu not good but it was already and I also February Well, people say Datte weak single horizontal ball 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.410
 People should go in time and direction 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.410
 Let the next time also to meet with the fact that
