Agni<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.670> fire<00:02:43.940> gets<00:02:44.330> stimulated<00:02:44.750> more<00:02:45.260> and

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
Agni the fire gets stimulated more and

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.309 
Agni the fire gets stimulated more and
people<00:02:45.950> generally<00:02:46.130> who<00:02:46.550> are<00:02:46.640> obese<00:02:47.060> they<00:02:47.840> feel

people generally who are obese they feel

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.680 
people generally who are obese they feel
like<00:02:48.800> eating<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.430> lot<00:02:49.610> there<00:02:49.910> they<00:02:50.180> get<00:02:50.330> hungry

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
like eating a lot there they get hungry

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.930 
like eating a lot there they get hungry
very<00:02:51.019> fast<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.040> is<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.430> reason<00:02:52.550> because

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
very fast so that is the reason because

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.449 
very fast so that is the reason because
when<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.269> water<00:02:53.390> comes<00:02:53.780> back<00:02:54.019> and<00:02:54.260> fires<00:02:55.040> or

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
when the water comes back and fires or

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.290 
when the water comes back and fires or
just<00:02:56.330> air<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:57.170> air<00:02:57.350> blows<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.790> air<00:02:58.970> blows

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
just air the air blows and the air blows

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.900 
just air the air blows and the air blows
and<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.570> agony<00:02:59.840> goes<00:03:00.110> high<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.340> jet<00:03:01.519> Rohini

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
and the agony goes high the jet Rohini

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.210 
and the agony goes high the jet Rohini
becomes<00:03:02.209> very<00:03:02.480> strong<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.110> then<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.890> person

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
becomes very strong and then the person

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.600 
becomes very strong and then the person
needs<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.610> eat<00:03:04.819> more<00:03:05.209> but<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.500> nourishment<00:03:06.950> is

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
needs to eat more but the nourishment is

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.600 
needs to eat more but the nourishment is
all<00:03:07.970> going<00:03:08.510> into<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.930> fat<00:03:09.230> now<00:03:10.069> what<00:03:10.310> are<00:03:10.459> the

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
all going into the fat now what are the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.059 
all going into the fat now what are the
reasons<00:03:10.940> for<00:03:11.030> formation<00:03:11.630> of<00:03:11.870> Amma<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.890> main

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
reasons for formation of Amma the main

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.640 
reasons for formation of Amma the main
reason<00:03:13.430> is<00:03:13.550> in<00:03:13.940> digestion<00:03:14.510> or<00:03:14.690> weak<00:03:15.050> digestive

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
reason is in digestion or weak digestive

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.009 
reason is in digestion or weak digestive
fire<00:03:15.830> what<00:03:16.459> could<00:03:16.700> cause<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.269> weak<00:03:17.420> digestive

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019

which are blocked by Amma if we do these

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.610 
which are blocked by Amma if we do these
two<00:04:36.460> things<00:04:36.760> properly<00:04:37.270> then<00:04:37.990> we<00:04:38.380> get

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
two things properly then we get

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.830 
two things properly then we get
