phone<00:03:42.840> here<00:03:43.019> which<00:03:43.830> I<00:03:43.920> think<00:03:44.040> was<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.190> really

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
phone here which I think was a really

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.509 
phone here which I think was a really
great<00:03:44.550> film<00:03:45.440> like<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:47.100> was<00:03:47.220> better<00:03:47.400> than

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
great film like it was better than

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.040 
great film like it was better than
returns<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.120> was<00:03:48.209> better<00:03:48.360> than<00:03:48.450> Batman<00:03:48.900> Begins

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
returns it was better than Batman Begins

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.380 
returns it was better than Batman Begins
so<00:03:50.330> X<00:03:51.330> is<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:51.810> kind<00:03:52.019> of<00:03:52.200> spot<00:03:52.970> well<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.000> think<00:03:54.150> it

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
so X is so kind of spot well I think it

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.000 
so X is so kind of spot well I think it
would<00:03:54.480> be<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.600> time<00:03:54.840> paradox<00:03:55.110> if<00:03:55.560> they<00:03:55.650> put<00:03:55.830> two

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
would be a time paradox if they put two

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.520 
would be a time paradox if they put two
