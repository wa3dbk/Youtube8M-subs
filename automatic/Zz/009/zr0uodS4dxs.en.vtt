at<00:01:23.390> least<00:01:23.450> there's<00:01:23.810> some<00:01:23.990> times<00:01:24.350> where<00:01:24.530> it

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
at least there's some times where it

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.950 
at least there's some times where it
glitches<00:01:24.890> out<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:25.610> some<00:01:26.240> sounds<00:01:26.659> don't<00:01:26.840> sound

most<00:01:29.270> part<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.630> sound<00:01:29.840> design<00:01:30.110> is<00:01:30.140> good<00:01:30.710> the

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
most part the sound design is good the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.679

do a good job with the skill shots um I
will<00:04:32.330> say<00:04:32.630> this<00:04:32.780> though<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.110> gunplay<00:04:33.380> is<00:04:33.530> not

stuff is going on it's so frustrating

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.520 
stuff is going on it's so frustrating
and<00:05:13.669> enemies<00:05:14.599> kill<00:05:14.840> you<00:05:14.960> because<00:05:15.110> you<00:05:15.380> have

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
and enemies kill you because you have

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.800 
and enemies kill you because you have

very very low health too and it just

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.089 
very very low health too and it just
does<00:05:17.990> not<00:05:18.110> make<00:05:18.319> you<00:05:18.440> feel<00:05:18.650> like<00:05:18.800> a<00:05:18.830> badass

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
does not make you feel like a badass

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.140 
does not make you feel like a badass
when<00:05:19.460> you're<00:05:19.580> running<00:05:19.759> through<00:05:20.030> this

when you're running through this

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.850 
when you're running through this
sometimes<00:05:20.960> it<00:05:21.139> does<00:05:21.289> make<00:05:21.470> you<00:05:21.500> feel<00:05:21.740> like

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
sometimes it does make you feel like

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.469 
sometimes it does make you feel like
badass<00:05:22.280> because<00:05:22.880> there's<00:05:23.090> sometimes<00:05:23.270> where

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
badass because there's sometimes where

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.149 
badass because there's sometimes where
they<00:05:23.720> just<00:05:23.960> throw<00:05:24.289> like<00:05:24.560> a<00:05:24.590> few<00:05:24.889> enemies

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
they just throw like a few enemies

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.760 
they just throw like a few enemies
inside<00:05:25.880> a<00:05:25.940> room<00:05:26.240> like<00:05:26.569> four<00:05:26.930> or<00:05:27.050> five<00:05:27.080> besides

know<00:05:30.259> where<00:05:30.440> they<00:05:30.560> are<00:05:30.740> because<00:05:30.860> they're

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
know where they are because they're

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:32.379 
know where they are because they're
right<00:05:31.280> in<00:05:31.370> front<00:05:31.550> of<00:05:31.639> you<00:05:31.729> and<00:05:32.030> you<00:05:32.120> can<00:05:32.240> just

really fun the thing is there's too many

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.760 
really fun the thing is there's too many

big environment a whole bunch of enemies

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.990 
big environment a whole bunch of enemies
kill<00:05:42.770> them<00:05:42.889> all<00:05:43.039> before<00:05:43.310> they<00:05:43.520> kill<00:05:43.729> you<00:05:43.909> I'm

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
kill them all before they kill you I'm

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.629

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
like no son I don't like that it's not

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.689 
like no son I don't like that it's not
fun<00:05:46.699> so<00:05:47.440> that<00:05:48.440> really<00:05:48.680> brought<00:05:49.159> the<00:05:49.220> game<00:05:49.460> down

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
fun so that really brought the game down

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.279 
fun so that really brought the game down
from<00:05:49.940> me<00:05:50.060> those<00:05:50.509> little<00:05:50.719> parts<00:05:51.110> here<00:05:51.259> and

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
from me those little parts here and

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.860 
from me those little parts here and
there<00:05:51.409> were<00:05:51.889> very<00:05:52.159> fun<00:05:52.460> but<00:05:53.030> not<00:05:53.210> worth<00:05:53.479> me

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
there were very fun but not worth me

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.480 
there were very fun but not worth me
saying<00:05:54.229> this<00:05:54.409> game<00:05:54.650> is<00:05:54.830> definitely<00:05:55.219> worth<00:05:55.340> a

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
saying this game is definitely worth a

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.730 
saying this game is definitely worth a
buy<00:05:55.669> I<00:05:55.699> would<00:05:56.030> say<00:05:56.240> maybe<00:05:56.270> at<00:05:56.719> 30<00:05:57.020> maybe<00:05:57.289> 20

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
buy I would say maybe at 30 maybe 20

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.890 
buy I would say maybe at 30 maybe 20
bucks<00:05:57.949> but<00:05:58.759> for<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.000> most<00:05:59.120> part<00:05:59.240> right<00:05:59.539> now<00:05:59.690> is

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
bucks but for the most part right now is

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.990 
bucks but for the most part right now is
a<00:06:00.050> rental<00:06:00.380> the<00:06:00.860> multiplayer<00:06:01.340> is<00:06:01.520> also<00:06:01.789> almost

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
a rental the multiplayer is also almost

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.260 
a rental the multiplayer is also almost
completely<00:06:02.659> dead<00:06:02.930> already<00:06:03.610> which<00:06:04.610> is<00:06:04.789> not

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
completely dead already which is not

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.520 
completely dead already which is not
surprising<00:06:05.389> because<00:06:05.810> the<00:06:05.960> game<00:06:06.110> came<00:06:06.289> out<00:06:06.409> of

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
surprising because the game came out of

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.899 
surprising because the game came out of
nowhere<00:06:06.710> anyway<00:06:07.099> and<00:06:07.370> the<00:06:07.430> multiplayer<00:06:07.789> is

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
nowhere anyway and the multiplayer is

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.969 
nowhere anyway and the multiplayer is
not<00:06:08.060> that<00:06:08.180> great<00:06:08.449> i<00:06:08.509> got<00:06:08.810> into<00:06:09.080> one<00:06:09.259> into<00:06:09.620> one
