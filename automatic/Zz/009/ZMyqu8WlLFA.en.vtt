00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880 

I

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
I

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.520 
I
ah

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:04.530 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.950 

let's<00:00:05.130> talk<00:00:05.310> about<00:00:05.460> articulation<00:00:06.300> on<00:00:06.720> base

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
let's talk about articulation on base

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.580 
let's talk about articulation on base
tonight<00:00:07.200> at<00:00:07.530> a<00:00:07.560> little<00:00:07.830> bit<00:00:09.410> again<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.440> don't

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
tonight at a little bit again I don't

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.440 
tonight at a little bit again I don't
think<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.190> articulation<00:00:12.090> on<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.300> bass

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
think of articulation on the bass

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.810 
think of articulation on the bass
clarinet<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.049> as<00:00:13.200> technically<00:00:13.889> any<00:00:14.190> different

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
clarinet is as technically any different

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.510 
clarinet is as technically any different
than<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.480> clarinet<00:00:15.959> I'm<00:00:16.170> accomplishing<00:00:16.890> it

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
than the clarinet I'm accomplishing it

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.090 
than the clarinet I'm accomplishing it
in<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.760> same<00:00:18.000> way<00:00:18.240> with<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.470> tip<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.980> the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
in the same way with the tip of the

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.890 
in the same way with the tip of the
tongue<00:00:20.280> as<00:00:20.490> close<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.360> tip<00:00:21.540> of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.750> reed

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
tongue as close to the tip of the reed

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.670 
tongue as close to the tip of the reed
as<00:00:22.140> possible<00:00:22.950> now<00:00:23.640> obviously<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:25.050> angle<00:00:25.560> of

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
as possible now obviously the angle of

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.590 
as possible now obviously the angle of
the<00:00:25.860> instrument<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.850> mouthpiece<00:00:27.420> as

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
the instrument of the mouthpiece as

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.720 
the instrument of the mouthpiece as
presented<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.530> the<00:00:28.650> embouchure<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.280> slightly

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
presented to the embouchure is slightly

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.970 
presented to the embouchure is slightly
different<00:00:30.090> than<00:00:30.540> clarinet<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.620> that's<00:00:31.770> one

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
different than clarinet and that's one

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.160 
different than clarinet and that's one
of<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.160> things<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.640> many<00:00:33.300> clarinet<00:00:33.930> players

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
of the things that many clarinet players

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.279 
of the things that many clarinet players
have<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> little<00:00:34.739> difficulty<00:00:35.190> getting<00:00:35.489> used<00:00:35.910> to

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.289 
have a little difficulty getting used to

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.160 
have a little difficulty getting used to
it's<00:00:37.289> therefore<00:00:37.679> hard<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.879> play<00:00:39.089> right<00:00:39.749> at<00:00:40.019> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
it's therefore hard to play right at the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.069 
it's therefore hard to play right at the
tip<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.559> reed<00:00:40.710> because<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.609> mouthpiece

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
tip of the reed because that mouthpiece

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.810 
tip of the reed because that mouthpiece
isn't<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.140> sort<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.280> angle<00:00:44.640> like<00:00:44.789> a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
isn't that sort of that angle like a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.729 
isn't that sort of that angle like a
clarinet<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.499> so<00:00:47.190> I'm

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
clarinet it's it's here so I'm

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.739 
clarinet it's it's here so I'm
articulating<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.890> little<00:00:50.519> bit<00:00:50.699> lower<00:00:50.999> but

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:51.749 
articulating a little bit lower but

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:53.479 
articulating a little bit lower but
still<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> tip<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.859> tongue<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
still with the tip of the tongue with a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.719 
still with the tip of the tongue with a
very<00:00:53.819> short<00:00:54.239> motion<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.289> tongue<00:00:55.609> so<00:00:56.609> that

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
very short motion of the tongue so that

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.969 
very short motion of the tongue so that
I'm<00:00:56.819> not<00:00:56.850> involving<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> back<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.769> tongue

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
I'm not involving the back of the tongue

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.340 
I'm not involving the back of the tongue
which<00:00:59.969> would<00:01:00.179> interfere<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.780> airflow<00:01:03.350> one

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
which would interfere with airflow one

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.050 
which would interfere with airflow one
of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.620> major<00:01:04.800> things<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.339> find<00:01:05.610> when<00:01:05.909> you're

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
of the major things you find when you're

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.760 
of the major things you find when you're
playing<00:01:06.270> bass<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.780> you're<00:01:07.050> playing<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.590> a

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
playing bass is you're playing in a

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.620 
playing bass is you're playing in a
register<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.370> haven't<00:01:08.700> been<00:01:08.820> used<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.450> mean

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
register you haven't been used to I mean

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.249 
register you haven't been used to I mean
that<00:01:10.009> goes<00:01:11.009> without<00:01:11.189> saying<00:01:11.369> maybe<00:01:11.909> but<00:01:12.719> in<00:01:12.930> in

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
that goes without saying maybe but in in

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.590 
that goes without saying maybe but in in
an<00:01:13.469> orchestral<00:01:13.890> setting<00:01:14.520> suddenly<00:01:15.210> instead

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
an orchestral setting suddenly instead

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.240 
an orchestral setting suddenly instead
of<00:01:15.810> playing<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.140> falutin<00:01:16.590> oboes<00:01:16.950> you're

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
of playing with falutin oboes you're

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.969 
of playing with falutin oboes you're
mainly<00:01:17.490> playing<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.090> fourth<00:01:18.810> horn<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
mainly playing with fourth horn the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.730 
mainly playing with fourth horn the
cellos<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.030> bases<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.810> particularly<00:01:22.590> when

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
cellos the bases and particularly when

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.800 
cellos the bases and particularly when
you're<00:01:22.860> playing<00:01:23.130> with<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> strings<00:01:23.820> I'm

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you're playing with the strings I'm

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.620 
you're playing with the strings I'm
trying<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.469> foster<00:01:25.890> an<00:01:26.430> articulation<00:01:27.270> that

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
trying to foster an articulation that

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.279 
trying to foster an articulation that
can<00:01:27.840> sound<00:01:28.289> very<00:01:28.740> much<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.219> pit<00:01:29.610> sacado<00:01:30.289> so

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
can sound very much like a pit sacado so

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.609 
can sound very much like a pit sacado so
that<00:01:31.469> I<00:01:31.939> can<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.329> bounce<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:34.259> pit

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
that I can get a bounce to it now pit

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.130 
that I can get a bounce to it now pit
sacado<00:01:35.009> has<00:01:35.450> something<00:01:36.450> that's<00:01:36.630> pretty<00:01:36.960> hard

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
sacado has something that's pretty hard

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.920 
sacado has something that's pretty hard
for<00:01:37.380> us<00:01:37.469> as<00:01:37.649> wind<00:01:37.920> players<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.579> accomplish<00:01:39.060> it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
for us as wind players to accomplish it

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.230 
for us as wind players to accomplish it
has<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.380> very<00:01:40.740> clear<00:01:40.979> beginning<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.969> rings

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
has a very clear beginning but it rings

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.849 
has a very clear beginning but it rings
and<00:01:42.890> that's<00:01:43.890> that's<00:01:44.399> what<00:01:44.670> I'm<00:01:44.789> after<00:01:45.859> partly

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
and that's that's what I'm after partly

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:49.039 
and that's that's what I'm after partly
why<00:01:47.070> why<00:01:47.609> it's<00:01:47.789> possible<00:01:48.359> on<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.539> basis<00:01:48.869> we're

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
why why it's possible on the basis we're

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.109 
why why it's possible on the basis we're
not<00:01:49.229> hitting<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.100> absolute<00:01:50.609> tip<00:01:50.789> of<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.969> raid

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
not hitting the absolute tip of the raid

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.940 
not hitting the absolute tip of the raid
on<00:01:51.270> pressing<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.929> the<00:01:52.079> rail<00:01:52.350> where<00:01:52.679> it<00:01:52.799> is

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
on pressing it to the rail where it is

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.050 
on pressing it to the rail where it is
going<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.399> absolutely<00:01:53.640> stop<00:01:54.829> vibrating<00:01:56.060> we're

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
going to absolutely stop vibrating we're

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.550 
going to absolutely stop vibrating we're
hitting<00:01:57.359> it<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> little<00:01:57.630> lower<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.350> can

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
hitting it a little lower and you can

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.530 
hitting it a little lower and you can
play<00:02:00.829> huh<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.700> there<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.090> ring<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.869> it

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
play huh so there is a ring to it

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.730 
play huh so there is a ring to it
obviously<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.660> need<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.870> short<00:02:07.320> short

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
obviously if you need a short short

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.740 
obviously if you need a short short
short<00:02:07.830> note<00:02:08.430> you're<00:02:09.270> going<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.540> to<00:02:09.660> go

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
short note you're going to have to go

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.120 
short note you're going to have to go
shorter<00:02:10.050> than<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.170> but<00:02:10.410> there's<00:02:10.590> times<00:02:10.860> when

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
shorter than that but there's times when

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.920 
shorter than that but there's times when
you're<00:02:11.280> playing<00:02:11.520> as<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.940> say<00:02:12.120> with<00:02:12.360> bass<00:02:12.630> or

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
you're playing as I say with bass or

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.920 
you're playing as I say with bass or
cello<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:13.920> want<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.460> kind<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.930> clarity

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
cello and you want that kind of clarity

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.050 
cello and you want that kind of clarity
to<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.200> beginning<00:02:16.680> but<00:02:17.010> resonance<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.940> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
to the beginning but resonance to the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.410 
to the beginning but resonance to the
note<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.420> that's<00:02:18.960> what<00:02:19.170> I'm<00:02:19.290> after<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:20.420> many

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
note and that's what I'm after in many

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.250 
note and that's what I'm after in many
instances<00:02:21.540> with<00:02:25.970> air<00:02:26.970> flow<00:02:27.450> just<00:02:28.110> like

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
instances with air flow just like

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.190 
instances with air flow just like
clarinet<00:02:28.830> we've<00:02:29.580> got<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.820> have<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.570> good

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
clarinet we've got to have a good

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.910 
clarinet we've got to have a good
airflow<00:02:32.450> supporting<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.570> sound<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.710> that<00:02:34.830> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
airflow supporting the sound so that the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.850 
airflow supporting the sound so that the
articulation<00:02:35.670> can<00:02:35.990> appear<00:02:36.990> upon<00:02:37.200> that

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
articulation can appear upon that

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.449 
articulation can appear upon that
airflow<00:02:39.560> other<00:02:40.560> than<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:40.950> don't<00:02:41.100> think

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
airflow other than that I don't think

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.130 
airflow other than that I don't think
it's<00:02:41.580> any<00:02:41.910> different<00:02:42.330> than<00:02:42.750> playing<00:02:42.900> the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
it's any different than playing the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.320 
it's any different than playing the
clarinet
