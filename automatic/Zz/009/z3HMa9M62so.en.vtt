00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.220
 even during technical progress 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.070
 legs of the people with trepidation and interest 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.650
 relate to their roots they are interested 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.790
 how the ancestors lived what did they do 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.710
 gods revered 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.170
 also most of the information already 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.020
 laid down in us at the genetic level and 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.600
 handed down from generation to generation and 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.599
 when we hear words like slav 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.849
 Rusich, or many of us something ekaet 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.489
 as if ancient blood begins to seethe 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.219
 and other nations will treat these words 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.820
 calmly also how to apply to the words 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.370
 samurai 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.739
 or the shogun while the Japanese will start 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.469
 remember your culture as well as 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.000
 game writers and directors 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.280
 give us a chance to plunge into 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.950
 Old Slavic era and at least 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.809
 a little stay there games one way or another 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.600
 related by our roots 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.199
 a lot has accumulated about some of them and 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.199
 will be discussed 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.530
 the prince thought as our answer to the game 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.170
 diablo 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.020
 only in the world of the prince there is no place for succubus 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.369
 harp him and the gargoyle 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.950
 mermaids water 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.860
 his what came of it is worth immediately 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.290
 say that the princes are three but different 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.509
 between them is a miser just every part 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.580
 developers added something new to 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.720
 terms of opportunity therefore the basis 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.210
 take the last 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.250
 and so before the start of the journey we 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.620
 decide on the choice of character and 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.780
 initial characteristics to choose from 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.270
 given as many as six avatars of different 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.730
 nationalities this slavs vikings 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.950
 Byzantines according to the characteristics can not 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.290
 bother with time we turn 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.660
 our character in the one we need 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.610
 even a jack of all trades especially as 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.370
 there is no maximum level in the game 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.200
 but on the choice of nationality depends on how 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.560
 you will be treated by some characters 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.119
 and who will spring to you so viking not 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.930
 will want to be commanded 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.840
 Byzantines 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.270
 in the previous two parts from the selection yet 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.790
 depended in which part of the spring of the country we 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.550
 appeared in the same way we begin 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.470
 world of words capital of the Slavic 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.570
 principalities and immediately come across 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.610
 inconvenient location of the camera which 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.300
 can not be changed but with time 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.459
 you get used to 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.310
 and still have to get used to very 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.920
 many dialogues voiced only the first 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.440
 the proposal that for 2009 somehow 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.270
 unusually dialog lines are closed 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.670
 after a few seconds did not have time 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.239
 read well what are your problems read 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.430
 more books and better reading techniques 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.320
 but a graphics and say nothing any 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.200
 changes since the first part is not 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.180
 happened if such a game was about 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.489
 same samurai then surely many of 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.280
 in half an hour you would have left the game 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.260
 it was deleted but old russian doom 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.150
 makes you move on in hopes 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.709
 what is about to be something 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.930
 and in some ways he is right the map of the forest country 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.600
 divided into locations coming to the edge 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.130
 that we move on to the next in 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.260
 all villages and towns can 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.320
 activate teleport and help 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.030
 get to visited places faster 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.130
 cities or settlements besides idle 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.860
 reeling people are 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.740
 the merchant sells and buys all kinds of 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.080
 amulet items weapons and armor 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.840
 the blacksmith also sells weapons of armor 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.480
 however its range depends on the skill 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.450
 the blacksmith also fixes our load 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.480
 I know at least sells elixirs and recipes to 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.270
 him earl or headman of the village 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.090
 give quests governor can also give 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.760
 quests are ruled by guards other than 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.960
 this among the idle come across 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.450
 and quest to give or 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.630
 some settlements can also be taken 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.770
 control her manage them 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.260
 micromanagement is small but pretty 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.050
 still curious we adjust the size 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.020
 we are looking for tribute warrior settlers 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.090
 armor weapons assign posts look 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.370
 so that there is a blacksmith in the settlement 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.740
 if the voivode 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.980
 improving their skills well still doing 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.470
 then all the little things well, but clean field 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.140
 captivated all sorts of attack bunches 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.290
 The devil are robbers and everyone strives for us 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.220
 grab go in the game becomes visible yet 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.530
 one minus 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.510
 Our squad will not help 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.030
 to another even if it will be ripped on 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.760
 parts if you do not give them an order so 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.070
 will stand and watch tactical 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.680
 There is no pause in the game, and in general there is no pause except 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.180
 there is no escape even when you read the diary 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.730
 or do you dig in inventory 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.400
 what does the action when you are under control 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.740
 more than three characters uncomfortable but 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.560
 back in the open field besides any 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.320
 evil spirits there are plants minerals 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.880
 and resources that we can collect 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.880
 use potions 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:51.729
 Potions riches performed very 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.759
 Interestingly applying any plant 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:05:00.129
 on the bottle we get an infusion and if we 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:05:02.860
 buy a burner no there is no other this one here 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:04.840
 we can make broths and constantly 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.270
 mixing everything with each other is possible 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.610
 create or spoil something 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.479
 list of all kinds of mixtures pretty 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.180
 big 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.520
 There are easier recipes and more complicated 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.699
 you can experiment and you can buy 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.919
 recipe or find it and then you can give 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:26.080
 the game plus since science sile jam 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:28.150
 really intrigues anything special 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.280
 in quests there is no other than the main task 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.620
 which is issued at the beginning hangs up 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.620
 the very end of the game has a lot 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:40.349
 side but they are all straight loosening 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.349
 no go go kill me and so on 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.400
 the companions in the game are silent words of them 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.159
 do not pull out the dialogues and meet yours without 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.590
 orders do not help and get in the way 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:52.930
 however, without them in any way since the second 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.690
 half the game there are clashes at the same time 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.120
 ten 12 all kinds of create with one 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.949
 parties and this to me diabla our hero 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.319
 though not weak but for him it is 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:05.229
 the number of enemies is a lot 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:07.919
 to introduce a dance of stupid and clubs 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.919
 characters 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:12.629
 Of course, this game does not reach 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:15.309
 diablo and herself on it from that steppe 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:17.349
 Western players would bet no more 

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:19.659
 three points however in our countries 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:22.149
 due to the fact that the game is straight soaked 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:24.550
 Old Slavonic spirit and and rating 

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:26.619
 somewhat higher though before honorary title 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.379
 on and not reach for some of her 

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:31.029
 aspects are very entertaining so play 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:35.439
 in her still possible and in some places 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:38.489
 she's pretty interesting all the luck and
