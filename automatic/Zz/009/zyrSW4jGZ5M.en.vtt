 hello everyone and welcome to the channel 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.109
 experience games you I Scythians we 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.050
 keep playing grass today would i 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.140
 I wanted to open 60 boxes or rather in 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.609
 sixty four boxes is it with us 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.830
 the boxes are called by before n ventures in 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.219
 these boxes can be a bunch of all 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:40.050
 stuff but the most interesting is of course 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:43.440
 same mount here can be 2 2 variations 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.200
 pandas are purple in my and red 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.890
 and of course I would like to get some 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.829
 of these mounts well and just look 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.110
 so you can get interesting from where 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.280
 these boxes are taken we just get 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:03.420
 in the world killing mobs and bosses just 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.430
 we go to the dungeon they fall out but 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.409
 especially effectively do it 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.060
 again f1 welcome thursday it turns out 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.360
 plus 200 percent 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.159
 and venture adventure mode and I think in 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.049
 Soon these boxes will be replaced by 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.299
 what other boxes where it will be 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.720
 new mounts but for now we have 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.189
 the task is to pull out the panda and let's do it 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.890
 by this and see what we can 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.369
 pancakes of the legendary shit neither here nor here 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.170
 although bye 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:40.040
 throw out said flying for cleanliness 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.880
 of the experiment we leave everything empty here 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.780
 so let's go 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.990
 64 boxes that we are here a little bit 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.689
 flux still slightly flux but we also know 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.939
 her luck we can assume that a bunch 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:02:01.520
 a lot of bullshit but I need a mount 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:05.960
 certainly so at least eyes babes 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:10.250
 what eyes it is considered straight cool 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.239
 find gleam their suite and total 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.269
 little by little 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.730
 Well, enough to get the box 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.730
 just real interest here 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.160
 of course represents only mount 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:27.010
 who doesn't want me to fall out of course 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.660
 about 1 mount pulled out 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.080
 zashib but I like pink more 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:41.329
 by the way they are pink purple it all 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:46.130
 I suffered a science but give us more 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:50.840
 mount not be not be a box 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.900
 so cruel yes a little bit flux 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.989
 slightly past useless enough 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.430
 boxes so but a little bit of glacier in 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.430
 classic from me about what really 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.299
 the most interesting loot of course but not the most 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:13.220
 interesting most say so productive 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.730
 This of course in the boxes of dragons so 2 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.000
 mount 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.090
 let's 10 boxes left let's 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.790
 take a look at this mount what is it 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.980
 presents 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:30.980

 I am a master of orange 38 and they also gave it there 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:40.299
 we are here thousands of Cubans as I 4 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:48.110
 700 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:52.129
 free chests take two 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.110
 free chests yes theirs 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:04:01.310
 periodically give years do not understand with what 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:03.370
 frequency but in them nonsense 5 well such 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.609
 nonsense five of these crystals is quite a 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:15.859
 maybe i need okay mount 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:23.900
 where is the panda so here and not here it is clearly not 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:30.700
 code they corgi what that and not so 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:35.380
 Dragons all and wolf adventure box 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.380
 giant red panda 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.730
 let's even do that 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:52.710
 better seen principle pretty cute 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:59.700
 Of course the animal is pretty cute panda 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:01.560
 such but there is to violet 1 to 1 mid 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.320
 somehow he likes me better 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.320
 let's say a necromancer is probably better 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.450
 came up than this red panda 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:17.660
 but we have what we have 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:24.030

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:38.010
 oh style well and so box with 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:46.250
 random style but let's look what 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:51.560
 this is us some kind of equilibrium Hammer 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:58.500
 afl-cio it is all about the staff Tipo 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:06:00.780
 supposedly a staff where to look for it here is this 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.600
 very convenient here that opened cast well 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.410
 Now, well, she will take the word that 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.410
 opened something 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:18.750
 like how he looked so sly 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:24.410
 forcibly yes it's not relic loops great well 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.410

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:32.400
 252 flux she was there a little more 350 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:37.470

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:50.580
 still purple is not red but in the side 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:53.640
