00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 Look , people, I did not talk, give them one. 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.690
 does anyone know which button is the one I 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.700
 I'm using 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.349
 of course everything was already delivering 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.960
 Until you know that I came today. 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.920
 finally talk about the mixtures of 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.199
 neighborhood battalion 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.539
 who's there started I was here and 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.520
 record video and was not even selected button 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.279
 who recorded video and did not know if it was used 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.199
 had before silk you wore sneaker 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.970
 I thought why not use both 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.529
 together and see what's going to 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.410
 This story you are watching 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.020
 now I like instagram shortcuts 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.030
 reinforced my photo, this is it from here 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.710
 In the photo the hurricane is also more pink than 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.870
 You 're seeing here now because you've already 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.550
 At night then of course I would not stay 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.899
 the same way I had there in the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.450
 window in natural light 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.579
 ai us what happened a whole 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.469
 download would be lipstick and then you 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.149
 get some pictures asking when I 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.340
 wanted to make videos about the mixes 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.739
 How did he do that? 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.780
 really liked the combination and today 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.489
 I finally came to bring you a 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.989
 Mix video is fine 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.940
 continue on the other side as I go 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.460
 show you the law or sneaker of 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.369
 let's go there so beautiful and perfect 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.290
 the new lipsticks I made make mix 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.600
 with 14 scenario and also a tutorial 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.200
 quick how the country is good to see 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.360
 How are we going to start mixing believe 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.009
 What has nothing for you to do? 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.409
 the mix that if you do not know if the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.170
 combination will get very good cup 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.090
 before on the arm I'm there I'm there 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.740
 I was only doing two situations that 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.290
 also do some tests to be able to 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.659
 show you something cute right? 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.360
 The second tip starts with the most 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.490
 dark and then in the work but glory I 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.710
 I know this will end up messing up your 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.299
 lighter lipstick brush but more 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.430
 you start with the clearest and then 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.439
 to go dark over the structure goes 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.540
 even if you take care of your mouth it will not 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.700
 to realize that he had a 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.770
 mix do you know how to say otherwise 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.600
 Then you can see the difference in the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.640
 tip with button and I already talked about it 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.770
 already the lipstick brush my third 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.780
 tip is for you that will win 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.280
 why are you going to use me lipstick will not 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.149
 want to save the car back 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.630
 applicator 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.240
 It's just you picking one up. 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.640
 yes i before saving so you go 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.980
 play your little mix the second color you 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.620
 It's clearer, it's going to get stained more 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.450
 you take a rake language publishers 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.319
 slowly it's all right 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.390
 after complaint 4 last tip do mix 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.760
 while the first button was still 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.160
 Wet people do not pick up the button after 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.590
 What did you accept after you 're already matilla? 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.180
 stick in your mouth and will pass another 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.420
 by five you already know the lipsticks 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.580
 medals know they echo a lot in the mouth 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.200
 and it will not do for you after he 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.750
 pass another possible button because the 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.790
 what will happen if the lipstick goes there 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.410
 and you will put when button floors 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.970
 when, in fact, this is what 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.709
 we did it all wrong then super 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.019
 important this tip that made the 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.769
 while the first button is still 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.900
 wet 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.790
 It's good to be in these four parks that 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.510
 I told you we'll go there and show you 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.610
 button 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.410
 The first mix I'm going to make is 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:05.590
 of the tone 16 the gt is this very dark here 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.950
 that you should know 0 36 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.480
 china the pec is a pinkish hue but 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.480
 Let's see what this here in the house 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:39.190
 There are people here, this was my first 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.709
 We used to mix one for you to see the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.790
 result and I loved this new color that 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:48.010
 would art gp10 today feet on feet not 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.800
 I know how it is under the options 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.790
 It gets better from the name of our new 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.790
 block next mixer I'll use the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.370
 Keith shook fourteen red and 38 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.680
 the spectacle that is a nude beige yes da 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.360
 latest collection of light will blend the 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.040
 two procedures and I'm going to skip steps 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.410
 that you've seen there how I do it 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.450
 the first dark goal afterwards the further away 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.310
 while the bosses are wet and 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.830
 see only the result that is the result 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.440
 misturinha the second shake with 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.720
 show I am by the half result and 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.390

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.460
 You mixed up here, you asked me so much. 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.160
 What am I going to do with you now, that one? 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.440
 the girl in the shoe who was early is more 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.669
 once it starts with the darkest 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.669
 want something for a lighter 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.500
 there people think that the most beautiful lipstick 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.120
 rays can have your slice of silk from 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.070
