00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:06.729 
here is my all-in-one computer built out

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:09.959 
here is my all-in-one computer built out
of<00:00:06.759> a<00:00:07.180> monitor<00:00:07.750> and<00:00:07.990> PC<00:00:08.950> without<00:00:09.099> the<00:00:09.460> cases

see<00:00:12.789> here<00:00:13.030> we<00:00:13.120> got<00:00:13.150> the<00:00:13.360> main<00:00:13.539> computer<00:00:13.870> in

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
see here we got the main computer in

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.320 
see here we got the main computer in
this<00:00:14.230> section<00:00:14.499> and<00:00:14.860> then<00:00:15.730> the<00:00:15.849> monitor<00:00:16.209> in

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
this section and then the monitor in

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.990 
this section and then the monitor in
this<00:00:16.510> section<00:00:16.750> here<00:00:17.619> we<00:00:17.770> have<00:00:17.950> the<00:00:18.730> on<00:00:18.820> off

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
this section here we have the on off

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.700 
this section here we have the on off
switch<00:00:19.030> covered<00:00:19.599> by<00:00:19.689> a<00:00:19.720> hatch<00:00:20.019> along<00:00:20.529> with<00:00:20.650> the

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
indicator LEDs we've got one power

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.210 
indicator LEDs we've got one power
leading<00:00:23.890> into<00:00:24.189> it<00:00:24.220> going<00:00:25.090> inside<00:00:25.420> the<00:00:25.599> case

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
leading into it going inside the case

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.529 
leading into it going inside the case
coming<00:00:27.220> back<00:00:27.460> out<00:00:27.640> for<00:00:27.789> the<00:00:27.849> power<00:00:28.060> supply<00:00:28.300> you

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
coming back out for the power supply you

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.109 
coming back out for the power supply you
can<00:00:28.660> see<00:00:28.839> the<00:00:28.929> fan<00:00:29.140> there<00:00:29.410> and<00:00:29.589> one<00:00:30.369> going<00:00:30.910> into

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
custom computer is how closely the Lego

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.560 
custom computer is how closely the Lego
bricks<00:01:09.159> spin<00:01:09.400> off<00:01:09.549> the<00:01:09.700> monitor<00:01:10.060> you<00:01:10.180> can<00:01:10.210> just

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
bricks spin off the monitor you can just

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.120 
bricks spin off the monitor you can just
barely<00:01:10.869> see<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.140> little<00:01:11.380> metal<00:01:11.770> in<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:11.920> little
