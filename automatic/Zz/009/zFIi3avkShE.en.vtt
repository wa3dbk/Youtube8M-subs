00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
to you know manipulates and my answer is

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.970 
to you know manipulates and my answer is
kind<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.700> they<00:00:35.700> are<00:00:36.030> already<00:00:36.870> at<00:00:37.170> an<00:00:37.350> odd<00:00:37.559> angle

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
kind of they are already at an odd angle

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.459 
kind of they are already at an odd angle
on<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.610> ipod<00:00:39.030> touch<00:00:39.210> themselves<00:00:39.629> they're<00:00:40.230> not

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
on the ipod touch themselves they're not

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.950 
on the ipod touch themselves they're not
flushed<00:00:41.010> they<00:00:41.340> are<00:00:41.489> all<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:42.030> an<00:00:42.239> angle<00:00:42.629> as<00:00:42.780> you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
flushed they are all at an angle as you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.459 
flushed they are all at an angle as you
can<00:00:43.079> see<00:00:43.379> angled<00:00:44.160> button<00:00:45.110> angled<00:00:46.110> buttons

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
can see angled button angled buttons

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.119 
can see angled button angled buttons
right<00:00:46.739> there<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.340> well<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.420> pushing<00:00:49.260> them<00:00:49.860> in

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
right there as well so pushing them in

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.389 
right there as well so pushing them in
the<00:00:50.280> first<00:00:50.489> place<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.969> little<00:00:51.660> awkward<00:00:52.399> with

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
the first place is a little awkward with

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.270 
the first place is a little awkward with
this<00:00:53.610> case<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.719> power<00:00:54.989> button<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.469> very<00:00:55.890> easy

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
this case the power button is very easy

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.479 
this case the power button is very easy
to<00:00:56.460> push<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.660> see<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.079> off<00:00:58.620> very<00:00:59.160> easy

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
to push as you can see on off very easy

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.299 
to push as you can see on off very easy
when<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.329> get<00:01:00.480> into<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.530> volume<00:01:01.949> buttons

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
when you get into it the volume buttons

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.549 
when you get into it the volume buttons
are<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.609> little<00:01:03.539> tougher<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.930> push<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.530> can

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
are a little tougher to push you can

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.940 
are a little tougher to push you can
definitely<00:01:05.159> do<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:06.090> down<00:01:06.720> button<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
definitely do it the down button the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
definitely do it the down button the
down<00:01:08.130> volume<00:01:08.159> button<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> little<00:01:09.360> harder<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
down volume button is a little harder to

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.929 
down volume button is a little harder to
push<00:01:09.930> then<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.350> volume<00:01:11.040> up<00:01:11.189> button<00:01:11.220> actually

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
push then the volume up button actually

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.450 
push then the volume up button actually
so<00:01:12.689> that's<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.470> little<00:01:13.740> drawback<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.159> I've

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
so that's one little drawback that I've

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.890 
so that's one little drawback that I've
been<00:01:14.610> noticing<00:01:14.880> over<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> last<00:01:15.450> couple<00:01:15.630> days

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
been noticing over the last couple days

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.690 
been noticing over the last couple days
when<00:01:16.080> I've<00:01:16.200> been<00:01:16.350> using<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.340> volume

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
when I've been using this is the volume

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.240 
when I've been using this is the volume
buttons<00:01:18.060> are<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> little<00:01:19.229> difficult<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.950> push

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
buttons are a little difficult to push

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.510 
buttons are a little difficult to push
they<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:20.670> work<00:01:21.210> yes<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.049> they<00:01:22.229> are<00:01:22.470> raised<00:01:23.100> out

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
they do work yes and they are raised out

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.370 
they do work yes and they are raised out
of<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> case<00:01:23.970> as<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.540> see<00:01:24.720> right<00:01:24.750> there

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
of the case as you can see right there

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.780 
of the case as you can see right there
they<00:01:26.340> are<00:01:26.490> definitely<00:01:26.729> raised<00:01:27.600> um<00:01:28.549> but<00:01:29.549> they

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
they are definitely raised um but they

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.969 
they are definitely raised um but they
are<00:01:29.909> still<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.240> little<00:01:30.689> difficult<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.470> press

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
are still a little difficult to press

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.390 
are still a little difficult to press
the<00:01:32.579> other<00:01:32.820> question<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.170> received<00:01:35.130> as

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the other question that I received as

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.210 
the other question that I received as

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
well was how easy is this to take out of

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.330 
well was how easy is this to take out of
the<00:01:38.850> case<00:01:39.119> if<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.900> want<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.380> switch<00:01:40.680> cases<00:01:40.920> or

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
remove from the case and my answer that

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.289 
remove from the case and my answer that
is<00:01:47.670> very<00:01:48.390> very<00:01:48.570> simple<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.590> very<00:01:50.009> easy<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.729> is

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
is very very simple it's very easy it is

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.719 
is very very simple it's very easy it is
a<00:01:51.619> soft<00:01:52.970> pliable<00:01:53.970> rubber<00:01:54.570> case<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:56.250> thick

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
a soft pliable rubber case it is thick

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.060 
a soft pliable rubber case it is thick
enough<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.450> strong<00:01:57.990> enough<00:01:58.049> in<00:01:58.649> order<00:01:58.799> to

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
enough and strong enough in order to

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.539 
enough and strong enough in order to
keep<00:01:59.219> around<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.790> ipod<00:02:00.829> hard<00:02:01.829> plastic<00:02:02.310> back

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
keep around the ipod hard plastic back

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.840 
keep around the ipod hard plastic back
but<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.659> soft<00:02:04.020> rubber<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:05.130> think<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
but the soft rubber I think it's a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.850 
but the soft rubber I think it's a
either<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.119> rubber<00:02:06.479> or<00:02:06.719> silicone<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.619> case

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
either a rubber or silicone in case

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.520 
either a rubber or silicone in case
