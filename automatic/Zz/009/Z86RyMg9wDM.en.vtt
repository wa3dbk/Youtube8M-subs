00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
metal this is a door for my pantry yeah

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.520 
metal this is a door for my pantry yeah
it<00:00:27.660> was<00:00:27.810> fairly<00:00:28.050> simple<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.650> figure<00:00:28.980> out<00:00:33.530> cuts

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
it was fairly simple to figure out cuts

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.650 
it was fairly simple to figure out cuts
an<00:00:34.680> inch<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.070> half<00:00:35.100> steal<00:00:35.790> from<00:00:36.210> tractor

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
an inch and a half steal from tractor

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.130 
an inch and a half steal from tractor
supply<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.590> some<00:00:37.829> bolts

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
supply and some bolts

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.030 
supply and some bolts
some<00:00:40.140> lag<00:00:40.379> bolts<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.440> magic<00:00:43.860> ingredient

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
some lag bolts and the magic ingredient

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.470 
some lag bolts and the magic ingredient
is<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.210> wheel<00:00:45.860> and<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.070> salvaged<00:00:47.610> those<00:00:47.879> from

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
is the wheel and I salvaged those from

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.790 
is the wheel and I salvaged those from
some<00:00:48.780> rollerblades

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
some rollerblades

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.939 
some rollerblades
from<00:00:50.280> Goodwill<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.410> pair<00:00:52.739> of

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
from Goodwill and one pair of

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.510 
from Goodwill and one pair of
rollerblades<00:00:53.370> will<00:00:53.969> met<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.390> eight<00:00:54.660> wheels

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
rollerblades will met you eight wheels

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.529 
rollerblades will met you eight wheels
so<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.670> enough<00:00:56.969> for<00:00:57.180> four<00:00:57.420> doors<00:00:59.449> you<00:01:00.449> can

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
so it's enough for four doors you can

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.330 
so it's enough for four doors you can
get<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> close-up<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.739> you'll<00:01:02.010> see<00:01:02.100> it's

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
get a close-up on that you'll see it's

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.539 
get a close-up on that you'll see it's
just<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.609> bowl<00:01:03.379> with<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.500> couple<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.890> nuts<00:01:05.189> to

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
just a bowl with a couple of nuts to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.420 
just a bowl with a couple of nuts to
space<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.450> out<00:01:09.470> you<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.650> great<00:01:10.890> bearings

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
space it out you have great bearings

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.510 
space it out you have great bearings
they<00:01:11.640> roll<00:01:11.880> nice<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.360> quiet<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.369> in<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
they roll nice and quiet and in the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.890 
they roll nice and quiet and in the
track<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.659> also<00:01:16.110> pretty<00:01:16.350> simple<00:01:17.509> it's<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.689> piece

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
track is also pretty simple it's a piece

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.940 
track is also pretty simple it's a piece
of<00:01:19.110> oak<00:01:19.320> salvaged<00:01:19.950> from<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.340> four-foot<00:01:20.880> pallet

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
of oak salvaged from a four-foot pallet

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.910 
of oak salvaged from a four-foot pallet
with<00:01:22.950> two<00:01:23.189> pieces<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.869> quarter-round<00:01:27.920> facing

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
with two pieces of quarter-round facing

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.140 
with two pieces of quarter-round facing
side<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.729> side<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.840> makes<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.290> track<00:01:32.150> you

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
side to side and makes the track you

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.480 
side to side and makes the track you
gotta<00:01:33.390> leave<00:01:33.630> enough<00:01:33.900> enough<00:01:34.890> space<00:01:35.280> between

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
gotta leave enough enough space between

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.810 
gotta leave enough enough space between
them<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> wheel<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.450> roll<00:01:37.340> so<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.549> about

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
them for the wheel to roll so it's about

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.910 
them for the wheel to roll so it's about
an<00:01:39.210> inch<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:40.200> 3/8<00:01:41.070> deep<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.710> leave

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
an inch and 3/8 deep and you leave

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.800 
an inch and 3/8 deep and you leave
enough<00:01:44.159> space<00:01:44.220> from<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> ceiling<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.570> can

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
enough space from the ceiling so you can

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.219 
enough space from the ceiling so you can
fit<00:01:46.049> your<00:01:46.200> wheel<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.680> when<00:01:46.860> you're<00:01:46.979> done<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:49.200> I

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
fit your wheel in when you're done so I

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.469 
fit your wheel in when you're done so I
drilled<00:01:49.770> these<00:01:49.950> out<00:01:50.220> with<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.490> drill<00:01:50.729> press<00:01:50.759> or

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
drilled these out with a drill press or

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.889 
drilled these out with a drill press or
you<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.720> use<00:01:51.899> hand<00:01:52.860> drill<00:01:53.220> there<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.540> straps

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
you can use hand drill there the straps

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.020 
you can use hand drill there the straps
are<00:01:55.140> ten<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.530> half<00:01:55.649> inches<00:01:55.890> long<00:01:58.850> on<00:01:59.850> this

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
are ten and a half inches long on this

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.280 
are ten and a half inches long on this
door<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.780> wanted<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.290> lean<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.189> used<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.880> a

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
door it wanted to lean in so I used a a

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.839 
door it wanted to lean in so I used a a
third<00:02:04.290> wheel<00:02:04.680> at<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.729> bottom<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.619> guide<00:02:07.950> so

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
third wheel at the bottom is a guide so

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.940 
third wheel at the bottom is a guide so
it<00:02:08.910> rolls<00:02:09.119> nice<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.690> smooth

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.340 

for<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.010> handle<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.580> just<00:02:16.820> used<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.350> salvage

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
for the handle I just used a salvage

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.170 
for the handle I just used a salvage
brass<00:02:19.630> finial<00:02:20.630> plate<00:02:20.960> and<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.350> soldered<00:02:21.890> a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
brass finial plate and I soldered a

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.820 
brass finial plate and I soldered a
doorknob<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:23.930> doesn't<00:02:24.110> turn<00:02:24.500> it's

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
doorknob to it so it doesn't turn it's

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.410 
doorknob to it so it doesn't turn it's
just<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.220> it's<00:02:26.210> just<00:02:26.300> a<00:02:26.480> handle<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:26.870> can<00:02:27.140> grab

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
just a it's just a handle you can grab

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.330 
just a it's just a handle you can grab
so<00:02:29.420> there<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.690> go

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
so there you go

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.440 
so there you go
total<00:02:31.340> outlay<00:02:32.470> twenty<00:02:33.470> bucks

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
total outlay twenty bucks

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.950 
total outlay twenty bucks
