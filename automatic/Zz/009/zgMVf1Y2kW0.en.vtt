all that over again the same part that

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.520 
all that over again the same part that
we<00:02:21.790> did<00:02:21.910> at<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.060> beginning<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.450> C<00:02:22.690> up<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.290> the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
we did at the beginning and C up to the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.870 
we did at the beginning and C up to the
high<00:02:23.680> C<00:02:29.160> now<00:02:30.160> this<00:02:30.310> is<00:02:30.400> where<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:30.610> gets<00:02:30.760> a

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
high C now this is where it gets a

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.640 
high C now this is where it gets a
little<00:02:30.910> bit<00:02:31.209> different<00:02:31.540> I'm<00:02:32.350> going<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.590> go

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
little bit different I'm going to go

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.740 
little bit different I'm going to go
back<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:32.830> G<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:34.170> work<00:02:35.170> your<00:02:35.290> way<00:02:35.350> down<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.770> see

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:49.470 

it's<00:02:40.750> g<00:02:41.220> FD<00:02:45.030> then<00:02:46.030> back<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.450> F<00:02:47.730> then<00:02:48.730> e<00:02:49.030> just

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
it's g FD then back to F then e just

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.380 
it's g FD then back to F then e just
lower<00:02:49.690> down<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:50.050> right<00:02:50.200> middle<00:02:50.350> finger<00:02:50.440> and

lower down that right middle finger and

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.710 
lower down that right middle finger and

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
then C so let's play it from the top

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.590 
then C so let's play it from the top
starting<00:02:56.350> with<00:02:56.500> that<00:02:56.620> low<00:02:56.890> C<00:02:57.209> let's<00:02:58.209> go<00:02:58.390> real

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
starting with that low C let's go real

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:20.780 
starting with that low C let's go real
slow<00:02:58.840> one<00:02:59.550> two<00:03:00.600> ready<00:03:01.600> go

the second section of the song starting
with<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.660> high<00:03:25.870> C<00:03:36.450> so<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.660> kind<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:37.900> it's

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
with the high C so it kind of it's

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.729 
with the high C so it kind of it's
almost<00:03:38.590> Li<00:03:38.829> above<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.579> G<00:03:40.420> note<00:03:41.140> all<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.680> way

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
almost Li above the G note all the way

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.220 
almost Li above the G note all the way
up<00:03:41.829> to<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.190> high<00:03:42.370> F<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:43.180> how<00:03:43.450> we<00:03:43.510> play<00:03:43.720> that<00:03:43.930> is

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
up to the high F and how we play that is

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.990 
up to the high F and how we play that is
you<00:03:44.530> start<00:03:44.590> with<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:45.040> high<00:03:45.820> C<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:48.640> you<00:03:48.850> play

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
you start with that high C and you play

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.960 
you start with that high C and you play
that<00:03:49.030> note<00:03:49.329> three<00:03:49.570> times<00:03:49.780> one<00:03:50.590> two<00:03:50.890> three<00:03:53.970> and

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
that note three times one two three and

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.060 
that note three times one two three and
then<00:03:55.180> it's<00:03:55.480> B<00:03:55.870> so<00:03:56.260> just<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.650> right<00:03:56.860> middle

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
then it's B so just that right middle

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:04.140 
then it's B so just that right middle
finger<00:03:58.079> back<00:03:59.079> to<00:03:59.230> C<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:01.299> D<00:04:02.640> which<00:04:03.640> is<00:04:03.820> the<00:04:03.940> left

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
finger back to C and D which is the left

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.900 
finger back to C and D which is the left
thumb<00:04:04.360> then<00:04:05.049> go<00:04:05.260> down<00:04:05.470> to<00:04:05.739> G<00:04:06.010> so<00:04:06.250> both<00:04:06.730> thumbs

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
thumb then go down to G so both thumbs

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.819 
thumb then go down to G so both thumbs
cover<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.870> both<00:04:08.019> of<00:04:08.170> those<00:04:08.260> two<00:04:08.500> bottom

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
kind of rock it off like that

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.260 
kind of rock it off like that
see<00:04:24.530> I<00:04:24.770> just<00:04:25.310> kind<00:04:25.640> of<00:04:25.670> rock<00:04:25.850> it<00:04:25.970> off<00:04:26.090> it's

see I just kind of rock it off it's

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.460 
see I just kind of rock it off it's
still<00:04:26.480> touch<00:04:26.690> making<00:04:26.930> contact<00:04:27.350> with<00:04:27.380> the

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
still touch making contact with the

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.350 
still touch making contact with the
ocarina<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.040> I<00:04:28.430> just<00:04:28.640> kind<00:04:28.820> of<00:04:28.880> wobble<00:04:29.150> it<00:04:29.240> off

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
ocarina and I just kind of wobble it off

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.630 
ocarina and I just kind of wobble it off
the<00:04:29.540> hole<00:04:29.690> to<00:04:29.810> uncover<00:04:30.140> and<00:04:30.490> that's<00:04:31.490> how<00:04:31.610> I

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
the hole to uncover and that's how I

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.130 
the hole to uncover and that's how I
balance<00:04:31.850> it<00:04:32.150> mostly<00:04:32.600> like<00:04:32.780> that

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
balance it mostly like that

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.630 
balance it mostly like that
then<00:04:33.620> you<00:04:33.710> get<00:04:33.800> to<00:04:33.890> cover<00:04:34.010> this<00:04:34.190> hole<00:04:34.370> which<00:04:34.520> is

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
then you get to cover this hole which is

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.000 
then you get to cover this hole which is
the<00:04:35.090> one<00:04:35.360> we<00:04:35.450> use<00:04:35.480> to<00:04:35.780> play<00:04:35.930> B<00:04:36.140> and<00:04:36.530> you're

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
the one we use to play B and you're

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.620 
the one we use to play B and you're
going<00:04:37.130> to<00:04:37.160> uncover<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.730> thumb<00:04:37.910> hole<00:04:38.120> so<00:04:38.390> it's

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
going to uncover the thumb hole so it's

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.940 
going to uncover the thumb hole so it's
F<00:04:39.080> with<00:04:39.560> all<00:04:39.740> coal's<00:04:40.220> uncovered<00:04:40.730> and<00:04:41.950> then

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
F with all coal's uncovered and then

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.830 
F with all coal's uncovered and then
just<00:04:43.310> cover<00:04:43.520> that<00:04:43.760> hole<00:04:44.030> still<00:04:44.450> thumb<00:04:44.660> holes

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
just cover that hole still thumb holes

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.090 
just cover that hole still thumb holes
uncovered<00:04:47.650> see<00:04:48.650> what<00:04:48.770> I<00:04:48.800> did

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
uncovered see what I did
