after a couple hours after I'm actually
shooting<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.180> reason<00:00:24.539> being<00:00:24.689> for

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
shooting it and the reason being for

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.170 
shooting it and the reason being for
that<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.320> because<00:00:25.470> yesterday<00:00:26.250> was<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.640> tough

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180

day we had shot a vlog then we had shot
an<00:00:34.010> unboxing<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.579> then<00:00:36.390> we'd<00:00:36.510> shot<00:00:36.719> another

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
an unboxing and then we'd shot another

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.310 
an unboxing and then we'd shot another
unboxing<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.980> then<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.210> went<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.660> go<00:00:39.750> take<00:00:39.960> this

okay so I went through all the data
recovery<00:00:49.020> options<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.649> possibly<00:00:50.129> knew

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
recovery options that I possibly knew

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.470 
recovery options that I possibly knew
and<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.690> them<00:00:51.809> actually<00:00:52.460> almost<00:00:53.480> ruined

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
my Mac because it started filling it up

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.330 
my Mac because it started filling it up
with<00:00:57.120> these<00:00:57.390> extraneous<00:00:57.809> files<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:59.250> the

with these extraneous files and to the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.920 
with these extraneous files and to the
point<00:00:59.550> where<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.879> filled<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.210> up<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.449> quick<00:01:00.719> I

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
point where it filled it up so quick I

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.810 
point where it filled it up so quick I
didn't<00:01:01.289> even<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.530> any<00:01:01.739> room<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.609> move

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
didn't even have any room to like move

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.000 
didn't even have any room to like move
around<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.239> delete<00:01:03.570> stuff<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.350> when<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> was

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
around to delete stuff and when I was

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.410 
around to delete stuff and when I was
deleting<00:01:05.280> stuff<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.850> was<00:01:05.939> going<00:01:06.180> into<00:01:06.299> like

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
deleting stuff it was going into like

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.510 
deleting stuff it was going into like
these<00:01:06.540> temp<00:01:06.810> holders<00:01:07.140> bla<00:01:07.590> bla<00:01:07.770> bla<00:01:08.159> I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
these temp holders bla bla bla I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.280 
these temp holders bla bla bla I
couldn't<00:01:08.970> delete<00:01:09.299> anything<00:01:09.810> from<00:01:09.930> my<00:01:10.080> Mac

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
couldn't delete anything from my Mac

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.810 
couldn't delete anything from my Mac
like<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.799> wouldn't<00:01:11.070> even<00:01:11.159> let<00:01:11.369> me<00:01:11.520> delete

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
like it wouldn't even let me delete

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.700 
like it wouldn't even let me delete
anything<00:01:12.119> because<00:01:12.510> when<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.900> click<00:01:13.170> delete<00:01:13.530> it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
anything because when I click delete it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.380 
anything because when I click delete it
would<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.159> go<00:01:14.310> off<00:01:14.490> somewhere<00:01:14.760> else<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.299> not

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
would just go off somewhere else and not

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.350 
would just go off somewhere else and not
actually<00:01:15.780> delete<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.470> save<00:01:16.979> space<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
actually delete and save space so the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.969 
actually delete and save space so the
Mac<00:01:18.540> shut<00:01:18.780> down<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> could<00:01:19.470> even<00:01:19.619> turn<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.860> back

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979
