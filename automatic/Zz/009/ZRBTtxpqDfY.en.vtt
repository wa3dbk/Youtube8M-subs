00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.679
 i am mike we have the lumia here 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.020
 800 30 get the lens 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.119
 it was indeed in the context of ifa 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.960
 presented is a somewhat stripped down 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:26.189
 variant of the lumia 930 and waits with 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.010
 a 5 inch display with 720p 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.880
 resolution on has a snapdragon 400 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.649
 in there 1 2 ghz we all know richly for 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.270
 enjoyment of definitely that needs 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.410
 not so many resources are running here 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.110
 everything through 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.780
 what else is there to say it's a 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.180
 pure video camera with 10 megapixels yes 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.020
 installed on the back and 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:56.050
 there you have a bit of the 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.150
 saved at the resolution compared to the 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.360
 other models but otherwise is just 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:05.530
 really everything on board so what 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.540
 who want the nokia eunuchs would 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.460
 here at the pre-production model I have to 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.740
 saying 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.240
 maybe it's a bit slower though 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.200
 will definitely be up to the release 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.170
 still 16 varied 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.160
 setting options 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.700
 that makes a lot of fun in any case 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.520
 otherwise in many colors here now 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.200
 of course, as an example against the gray 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.570
 Color where the camera is a bit too 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.050
 a problem with the focus has since I was 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.290
 see Beginning So as it gets 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.119
 properly grill with the green the orange 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.369
 what we have here with us is 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:53.510
 although from the lumia 730 735 but also in 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:57.370
 of course, the 830 will come in color 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:00.200
 so in the first impression stable processed 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.620
 nice with metal on the sides too very 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.330
 thin 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:07.100
 Of course it is very clear 5 2 but who 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.720
 on it is also no 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:15.520
 problems, especially the edges have a 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:19.880
 but they are not that annoying 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.840
 edges are flattened and it lies 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.560
 very good in the hand 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.260
 yes it should cost under 400 euros and for 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.760
 i think nokia has the price for everyone 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.910
 get a good iron in the fire 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.620
 clearly nokia will stop someday 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.680
 only microsoft hot you have yes 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.100
 read with us but these devices will be 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.000
 definitely still under the nokia name in 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.000
 come to the trade 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.010
 Finally, I have a lot to say 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.900
 interesting device for me if it 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.190
 then next week in the trade comes 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.290
 Of course , we immediately rush on the 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.640
 hopefully and then test device 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.430
 we do it again through his neat 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.060
 That was from my first impression says 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.060
 Thank you for watching
