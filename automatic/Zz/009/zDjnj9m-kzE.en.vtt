00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.599
 you have two vaults 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.119
 too hard to do with pain and 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.169
 stone and the pistons and that's too much 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.500
 complicated to understand 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.490
 Well, this tutorial will be for you 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.890
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.630
 Hello tutorial to all his fads 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.609
 mouth today we find ourselves for 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.189
 a tutorial it will be how to make a 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.670
 safe room thanks to ovens yes 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.000
 I said well thanks to ovens but he 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.329
 there will be a little bit of horatio so I have 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.149
 if the system stops stone 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.510
 so you will choose a course 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.239
 any of them 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.660
 and there will be a comparator behind who 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.190
 will roll him with two tons with one 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.670
 little repeater that gives enough 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.289
 power to open the pistons that 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.420
 are will be closed so that is to say 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.879
 that your cov threshold will be closed if 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.339
 you remove that block of coal and well 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.000
 that's chests is open and 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.710
 accessible 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.660
 I made a small way to return 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.960
 found back or oven and therefore 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.130
 put back the little coal I put some 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.170
 coal blogs and then 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.290
 here you have all your chests with your 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:29.640
 diamond and your gold and all your stuff 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.770
 this tutorial will be for especially the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.170
 servers such as I do not know if you 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.790
 have a brain or even a solo a 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.350
 waiter with your friends that they like 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.939
 well sometimes look in your chests 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.740
 and take some stuff they 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.240
 did not have skyblues for example 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.090
 would need a lot 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.110
 this little machine will be good for you 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.790
 because they will wonder why 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.090
 so they go so far as to believe that it's 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.460
 one they'll think it's just a 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.000
 room with ovens to heat 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.700
 the food will mine all that all 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.560
 This is trivial except that not because he 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.469
 y to your school bag behind I already 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.610
 is an example just now 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.489
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.980
 to do it is already very simple it you 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.280
 will need coal a crazy a comparator 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.380
 diarra stone harry peter new cases 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.639
 remained of sticky piston rest on 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.230
 would not need more than 15 even 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.579
 said it should suffer so already it's 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.400
 very simple you go do you have 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:32.579
 oven like you and a wave to use 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.690
 for example do not care anything you put by 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:39.299
 your example chappe blocks or blocks 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.370
 obliged it can be fashion plans 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.190
 finally your fuel and it takes 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.190
 that they have enough for the 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.109
 repeater be turned on paris a hundred times 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.180
 it's because these people but just a 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.209
 veiled repeater is not on and 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.919
 so it will not work so it was 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.359
 enough for the repeater to be put 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.459
 no no but there I'm not wrong 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.850
 not working 21 it does not work that 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.190
 it does not work 28 boom it works so 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.780
 in bulk coal its 28-year-old coal 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.049
 pure it must be 40 between like that 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.570
 it's cheaper with 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.639
 coal well knew how to use blocks of 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.000
 coal because that's it 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:20.340
 simple so here you have it 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.440
 your coal block or your at 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.209
 coal and it has to be the pieters rice 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.609
 what are you then you go all 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:32.190
 simply you will have two sons 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:35.579
 of redstone a redstone you put a 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.630
 a stay here and you put your tracks 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.540
 we see it works 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.760
 they are powered sticks and pistons 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.430
 for that because when you would have 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.370
 true here is the camp the piston is going to get 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.260
 retract finally close up and knock 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.109
 can also retract so you 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.419
 can go on there normally here if you 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.690
 make a big line of oven here 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:04:00.419
 you will have other ovens and so there 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.540
 you will not be able to pass this machine 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:05.070
 to do is that he normally I 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.750
 do not know you'll have for example if you 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.830
 do in a cave you will have them 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.560
 aston 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.360
 you take off up pretty quickly you 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.150
 does a little bit as I have 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.660
 is there a little excess you put back 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.220
 directly here so you can 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.280
 go in your school bag without 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.070
 behind you are you salt is you 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.140
 finally finally time that you can 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.700
 can be in your as tranquil 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.270
 that a person who passed then 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.190
 wanted from behind like a big 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.930
 nasty 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.320
 so that's already all that already already the 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.070
 end of this future dlc already the end of this 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.340
 tutorial 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.600
 thank you for watching this video it's 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.820
 it's very inexpensive in redstone 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.620
 and then just after coal 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.010
 it's a little bit expensive because it 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.400
 will have to empire from all over the 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:03.240
 coal in the furnaces and try to in 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:06.060
 put y and gaia to this format where there is 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.600
 the rise to be missed which are for 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.300
 avoid being in the highest maximum 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.130
 more discreet so here is anyway 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:20.270
 thank you for watching this video 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:21.860
 this tutorial was done by myself 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.480
 I was inspired by someone so 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.250
 I watched the series falling in love 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:30.140
 with versus free gel fire here I have 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.480
 well and I like the forint he gives 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.960
 so I looked at their fine kingdoms 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:39.440
 and then already big gg to free free but 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.460
 well we do not care that it's not that it's 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.080
 more interesting 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.850
 the most interesting is that this 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.480
 vault room was carried out by ban 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:49.760
 teen I do not know if he was taking 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.500
 the idea by someone or so he does 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.360
 himself but in any case now 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.370
 I can reproduce that I will be very 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.930
 useful anyway thank you have to look 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.730
 this video and we find ourselves the 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.590
 next time for new tutorial and 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.590
 other allies all hot
