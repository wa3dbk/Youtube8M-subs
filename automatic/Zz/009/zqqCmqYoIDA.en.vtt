teleports<00:02:19.800> thoughts<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.220> won't

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
teleports thoughts and I won't

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.039 
teleports thoughts and I won't
demonstrate<00:02:20.640> all<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.239> them<00:02:21.360> again<00:02:21.630> but<00:02:21.930> there

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
demonstrate all of them again but there

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.809 
demonstrate all of them again but there
are<00:02:22.080> two<00:02:22.530> notable<00:02:22.769> ones<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.430> let<00:02:23.549> you<00:02:23.670> enter

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
are two notable ones that let you enter

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.699 
are two notable ones that let you enter
clock<00:02:24.209> tower<00:02:24.450> from<00:02:24.600> ground<00:02:24.900> level<00:02:25.019> which<00:02:25.530> you

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
clock tower from ground level which you

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.710 
clock tower from ground level which you
can<00:02:25.860> see<00:02:25.890> here<00:02:26.269> now<00:02:27.269> there<00:02:27.420> are<00:02:27.540> other

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
can see here now there are other

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.240 
can see here now there are other
professions<00:02:28.170> specific<00:02:28.530> mechanics<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:28.980> do

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
professions specific mechanics that do

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.100 
professions specific mechanics that do
give<00:02:29.489> you<00:02:29.640> added<00:02:29.880> mobility<00:02:30.360> on<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:30.600> map<00:02:30.780> but

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
give you added mobility on this map but

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.930 
give you added mobility on this map but
since<00:02:31.860> they<00:02:32.100> can<00:02:32.250> often<00:02:32.459> result<00:02:32.580> in<00:02:32.819> you

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
since they can often result in you

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.550 
since they can often result in you
actually<00:02:33.299> getting<00:02:33.480> out<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.810> bands<00:02:33.989> at<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.290> map

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
actually getting out of bands at the map

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.710 
actually getting out of bands at the map
I<00:02:34.799> won't<00:02:35.370> be<00:02:35.580> showing<00:02:35.940> them<00:02:36.060> as<00:02:36.299> they're<00:02:36.540> just
