00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.750

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.510
 Here I have the first time just like that 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.879
 cards pure sake is following 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.399
 I did not collect it, I use it 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.840

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.789
 and that 's why I have the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.920
 Do not make any effort now 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.520
 to sort numbers 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.040
 There were many comments where you can find maps 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.250
 There is usually a collection folder 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.909
 where there are newspapers or in lottery 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.520
 shops 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.119
 if it is not there ask for it 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.530
 people behind the cash register can you 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.880
 The order and price I know in the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.799
 not at all but I have one here 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.380
 I made you a video with you 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.210
 unpacked so also this one 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.020
 cards are mostly made consciously 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.060
 There are where there are lottery locations 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.700
 Most of the time , they have these in front 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.369
 container bohli stuck in it and today 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.759
 I watch the first with you together 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.720
 map again 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.710
 Let's take a look at the chips of the cards 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.079
 have along 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.909
 I believe I almost all of them 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.670
 Scroll hastily into the socket 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.540
 processed 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.540
 So I need replenishment at least 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.610
 as far as the kids ugg types are concerned 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:04.390
 oh i 've got i've seen and stuff 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.390
 it looks 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.920
 Excitations and behind it you have yes 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.060
 always so certain things 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.540
 passed the last time I thus shown 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.540
 have 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.859
 i do not say the names anymore 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.900
 is discussed every time as s 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.430
 is pronounced but you know that 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.189
 apparently not all because it 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.620
 is there among the occasional videos 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:42.530
 comments where you say so it will be 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.970
 pronounced so that very old 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.310
 you are not that right either 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.870
 to be actually and therefore let 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.200
 I prefer the pronunciation 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.150
 I have no idea so much 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.719
 so that's my five cards of 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.219
 today if you want to see something here 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.859
 inside is divorces the next days 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:03.409
 again, because then comes the next 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:07.450
 five cards then to the next 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.450
