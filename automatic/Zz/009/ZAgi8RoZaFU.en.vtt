00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720 

you<00:00:00.750> got<00:00:00.900> this<00:00:01.020> bra<00:00:01.530> okay<00:00:02.100> so<00:00:02.159> this<00:00:02.370> is<00:00:02.550> how<00:00:02.669> you

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
you got this bra okay so this is how you

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.059 
you got this bra okay so this is how you
do<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:03.210> compression<00:00:03.659> test<00:00:04.110> on<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:05.190> 1.6<00:00:07.069> Miata

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
do a compression test on a 1.6 Miata

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.600 
do a compression test on a 1.6 Miata
engine<00:00:09.080> so<00:00:10.080> first<00:00:10.349> off<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:10.620> remove<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.400> four

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
engine so first off you remove the four

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.870 
engine so first off you remove the four
spark<00:00:11.969> plugs<00:00:12.799> with<00:00:13.799> your<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> spark<00:00:14.820> plug

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
spark plugs with your a spark plug

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.220 
spark plugs with your a spark plug
socket<00:00:17.270> and<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.449> we've<00:00:18.600> already<00:00:18.810> got<00:00:19.080> these

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
socket and so we've already got these

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.650 
socket and so we've already got these
three<00:00:19.560> out<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.130> just<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.460> show<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.670> what<00:00:21.600> you

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
three out so just to show you what you

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.800 
three out so just to show you what you
do<00:00:22.279> just<00:00:23.279> drive<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.699> down<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:24.029> there<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.630> you

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
do just drive it down in there and you

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:42.930 
do just drive it down in there and you
twist<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:29.689> see<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> plug<00:00:31.019> there<00:00:37.250> okay

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.960 

so<00:00:43.570> once<00:00:43.840> you<00:00:43.960> have<00:00:44.110> all<00:00:44.410> four<00:00:44.440> of<00:00:45.040> your<00:00:45.670> plugs

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
so once you have all four of your plugs

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.170 
so once you have all four of your plugs
out<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.960> can<00:00:50.110> see<00:00:50.260> behind<00:00:50.410> liners<00:00:50.800> on<00:00:50.950> there

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
out you can see behind liners on there

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.610 
out you can see behind liners on there
just<00:00:52.780> grab<00:00:52.960> your<00:00:52.990> a<00:00:53.290> compression<00:00:53.860> gauge<00:00:54.010> I

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
just grab your a compression gauge I

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.010 
just grab your a compression gauge I
mean<00:00:56.620> you<00:00:56.740> can<00:00:56.860> see<00:00:57.040> there<00:00:57.220> it's<00:00:57.490> kind<00:00:57.700> of<00:00:58.020> it's

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
mean you can see there it's kind of it's

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.580 
mean you can see there it's kind of it's
got<00:00:59.170> a<00:00:59.580> thread<00:01:00.580> on<00:01:00.670> it<00:01:00.700> like<00:01:00.970> a<00:01:01.000> spark<00:01:01.450> plug<00:01:01.590> so

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
got a thread on it like a spark plug so

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.290 
got a thread on it like a spark plug so
just<00:01:02.770> put<00:01:02.920> it<00:01:02.950> down<00:01:03.130> into<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.489> ignition<00:01:03.910> or<00:01:04.210> it

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
just put it down into the ignition or it

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:15.250 
just put it down into the ignition or it
into<00:01:04.540> the

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.350 

you<00:01:15.860> just<00:01:16.070> want<00:01:16.220> to<00:01:16.250> have<00:01:16.430> it<00:01:16.580> just<00:01:16.760> barely

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
you just want to have it just barely

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.690 
you just want to have it just barely
hand<00:01:18.230> tight<00:01:18.530> because<00:01:19.190> you<00:01:19.310> don't<00:01:19.490> want<00:01:19.640> to

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
hand tight because you don't want to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.390 
hand tight because you don't want to
strip<00:01:19.880> this<00:01:20.470> then<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.590> next<00:01:21.830> thing<00:01:21.920> you<00:01:22.040> do<00:01:22.190> is

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
strip this then the next thing you do is

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.850 
strip this then the next thing you do is
you<00:01:22.850> remove<00:01:23.150> your<00:01:23.300> ignition<00:01:23.720> coil<00:01:24.260> connector

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
you remove your ignition coil connector

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.400 
you remove your ignition coil connector
which<00:01:25.730> is<00:01:25.760> this<00:01:26.510> back<00:01:26.810> here<00:01:28.960> next<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.170> coil

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
which is this back here next to the coil

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.970 
which is this back here next to the coil
pack<00:01:30.620> on<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:30.890> engine<00:01:31.510> so<00:01:32.510> then<00:01:32.720> what<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.800> do

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
pack on the engine so then what you do

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.280 
pack on the engine so then what you do
is<00:01:34.190> you<00:01:34.460> just<00:01:34.490> hold<00:01:34.850> your<00:01:34.970> gauge<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.540> with<00:01:36.200> the

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
is you just hold your gauge and with the

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.960 
is you just hold your gauge and with the
help<00:01:36.470> of<00:01:36.590> a<00:01:36.710> friend<00:01:36.980> you<00:01:37.100> get<00:01:37.250> them<00:01:37.400> to<00:01:37.550> fire<00:01:37.760> up

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
help of a friend you get them to fire up

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.820 
help of a friend you get them to fire up
the<00:01:38.090> engine<00:01:40.000> for<00:01:41.000> about<00:01:41.150> five<00:01:41.420> seconds<00:01:41.900> so

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
the engine for about five seconds so

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:50.130 
the engine for about five seconds so
okay<00:01:43.070> whenever<00:01:43.310> you're<00:01:43.490> ready<00:01:47.740> that's<00:01:48.740> good

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
okay whenever you're ready that's good

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.780 
okay whenever you're ready that's good
so<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.229> can<00:01:51.440> see<00:01:51.650> our<00:01:51.830> compression<00:01:52.220> there<00:01:52.580> is

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
so you can see our compression there is

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.170 
so you can see our compression there is
about<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.810> hundred<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.440> seventy<00:01:55.030> which<00:01:56.030> is

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
about a hundred and seventy which is

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.640 
about a hundred and seventy which is
pretty<00:01:56.390> good<00:01:56.570> because<00:01:56.840> I'm<00:01:56.960> pretty<00:01:57.140> sure<00:01:57.290> that

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
pretty good because I'm pretty sure that

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.969 
pretty good because I'm pretty sure that
around<00:01:57.890> 180<00:01:58.520> is<00:01:58.700> what<00:01:58.910> you're<00:01:59.030> looking<00:01:59.270> for<00:01:59.979> so

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
around 180 is what you're looking for so

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.530 
around 180 is what you're looking for so
you<00:02:01.040> just<00:02:01.280> do<00:02:01.430> that<00:02:01.580> between<00:02:02.060> all<00:02:02.210> four<00:02:02.510> of

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
you just do that between all four of

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.410 
you just do that between all four of
your<00:02:02.690> cylinders<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:04.060> yeah<00:02:05.060> that's<00:02:05.330> your

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
your cylinders and yeah that's your

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.080 
your cylinders and yeah that's your
compression<00:02:05.870> test
