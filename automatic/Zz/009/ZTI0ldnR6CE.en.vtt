00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
as you can see here if you can see that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:25.999 
as you can see here if you can see that
on<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.020> camera<00:01:25.229> I'm<00:01:25.409> not<00:01:25.439> sure<00:01:25.680> if<00:01:25.830> you'll<00:01:25.979> be

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
on the camera I'm not sure if you'll be

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.980 
on the camera I'm not sure if you'll be
able<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:27.030> they<00:01:27.090> have<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.270> wavy<00:01:27.540> bottom<00:01:27.810> so

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
able to but they have a wavy bottom so

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.890 
able to but they have a wavy bottom so
when<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.409> close<00:01:29.130> them<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.670> hit<00:01:30.329> them<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.720> air

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
when you close them and hit them the air

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.429 
when you close them and hit them the air
can<00:01:31.079> escape<00:01:31.280> without<00:01:32.780> without<00:01:33.780> any<00:01:33.840> trouble

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
can escape without without any trouble

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.649 
can escape without without any trouble
normally<00:01:34.860> Hyatts<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.939> air<00:01:36.150> would<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.329> trapped

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
normally Hyatts the air would be trapped

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.899 
normally Hyatts the air would be trapped
in<00:01:36.840> there<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.409> really<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.890> results<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.820> a

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
in there and it really just results in a

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.389 
in there and it really just results in a
totally<00:01:39.659> different<00:01:39.689> songs<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:41.520> I've<00:01:41.610> got<00:01:41.790> them

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.970 
and then hopefully you'll be able to get
some<00:02:37.730> decent<00:02:37.910> sound<00:02:38.360> plates<00:02:38.770> from<00:02:39.770> these

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
some decent sound plates from these

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.490 
some decent sound plates from these
semblance<00:02:40.660> if<00:02:41.660> not<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.080> can<00:02:42.200> go<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.350> the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
semblance if not you can go to the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.680 
semblance if not you can go to the
serbian<00:02:42.890> website<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.550> i'm<00:02:43.790> pretty<00:02:44.270> sure<00:02:44.390> that

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
serbian website and i'm pretty sure that

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.620 
serbian website and i'm pretty sure that
they<00:02:44.840> have<00:02:45.550> recorded<00:02:46.550> some<00:02:46.850> types<00:02:47.120> for<00:02:47.360> all<00:02:47.510> of

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
they have recorded some types for all of

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.200 
they have recorded some types for all of
their<00:02:47.780> cymbals<00:02:48.260> in<00:02:48.500> their<00:02:48.800> ranges<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:49.880> just<00:02:50.120> go

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
their cymbals in their ranges so just go

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.690 
their cymbals in their ranges so just go
and<00:02:50.300> have<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.480> look<00:02:50.600> on<00:02:50.780> their<00:02:50.960> website<00:02:51.550> but<00:02:52.550> yet

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
and have a look on their website but yet

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.910 
and have a look on their website but yet
that's<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.120> for<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:53.330> cymbals<00:02:53.750> next<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.500> come<00:02:54.710> i

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
that's it for the cymbals next to come i

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.400 
that's it for the cymbals next to come i
think<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.640> just<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.420> lost<00:02:56.750> of<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.050> hardware

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
think is just the lost of the hardware

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.830 
think is just the lost of the hardware
and<00:02:57.470> then<00:02:57.830> i'm<00:02:57.980> going<00:02:58.100> to<00:02:58.190> be<00:02:58.250> setting<00:02:58.520> it<00:02:58.610> off

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
and then i'm going to be setting it off

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.320 
and then i'm going to be setting it off
so<00:02:59.840> you<00:02:59.930> have<00:03:00.050> to
