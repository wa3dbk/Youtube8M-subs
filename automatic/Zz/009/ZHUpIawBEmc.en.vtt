a<00:06:12.830> SI<00:06:12.889> toos<00:06:13.300> that's<00:06:14.300> great<00:06:14.509> that<00:06:14.779> we<00:06:14.839> can

00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:14.869 
a SI toos that's great that we can

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:16.540 
a SI toos that's great that we can
assume<00:06:15.169> a<00:06:15.289> third<00:06:15.499> of<00:06:15.619> that<00:06:15.770> wasn't<00:06:16.249> lethal
