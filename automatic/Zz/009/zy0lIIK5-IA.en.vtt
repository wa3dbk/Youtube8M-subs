00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello laurent the co-founder chair 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.790
 bobigny workshops today combines 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.620
 I will show you how we change 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.330
 a zipper on a pair 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.580
 of jeans after completely 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.000
 disassembled the old zipper we 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.279
 we will be able to propose a new 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.020
 after completely disjointed 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.449
 the old zipper we will have 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.890
 took care to dismantle the seams 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.289
 decorative the end of the belt have 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.939
 cleared the dough on which is fixed the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.590
 zipper for power 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.410
 place the new sip 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.000
 we will start by preparing our 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.350
 pinned zipper 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.629
 correctly on the fly 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.300
 we will place ourselves on the old traces 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:52.800
 stitched pinned way zip 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.899
 regular along the old mark the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.070
 exactly where we stand where 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.780
 was the previous 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.730
 once we pin it down we go to the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.960
 machine to put a closure to 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.400
 slide we need a foot 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:09.450
 specific for ease we're going 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.170
 sew it open in december 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.310
 crowbar 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.310
 we sting we will cost 1500 m 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.950
 certainly a reverse for 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.869
 solidify 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.869
 sewing and going back 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.969
 in the same way that we have 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.490
 prepared the beautiful game side we're going 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.439
 prepare the right side by pinning 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.829
 cleanly in the footsteps of the old 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.829
 sewing 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.530
 he's going to cart up to consolidate the 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.530
 sewing 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.520
 new pic 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.240
 a place 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.240
 from the previous 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.540
 here 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:17.850
 again from the ferriÃ¨re 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:20.370
 to solidify one checks at this point 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.930
 all the same we are well placed and 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.400
 sewing correspond to the closures 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.980
 to do mobile it remains to do 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.780
 finishes 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.860
 we're going to poke in the footsteps of 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.320
 old stitching to reform the shape 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.580
 from the brague it by taking all the 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:43.940
 thicknesses at that point which point 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:50.510
 strategic to solidify his pants 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.510
 we're going to stitch like these are like that 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.790
 and we end not fixed the belt of the 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.790
 fly 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.130
 many all the styles properly there 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.130
 will have to watch and karine 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.569
 here you know now when we 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.569
 exchange and zipper
