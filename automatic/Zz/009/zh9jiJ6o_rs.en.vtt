00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
something weird I have 202 points so the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.609 
something weird I have 202 points so the
first<00:00:26.699> 200<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.539> flag<00:00:27.840> capture<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
first 200 is the flag capture and the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.140 
first 200 is the flag capture and the
other<00:00:28.740> two<00:00:28.980> comes<00:00:29.250> from<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.580> hit<00:00:29.789> markers

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
other two comes from to hit markers

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.299 
other two comes from to hit markers
which<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.869> got<00:00:31.080> with<00:00:31.260> one<00:00:31.529> tracer<00:00:31.920> gun<00:00:32.099> so

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
which I got with one tracer gun so

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.549 
which I got with one tracer gun so
basically<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.790> shot<00:00:33.120> one<00:00:33.149> tracer<00:00:33.750> dart<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.140> it

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
basically I shot one tracer dart and it

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.920 
basically I shot one tracer dart and it
passed<00:00:34.770> by<00:00:34.890> through<00:00:35.190> two<00:00:35.730> people<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.750> it's

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
passed by through two people so it's

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.410 
passed by through two people so it's
amazing<00:00:37.350> right<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.579> might<00:00:38.790> be<00:00:38.850> one<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
amazing right and I might be one of the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.299 
amazing right and I might be one of the
first<00:00:39.690> people<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.200> youtube<00:00:40.649> or<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> world

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
first people on youtube or in the world

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.220 
first people on youtube or in the world
to<00:00:41.520> prove<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.790> collaterals<00:00:42.450> are<00:00:42.629> possible

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
to prove that collaterals are possible

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.440 
to prove that collaterals are possible
but<00:00:43.410> however<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.489> did<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> tracer

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
but however I did this with the tracer

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.450 
but however I did this with the tracer
duck<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.809> not<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> bullet<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:46.950> brings<00:00:47.250> up

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
duck and not a bullet so that brings up

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.069 
duck and not a bullet so that brings up
the<00:00:47.579> question<00:00:47.610> what<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.239> collaterals<00:00:48.899> were

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
the question what if collaterals were

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.779 
the question what if collaterals were
possible<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:49.770> bullets<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.250> battlefield

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
possible with bullets in battlefield

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.639 
possible with bullets in battlefield
play4free<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> little<00:00:52.170> bit<00:00:52.379> more

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
play4free to be a little bit more

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.189 
play4free to be a little bit more
simplistic<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.940> define<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.449> collateral<00:00:55.020> is

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
simplistic and to define a collateral is

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.290 
simplistic and to define a collateral is
the<00:00:55.320> name<00:00:55.500> given<00:00:55.530> when<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.460> kill<00:00:56.699> 20<00:00:57.059> or<00:00:57.270> more

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
the name given when you kill 20 or more

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.330 
the name given when you kill 20 or more
enemies<00:00:57.870> with<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.230> bullet<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.190> one

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
enemies with one bullet so that one

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.099 
enemies with one bullet so that one
bullet<00:00:59.520> passes<00:00:59.940> by<00:01:00.090> both<00:01:00.300> or<00:01:00.539> more<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.809> those

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
bullet passes by both or more of those

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.049 
bullet passes by both or more of those
enemies<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.800> kills<00:01:02.070> them<00:01:02.190> or<00:01:02.640> at<00:01:02.730> least<00:01:02.910> in

enemies and kills them or at least in
this<00:01:03.180> case<00:01:03.420> injures<00:01:03.840> them<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.559> battlefield

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
this case injures them so battlefield

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.350 
this case injures them so battlefield
play4free<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> game<00:01:05.760> where<00:01:05.909> your<00:01:06.060> enemy

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
play4free is a game where your enemy

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.600 
play4free is a game where your enemy
absorbs<00:01:06.900> every<00:01:07.229> single<00:01:07.560> bullet<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.040> rots<00:01:08.340> in

absorbs every single bullet and rots in

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.190 
absorbs every single bullet and rots in
the<00:01:08.760> ground<00:01:09.000> with<00:01:09.240> them<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.540> more<00:01:10.049> modern

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the ground with them in more modern

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.719 
the ground with them in more modern
first-person<00:01:10.860> shooters<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.340> bullet<00:01:11.610> will

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
first-person shooters a bullet will

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.490 
first-person shooters a bullet will
travel<00:01:11.760> through<00:01:12.270> an<00:01:12.360> enemy<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.840> keep<00:01:13.380> on

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
travel through an enemy and keep on

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.050 
travel through an enemy and keep on
going<00:01:13.799> depending<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.340> its<00:01:14.460> velocity<00:01:14.729> of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
going depending on its velocity of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.550 
going depending on its velocity of
course<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:15.930> why<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> lot<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.470> games

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
course so this is why a lot of the games

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.320 
course so this is why a lot of the games
like<00:01:16.799> battlefield<00:01:17.220> 3<00:01:17.400> or<00:01:17.549> metal<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:18.119> or<00:01:18.299> even

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
like battlefield 3 or metal on or even

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.270 
like battlefield 3 or metal on or even
call<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.780> duty<00:01:19.020> will<00:01:19.170> show<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.950> bullets

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
call of duty will show the bullets

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.039 
call of duty will show the bullets
penetrating<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.030> enemy<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:21.810> hitting

penetrating the enemy and then hitting

the<00:01:22.259> wall<00:01:22.439> behind<00:01:22.650> him<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.580> I'm<00:01:23.700> battlefield

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the wall behind him so I'm battlefield

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.429 
the wall behind him so I'm battlefield
play4free<00:01:24.210> that's<00:01:24.780> not<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> case<00:01:25.229> because

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
play4free that's not the case because

of<00:02:05.700> collaterals<00:02:06.390> do<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.960> think<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.469> it

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
of collaterals do you think that it

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.930 
of collaterals do you think that it
would<00:02:07.740> be<00:02:07.860> cool<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.129> have<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> system<00:02:08.729> like<00:02:08.879> this

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
would be cool to have a system like this

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.820 
would be cool to have a system like this
in<00:02:09.270> battlefield<00:02:09.690> play4free<00:02:09.780> or<00:02:10.349> do<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.770> think

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
in battlefield play4free or do you think

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.600 
in battlefield play4free or do you think
it<00:02:11.039> would<00:02:11.099> be<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.550> would<00:02:11.610> make<00:02:12.000> engagement

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
it would be it would make engagement

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.760 
it would be it would make engagement
a<00:02:12.640> bit<00:02:12.790> less<00:02:13.000> stable<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:13.720> know<00:02:13.750> with<00:02:14.440> assault

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
a bit less stable you know with assault

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.710 
a bit less stable you know with assault
rifles<00:02:14.830> SMGs<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.850> LMGs<00:02:16.240> would<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.600> be

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
rifles SMGs and LMGs would it be

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.720 
rifles SMGs and LMGs would it be
overpowered<00:02:17.470> if<00:02:17.710> they<00:02:17.950> were<00:02:18.040> collateral<00:02:18.340> if

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
overpowered if they were collateral if

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.390 
overpowered if they were collateral if
both<00:02:19.720> could<00:02:19.990> penetrate<00:02:20.260> through<00:02:20.650> two<00:02:21.040> bodies

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
both could penetrate through two bodies

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.430 
both could penetrate through two bodies
or<00:02:21.790> do<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.000> think<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.240> would<00:02:22.300> be<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:23.230> should<00:02:23.410> be

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
or do you think it would be it should be

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.080 
or do you think it would be it should be
reserved<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.040> sniper<00:02:24.340> rifles<00:02:24.730> with<00:02:24.910> high

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
reserved to sniper rifles with high

reserved to sniper rifles with high
velocities<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:26.110> know<00:02:26.230> either<00:02:26.440> way<00:02:26.680> I

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
velocities you know either way I

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.260 
velocities you know either way I
personally<00:02:27.280> think<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.550> would<00:02:27.640> be<00:02:27.760> cool<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.060> at

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
personally think it would be cool to at

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.000 
personally think it would be cool to at
least<00:02:28.420> be<00:02:28.720> activated<00:02:29.230> what<00:02:29.350> an<00:02:29.440> enemy<00:02:29.770> dies

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
least be activated what an enemy dies

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.890 
least be activated what an enemy dies
because<00:02:30.700> sometimes<00:02:31.270> there<00:02:31.510> could<00:02:31.630> be<00:02:31.690> like

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
because sometimes there could be like

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.170 
because sometimes there could be like
two<00:02:32.080> enemies<00:02:32.440> 11<00:02:33.430> right<00:02:33.610> behind<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:33.970> first

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
two enemies 11 right behind the first

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.640 
two enemies 11 right behind the first
one<00:02:34.420> as<00:02:34.750> soon<00:02:34.930> as<00:02:35.110> you're<00:02:35.230> done<00:02:35.260> with<00:02:35.590> the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
one as soon as you're done with the

one as soon as you're done with the
first<00:02:35.830> one<00:02:36.070> he's<00:02:36.280> having<00:02:36.460> his<00:02:36.730> death

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
first one he's having his death

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.300 
first one he's having his death
animation<00:02:37.510> but<00:02:38.140> you're<00:02:38.470> still<00:02:38.680> firing<00:02:39.010> and

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
animation but you're still firing and

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.740 
animation but you're still firing and
then<00:02:39.400> he<00:02:39.550> eats<00:02:39.730> up<00:02:39.910> all<00:02:40.030> your<00:02:40.150> bullets<00:02:40.420> and

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
then he eats up all your bullets and

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.360 
then he eats up all your bullets and
does<00:02:40.930> not<00:02:41.050> inflict<00:02:41.410> any<00:02:41.620> damage<00:02:41.709> onto<00:02:42.190> the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
does not inflict any damage onto the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.550 
does not inflict any damage onto the
other<00:02:42.550> guy<00:02:42.730> behind<00:02:43.030> him<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.360> then<00:02:43.810> he<00:02:44.050> results

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
other guy behind him and then he results

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.140 
other guy behind him and then he results
by<00:02:44.830> killing<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.459> if<00:02:45.700> that<00:02:45.760> makes<00:02:46.060> any

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
by killing you and if that makes any

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.570 
by killing you and if that makes any
sense<00:02:46.450> it's<00:02:47.140> like<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.530> sort<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:47.950> meat<00:02:48.250> shield

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
sense it's like a sort of meat shield

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.980 
sense it's like a sort of meat shield
that<00:02:48.940> should<00:02:49.150> not<00:02:49.270> be<00:02:49.450> there<00:02:49.480> because<00:02:49.780> the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
that should not be there because the

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.080 
that should not be there because the
guys<00:02:50.110> already<00:02:50.260> dead<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.370> also<00:02:51.640> don't<00:02:51.940> think

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
guys already dead so I also don't think

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.729 
guys already dead so I also don't think
that<00:02:52.360> this<00:02:52.540> could<00:02:52.600> ever<00:02:52.870> be<00:02:53.050> possible<00:02:53.260> because

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
that this could ever be possible because

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.830 
that this could ever be possible because
this<00:02:54.160> game<00:02:54.310> runs<00:02:54.580> on<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.730> very<00:02:55.000> old<00:02:55.180> engine<00:02:55.630> and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
this game runs on a very old engine and

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.110 
this game runs on a very old engine and
without<00:02:56.440> like<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.709> nuclear<00:02:57.010> updates<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.820> don't

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
without like a nuclear updates I don't

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.610 
without like a nuclear updates I don't
think<00:02:58.180> would<00:02:58.420> be<00:02:58.570> really<00:02:58.600> possible<00:02:59.050> but<00:02:59.530> I'm

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
think would be really possible but I'm

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.290 
think would be really possible but I'm
not<00:02:59.770> a<00:02:59.800> hundred<00:02:59.980> percent<00:03:00.160> sure<00:03:00.489> I'd<00:03:00.880> certain

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
not a hundred percent sure I'd certain

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.500 
not a hundred percent sure I'd certain
on<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:01.870> should<00:03:02.320> make<00:03:02.470> more<00:03:02.620> research<00:03:03.010> and

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
on that I should make more research and

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.180 
on that I should make more research and
you<00:03:04.510> know<00:03:04.630> see<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.900> battlefield<00:03:05.350> two<00:03:05.709> had<00:03:05.980> some

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
you know see a battlefield two had some

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.310 
you know see a battlefield two had some
sort<00:03:06.250> of<00:03:06.489> way<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.390> do<00:03:07.780> something<00:03:08.170> like<00:03:08.260> that

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
sort of way to do something like that

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.170 
sort of way to do something like that
but<00:03:08.770> it<00:03:08.920> would<00:03:09.340> be<00:03:09.459> cool<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.730> see<00:03:09.850> if<00:03:10.150> that

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
but it would be cool to see if that

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.570 
but it would be cool to see if that
would<00:03:10.420> be<00:03:10.450> possible<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:12.250> know<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.400> just

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
would be possible and you know I just

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.190 
would be possible and you know I just
thought<00:03:12.820> a<00:03:12.880> bit<00:03:13.060> right<00:03:13.239> now<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.690> would<00:03:13.840> be<00:03:13.959> cool

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
thought a bit right now it would be cool

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.130 
thought a bit right now it would be cool
if<00:03:14.230> at<00:03:14.950> least<00:03:15.220> if<00:03:15.580> you're<00:03:16.090> let's<00:03:16.900> say<00:03:16.989> you're

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
if at least if you're let's say you're

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.770 
if at least if you're let's say you're
using<00:03:17.320> an<00:03:17.530> AK<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.280> it's<00:03:18.400> dealing<00:03:18.790> 20<00:03:19.600> damage

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
using an AK and it's dealing 20 damage

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.350 
using an AK and it's dealing 20 damage
and<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.739> kills<00:03:20.950> which<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.700> bullets<00:03:21.970> dealing

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
and it kills which the bullets dealing

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.390 
and it kills which the bullets dealing
20<00:03:22.570> 20<00:03:23.290> damage<00:03:23.440> on<00:03:23.680> one<00:03:23.799> guy<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.250> guy

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
20 20 damage on one guy and the guy

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.070 
20 20 damage on one guy and the guy
behind<00:03:24.430> him<00:03:24.790> it<00:03:25.000> hits<00:03:25.180> him<00:03:25.360> it<00:03:25.540> should<00:03:25.810> at

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
behind him it hits him it should at

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.780 
behind him it hits him it should at
least<00:03:26.230> deal<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:27.010> would<00:03:27.160> be<00:03:27.280> cool<00:03:27.430> if<00:03:27.459> it<00:03:27.640> could

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
least deal it would be cool if it could

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.820 
least deal it would be cool if it could
be<00:03:27.880> like<00:03:28.030> half<00:03:28.330> of<00:03:28.450> them<00:03:28.600> until<00:03:28.750> 10<00:03:29.049> damage<00:03:29.200> you

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
be like half of them until 10 damage you

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.590 
be like half of them until 10 damage you
know<00:03:29.950> since<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.340> loses<00:03:30.670> its<00:03:30.820> velocity<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.480> its

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
know since it loses its velocity and its

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.199 
know since it loses its velocity and its
impact<00:03:31.989> on<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.680> target<00:03:33.010> so<00:03:33.640> I<00:03:33.670> want<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.120> know

impact on the target so I want to know

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.880 
impact on the target so I want to know
