now<00:01:21.340> you<00:01:21.400> bought<00:01:21.700> about<00:01:21.880> 3<00:01:22.180> G's<00:01:25.200> pretty<00:01:26.200> tough

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
now you bought about 3 G's pretty tough

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.680 
now you bought about 3 G's pretty tough
yeah<00:01:26.860> to<00:01:27.250> get<00:01:27.369> armor<00:01:27.640> so<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:31.240> do<00:01:31.390> it<00:01:31.479> great

though<00:01:31.869> so<00:01:32.340> supersonic<00:01:33.340> I'm<00:01:33.729> not<00:01:33.909> going<00:01:34.060> to

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
though so supersonic I'm not going to

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.960 
though so supersonic I'm not going to
lie<00:01:34.240> it's<00:01:34.540> a<00:01:34.600> little<00:01:34.990> anticlimactic<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.790> is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
lie it's a little anticlimactic this is

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.249 
lie it's a little anticlimactic this is
it<00:01:37.090> but<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:37.509> way<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.659> could<00:01:37.899> stay<00:01:38.080> you've
