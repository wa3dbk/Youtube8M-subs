00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
also you can fit right at the very very

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.360 
also you can fit right at the very very
bottom<00:03:17.940> there<00:03:18.500> in<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.620> number<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:19.920> colors<00:03:20.160> if

again<00:03:24.180> it's<00:03:24.390> difficult<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.780> print<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:25.049> lot<00:03:25.200> of

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
again it's difficult to print a lot of

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.960 
again it's difficult to print a lot of
many<00:03:25.470> people<00:03:25.769> but<00:03:26.190> have<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.400> facilities<00:03:26.850> to

be able to get you know get in there and
get<00:03:28.590> printing<00:03:29.010> but<00:03:29.190> you're<00:03:29.310> something<00:03:29.459> we<00:03:29.670> can

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
get printing but you're something we can

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.360 
get printing but you're something we can
do<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.630> my<00:03:31.410> favorite<00:03:31.769> part<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:31.980> this<00:03:32.070> movie<00:03:32.310> as

well<00:03:32.400> is<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.940> chalkboard<00:03:33.540> section<00:03:33.930> here<00:03:34.160> it's

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
well is the chalkboard section here it's

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.710 
well is the chalkboard section here it's
difficult<00:03:35.700> making<00:03:35.970> out<00:03:36.090> look<00:03:36.299> it's<00:03:36.660> just

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
difficult making out look it's just

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.660 
difficult making out look it's just
there<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.320> could<00:03:37.440> write<00:03:37.560> on<00:03:37.709> two<00:03:38.310> sugars

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
there so you could write on two sugars

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.280 
there so you could write on two sugars
or<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.120> tick<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:39.720> want<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.900> on<00:03:39.959> some<00:03:40.079> filling
