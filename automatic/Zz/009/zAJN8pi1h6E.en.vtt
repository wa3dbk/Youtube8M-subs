00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
impressive I think it is a little bit

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:52.280 
impressive I think it is a little bit
more

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.640 

birth<00:02:53.290> first<00:02:54.160> trust<00:02:54.430> now<00:02:54.790> there<00:02:55.030> will<00:02:55.180> be

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
birth first trust now there will be

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:04.890 
birth first trust now there will be
other

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.400 

okay<00:03:05.900> so<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.650> key<00:03:06.890> to<00:03:07.070> tiramisu<00:03:07.670> is<00:03:08.290> having<00:03:09.290> an

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
okay so the key to tiramisu is having an

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.290 
okay so the key to tiramisu is having an
eggbeater<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:10.670> since<00:03:11.350> we<00:03:12.350> weren't<00:03:12.530> able<00:03:12.680> to

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
eggbeater and since we weren't able to

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.210 
eggbeater and since we weren't able to
find<00:03:14.300> one<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.750> real<00:03:14.780> one<00:03:15.020> I<00:03:15.230> had<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.740> have<00:03:15.950> one

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
find one a real one I had to have one

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.770 
find one a real one I had to have one
and<00:03:16.550> so<00:03:17.360> my<00:03:17.780> hack<00:03:18.050> involved<00:03:19.090> become<00:03:20.090> combining

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
and so my hack involved become combining

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.420 
and so my hack involved become combining
of<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:21.080> drill<00:03:21.410> bit<00:03:21.650> with<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.400> beater<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.170> some

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
of a drill bit with a beater and some

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.250 
of a drill bit with a beater and some
electrical<00:03:25.430> tape<00:03:25.460> and<00:03:25.850> so<00:03:26.120> now<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.630> really

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
electrical tape and so now the really

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.750 
electrical tape and so now the really
interesting<00:03:27.470> thing<00:03:27.980> is<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.310> remove<00:03:28.550> the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
interesting thing is to remove the

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.700 
interesting thing is to remove the
electrical<00:03:29.210> tape<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:30.260> see<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.680> what

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
electrical tape and to see to what

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.620 
electrical tape and to see to what
extent<00:03:31.160> we've<00:03:31.400> damaged<00:03:31.850> either<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.450> egg

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
extent we've damaged either the egg

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.370 
extent we've damaged either the egg
beater<00:03:32.900> or<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.390> drill<00:03:35.660> button<00:03:36.050> so<00:03:36.260> I'm

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
beater or the the drill button so I'm

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.900 
beater or the the drill button so I'm
going<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.590> phone<00:03:37.190> an<00:03:37.340> incision<00:03:37.610> here

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
going to phone an incision here

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.050 
going to phone an incision here
hopefully<00:03:38.210> not<00:03:38.390> myself<00:03:39.460> to<00:03:40.460> try<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:40.820> remove

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
hopefully not myself to try and remove

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.330 
hopefully not myself to try and remove
the<00:03:41.300> electrical<00:03:41.750> tape<00:03:41.890> perhaps<00:03:42.890> it<00:03:43.100> will<00:03:43.160> be

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
the electrical tape perhaps it will be

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.480 
the electrical tape perhaps it will be
blunt<00:03:43.700> no<00:03:44.210> dear<00:03:44.570> yeah<00:03:44.930> unfortunately<00:03:45.490> fiction

worked extremely well because you'll see
in<00:03:53.660> other<00:03:53.840> videos<00:03:55.330> we<00:03:56.330> were<00:03:56.480> actually<00:03:56.660> able<00:03:56.930> to

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
in other videos we were actually able to

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.360 
in other videos we were actually able to
use<00:03:57.680> a<00:03:57.920> full<00:03:58.700> power<00:03:59.150> drill<00:03:59.570> bit<00:03:59.810> on<00:03:59.960> this<00:04:01.540> to

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
use a full power drill bit on this to

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.960 
use a full power drill bit on this to
get

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
get

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.720 
get
total<00:04:06.690> mixing<00:04:07.080> of<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.320> egg<00:04:07.500> whites<00:04:07.800> and<00:04:08.130> the

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730

extremely dangerous and you shouldn't
try<00:04:19.260> this<00:04:19.320> at<00:04:19.560> home<00:04:19.590> because<00:04:19.980> I<00:04:20.340> am<00:04:21.060> working

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
try this at home because I am working

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.370 
try this at home because I am working
with<00:04:21.780> a<00:04:21.900> knife<00:04:22.170> and<00:04:23.780> leave<00:04:24.780> those<00:04:24.960> things<00:04:25.200> and

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
with a knife and leave those things and

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.150 
with a knife and leave those things and
badly<00:04:25.980> so<00:04:26.250> we<00:04:26.370> may<00:04:26.550> actually<00:04:27.240> have<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:28.070> here<00:04:29.070> we

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
badly so we may actually have a here we

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.840 
badly so we may actually have a here we
go<00:04:30.290> okay<00:04:31.290> so<00:04:31.770> as<00:04:32.010> we<00:04:32.160> can<00:04:32.280> see<00:04:32.340> all<00:04:32.580> those<00:04:32.700> the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
go okay so as we can see all those the

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.290 
go okay so as we can see all those the
drill<00:04:33.090> bit<00:04:33.270> survived<00:04:33.660> quite<00:04:34.050> well<00:04:35.300> we've

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
drill bit survived quite well we've

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.670 
drill bit survived quite well we've
definitely<00:04:36.570> created<00:04:37.730> somewhat<00:04:38.730> of<00:04:39.000> a<00:04:39.680> twist

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
definitely created somewhat of a twist

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.530 
definitely created somewhat of a twist
in<00:04:41.040> our<00:04:41.460> very<00:04:41.940> high<00:04:42.330> tech<00:04:42.660> and<00:04:44.240> expensive<00:04:45.240> egg

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
in our very high tech and expensive egg
