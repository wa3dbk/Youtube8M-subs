00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
bore you with all the details but

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.050 
bore you with all the details but
there's<00:02:10.800> just<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.160> much<00:02:11.310> leading<00:02:11.610> up<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.849> that

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
there's just so much leading up to that

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.630 
there's just so much leading up to that
moment

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
moment

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.380 
moment
that<00:02:12.819> you<00:02:13.210> know<00:02:13.330> that<00:02:13.780> we<00:02:13.930> were<00:02:14.020> able<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.319> have

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
that you know that we were able to have

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.270 
that you know that we were able to have
and<00:02:16.390> then<00:02:16.569> uh<00:02:16.600> you<00:02:17.260> know<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.650> guess<00:02:17.860> it's<00:02:18.069> almost

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
and then uh you know I guess it's almost

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.160 
and then uh you know I guess it's almost
fitting<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:18.970> would<00:02:19.209> that<00:02:19.660> he<00:02:19.810> would<00:02:19.990> do

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
fitting that I would that he would do

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.250 
fitting that I would that he would do
that<00:02:20.880> because<00:02:21.880> that's<00:02:22.180> what<00:02:22.360> he's<00:02:22.510> done<00:02:22.750> time

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
that because that's what he's done time

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.870 
that because that's what he's done time
and<00:02:23.290> time<00:02:23.500> again<00:02:23.620> that's<00:02:24.130> just<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.370> nature<00:02:24.730> of

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
and time again that's just the nature of

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.870 
and time again that's just the nature of
the<00:02:25.060> beast<00:02:25.240> I<00:02:25.540> guess<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:27.520> know<00:02:27.640> we'll

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
the beast I guess and you know we'll

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.370 
the beast I guess and you know we'll
have<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.030> have<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.510> see<00:02:28.630> how<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:28.750> plays<00:02:28.930> out<00:02:29.170> now

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
have to have to see how it plays out now

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.530 
have to have to see how it plays out now
I'm<00:02:29.920> guessing<00:02:30.280> we<00:02:30.370> can<00:02:30.580> see<00:02:30.730> we're<00:02:31.450> gonna
