of the rare loot you'll hope to get but
there<00:00:31.679> still<00:00:31.920> seems<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.279> be<00:00:32.369> some<00:00:32.489> confusion

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
there still seems to be some confusion

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.150 
there still seems to be some confusion
as<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.390> what<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> raid<00:00:33.840> actually<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.860> how<00:00:35.010> it

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
as to what a raid actually is and how it

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.950 
as to what a raid actually is and how it
differs<00:00:35.460> from<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.730> strike<00:00:35.969> mission<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.719> allow

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
differs from a strike mission so allow

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.470 
differs from a strike mission so allow
me<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.230> explain<00:00:37.730> first<00:00:38.730> off<00:00:38.910> let<00:00:39.210> me<00:00:39.239> clarify

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
me to explain first off let me clarify

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.720 
me to explain first off let me clarify
something<00:00:39.690> strike<00:00:40.590> missions<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.160> raids<00:00:41.520> are

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
something strike missions and raids are

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.970 
something strike missions and raids are
not<00:00:42.030> one<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.480> same<00:00:42.570> what<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.559> experienced

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
not one in the same what we experienced

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.680 
not one in the same what we experienced
in<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> beta<00:00:44.280> was<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> strike<00:00:44.940> mission<00:00:45.210> not<00:00:45.629> a

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
in the beta was a strike mission not a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.209 
in the beta was a strike mission not a
raid<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.170> know<00:00:46.620> they're<00:00:46.829> completely<00:00:47.100> different

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
raid I know they're completely different

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.889 
raid I know they're completely different
games<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.149> use<00:00:48.180> water<00:00:48.480> Warcraft

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
games but I like to use water Warcraft

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.479 
games but I like to use water Warcraft
as<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.079> comparison<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.739> structure<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.399> is

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
as a comparison as a structure in it is

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.920 
as a comparison as a structure in it is
a<00:00:50.520> great<00:00:50.610> way<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.120> illustrate<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.629> difference

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
a great way to illustrate the difference

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.459 
a great way to illustrate the difference
in<00:00:52.110> well<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.340> have<00:00:53.489> instances<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.239> rates<00:00:54.780> an

in well you have instances and rates an

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.139 
in well you have instances and rates an
instance<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.250> small-scale<00:00:56.579> dungeon

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149

small team in destiny this would be a
