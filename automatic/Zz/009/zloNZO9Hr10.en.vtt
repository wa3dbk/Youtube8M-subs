going to do it like this I'm gonna

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.020 
going to do it like this I'm gonna
search<00:04:29.560> for<00:04:29.590> ADK<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:31.780> I<00:04:32.140> don't<00:04:32.260> find<00:04:32.500> it<00:04:32.680> there

let's open file explorer and search for

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.430 
let's open file explorer and search for
ADK

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.860 

so<00:04:44.440> after<00:04:44.860> you've<00:04:45.040> located<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:46.360> folder<00:04:46.840> that

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
so after you've located the folder that

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.490 
so after you've located the folder that
contains<00:04:47.229> the<00:04:47.800> Windows<00:04:48.310> ADK<00:04:48.850> tools<00:04:49.500> locate

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
contains the Windows ADK tools locate

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.590 
contains the Windows ADK tools locate
the<00:04:50.740> deployment<00:04:51.430> and<00:04:51.640> imaging<00:04:52.300> tools

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
the deployment and imaging tools

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.130 
the deployment and imaging tools
environment<00:04:53.410> right<00:04:54.400> click<00:04:54.790> it<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:55.210> click<00:04:55.270> run

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
environment right click it and click run

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.490 
environment right click it and click run
as<00:04:56.440> administrator<00:04:56.610> a<00:04:58.020> command<00:04:59.020> prompt<00:04:59.410> is

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
as administrator a command prompt is

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.070 
as administrator a command prompt is
going<00:04:59.680> to<00:04:59.740> open<00:05:00.390> now<00:05:01.390> I'm<00:05:01.540> going<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.750> use<00:05:01.930> an

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
going to open now I'm going to use an

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.350 
going to open now I'm going to use an
example<00:05:02.440> that<00:05:02.770> I<00:05:02.830> did<00:05:02.919> before<00:05:03.790> I<00:05:03.820> recorded

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
example that I did before I recorded

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.469 
example that I did before I recorded
this<00:05:04.540> so<00:05:05.080> my<00:05:05.380> e<00:05:05.770> and<00:05:06.250> f<00:05:06.460> commands<00:05:07.090> are<00:05:07.270> going<00:05:07.419> to

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
this so my e and f commands are going to

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:08.909 
this so my e and f commands are going to
be<00:05:07.600> a<00:05:07.630> little<00:05:07.870> different<00:05:08.440> than<00:05:08.620> what<00:05:08.740> you<00:05:08.890> just

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
be a little different than what you just

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.850 
be a little different than what you just
saw<00:05:09.400> in<00:05:09.760> the<00:05:10.660> example<00:05:10.870> that<00:05:11.260> I<00:05:11.380> just<00:05:11.620> built

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
saw in the example that I just built

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.090 
saw in the example that I just built
however<00:05:12.700> you'll<00:05:13.300> apply<00:05:13.600> something<00:05:14.100> different

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
however you'll apply something different

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.840 
however you'll apply something different
anyway<00:05:15.310> here's<00:05:16.150> what<00:05:16.300> it<00:05:16.419> looks<00:05:16.630> like<00:05:17.850> the

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
anyway here's what it looks like the

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.710 
anyway here's what it looks like the
command<00:05:19.180> prompt<00:05:19.450> comes<00:05:19.750> up<00:05:19.900> like<00:05:20.110> this<00:05:21.720> notice

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
command prompt comes up like this notice

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.800 
command prompt comes up like this notice
you've<00:05:22.930> got<00:05:24.120> your<00:05:25.120> path

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
you've got your path
