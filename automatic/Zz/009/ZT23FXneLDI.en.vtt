 we distrust four different colors of luis guil we started with this 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.610
 technique and we can obviate different in each autochthonous case 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.030
 in the same line as when they reach the age they have 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.390
 since then I really have 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.390
 so the wind at sea 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.669
 could not get out of this situation is that we have 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.999
