 this case should not exceed 10 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.959
 centimeters and casting is carried out 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.850
 middle layers of the reservoir spinning fishing 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.070
 also brings great fruit

 will exceed 8 degrees it still holds 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.860
 at a deep enough depth from 2 to 6 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.720
 meters 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.450
 most often this fish can be found in 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.240
 brooks and places with snags where the cross section 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.070
 in the river slows in April

 millimeters roach can be found 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.820
 almost the entire area of ​​the reservoir she 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.239
 still actively fed keep on 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.489
 a depth of no more than 2 meters at the end of the month 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.709
 you can do without bait but

 which has already reached 8 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.330
 degrees and the rising moon will create 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.390
 excellent conditions for effective
