00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.640
 you imagine that for example trevor of 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.920
 grand theft auto 5 farted and 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.760
 suddenly the smell of that dog came out 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.530
 by the command of your console and I know that 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.320
 it's a pretty unpleasant example but 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.250
 is that this could have happened with the 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.100
 new generation of consoles 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.199
 specifically with microsoft and its xbox 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.750
 one attentive for both and which ones were going to 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.150
 be those possibilities that I was going to have 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.550
 the new command of xbox one and why the 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.010
 smells leaving one of it 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.200
 see what a curious fact about the command of 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.510
 xbox one you already know that is the command that 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.790
 best compliments is receiving the 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.710
 true in this annexation if we compare it 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.500
 with the playstation 4 but good for 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.480
 likes the colors and for likes too 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.640
 the smells or at least that's what 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.860
 he intended microsoft and is that attentive 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.680
 because the command of xbox one could have 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.660
 had emitters of smell and images like 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.579
 you are listening to it the truth is that 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.010
 with this microsoft yes that would have 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.440
 really innovated and now yes yes 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.180
 I would have left something that impacts nintendo 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.460
 on the ground attentive to what has 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.000
 revealed the general manager of accessory 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.590
 of xbox that has taught us some of 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.390
 the ideas that they implemented in the 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.150
 first prototypes of the new command of 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.100
 xbox john being some of them the 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.229
 really quite amazing as you 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.290
 I can say they introduced issuers of 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.479
 smell for example they were going to allow us to 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.240
 by which according to walk we are for a 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.130
 jungle to give you an idea 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.930
 we could smell the trees and the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.580
 plants another of the things that you 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.500
 they contemplated for this new command was 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.140
 a projector that would emit images in 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.110
 our environment in much the same way as 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.179
 the one that we saw in that one illuminated I do not know if 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.950
 you remember that project and that 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.840
 also everyone thought he was going to 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.360
 appear on xbox one for you to do 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.039
 an idea the command of xbox one was going to 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.380
 project images and you will have a 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.080
 small image projector and also 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.990
 there were ideas like touch panels cameras 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.539
 and speakers on the xbox one control that 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.880
 yes after a series of testing tests 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.369
 with different people from the public 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.920
 all these ideas were discarded 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.989
 Microsoft chose to focus on what 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.880
 It is happening on television since 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.370
 they prefer that the players 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.160
 they say they are sexually 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.600
 immersed in the experience that happens 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.040
 in front of them of course it was 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.050
 awesome everything was 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.000
 preparing a microsoft for that new 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.100
 I send things the truth that some the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.710
 wait even preposterous 100 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.170
 millions of dollars cost all this 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.510
 let's say create the final command of 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.180
 xbox one is that they were made very many 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.650
 experiments and lots of tests but 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.140
 I can assure you that the new command of 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.560
 xbox one is amazing once 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.560
 you try
