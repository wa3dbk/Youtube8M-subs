hand<00:02:25.150> behind<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.480> neck<00:02:25.690> notice<00:02:26.020> how<00:02:26.140> high<00:02:26.290> my

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
hand behind the neck notice how high my

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.320 
hand behind the neck notice how high my
wrist<00:02:26.680> went<00:02:26.950> this<00:02:27.610> is<00:02:27.760> going<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:27.970> leave<00:02:28.150> more

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
wrist went this is going to leave more

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.260 
wrist went this is going to leave more
finger<00:02:28.780> in<00:02:29.280> front<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.460> neck<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.850> make<00:02:31.120> it

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
finger in front of the neck and make it

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.020 
finger in front of the neck and make it
easier<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:31.660> play<00:02:32.400> notice<00:02:33.400> what<00:02:33.550> when<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:33.790> went

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
easier to play notice what when I went

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.470 
easier to play notice what when I went
from<00:02:34.150> C<00:02:34.450> at<00:02:34.600> 9<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.990> G<00:02:35.610> my<00:02:36.610> third<00:02:36.880> finger<00:02:37.150> once

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
from C at 9 to G my third finger once

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.750 
from C at 9 to G my third finger once
again<00:02:37.780> stays<00:02:38.110> still

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.149 

and<00:02:40.849> then<00:02:41.569> as<00:02:41.780> chord<00:02:42.349> progressions<00:02:42.799> do<00:02:42.980> it's

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
and then as chord progressions do it's

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.610 
and then as chord progressions do it's
going<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.370> start<00:02:43.670> all<00:02:43.819> over<00:02:43.849> so<00:02:44.810> I'm<00:02:45.349> going<00:02:45.590> to

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
going to start all over so I'm going to

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.979 
going to start all over so I'm going to
go<00:02:45.739> back<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.010> D<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.519> my<00:02:46.730> third<00:02:47.000> finger<00:02:47.299> is<00:02:47.569> once

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
go back to D and my third finger is once

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.319 
go back to D and my third finger is once
again<00:02:48.140> going<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.530> stay<00:02:48.739> still<00:02:49.069> so<00:02:49.879> during<00:02:50.209> this

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
again going to stay still so during this

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.460 
again going to stay still so during this
whole<00:02:50.569> chord<00:02:50.930> progression<00:02:51.530> my<00:02:52.519> third<00:02:52.879> finger

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
whole chord progression my third finger

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.140 
whole chord progression my third finger
is<00:02:54.470> staying<00:02:54.799> right<00:02:54.860> where<00:02:55.220> it<00:02:55.340> is

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.390 

one<00:03:00.720> other<00:03:00.870> tip<00:03:01.140> about<00:03:01.440> playing<00:03:01.709> chords<00:03:02.220> is

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
one other tip about playing chords is

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.119 
one other tip about playing chords is
you<00:03:03.150> want<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.480> press<00:03:03.690> down<00:03:03.959> as<00:03:04.260> lightly<00:03:04.950> as<00:03:05.099> you

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
you want to press down as lightly as you

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.089 
you want to press down as lightly as you
can<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.849> still<00:03:06.030> get<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.269> clean<00:03:06.569> note<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.860> don't

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
can and still get a clean note so don't

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.270 
can and still get a clean note so don't
over<00:03:08.459> press<00:03:09.500> notice<00:03:10.500> what<00:03:10.650> happens<00:03:11.040> when<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.190> do

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
over press notice what happens when I do

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.580 
over press notice what happens when I do
that<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:12.750> can<00:03:12.900> actually<00:03:13.019> hear<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.290> pitch

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
that you can actually hear the pitch

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.089 
that you can actually hear the pitch
change<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:15.530> it's<00:03:16.530> making<00:03:16.709> me<00:03:16.830> work<00:03:17.069> really

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
change and it's making me work really

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.869 
change and it's making me work really
hard<00:03:19.010> so<00:03:20.010> what<00:03:20.190> we're<00:03:20.280> looking<00:03:20.310> for<00:03:20.580> is<00:03:20.760> the

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
hard so what we're looking for is the

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.820 
hard so what we're looking for is the
lightest<00:03:21.239> touch<00:03:21.390> possible<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.170> still<00:03:22.530> get<00:03:22.799> a

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
lightest touch possible and still get a

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:30.710 
lightest touch possible and still get a
clean<00:03:23.129> note<00:03:28.760> now<00:03:29.760> let's<00:03:30.030> take<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.269> look<00:03:30.480> at<00:03:30.629> the

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
clean note now let's take a look at the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:42.010 
clean note now let's take a look at the
strum<00:03:31.019> pattern

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.530 

so<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:42.980> strum<00:03:43.280> pattern<00:03:43.790> we<00:03:44.030> want<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.390> use

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
so the strum pattern we want to use

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.790 
so the strum pattern we want to use
today<00:03:44.870> is<00:03:45.080> down<00:03:45.920> down<00:03:46.670> up<00:03:46.970> down<00:03:47.030> down<00:03:47.800> and

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
today is down down up down down and

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.470 
today is down down up down down and
we're<00:03:49.100> just<00:03:49.190> demonstrating<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:50.000> over<00:03:50.210> the<00:03:50.330> D

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
we're just demonstrating it over the D

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.020 
we're just demonstrating it over the D
chord<00:03:50.750> for<00:03:51.020> now<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:52.400> if<00:03:52.460> you<00:03:52.550> make<00:03:52.700> your<00:03:52.850> D

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
chord for now so if you make your D

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
chord for now so if you make your D
chord<00:03:53.060> you're<00:03:53.450> going<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.600> start<00:03:53.870> with<00:03:53.990> the

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
chord you're going to start with the

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.410 
chord you're going to start with the
down<00:03:54.230> stroke<00:03:54.940> come<00:03:55.940> back<00:03:56.150> up<00:03:56.620> down<00:03:57.620> up<00:03:58.040> down

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
down stroke come back up down up down

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.160 
down stroke come back up down up down
come<00:03:59.420> back<00:03:59.630> up<00:03:59.870> down<00:04:01.420> that<00:04:02.420> might<00:04:02.660> sound<00:04:03.050> like

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
come back up down that might sound like

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.260 
come back up down that might sound like
I'm<00:04:03.350> overthinking<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:04.070> so<00:04:04.280> let's<00:04:04.820> talk<00:04:05.210> about

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
I'm overthinking it so let's talk about

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.060 
I'm overthinking it so let's talk about
it<00:04:05.540> this<00:04:05.780> way<00:04:06.020> I<00:04:06.230> want<00:04:06.530> you<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.710> stay<00:04:06.920> in

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
it this way I want you to stay in

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.890 
it this way I want you to stay in
constant<00:04:07.340> motion

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.390 

and<00:04:12.349> I<00:04:12.440> want<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.799> right<00:04:12.980> hand<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.430> move

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
and I want the right hand to move

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.500 
and I want the right hand to move
in<00:04:14.819> time<00:04:15.299> it's<00:04:15.629> like<00:04:15.780> it's<00:04:15.959> a<00:04:16.049> metronome<00:04:17.510> so

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
in time it's like it's a metronome so

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.110 
in time it's like it's a metronome so
it's<00:04:18.690> down-up<00:04:19.229> down-up<00:04:19.260> down-up<00:04:19.859> really<00:04:20.790> even

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.140 

you

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
you

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.060 
you
remember<00:04:26.930> we're<00:04:27.050> only<00:04:27.229> strumming<00:04:27.800> from<00:04:27.979> the

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
remember we're only strumming from the

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.000 
remember we're only strumming from the
fourth<00:04:28.400> string<00:04:28.760> down<00:04:29.110> down<00:04:30.110> down<00:04:30.710> up<00:04:30.740> down

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
fourth string down down down up down

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.450 
fourth string down down down up down
down

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
down

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.129 
down
down<00:04:32.580> down<00:04:33.120> up<00:04:33.150> down<00:04:33.419> down

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.709 

as<00:04:39.590> I<00:04:39.650> strum<00:04:40.249> my<00:04:40.669> wrist<00:04:40.909> is<00:04:41.060> turning<00:04:41.419> just<00:04:41.569> a

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:41.719 
as I strum my wrist is turning just a

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:43.510 
as I strum my wrist is turning just a
little<00:04:41.960> bit<00:04:42.110> it's<00:04:42.409> not<00:04:42.590> like<00:04:42.919> this<00:04:43.129> it's<00:04:43.370> not

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
little bit it's not like this it's not

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.969 
little bit it's not like this it's not
rigid<00:04:43.999> it's<00:04:44.780> turning<00:04:45.110> a<00:04:45.169> little<00:04:45.259> bit<00:04:45.409> the<00:04:45.740> pic

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
rigid it's turning a little bit the pic

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.550 
rigid it's turning a little bit the pic
is<00:04:46.009> turning<00:04:46.460> a<00:04:46.520> little<00:04:46.639> bit<00:04:46.789> I'm<00:04:47.360> brushing<00:04:48.229> the

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
is turning a little bit I'm brushing the

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.950 
is turning a little bit I'm brushing the
strings<00:04:48.919> I'm<00:04:49.129> not<00:04:49.810> colliding<00:04:50.810> with<00:04:50.930> the

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
strings I'm not colliding with the

00:04:50.960 --> 00:05:03.750 
strings I'm not colliding with the
strength

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:18.520 

now<00:05:04.760> let's<00:05:05.030> put<00:05:05.240> it<00:05:05.360> all<00:05:05.450> together

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.980 

so<00:05:19.370> adding<00:05:19.790> to<00:05:19.910> our<00:05:20.000> difficulty<00:05:20.630> we're<00:05:20.810> now

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
so adding to our difficulty we're now

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.510 
so adding to our difficulty we're now
doing<00:05:21.380> our<00:05:21.500> chord<00:05:21.770> changes

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
doing our chord changes

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.410 
doing our chord changes
keeping<00:05:23.240> that<00:05:23.360> pivot<00:05:23.720> finger<00:05:24.110> and<00:05:25.420> attempting

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
keeping that pivot finger and attempting

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:38.629 
keeping that pivot finger and attempting
to<00:05:26.510> do<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.750> strum<00:05:27.020> pattern<00:05:27.440> at<00:05:27.590> the<00:05:27.620> same<00:05:27.920> time

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.369 

the<00:05:39.180> thing<00:05:39.389> that's<00:05:39.509> difficult<00:05:40.020> here<00:05:40.199> is<00:05:40.259> you

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:40.379 
the thing that's difficult here is you

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:42.230 
the thing that's difficult here is you
have<00:05:40.590> to<00:05:40.800> wait<00:05:41.009> to<00:05:41.250> the<00:05:41.340> last<00:05:41.580> moment<00:05:41.879> to<00:05:42.120> do

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
have to wait to the last moment to do

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.939 
have to wait to the last moment to do
your<00:05:42.389> chord<00:05:42.720> change<00:05:43.080> so<00:05:43.680> if<00:05:43.800> you're

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949 
your chord change so if you're

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:45.710 
your chord change so if you're
attempting<00:05:44.430> to<00:05:44.460> do<00:05:44.699> this<00:05:44.970> and<00:05:45.240> you<00:05:45.389> haven't

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
attempting to do this and you haven't

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.320 
attempting to do this and you haven't
got<00:05:45.870> your<00:05:45.900> chord<00:05:46.289> changes<00:05:46.379> really<00:05:47.250> good<00:05:47.610> where

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
got your chord changes really good where

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.080 
got your chord changes really good where
it's<00:05:48.449> really<00:05:48.689> smooth<00:05:49.050> and<00:05:49.349> easy<00:05:50.039> to<00:05:50.250> do<00:05:50.430> you're

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
it's really smooth and easy to do you're

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.700 
it's really smooth and easy to do you're
not<00:05:51.330> going<00:05:51.509> to<00:05:51.569> be<00:05:51.689> able<00:05:51.750> to<00:05:51.930> continue<00:05:52.229> to<00:05:52.500> play

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
not going to be able to continue to play

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.779 
not going to be able to continue to play
in<00:05:52.979> time<00:05:53.449> so<00:05:54.449> to<00:05:54.509> play<00:05:54.750> in<00:05:54.900> time<00:05:55.169> I<00:05:55.669> have<00:05:56.669> to

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
in time so to play in time I have to

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.260 
in time so to play in time I have to
wait<00:05:56.969> for<00:05:57.659> this<00:05:57.780> down<00:05:58.110> stroke<00:05:58.560> is<00:05:59.030> done<00:06:00.030> before

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
wait for this down stroke is done before

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.939 
wait for this down stroke is done before
I<00:06:00.449> can<00:06:00.599> do<00:06:00.689> that<00:06:00.810> chord<00:06:01.110> change<00:06:01.169> I<00:06:01.439> can't<00:06:01.710> do<00:06:01.860> it

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
I can do that chord change I can't do it

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:07.200 
I can do that chord change I can't do it
before<00:06:02.280> I<00:06:02.310> can't<00:06:02.610> go

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.710 

I<00:06:07.240> need<00:06:08.080> to<00:06:08.200> wait

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:18.030 

wait

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.170
