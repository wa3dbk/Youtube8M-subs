sort of thing so battery life and bits
and<00:00:44.850> bobs<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.120> important<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.629> us<00:00:45.750> yeah<00:00:46.200> day<00:00:46.440> to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and bobs is important to us yeah day to

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.319 
and bobs is important to us yeah day to
day<00:00:46.770> we<00:00:47.010> use<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.820> use<00:00:47.850> cordless<00:00:48.660> tools

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
day we use we use cordless tools

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.670 
day we use we use cordless tools
probably<00:00:51.329> sixty<00:00:51.989> seventy<00:00:52.260> percent<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
probably sixty seventy percent of the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.549 
probably sixty seventy percent of the
day<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.059> for<00:00:54.059> us<00:00:54.120> batteries<00:00:54.780> holding<00:00:55.320> charge

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
day so for us batteries holding charge

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.040 
day so for us batteries holding charge
and<00:00:56.010> keeping<00:00:56.430> charge<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.149> very<00:00:57.660> important

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
and keeping charge is a very important

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.670 
and keeping charge is a very important
part<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:59.510> yeah<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:01.230> some

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
part of it yeah if we if we have some

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.590 
part of it yeah if we if we have some
problems<00:01:02.520> with<00:01:02.579> batteries<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.210> makes<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.480> big

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
problems with batteries it makes a big

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.200 
problems with batteries it makes a big
impact<00:01:03.629> because<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.350> some<00:01:04.710> tasty<00:01:05.700> take<00:01:05.909> time

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
impact because it's some tasty take time

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.719 
impact because it's some tasty take time
take<00:01:06.600> time<00:01:06.840> out<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.049> day<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> recharge<00:01:08.070> find

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
take time out the day to recharge find

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.680 
take time out the day to recharge find
other<00:01:08.939> batteries

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
other batteries

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.340 
other batteries
especially<00:01:11.690> if<00:01:11.750> we<00:01:11.810> up<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:12.080> down<00:01:12.200> the

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
especially if we up and down the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.830 
especially if we up and down the
scaffold<00:01:12.890> we<00:01:13.040> kind<00:01:13.220> of<00:01:13.280> up<00:01:13.910> and<00:01:14.150> back<00:01:14.390> into<00:01:14.630> the

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
scaffold we kind of up and back into the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.780 
scaffold we kind of up and back into the
van<00:01:15.020> it's<00:01:15.290> you<00:01:15.890> know<00:01:16.010> you<00:01:16.070> can<00:01:16.460> lose<00:01:16.610> a<00:01:16.640> lot

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
van it's you know you can lose a lot

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.820 
van it's you know you can lose a lot
time<00:01:17.000> well<00:01:17.360> I<00:01:17.390> hope<00:01:17.540> hopefully<00:01:17.870> with<00:01:18.200> this<00:01:18.350> I'm

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
time well I hope hopefully with this I'm

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.560 
time well I hope hopefully with this I'm
going<00:01:18.980> to<00:01:19.040> get<00:01:19.220> more<00:01:19.400> run<00:01:19.790> time<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.300> I<00:01:20.360> haven't

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
going to get more run time so I haven't

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.350 
going to get more run time so I haven't
got<00:01:20.660> be<00:01:20.950> charging<00:01:21.950> batteries<00:01:22.490> keeping<00:01:23.240> so

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
got be charging batteries keeping so

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.000 
got be charging batteries keeping so
many<00:01:23.450> batteries<00:01:23.870> with<00:01:24.050> me<00:01:24.230> sort<00:01:24.500> of<00:01:24.560> thing<00:01:24.710> so

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
many batteries with me sort of thing so

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.270 
many batteries with me sort of thing so
ideally<00:01:25.910> if<00:01:26.000> it<00:01:26.150> will<00:01:26.680> last<00:01:27.680> longer<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:28.160> give

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
ideally if it will last longer and give

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.640 
ideally if it will last longer and give
me<00:01:28.340> more<00:01:28.520> power<00:01:28.760> then<00:01:29.630> it'll<00:01:30.200> be<00:01:30.230> at<00:01:30.380> all<00:01:30.500> for

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
me more power then it'll be at all for

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:54.750 
me more power then it'll be at all for
me

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.850 

well<00:01:55.760> it<00:01:56.120> seems<00:01:56.390> sir<00:01:56.810> seems<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.409> be<00:01:57.500> powerful

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
well it seems sir seems to be powerful

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.020 
well it seems sir seems to be powerful
drill<00:01:58.280> quite<00:01:59.120> lightweight<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.950> then<00:02:01.580> yeah

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
drill quite lightweight and then yeah

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.810 
drill quite lightweight and then yeah
we'll<00:02:02.150> see<00:02:02.330> this<00:02:02.479> battery<00:02:03.340> last<00:02:04.340> Halloween

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
we'll see this battery last Halloween

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:16.030 
we'll see this battery last Halloween
Larson<00:02:05.180> lots<00:02:05.330> or<00:02:05.450> power<00:02:05.659> it<00:02:05.750> gives<00:02:05.869> us<00:02:06.050> really

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040
