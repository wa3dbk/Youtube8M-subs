entertainment<00:00:13.910> the<00:00:14.910> second<00:00:15.299> thing<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.750> a

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
entertainment the second thing is a

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.320 
entertainment the second thing is a
software<00:00:16.440> which<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.100> full<00:00:17.369> which<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.090> called

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
software which is full which is called

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.500 
software which is full which is called
play<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.810> Linux<00:00:19.340> which<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.580> at<00:00:20.760> full<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.210> manage

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
play on Linux which is at full to manage

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.779 
play on Linux which is at full to manage
different<00:00:21.720> version<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.410> wine<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.220> different

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
different version of wine and different

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.019 
different version of wine and different
configuration<00:00:25.160> mostly<00:00:26.160> for<00:00:26.369> game<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.849> play

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
configuration mostly for game to play

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.890 
configuration mostly for game to play
and<00:00:27.240> Linux<00:00:28.160> so<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.550> need<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> custom<00:00:30.359> version<00:00:30.599> of

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
and Linux so we need a custom version of

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.569 
and Linux so we need a custom version of
wine<00:00:31.309> here

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
wine here

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.100 
wine here
so<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.570> will<00:00:33.750> download<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.350> little<00:00:34.590> script<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
so we will download a little script to

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.660 
so we will download a little script to
compile<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.410> version<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.920> wine<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.489> have

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
compile this version of wine so I have

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.700 
compile this version of wine so I have
met<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.969> script<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.660> see<00:00:39.840> here<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.649> are

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
met the script you can see here we are

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.990 
met the script you can see here we are
done<00:00:41.010> loading<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:43.250> then<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.460> will<00:00:44.640> make<00:00:44.820> it

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
done loading it and then we will make it

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.810 
done loading it and then we will make it
executable<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.989> then<00:00:46.379> run<00:00:46.890> it

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.140 

this<00:00:55.450> operation<00:00:56.020> is<00:00:56.170> quaking<00:00:56.710> as<00:00:57.130> you<00:00:57.760> can<00:00:57.940> see

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
this operation is quaking as you can see

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.570 
this operation is quaking as you can see
the<00:00:58.330> script<00:00:58.660> is<00:00:58.870> done<00:00:59.110> Lee<00:00:59.470> did<00:00:59.650> some<00:00:59.980> software

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
the script is done Lee did some software

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.630 
the script is done Lee did some software
and<00:01:00.940> then<00:01:01.630> we'll<00:01:02.170> apply<00:01:02.350> some<00:01:02.800> patch<00:01:03.130> and<00:01:03.490> then

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
and then we'll apply some patch and then

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.140 
and then we'll apply some patch and then
compile<00:01:04.150> everything<00:01:05.490> this<00:01:06.490> is<00:01:06.550> very<00:01:06.970> long

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
compile everything this is very long

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.300 
compile everything this is very long
operation<00:01:07.630> so<00:01:08.020> you<00:01:08.050> can<00:01:08.500> do<00:01:08.710> whatever<00:01:09.010> you

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
want during this operation the script

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.219 
want during this operation the script

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
to confined software yourself through

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.219 
to confined software yourself through
you<00:01:18.760> in<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.180> of<00:01:19.360> this<00:01:19.540> package<00:01:19.900> instant<00:01:20.350> so

for<00:01:25.979> some<00:01:26.979> stuff<00:01:27.220> like<00:01:27.400> that<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:31.270> there<00:01:31.900> is

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
for some stuff like that then there is

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.200 
for some stuff like that then there is
almost<00:01:32.229> nothing<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.920> do<00:01:33.070> when<00:01:33.940> will<00:01:34.180> be

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
almost nothing to do when will be

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.650 
almost nothing to do when will be
compiled<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:35.290> then<00:01:35.650> added<00:01:36.610> automatically<00:01:37.240> to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
compiled and then added automatically to

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.050 
compiled and then added automatically to
plain<00:01:37.930> Linux<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:38.650> available<00:01:39.280> one<00:01:39.580> version

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
plain Linux and available one version

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.140 
plain Linux and available one version

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
under plain Linux and all the garbage

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.660 
under plain Linux and all the garbage
made<00:01:43.690> during<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.320> computation<00:01:44.710> process<00:01:45.460> will

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
made during the computation process will

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.120 
made during the computation process will
be<00:01:45.790> cleaned<00:01:46.060> so<00:01:46.900> nothing<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:47.740> worry<00:01:47.770> about

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
be cleaned so nothing to worry about

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.249 
be cleaned so nothing to worry about
here<00:01:48.700> just<00:01:49.090> wait<00:01:49.509> some<00:01:49.780> time<00:01:50.580> hi<00:01:51.580> there<00:01:51.990> ok<00:01:52.990> the

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
here just wait some time hi there ok the

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.060 
here just wait some time hi there ok the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
completion process is finished now so we

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.950 
completion process is finished now so we
can<00:01:57.280> go<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.940> second<00:01:58.330> step<00:01:58.630> of<00:01:58.810> the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
can go to the second step of the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.230 
can go to the second step of the
installation<00:01:59.320> so<00:01:59.860> we<00:02:00.370> will<00:02:00.520> download<00:02:00.729> a

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
installation so we will download a

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.440 
installation so we will download a
script<00:02:01.930> for<00:02:02.200> play<00:02:02.500> on<00:02:02.710> Linux<00:02:03.100> this<00:02:03.370> time<00:02:06.300> ok<00:02:07.300> we
