00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.960
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.969
 to bring planning review dotcom today 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.010
 let's analyze a jacket the 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.320
 hydrojet jacket of the house north face 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.779
 a jacket with a little cut 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.480
 Very light minimalist is worth and that no 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.120
 it is tight to fix it is a jacket 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.020
 that both in front and behind 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.480
 ok it's not a jacket that's 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.189
 those close to the body 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.910
 what else are we going to see little by little 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.730
 for first the sleeve are sleeves 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.610
 quite long very very complete and here 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.580
 on the wrist 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.250
 as we can see it wears a rubber band that 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.750
 helps to keep the sleeve down 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.480
 attached to the wrist but without being 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.800
 completely closed is worth this too 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.550
 allows you to pass an easy way 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.140
 clock both up and down 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.540
 agree and stays in that position 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.040
 let's keep running with her do not miss us 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.510
 comes for over the clock 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.910
 happens for the other side because in the case 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.790
 of rain or that we do not want to wet what 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.410
 more here in the sleeve we teach here 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.030
 they have a very very leaky part 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.040
 breathable is it goes almost to the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.259
 armpit this favors perspiration 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.060
 especially on the inside if 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.860
 some time we catch a little rain 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.080
 everything and not be waterproof and that is 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.540
 repellent favors us very well 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.590
 perspiration cuts us the wind and by 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.110
 here helps us with perspiration 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.610
 we have all this piece and we have everything 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.690
 this piece here under the armpit that 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.360
 when we go running we have left 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.850
 quite covered and we do not get wet in 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.770
 rain case 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.049
 we also have this part here 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.119
 in the back, notice that he is in 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.009
 this position is valid to avoid if 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.479
 we backpack that is fully covered the 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.130
 perspiration with the part of the backpack 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.130
 according to it favors 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.450
 the part of the car carries only one car 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.450
 of water from a car 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.650
 and the fight of the zippers is not so 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.560
 thermosealed teaches us the zippers 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.680
 and all the seams are not 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.659
 thermosealed then we said is and is not 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.340
 waterproof is water repellent 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.920
 agreement 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.930
 what else do we have here a pocket 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.030
 only one in the back does not carry 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.180
 he only wears this pocket he has a 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.270
 capacity that allows us to put a 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.130
 easy way a pair of gels for example 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.410
 or in this case we are going to try first a 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.060
 device in this case an iphone more or 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.489
 least we all have the measures are 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.700
 very well adjusted once the 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.290
 iphone is very well adjusted in the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.329
 the pocket 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.890
 and when we raise the zipper we can 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.260
 take out this one up here the 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.579
 zipper if we climb it up 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.200
 very well adjusted city up here to 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.269
 be covered in agreement so that 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.250
 go giving all bounces and if 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:50.209
 we go down a little we get the cable from 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:53.420
 music earphone for iphone 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.010
 we also fit in an easy way a 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.010
 pair of gels we should try 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.360
 we have a couple of gels several measures 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.840
 in this case a fairly long one and a 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.180
 little bit smaller we can put here or 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.819
 well they are keys or anything that 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.909
 let's bring it to agreement 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.719
 that now we're going to show you how 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:20.079
 it is in the upper part we adjust the 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.079
 neck 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:30.500
 It's a little bit worn a little bit up 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.870
 and the zipper 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.390
 As you can see it is easy to use with 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.260
 gloves is protected with plastic is 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.730
 easy things I'm going to take out and I'm going to 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.730
 show how it is once 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.920
 folded every time in the races it 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.069
 Seeks to carry lighter material more 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.290
 compressed easier to store 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:01.810
 good badly bent badly bent would this be 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.760
 imagine some hands good, this is 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.219
 what would remain could even get 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.659
 to compress the a little bit more if 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:10.239
 take some compression sleeve 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.670
 we would get to compress the something else the 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.889
 backpack cup very little weigh very little very 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.470
 little and in the end he only carries a pocket and 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:21.030
 a pair of zippers that is a bit 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.030
 what might sound more weight to us 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.080
 Finally 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.590
 I put it back and I show you the part 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.190
 down 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.270
 in agreement 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.270
 at the bottom 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.680
 to fix it does not take does not take to adjust 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.850
 OK 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.850
 it's an easy rubber but it does not wear so 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.610
 If we want to tighten it, no, it does not have a 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:55.610
 special setting for it and also 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:58.680
 allows long sleeves to be able to adjust to 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.780
 the smallest and we go to school because 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.440
 come with sleep 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.570
 we can 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.960
 take it to the sections where they do 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.960
 more heat 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:14.819
 which is also valid good and this is the 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.200
 hidrojet de north face a little bit 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:20.870
 inside so you can see it 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.300
 as it is finished we said the positions 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.790
 they are not thermosealed so much here 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.690
 above also as below pieces of 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.690
 breathable mesh 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.960
 A fabric 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.360
 breathable also worth repellent 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.720
 water and I think a great choice 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.100
 for spring summer races in the 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.810
 than good because it will make some 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.689
 wind we do not have clear as we can 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.849
 catch some fog we can 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:52.889
 pass ridges that can blow air is 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:56.159
 a perfect jacket for this maybe 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:57.779
 for rainy or snowy days or when the 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:00.779
 time is much worse it would not be so 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:02.969
 advisable is this material of 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:05.729
 agreement of a very minimalist material 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:08.099
 Well, here's a new analysis 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.519
 of brings the dotcom running review up 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.519
 then friends
