00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.579 

yeah<00:00:00.299> I<00:00:00.359> think<00:00:00.450> for<00:00:00.750> the<00:00:00.780> first<00:00:00.840> team<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:01.410> main

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
yeah I think for the first team the main

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.749 
yeah I think for the first team the main
feature<00:00:01.860> will<00:00:02.070> always<00:00:02.370> be<00:00:02.580> you<00:00:02.970> know<00:00:03.149> Benji

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:04.759 
feature will always be you know Benji

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.070 
feature will always be you know Benji
probably<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.819> highest<00:00:06.000> profile<00:00:06.509> signing<00:00:06.930> and

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
probably the highest profile signing and

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.259 
probably the highest profile signing and
the<00:00:07.140> offseason<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:07.859> just<00:00:08.610> where<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.880> that<00:00:09.030> and

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
the offseason and just where is that and

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.669 
the offseason and just where is that and
we<00:00:10.200> just<00:00:10.230> feel<00:00:10.620> that<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.980> not<00:00:11.309> quite<00:00:11.580> ready

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
we just feel that is not quite ready

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.020 
we just feel that is not quite ready
from<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> learning<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.250> understanding<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.969> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
from a learning and understanding of the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.290 
from a learning and understanding of the
game<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.540> think<00:00:16.080> at<00:00:16.260> ten<00:00:17.000> it's<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.090> very

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
game I think at ten it's a very

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.050 
game I think at ten it's a very
difficult<00:00:18.480> game<00:00:18.840> 12<00:00:19.350> 13<00:00:19.890> 15<00:00:20.189> s<00:00:20.520> very<00:00:20.670> different

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
difficult game 12 13 15 s very different

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.759 
difficult game 12 13 15 s very different
we<00:00:21.210> played<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.570> 15<00:00:21.990> minutes<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.560> last

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
we played in 15 minutes in the last

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.670 
we played in 15 minutes in the last
trial<00:00:23.160> game<00:00:23.630> and<00:00:24.630> he<00:00:24.750> seated<00:00:25.019> himself<00:00:25.080> you

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
trial game and he seated himself you

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.929 
trial game and he seated himself you
know<00:00:25.710> he's<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.039> first<00:00:26.250> ones<00:00:26.430> woman<00:00:26.580> he's<00:00:26.789> not

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
know he's the first ones woman he's not

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.189 
know he's the first ones woman he's not
quite<00:00:27.180> ready<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.689> was<00:00:27.869> probably<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
quite ready so that was probably the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.930 
quite ready so that was probably the
biggest<00:00:28.880> selection<00:00:30.500> situation<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.650> had<00:00:31.940> offer

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
his spot so that's probably the other

we've tried to achieve in the in the
offseason<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.440> more<00:00:55.710> competitive<00:00:56.039> side<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.610> we

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
offseason a more competitive side and we

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.459 
offseason a more competitive side and we
think<00:00:56.879> we've<00:00:56.969> got<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.300> what<00:00:57.930> you've<00:00:58.079> seen<00:00:58.289> of

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
think we've got that what you've seen of

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.229 
think we've got that what you've seen of
offer<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> preseason<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.730> heaps<00:01:00.090> of

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
offer in the preseason is heaps of

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.439 
offer in the preseason is heaps of
energy<00:01:01.309> excited<00:01:02.309> throwing<00:01:02.910> himself<00:01:03.090> into

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
energy excited throwing himself into

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.190 
energy excited throwing himself into
everything<00:01:03.660> which<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.769> exactly<00:01:05.450> what<00:01:06.450> we've

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
everything which is exactly what we've

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.140 
everything which is exactly what we've
had<00:01:07.470> from<00:01:07.650> him<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> preseason<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.820> think

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
had from him in the preseason I think

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.359 
had from him in the preseason I think
the<00:01:09.270> biggest<00:01:09.479> thing<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:10.200> offer<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
the biggest thing for offer is the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.980 
the biggest thing for offer is the
invisible<00:01:11.640> stuff<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.299> people<00:01:12.450> don't<00:01:12.720> see

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
last year in the beginning of the season

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.870 
last year in the beginning of the season

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
I think he's done that again for us I'm

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.640 
I think he's done that again for us I'm
in<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.180> last<00:02:17.390> week<00:02:17.690> or<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:17.900> he's<00:02:18.200> just<00:02:18.410> stepped

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
in the last week or so he's just stepped

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.410 
in the last week or so he's just stepped
into<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:18.950> role<00:02:19.310> he's<00:02:19.610> working<00:02:20.180> really<00:02:20.330> hard

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
into that role he's working really hard

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.750
