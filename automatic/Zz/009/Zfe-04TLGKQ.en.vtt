00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.270
 what if 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.580
 I'll explain how we get the 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.580
 basil seed 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:19.000
 we have it from these twigs 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.740
 these branches are from the flowers that come out 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.580
 when the basil is already done 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.580
 old lady 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.029
 your short is the twig when 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.790
 practically all the flowers are 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.870
 dried up and maybe only has the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:40.600
 of the tips in purple and good 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.059
 I cut them and let them dry 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.539
 The extraction mode of the seed is 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.539
 The next 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.730
 Each of these things is a flower 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.100
 each of these is a flower every 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.800
 little flower brings about three or 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.200
 four seeds then what we do 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.830
 is 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.330
 to pluck the little flower we open it like 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:09.460
 if it were a banana 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.460
 in fact there you can already see 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.140
 inside you see this black is the seed 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.100
 there is the seed 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:31.210
 the basil is a very important plant 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.210
 in an organic garden 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.030
 because because it is a plant 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.740
 aromatic and in fact quite aromatic 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.890
 it helps us to create what is called a 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.930
 fence I live around our 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.720
 vegetable 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.400
 and in this way it works for us as a 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.400
 biological control of pests 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.470
 When you do not dry the flower or the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.680
 you remove before you have finished your 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:08.660
 cycle are not hard like the others that 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.270
 they are black and they do not germinate 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.150
 these do not serve us then here it's not going 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.050
 to have usable seed but in the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.050
 part of below 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.180
 the seed is an embryo 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:30.240
 is life in power 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.700
 so collection is important 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.240
 and the storage of the seeds 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.770
 I like to leave them like that 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:45.730
 outdoors here in a little glass 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.990
 We label the date because 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.800
 obviously we can not be 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.920
 saving 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.350
 long the seeds but 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.850
 practically the seeds that we get 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.410
 It is used immediately 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.860
 I hope you liked this 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.860
 demonstration 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.830
 and that is useful for you 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.560
 Thank you 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.110
 Hello 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.450
 do not
