00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.229
 we go with the Tehran doctor 4 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:17.289
 anb are several susceptible groups trick and will start by the group more 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.859
 susceptible that are the young 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.679
 young people are in the studies we have done we say a study in 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.220
 the entire federal district 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.199
 very early on the protein 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.340
 not subject whose work is about to be published 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.320
 'We count kessel as a group 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.340
 young yes he is the most susceptible to infection 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.960
 ea adam because because the young group because these viruses of an otherwise 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.310
 they have circulated 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.280
 frieden in between the world 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.460
 but young people are the least 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.530
 not the ones we already have after a certain age 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.280
 we can this we have immunological mechanism that has been mounted against 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.990
 these these viruses the young as such do not have the immune defense 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.410
 because they have not faced these viruses previously 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.220
 ptos they are the target of these viruses for 100 of which are presented 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.270
 these cuts 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.370
 are the ones that are most infected that first place as such in second by the way 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.940
 style as obesity was mentioned 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.610
 there somehow or other obese patients in an alteration in their 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.070
 immune mechanism has a constant inflammatory process then system 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.310
 immune is not prepared to defend itself properly 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.500
 that is to say that recently published abc published in the Andean world medicines 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.410
 a week less than a week 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.510
 in which at this interesting time where 700 more than 700 patients who 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.720
 sentenced 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.010
 in intensive care units in new zealand and hostels a very study 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.930
 nice because two countries went up 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.360
 and one of those that register 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.630
 the patient more frequently 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.760
 infected that got serious fran works patients 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.000
 then from him that's the next group is a council for all 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.970
 cycles the obese people take care of a lot of stress are really the group 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.249
 susceptible 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:15.540
 that apparently we would go in healthy parentheses ubuntu and that can be 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.649
 severely affected by the influenza virus 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:22.329
 later on we have another group of patients are patients who have 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.149
 respiratory diseases such as asthma 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:29.449
 benzema with a subtle towards any lung disease 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:33.930
 what the reason what happens is that this one is 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.840
 its different mechanism 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.919
 defending 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.319
 local in pines for a world is that the violent 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.739
 In Tucuman there is a chronic inflammatory process which allows 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.989
 more easily that the virus of the infuenza penetrate the life she and that 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.739
 still suffers a severe 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.399
 another group 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:55.729
 Moscow Oct 30 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:59.489
 if pregnant women because so much because pregnant women what 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.129
 yes I know is that during pregnancy 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.449
 per cent the woman to be able to allow the product development in ee 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:09.529
 p you need this immune system 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:14.169
 decreases then he does that cam and with semen 1 logical is 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:20.259
 discretely suppressed so the virus can also penetrate yy 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:23.229
 have an immunological barrier 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:28.229
 within this case not only the rich more frequently more vulnerable to 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.489
 also hypertensive 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.189
 in sonsón they are a type of patients and it would be an important point for him 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.199
 all those who are watching us and listening 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:41.159
 bolt say it in a simple way 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.549
 this is distro ph distortion this alteration of the fields 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.339
 electromagnetic that makes the micro-organism conducive to 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.469
 as high to metal when doing this 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:55.609
 is 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:01.289
 percent heurtel heap hoist these two magnets are practically two 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:02.819
 empty now 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.419
 I attended the system stable 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.419
 per hundred people and defense but from the point of view 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.479
 magnetic 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.479
 moved more must magnetic good 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.900
 Who would like you to tell us 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.049
 different with two or three examples to understand 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.840
 if tomorrow the flu to do something very common in children we have a lot 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.729
 from this 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.449
 certainly the one who consume too much his case 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.449
 true then of him children also have the system 

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:39.740
 and immune immature and if we see where they are in their living room with the children 

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:40.639
 so many 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.639
 shout you always have to hire him with everyone 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:46.749
 the ease with which they get nothing 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:48.580
 and already good teenagers 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.710
 bazán another stage in addition to one hundred immunological maturity 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.870
 however they went to yell at us anybody 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.990
 for one hundrerd 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.439
 but 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:03.489
 one is looking at a magnetic field to receive the microorganism 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:10.150
 there is not no possibility of holding the cf microphone for us 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.100
 the leguizamo rest are getty campaner with apply the magnetic park is 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.749
 tell 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:20.139
 a positive pole and a negative pole in the exact points do not pay the 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.319
 microorganism unless there were two contagion 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:26.509
 but the microbe that was evicted I think that she 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.180
 these port are not enough 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.790
 and the changes in our health because they are an amazing are not as the 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.210
 doctor igloo in the changes he saw in blood 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.870
 there 100% or radicalism changes
