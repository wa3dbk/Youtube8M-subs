00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.010
 but 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.230
 but an important thing is not a taurus 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.270
 it's something even worse 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.820
 is a person who studies we are going to 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.240
 sit the summers is a person who 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.550
 studying here the techniques that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.320
 they use the gamblers it is known what 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.239
 happens in those poker games 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.070
 horrible and frightening where people 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.480
 it smells like whiskey leather and tobacco and he 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.950
 know each of the secrets that 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.500
 that deck happens and will explain us 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.899
 what what what happens in those 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.840
 game tables then I have here 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.879
 a deck of poker that is mine and if I 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.519
 I'm going to mix it and we're going to 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.870
 mix very clearly on the table 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.949
 he will not play while we 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:50.480
 we mix small fish great pablo and 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:52.859
 vice versa you can mix perfectly 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.329
 mixed do not mix and that there is not 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.559
 cards upside I think if you have but a 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.159
 upside down 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.129
 to prove it then we will choose 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.650
 one that is the letter let's say winning in 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.909
 a game of poker that will happen 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.159
 you shoot when you want 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.319
 for this ok 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.350
 that would be the winning card we are going to 

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:15.869
 showing it to the camera would be the letter that 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.409
 here to the camera 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.509
 would be the one that would win in a game 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.700
 of the game that we say no 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.119
 then put it half of the deck where 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.420
 you want there is in the middle the middle 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.780
 of you have wanted good 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.359
 You already know where the card is in the deck 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.039
 no no no no no really he already knows in 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:40.039
 what position is the letter 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.869
 yes 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:59.090
 you put it 33 and after the mixtures 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.789
 the placed of 17 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:06.450
 we would like to check what was named line and 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:09.289
 the short open it management account 16 1 2 3 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.280
 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:17.050
 in 12 13 14 fires wear out 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.050
 you can look what's coming 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.220
 to try to give you the letter that is the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.319
 that wins the problem is that a game 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.500
 of poker he has to deal in this 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.030
 order therefore train you on 10 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.320
 of hearts is impossible because first 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.570
 He has to give me and then Pablo 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.810
 then tare and finally you but he 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.830
 is capable and you can see what the 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.830
 10 of hearts 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.230
 but no 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.140
 what he does is something that happens tables 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.840
 of the game the repairing will not see it if not 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.640
 the feat nothing and keeps the interesting 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.110
 in the first position but if you go 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.720
 handing out and in the first position 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.159
 is the one that interests you and it is clear 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.950
 an appearance of power that makes it 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.950
 reverse is to look absolutely invisible 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.950
 undetectable 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.819
 the problem of a letter is not 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.010
 enough is not in a party just 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.459
 you need not need more letters anymore 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.459
 letters 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.010
 almost without you chose the 10 he gives you a 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.010
 diego poker 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.260
 a buddy you are your buddy what 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.540
 it happens that when the letters are 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.790
 four does not serve the trap of having them 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.440
 in the first position because they are 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.330
 four you have to keep it can not be 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.480
 because you have to put them underneath and you have 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.310
 what to distribute from below 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.739
 a lot under the four says if he's going 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.360
 handing out and you can see how it is 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.640
 delivering the letter below as if by 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.680
 weapon and you do not realize and the eye more 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.750
 seasoned and less bleary it could occur 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.879
 mind that your fingers are 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.500
 handing out the turn are no longer 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.500
 under the 4 10 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.639
 in a poker game the people after 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.159
 really short then there are the 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.199
 letters in the middle and neither does it 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:36.250
 giving from below does not work either and you have to 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.250
 distribute the cards 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.409
 face up 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.750
 besides, he can not always do that 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.430
 I always win, I won, but you 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.289
 say in what position do you want 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.940
 imagine a hand for five players 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.800
 in which position first second third 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.199
 fourth or fifth channels that is for 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.259
 five in the third one two three 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.880
 perfect in the third third in the 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.099
 third position is he will give the 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.599
 center of the deck 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:06.860
 the position is no longer in the center of 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.719
 the deck 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.550
 you can see being in the middle and going 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.550
 handing out and in the third position 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.300
 and there they are in the third 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.639
 and it is that it is true in morelos the calm 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.430
 it has to be one 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:35.840
 it's an exhibition but fish without 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:39.280
 accomplice and they never betray a part 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.280
 to a grandmother not 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.150
 two 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.280
 Another interesting technique is that of 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.600
 call in English is here that is 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.940
 sort cards in the deck the can 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.350
 mix and place and this is a view 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.020
 more to do at home and it's fantastic 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.910
 as he rehearses because he rehearses with 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.700
 eyes of canillitas 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.510
 Major and Gerson Sweet William Blaine 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.790
 weekend 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.620
 you can not follow efe because I had a 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.300
 thing when you make the traps you can not 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.070
 look at your hands if you look at your hands 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.170
 people see you're doing something and you 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.900
 they can even nail a knife or something 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:23.050
 sharper then what he rehearses is 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.810
 without looking at the deck look and go to 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:29.610
 try 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:32.470
 harding green cards uicc 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.880
 ok speakers I've been watching during the 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.180
 heading while we teach up the 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.220
 spades cards and now he will try 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.840
 place them to divide up the biggest 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.289
 number of spade cards he has been 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:47.389
 placing the 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:48.650
 and distribute picard that is the largest number 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:52.270
 possible 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.270
 do not say what you say 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.580
 10 

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:18.709
 I do not want to be a big fussy 

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:18.709
 but they are not in order it is true 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:23.740
 with 100 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.910
 putting all the cameras in order 

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.990
 all right
