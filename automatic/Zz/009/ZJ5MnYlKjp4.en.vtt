machine guns you need to know which we
can<00:01:41.610> hit<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:42.000> they<00:01:42.210> both<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.570> different<00:01:42.720> fire

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
can hit as they both have different fire

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.770 
can hit as they both have different fire
pair<00:01:43.290> ratings<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.700> I'd<00:01:44.820> use<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.210> main<00:01:45.570> gun

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
pair ratings so I'd use the main gun

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.719 
pair ratings so I'd use the main gun
with<00:01:45.990> its<00:01:46.020> high<00:01:46.259> firepower<00:01:46.860> against<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
with its high firepower against the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.510 
with its high firepower against the
duggan<00:01:48.060> infantry<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.899> other<00:01:49.229> tanks<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.009> i

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
duggan infantry and other tanks and i

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.819 
duggan infantry and other tanks and i
would<00:01:50.670> use<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.240> machine<00:01:52.079> guns<00:01:52.320> with<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> high

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
would use the machine guns with a high

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.340 
would use the machine guns with a high
rate<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.040> fire<00:01:53.250> against<00:01:53.909> moving<00:01:54.210> infantry<00:01:54.720> yep

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
rate of fire against moving infantry yep

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.590 
rate of fire against moving infantry yep
man<00:01:55.590> that's<00:01:55.799> very<00:01:55.890> good<00:01:56.159> tactics<00:01:56.640> now<00:01:57.420> let's

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
man that's very good tactics now let's

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.539 
man that's very good tactics now let's
look<00:01:57.750> another<00:01:58.079> British<00:01:58.380> tank<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.890> Sherman's

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
look another British tank the Sherman's

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.490 
look another British tank the Sherman's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
high-flyer alright so this one's got a

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.859 
high-flyer alright so this one's got a
bit<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.890> big<00:02:02.369> gun<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.790> yeah<00:02:03.479> but<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:03.810> a

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
bit of a big gun on it yeah but it's a

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.749 
bit of a big gun on it yeah but it's a
dedicated<00:02:04.259> tank<00:02:04.619> killer<00:02:04.860> because<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:05.640> got

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
dedicated tank killer because it's got

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.850 
dedicated tank killer because it's got
the<00:02:05.880> no<00:02:06.030> AG<00:02:06.210> wrong<00:02:06.630> with<00:02:06.810> its<00:02:06.930> main<00:02:07.140> gun<00:02:07.530> can

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
the no AG wrong with its main gun can

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.559 
the no AG wrong with its main gun can
only<00:02:08.069> shoot<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.399> tanks<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.300> other<00:02:09.450> vehicles

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
only shoot it tanks and other vehicles

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.830 
only shoot it tanks and other vehicles
it<00:02:10.140> can't<00:02:10.349> shoot<00:02:10.530> it

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
it can't shoot it

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.080 
it can't shoot it
country<00:02:11.110> on<00:02:12.010> top<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.519> it's<00:02:12.730> only<00:02:12.940> got<00:02:13.060> a

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
country on top of that it's only got a

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.150 
country on top of that it's only got a
coax<00:02:13.450> machine<00:02:13.750> gun<00:02:13.959> no<00:02:14.200> hell<00:02:14.440> machine<00:02:14.709> gun<00:02:14.890> to

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
coax machine gun no hell machine gun to

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.530 
coax machine gun no hell machine gun to
make<00:02:15.250> room<00:02:15.489> for<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.849> extra<00:02:16.090> ammunition

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
make room for the extra ammunition

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.350 
make room for the extra ammunition
abigai<00:02:16.959> munition<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:18.940> more<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.150> a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
abigai munition so this is more of a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.630 
abigai munition so this is more of a
specialized<00:02:19.930> tank<00:02:20.200> as<00:02:20.349> opposed<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.800> the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
specialized tank as opposed to the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.210 
specialized tank as opposed to the
auricular<00:02:21.819> sherman<00:02:22.450> what<00:02:23.349> about<00:02:23.590> yours<00:02:23.950> took

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
auricular sherman what about yours took

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.250 
auricular sherman what about yours took
assault<00:02:24.489> gun<00:02:24.640> back<00:02:24.819> here<00:02:25.060> it's<00:02:25.840> only<00:02:26.050> got<00:02:26.230> one

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
assault gun back here it's only got one

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.320 
assault gun back here it's only got one
machine<00:02:26.590> gun<00:02:26.769> as<00:02:26.890> well<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.670> since<00:02:27.970> both<00:02:28.209> the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
machine gun and the main gunner hole

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.250 
machine gun and the main gunner hole
mounted<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:31.120> can't<00:02:31.420> fire<00:02:31.629> both<00:02:31.810> at<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.019> same

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
mounted it can't fire both at the same

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.839 
mounted it can't fire both at the same
time<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.920> loader<00:02:33.129> can<00:02:33.310> either<00:02:33.430> fire<00:02:33.730> the

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
time the loader can either fire the

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.880 
time the loader can either fire the
machine<00:02:33.940> gun<00:02:34.299> or<00:02:34.599> load<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.989> main<00:02:35.170> gun<00:02:35.379> they

machine gun or load the main gun they
can't<00:02:36.129> fire<00:02:36.340> both<00:02:36.519> together<00:02:36.720> right<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:37.959> it's

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
can't fire both together right so it's

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.990 
can't fire both together right so it's
another<00:02:38.470> one<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.799> reasons<00:02:39.129> why<00:02:39.310> tanks<00:02:39.849> are

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
another one of the reasons why tanks are

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.339 
another one of the reasons why tanks are
a<00:02:40.030> bit<00:02:40.180> more<00:02:40.299> versatile<00:02:40.810> than<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.049> assault

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
a bit more versatile than the assault

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.640 
a bit more versatile than the assault
guns

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
guns

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.430 
guns
indeed<00:02:42.489> now<00:02:43.329> let's<00:02:43.840> take<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.019> look<00:02:44.200> at<00:02:44.290> what<00:02:44.380> the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
indeed now let's take a look at what the

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.100 
indeed now let's take a look at what the
infantry<00:02:44.829> can<00:02:45.010> do<00:02:45.160> back<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.730> tanks<00:02:46.110> rifles

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
infantry can do back to the tanks rifles

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.780 
infantry can do back to the tanks rifles
and<00:02:47.260> machine<00:02:47.560> guns<00:02:47.590> don't<00:02:48.130> have<00:02:48.310> much<00:02:48.430> effect

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
and machine guns don't have much effect

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.370 
and machine guns don't have much effect
on<00:02:48.910> tanks<00:02:49.360> as<00:02:49.510> they<00:02:49.599> have<00:02:49.720> an<00:02:49.810> entertainer

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
on tanks as they have an entertainer

rating of two fortunately for the

point 8 centimeter pak 43 anti-tank gun
it's<00:05:00.150> so<00:05:00.389> big<00:05:00.570> and<00:05:00.600> heavy<00:05:00.900> it<00:05:01.080> can<00:05:01.260> only<00:05:01.530> move

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
it's so big and heavy it can only move

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.450 
it's so big and heavy it can only move
if<00:05:02.160> towed<00:05:02.400> by<00:05:02.580> a<00:05:02.610> tractor<00:05:03.590> guns<00:05:04.590> aside<00:05:05.280> from

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
if towed by a tractor guns aside from

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.260 
if towed by a tractor guns aside from
their<00:05:05.669> black<00:05:05.850> guns

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
their black guns

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.540 
their black guns
also<00:05:07.080> risk<00:05:07.289> bogging<00:05:07.650> down<00:05:07.680> like<00:05:08.039> tanks<00:05:08.430> if

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
also risk bogging down like tanks if

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.790 
also risk bogging down like tanks if
they<00:05:08.669> move<00:05:08.850> through<00:05:09.000> rough<00:05:09.180> terrain<00:05:09.539> and<00:05:09.960> all

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
they move through rough terrain and all

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.860 
they move through rough terrain and all
guns<00:05:11.070> reduce<00:05:11.789> their<00:05:11.970> rate<00:05:12.090> of<00:05:12.120> fire<00:05:12.419> by<00:05:12.630> half

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
guns reduce their rate of fire by half

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.500 
guns reduce their rate of fire by half
if<00:05:13.320> they<00:05:13.560> fire<00:05:13.770> on<00:05:13.949> the<00:05:14.039> move<00:05:14.300> let's<00:05:15.300> take<00:05:15.479> a

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
if they fire on the move let's take a

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.390 
if they fire on the move let's take a
closer<00:05:15.840> look<00:05:15.990> at<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.620> 7<00:05:16.860> point<00:05:17.039> 5<00:05:17.190> centimeter

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
closer look at the 7 point 5 centimeter

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.909 
closer look at the 7 point 5 centimeter
pak<00:05:17.820> 40<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.810> shooting<00:05:19.139> characteristics<00:05:19.800> are

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
pak 40 the shooting characteristics are

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.650 
pak 40 the shooting characteristics are
much<00:05:20.039> like<00:05:20.220> a<00:05:20.250> tank<00:05:20.610> it's<00:05:21.030> got<00:05:21.120> a<00:05:21.180> right<00:05:21.389> a<00:05:21.419> fire

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
much like a tank it's got a right a fire

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.650 
much like a tank it's got a right a fire
to<00:05:21.960> enter<00:05:22.500> tank<00:05:22.680> of<00:05:22.800> 12<00:05:23.160> and<00:05:23.699> a<00:05:23.759> 5<00:05:23.970> power<00:05:24.180> of<00:05:24.270> 3<00:05:24.479> +

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
to enter tank of 12 and a 5 power of 3 +

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.170 
to enter tank of 12 and a 5 power of 3 +
now<00:05:24.930> sounds<00:05:25.320> pretty<00:05:25.500> good<00:05:25.710> yep<00:05:26.370> but<00:05:26.849> like<00:05:27.030> an
