brand-new<00:03:08.040> we<00:03:08.340> haven't<00:03:09.920> use<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.190> yet<00:03:11.459> so<00:03:11.730> I'm

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
brand-new we haven't use that yet so I'm

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.039 
brand-new we haven't use that yet so I'm
going<00:03:12.690> back<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:13.049> that<00:03:14.120> looks<00:03:15.120> like<00:03:15.329> a<00:03:15.390> cloud

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
going back on that looks like a cloud

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.810 
going back on that looks like a cloud
feature<00:03:18.140> selection<00:03:19.140> mode<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.799> don't<00:03:20.549> know<00:03:20.640> much

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
feature selection mode I don't know much

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.150

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
about that undo redo s pinmode only I

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.040 
about that undo redo s pinmode only I
guess<00:03:26.730> if<00:03:26.910> you<00:03:27.030> click<00:03:27.300> that

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
guess if you click that
