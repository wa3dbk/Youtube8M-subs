long<00:01:07.759> board<00:01:08.119> in<00:01:08.540> my<00:01:08.689> mind<00:01:08.930> is<00:01:09.200> I<00:01:09.439> think<00:01:09.799> of<00:01:10.070> long

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
long board in my mind is I think of long

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.100 
long board in my mind is I think of long
words<00:01:11.060> that<00:01:11.299> I<00:01:11.479> guess<00:01:11.659> it's<00:01:11.840> because<00:01:11.900> the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
words that I guess it's because the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.330 
words that I guess it's because the
first<00:01:12.290> long<00:01:12.439> word<00:01:12.650> I<00:01:12.740> ever<00:01:12.770> wrote<00:01:13.070> was<00:01:13.100> my

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
first long word I ever wrote was my

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.770 
first long word I ever wrote was my
cousin's<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:13.850> it<00:01:13.909> was<00:01:14.030> like<00:01:14.150> a<00:01:14.240> smaller<00:01:14.509> pin

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
cousin's and it was like a smaller pin

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.170 
cousin's and it was like a smaller pin
tail<00:01:15.020> it's<00:01:15.950> just<00:01:16.220> a<00:01:16.369> pin<00:01:16.579> tail<00:01:16.790> than<00:01:16.939> a<00:01:17.000> pin

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
tail it's just a pin tail than a pin

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.810 
tail it's just a pin tail than a pin
tail

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
tail

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.480 
tail
hence<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.030> name<00:01:20.180> pin<00:01:20.450> tail<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.229> it<00:01:21.619> tapers

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
hence the name pin tail and it tapers

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.390 
hence the name pin tail and it tapers
off<00:01:22.579> in<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:22.850> back<00:01:23.000> in<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.270> front<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:24.400> it's

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
off in the back in the front and it's

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.330 
off in the back in the front and it's
really<00:01:25.850> just<00:01:26.000> an<00:01:26.210> all<00:01:26.390> around<00:01:26.740> it<00:01:27.740> can<00:01:27.950> do<00:01:28.040> just

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
really just an all around it can do just

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.950 
really just an all around it can do just
about<00:01:28.430> anything<00:01:28.760> you<00:01:28.970> throw<00:01:29.150> at<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.360> it's<00:01:29.810> not

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
about anything you throw at it it's not

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.290 
about anything you throw at it it's not
too<00:01:30.170> strong<00:01:30.729> can't<00:01:31.729> handle<00:01:32.060> just<00:01:32.150> about

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
too strong can't handle just about

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.300 
too strong can't handle just about
anything<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:36.020> next<00:01:36.290> step<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.890> main<00:01:37.040> deck

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
anything the next step the main deck

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
anything the next step the main deck
we're<00:01:37.430> gonna<00:01:37.520> be<00:01:37.610> talking<00:01:37.820> about<00:01:37.850> as<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:38.120> drops

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
we're gonna be talking about as it drops

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.210 
we're gonna be talking about as it drops
your<00:01:38.540> deck<00:01:38.690> where<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.440> trucks<00:01:39.740> are<00:01:39.890> actually

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
your deck where the trucks are actually

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.880 
your deck where the trucks are actually
mounted<00:01:40.610> that<00:01:41.120> there's<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.420> spot<00:01:42.320> cut<00:01:42.770> out

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
mounted that there's a spot cut out

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.680 
mounted that there's a spot cut out
right<00:01:43.130> here<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:43.580> come<00:01:43.700> out<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:44.000> trucks<00:01:44.240> on

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
right here so you come out the trucks on

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.950 
right here so you come out the trucks on
top<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:46.280> allows<00:01:46.520> you<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.760> lower<00:01:47.720> to<00:01:47.870> the

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
top and it allows you to lower to the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.289 
top and it allows you to lower to the
ground<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.619> you<00:01:48.680> can<00:01:49.220> have<00:01:49.880> more<00:01:50.090> stability

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
ground so you can have more stability

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.780 
ground so you can have more stability
and<00:01:50.600> they're<00:01:50.930> more<00:01:51.110> for<00:01:51.409> downhill<00:01:51.950> racing

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
and they're more for downhill racing

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.910 
and they're more for downhill racing
type<00:01:53.000> things<00:01:53.270> but<00:01:53.540> you<00:01:54.170> can<00:01:54.440> mount<00:01:54.650> them<00:01:54.799> on

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
type things but you can mount them on

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.010 
type things but you can mount them on
the<00:01:55.010> bottom<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.549> it's<00:01:56.390> basically<00:01:56.840> an

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
the bottom and it's basically an

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.600 
the bottom and it's basically an
all-around<00:01:57.320> freestyle<00:01:57.860> deck<00:01:58.040> then

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.520 

I<00:02:00.640> don't<00:02:01.240> know<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.420> technical<00:02:01.870> name<00:02:02.080> for<00:02:02.440> this

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
I don't know the technical name for this

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.500 
I don't know the technical name for this
I<00:02:02.770> call<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.430> guess<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.790> short<00:02:03.970> long<00:02:04.210> board

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
I call it I guess the short long board

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.530 
I call it I guess the short long board
and<00:02:04.830> it's<00:02:05.830> just<00:02:06.010> a<00:02:06.130> shorter<00:02:06.460> board<00:02:06.730> it's<00:02:07.000> not<00:02:07.240> I

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
and it's just a shorter board it's not I

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.040 
and it's just a shorter board it's not I
wouldn't<00:02:07.870> consider<00:02:07.990> it<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.380> cruiser<00:02:08.850> I<00:02:10.050> guess

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
wouldn't consider it a cruiser I guess

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.650 
wouldn't consider it a cruiser I guess
it<00:02:11.170> could<00:02:11.320> be<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:12.030> they<00:02:13.030> come<00:02:13.240> in<00:02:13.360> all<00:02:13.420> sorts

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
it could be and they come in all sorts

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.660 
it could be and they come in all sorts
of<00:02:13.840> shapes<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.170> sizes<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:15.280> sort<00:02:15.490> of<00:02:15.550> give

of shapes and sizes and it sort of give

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.910 
of shapes and sizes and it sort of give
you<00:02:15.760> an<00:02:15.850> idea<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.120> how<00:02:16.270> big<00:02:16.450> they<00:02:16.540> are

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
you an idea of how big they are

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.260 
you an idea of how big they are
hold<00:02:17.920> them<00:02:18.100> up<00:02:18.190> next<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.670> escape<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.120> an

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
hold them up next to the escape of an

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.480 
hold them up next to the escape of an
old<00:02:19.420> skateboard<00:02:19.690> this<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.890> little<00:02:21.310> bit

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
old skateboard this is a little bit

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.760 
old skateboard this is a little bit
bigger<00:02:21.730> than<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.030> skateboard<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:23.200> shorter

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
bigger than a skateboard the shorter

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.140 
bigger than a skateboard the shorter
boards<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:26.640> don't<00:02:27.640> know<00:02:27.790> how<00:02:27.850> many<00:02:27.970> inches

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
boards and I don't know how many inches

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.550 
boards and I don't know how many inches
that<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.510> but<00:02:28.960> this<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.620> 44<00:02:30.610> or<00:02:30.850> 42<00:02:31.210> and<00:02:31.660> as<00:02:32.350> you

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
that is but this is 44 or 42 and as you

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.420 
that is but this is 44 or 42 and as you
can<00:02:32.680> see<00:02:32.740> there<00:02:33.070> is<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> big<00:02:33.580> height<00:02:34.510> difference

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
can see there is a big height difference

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.930 
can see there is a big height difference
and<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:37.390> drop<00:02:37.630> through<00:02:38.520> quite<00:02:39.520> a<00:02:39.550> bit<00:02:39.730> long

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
and the drop through quite a bit long

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.960 
and the drop through quite a bit long
quite<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.450> bit<00:02:40.660> longer<00:02:40.780> than<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.110> skateboard

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
quite a bit longer than the skateboard

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.680 
quite a bit longer than the skateboard
and<00:02:42.970> we<00:02:43.180> don't<00:02:43.300> need<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:43.480> anymore<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:45.690> next

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
and we don't need this anymore so next

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.100 
and we don't need this anymore so next
let's<00:02:46.990> start<00:02:47.260> talking<00:02:47.590> about<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:49.110> different

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
let's start talking about the different

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.100 
let's start talking about the different
parts<00:02:50.380> on<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.680> board<00:02:50.890> let's<00:02:51.070> start<00:02:51.220> there<00:02:51.520> you

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
parts on the board let's start there you

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.370 
parts on the board let's start there you
think<00:02:53.730> on<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.880> bottom<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.240> each<00:02:55.380> longboard

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
think on the bottom of each longboard

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.860 
think on the bottom of each longboard
skateboard<00:02:57.340> you're<00:02:58.060> gonna<00:02:58.150> have<00:02:58.360> two<00:02:58.570> trucks

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870

noticed already these trucks are mounted
backwards<00:03:44.560> from<00:03:45.340> if<00:03:46.180> you're<00:03:46.420> comparing<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:46.810> to

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
backwards from if you're comparing it to

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.690 
backwards from if you're comparing it to
a<00:03:46.959> skateboard<00:03:47.410> because<00:03:48.070> it<00:03:48.220> allows<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.670> a

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
a skateboard because it allows you a

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.580 
a skateboard because it allows you a
greater<00:03:49.270> turning

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.940 

and<00:03:53.569> that's<00:03:54.569> pretty<00:03:55.050> much<00:03:55.260> standard<00:03:55.319> on<00:03:55.770> all

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
and that's pretty much standard on all

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.260 
and that's pretty much standard on all
along<00:03:56.130> boards<00:03:56.930> unless<00:03:58.280> you<00:03:59.280> get<00:03:59.490> double

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
along boards unless you get double

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.740 
along boards unless you get double
kingpin<00:04:00.750> trunks<00:04:01.260> which<00:04:01.440> are<00:04:02.450> hence<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.630> name

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
kingpin trunks which are hence the name

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.600 
kingpin trunks which are hence the name
double<00:04:04.170> kingpin<00:04:04.530> have<00:04:04.709> two<00:04:04.890> kingpins<00:04:05.370> and

double kingpin have two kingpins and

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.390 
double kingpin have two kingpins and
once<00:04:06.480> one<00:04:07.080> has<00:04:07.110> turned<00:04:07.470> all<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.740> way<00:04:07.860> it

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
once one has turned all the way it

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.250 
once one has turned all the way it
activates<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:08.970> other<00:04:09.150> one<00:04:09.330> and<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:10.020> allows

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
activates the other one and it allows

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.640 
activates the other one and it allows
you<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.830> really<00:04:11.160> get<00:04:11.310> into<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.580> carves<00:04:11.970> and

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
you to really get into the carves and

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.490 
you to really get into the carves and
it's<00:04:13.650> just<00:04:13.860> great<00:04:14.069> for<00:04:14.989> sharp<00:04:15.989> turns<00:04:16.200> like<00:04:16.380> on

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
it's just great for sharp turns like on

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.830 
it's just great for sharp turns like on
sidewalks<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.070> stuff<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.639> these<00:04:18.600> have

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
sidewalks and stuff and these have

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.259 
sidewalks and stuff and these have
quarter<00:04:19.320> inch<00:04:19.500> riser<00:04:20.400> pads<00:04:20.730> so<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.060> don't<00:04:21.209> get

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
quarter inch riser pads so you don't get

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:30.550 
quarter inch riser pads so you don't get
wheel<00:04:21.450> light<00:04:25.070> and<00:04:26.070> each<00:04:26.910> deck<00:04:27.180> has<00:04:28.520> commonly

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
wheel light and each deck has commonly

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.470 
wheel light and each deck has commonly
four<00:04:31.560> screws<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:32.520> bolts<00:04:32.820> on<00:04:33.060> either<00:04:33.180> side

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
four screws and bolts on either side

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.480 
four screws and bolts on either side
which<00:04:33.750> you're<00:04:33.900> called<00:04:34.110> hardware<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:35.220> keep<00:04:35.400> the

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
which you're called hardware to keep the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.350 
which you're called hardware to keep the
trucks<00:04:35.730> on<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:35.970> deck<00:04:37.280> and<00:04:38.280> yeah<00:04:38.460> so<00:04:38.910> now

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
trucks on the deck and yeah so now

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.150 
trucks on the deck and yeah so now
they've<00:04:39.510> got<00:04:39.540> in<00:04:39.870> fact<00:04:40.230> none<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.650> gone<00:04:40.830> over

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
they've got in fact none of it gone over

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.690 
they've got in fact none of it gone over
most<00:04:41.280> of<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.810> main<00:04:42.810> components<00:04:43.550> break<00:04:44.550> down

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
most of the main components break down

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.370 
most of the main components break down
the<00:04:44.790> weak<00:04:45.000> wheels<00:04:45.300> a<00:04:45.450> little<00:04:45.479> bit<00:04:45.720> all<00:04:46.020> wheels

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
the weak wheels a little bit all wheels

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.710 
the weak wheels a little bit all wheels
are<00:04:46.620> different<00:04:47.010> and<00:04:47.280> all<00:04:47.850> of<00:04:48.030> them<00:04:48.150> have<00:04:48.390> their

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
are different and all of them have their

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.590 
are different and all of them have their
pros<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:48.990> their<00:04:49.320> cons<00:04:49.350> these<00:04:50.190> wheels<00:04:50.600> have

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
pros and their cons these wheels have

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.020 
pros and their cons these wheels have
really<00:04:51.990> they're<00:04:52.919> really<00:04:52.950> lipped<00:04:53.520> around<00:04:53.970> the

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
really they're really lipped around the

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.270 
really they're really lipped around the
edge<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.419> these<00:04:55.110> are<00:04:55.260> for<00:04:55.560> really<00:04:56.010> sticking

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
edge and these are for really sticking

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.340 
edge and these are for really sticking
you<00:04:56.460> to<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.669> pavement<00:04:56.880> and<00:04:57.540> you<00:04:58.050> can<00:04:58.200> really

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
you to the pavement and you can really

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.320 
you to the pavement and you can really
carve<00:04:58.770> around<00:04:58.950> without<00:04:59.370> worrying<00:04:59.940> you're

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
carve around without worrying you're

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.840 
carve around without worrying you're
gonna<00:05:00.450> slide<00:05:00.750> or<00:05:00.930> anything<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.610> this<00:05:02.610> boards

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
gonna slide or anything and this boards

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.980 
gonna slide or anything and this boards
not<00:05:03.030> really<00:05:03.180> if<00:05:03.240> you're<00:05:03.330> saying<00:05:03.510> it's<00:05:03.660> not<00:05:03.690> for

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
not really if you're saying it's not for

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.040 
not really if you're saying it's not for
carving<00:05:04.680> around<00:05:04.890> and<00:05:05.010> cruising<00:05:05.340> so<00:05:05.669> yeah

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
carving around and cruising so yeah

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.850 
carving around and cruising so yeah
these<00:05:07.050> wheels<00:05:07.500> are<00:05:08.900> more<00:05:09.900> on<00:05:10.260> that<00:05:10.440> lines<00:05:10.650> of

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
these wheels are more on that lines of

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.310 
these wheels are more on that lines of
racing<00:05:11.220> wheels<00:05:11.400> but<00:05:11.669> also<00:05:11.970> you<00:05:12.870> can<00:05:12.990> pull<00:05:13.169> some

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
racing wheels but also you can pull some

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.980 
racing wheels but also you can pull some
slides<00:05:13.560> off<00:05:13.740> with<00:05:13.919> them<00:05:14.100> and<00:05:14.600> there's<00:05:15.600> no<00:05:15.750> lip

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
slides off with them and there's no lip

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.800 
slides off with them and there's no lip
there's<00:05:16.560> no<00:05:16.680> big<00:05:16.919> lip<00:05:17.130> around<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:17.460> wheel<00:05:17.810> and

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
there's no big lip around the wheel and

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:27.140 
there's no big lip around the wheel and
my<00:05:19.350> dad<00:05:19.560> they<00:05:23.270> do<00:05:25.400> these<00:05:26.400> wheels<00:05:26.610> are<00:05:26.760> good<00:05:26.970> for

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
my dad they do these wheels are good for

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.150 
my dad they do these wheels are good for
carving<00:05:27.510> and<00:05:27.750> for<00:05:28.229> sliding<00:05:28.440> it's<00:05:28.830> just<00:05:28.979> been

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
carving and for sliding it's just been

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.190 
carving and for sliding it's just been
all<00:05:29.280> around<00:05:29.630> have<00:05:30.630> you<00:05:30.690> get<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:30.870> name<00:05:30.990> for

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
all around have you get the name for

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.590 
all around have you get the name for
them<00:05:31.320> but<00:05:32.010> it's<00:05:32.550> just<00:05:32.669> kind<00:05:32.880> of<00:05:32.910> in<00:05:33.180> between

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
them but it's just kind of in between

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.820 
them but it's just kind of in between
the<00:05:33.780> really<00:05:33.960> lift<00:05:34.200> wheels<00:05:34.440> and<00:05:34.710> the

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
the really lift wheels and the

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.950 
the really lift wheels and the
stone-ground<00:05:35.640> ones<00:05:36.030> that<00:05:36.150> are<00:05:36.240> just<00:05:36.360> really

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
stone-ground ones that are just really

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.090 
stone-ground ones that are just really
easy<00:05:37.080> to<00:05:37.320> slide<00:05:37.590> on<00:05:37.740> that<00:05:37.830> look<00:05:37.979> like

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
easy to slide on that look like

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.560 
easy to slide on that look like
skateboard<00:05:38.550> wheels

built-in wheel space our bearing spacers
you<00:06:19.340> don't<00:06:20.340> need<00:06:20.460> them<00:06:20.640> but<00:06:20.850> if<00:06:21.000> they<00:06:21.240> don't

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
you don't need them but if they don't

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.150 
you don't need them but if they don't
you<00:06:21.720> can<00:06:21.750> optionally<00:06:22.320> put<00:06:22.770> in<00:06:22.890> these<00:06:22.980> little
