 4 selected 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.619
 this is quite important because today we will talk 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.509
 of anticipation 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.390
 up to now we have only changed the agreements to hit then itunes 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.329
 over most of the time 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:26.359
 and then anybody else I lost 2 out of 4 now instead we change the agreement one eighth 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:33.610
 which if amv we have two agreements that silvio has beaten we will wait now 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.870
 on the pier and lift by 2 so we could have 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.190
 so we change on the neva vegetable 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.570
 I noticed before 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.630
 or if we have 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.620
 what changes on the valleys 4 instead of on the wall so they must have 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.380
 the espresso this is a little bit here 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.580
 difficult and because we are used to change on the boat 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.100
 now instead we have to change on the common hands against pennata this is the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.080
 technique 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.200
 hattrick italia command we must not lose the sense of the finger of the hand 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.360
 right I always have to 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.090
 then 1 whole suit 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.840
 if we play crafty on the 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.850
 however, it is not at all difficult for me to prepare some excellent 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.180
 exercises come limited partnerships 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.120
 okay one at a time and i'm sure you have no problem 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.660
 cardboard 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.660
 themselves 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.110
 the first and second 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.610
 example the agreements have the same structure if only a minimum tna 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.319
 unlike this sound or we always dream of eighths 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.679
 the treatment. always come back 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:25.779
 the only chalk the milk according to the bargain agreement we change it on 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:27.179
 o2 coffins 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.119
 and therefore not plus ultra 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.469
 this is a little bit 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.900
 output resul monzino complicated at the beginning but it is nothing 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:38.790
 difficult don gius remember us 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.629
 to change 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.039
 Giurdanella 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.999
 nicola contro panda ita 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.969
 we play minor villa 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.199
 that the rom 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:53.589
 therefore, I go from 2 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:56.739
 lasts for the third beat on the draw bar 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.929
 synonymous 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.829
 I sell because there is that tie 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.829
 it seems therefore given the heart of the 2 mp3 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.739
 they are bound 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.739
 so we have 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.889
 I stop or dream that we do 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.119
 no but it's the same thing then happens in the next bat download where 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.829
 we have 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.829
 later in an hour www play 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:31.179
 then there is a variation that serves this there are 2 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:34.809
 where camp that I played at the same time 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:37.249
 the almond in the old fax 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:38.709
 in the basilicata 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.199
 I have practically not only 200 we have this sound 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.679
 I repeat. I do 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:55.179
 with the right hand 

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:58.179
 to get this sound 

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.799
