00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.670
 we presented in the first part of the program the reform project that made the 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.709
 owners 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.129
 change your mind 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:13.860
 Did they think 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.949
 I went to change 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.409
 the couple wanted more comfort and space to receive friends 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.210
 and to be able to offer the complete leisure equipment 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.430
 the intergroup 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.430
 they are environment and painted the gaiasocial 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.589
 the idea was to bring the children into the house 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.520
 the most difficult part of the work was to transform the dream of the 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.329
 own an indoor pool 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.030
 for winter and evening wear 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.550
 the heating system speak 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.909
 always thinking about 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.100
 ana preservation of the environment and anthem 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.420
 the minimum sunset of energy was thought in the solar heating of the water of the swimming pool 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.900
 so it was all made use of on holidays the biggest of them 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.450
 fenac effects and solar cement to account for that if all the pool water has a 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.540
 interesting detail that the doors they run all in both research and 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.800
 500 social and dodo areas 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.980
 on the dining table and in the sauna game room 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.870
 sympathy disintegration 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.440
 with all the external area that has enough and the average rate reached 1 in 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.930
 paulo washington will have 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.039
 I think I ran 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.739
 They are over pigs' puddles It's only a little bit we never have 

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:28.739
 provided by the competent gerson chacon 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.729
 the therapy 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.490
 pure is a sandwich days with this in mind that what occurred 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.530
 to maintain the temperature 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.930
 the space also has a cabinet to wait for Sunday accessories and 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.740
 dressing room with showers 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.740
 the bathroom 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.730
 in turn is integrated to Saturday 5 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.360
 and to the indoor pool 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.170
 so on the occasion of a big party and here it bears more than 100 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.350
 people quietly is a party 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.810
 everything is integrated this reform also gave a facelift on the facade of the house 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.090
 Yes too 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.490
 the roof has been repaginated throughout the iss 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.819
 all including the old ones 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.029
 and that sore was 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:17.919
 leader with the net with nothing 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:22.199
 and the garden also both the warm up and the resin pet shop 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:30.409
 in addition to bringing the children the owner prefect the reform 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.029
 to create a field of study 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:36.699
 separate from seeds other than most dorms 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:42.849
 but then I started crying from the beginning of that morning I do not understand the 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:43.899
 worry 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:48.159
 with the time that the children spent inside the isolated rooms 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.019
 computer 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.920
 cause a certain disintegration of the family, so let's say 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.600
 taking advantage of the reform 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.689
 it was thought of an environment 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.019
 that concentrated all computers and desks 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.400
 a large closet that awaits the magazines and all the things a 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.689
 or two normal teenagers time 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.900
 then this area in which I acted office 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.660
 it is integrated into the intimate room, that is to say, in the hours following the family 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.970
 which usually at night 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.050
 parents watch on television and children who tinker with the computer that 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.050
 causes greater Burmese integration 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.580
 the organization goes beyond books magazines 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.139
 some ports may appeal 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.739
 clean the panel with the same furniture finish 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.739
 to hide membership 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.349
 the 13-year-old girl suite is romantic as she 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.549
 port 23 of the minimum part of the wall in the top 20 and in the details 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.449
 the afternoon of the environment and white as a woman monarch 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:04.769
 or if it is called attention by the colorful fabric of butterflies 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:11.339
 the planned elimination is also a strong point with emphasis on fiber 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:13.969
 optics give us 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:18.849
 also observe in the bedside tables with different 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.849
 glass tablet 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.639
 at age 18 the girl's suite had masculine airs 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.620
 a real estate wall in Aracati and Formica standard wood 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.810
 the difference here was the inclusion of the lavatory in the bedroom a proposal of the 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.320
 architect, since a new bathroom created during 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.099
 small area 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.689
 the maximum standard formica tub counter even the door finish of the 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:02.689
 bathroom 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.039
 the suite of the couple won in area with the closing of the balcony 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.860
 soft tones the comfort and elegance characterizes a 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.570
 make a renovation should not be easy imagine in a hotel that this is a challenge 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.689
 or the greatest difficulty 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:35.959
 good first challenge is to persuade the customer not to stay during the 

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:39.219
 retirement period in the house he really has 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:43.150
 it is my first moment the pieces until the pension that in the area that stays in a letter 

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:47.550
 coats to renovate or else was what we thought of here at the beginning but it was not 

00:05:47.549 --> 00:05:50.490
 the size of the wada 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.090
 secondly takes over the renovations sometimes booking some surprises like 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.770
 appearance of columns in prominent places in defense this time in 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.800
 all these tips 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.349
 are in what way 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.020
 it is here in the case of a major reform 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.540
 practically a new house the English international a partnership 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:17.750
 formed by the square built 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.900
 I ended up waikiki from maranhão in são luís and the result was very 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.900
 very cool good 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.750
 you watched more testimonials from the architects who attended 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.810
 the architecture yearbook of santa catarina a publication 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.320
 who is already on sale in the main banks of the state 

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:44.310
 resting 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.770
 bento plays ala 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.669

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:57.469
 shows beyond all quality is also reflected the diversity 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:01.779
 in every state of Santa Catarina 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.680
 the work of the writer that we have 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.009
 still do not exist 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:11.009
 the suppliers partners work with us 

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:15.029
 He helped us show 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.860
 the kind of work that we say even if someone 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.020
 still worth very much looked very beautiful in his entire repression 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.060
