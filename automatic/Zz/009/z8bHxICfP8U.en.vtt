let's<00:00:31.400> start<00:00:31.609> off<00:00:31.699> by<00:00:31.730> looking<00:00:31.880> at<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:32.419> small

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
let's start off by looking at the small

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.170 
let's start off by looking at the small
setup<00:00:33.020> so<00:00:34.010> with<00:00:34.129> the<00:00:34.219> small<00:00:34.460> setup<00:00:34.730> I<00:00:34.940> take

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
setup so with the small setup I take

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.790 
setup so with the small setup I take
this<00:00:35.300> out<00:00:35.510> to<00:00:35.690> all<00:00:35.780> my<00:00:35.809> smaller<00:00:36.289> gigs<00:00:36.530> where<00:00:36.739> I

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
this out to all my smaller gigs where I

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.770 
this out to all my smaller gigs where I
don't<00:00:36.860> need<00:00:37.160> such<00:00:37.370> a<00:00:37.399> large<00:00:37.699> light<00:00:38.030> show<00:00:38.329> so

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
don't need such a large light show so

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.910 
don't need such a large light show so
let's<00:00:38.930> start<00:00:39.170> off<00:00:39.230> taking<00:00:39.379> a<00:00:39.590> look<00:00:39.739> at<00:00:39.829> the

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
let's start off taking a look at the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.880 
let's start off taking a look at the
lighting<00:00:40.340> I<00:00:40.850> have<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:41.719> jelly<00:00:42.020> part<00:00:42.109> profile

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
lighting I have the jelly part profile

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.439 
lighting I have the jelly part profile
system<00:00:43.100> this<00:00:43.520> is<00:00:43.609> basically<00:00:43.879> an<00:00:44.030> all-in-one

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
system this is basically an all-in-one

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.110 
system this is basically an all-in-one
light<00:00:44.899> show<00:00:45.140> using<00:00:45.859> flat<00:00:46.399> paths<00:00:46.699> with<00:00:47.000> the

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
light show using flat paths with the

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.639 
light show using flat paths with the
jelly<00:00:47.390> KC<00:00:47.690> on<00:00:47.960> them<00:00:48.079> so<00:00:48.170> they<00:00:48.260> give<00:00:48.379> a<00:00:48.410> really

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
jelly KC on them so they give a really

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.360 
jelly KC on them so they give a really
cool<00:00:48.829> effect

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
cool effect

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.860 
cool effect
so<00:00:49.699> it's<00:00:49.850> an<00:00:49.910> all-in-one<00:00:50.149> light<00:00:50.480> show<00:00:50.690> which

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
so it's an all-in-one light show which

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.240 
so it's an all-in-one light show which
makes<00:00:51.079> it<00:00:51.199> really<00:00:51.230> useful<00:00:51.800> for<00:00:51.890> this<00:00:52.039> small

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
makes it really useful for this small

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.220 
makes it really useful for this small
setup<00:00:52.550> where<00:00:52.910> sometimes<00:00:53.449> a<00:00:53.600> gigs<00:00:53.840> I<00:00:54.019> won't

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
setup where sometimes a gigs I won't

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.830 
setup where sometimes a gigs I won't
have<00:00:54.379> such<00:00:54.559> a<00:00:54.590> long<00:00:54.859> get<00:00:55.070> in<00:00:55.219> time<00:00:55.570> also<00:00:56.570> the

it
so<00:02:24.310> let's<00:02:24.460> move<00:02:24.610> on<00:02:24.820> now<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.300> largest

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
so let's move on now to the largest

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.320 
so let's move on now to the largest
setup<00:02:26.350> now<00:02:26.890> this<00:02:27.070> is<00:02:27.190> where<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.400> take<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.820> all<00:02:27.970> my

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
setup now this is where I take to all my

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.390 
setup now this is where I take to all my
gig<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:28.750> does<00:02:28.930> change<00:02:29.260> depending<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.190> gig

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
gig it does change depending on the gig

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.880 
gig it does change depending on the gig
example<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.330> recent<00:02:31.600> gig<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:31.990> did<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.440> added<00:02:32.770> on

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
example a recent gig I did I added on

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.490 
example a recent gig I did I added on
some<00:02:33.390> flat<00:02:34.390> pass<00:02:34.630> onto<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.020> top<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.290> truss

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
some flat pass onto the top of the truss

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.110 
some flat pass onto the top of the truss
which<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.770> haven't<00:02:35.920> done<00:02:36.100> before<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.910> may<00:02:37.060> see

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
which I haven't done before you may see

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
which I haven't done before you may see
some<00:02:37.270> more<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.480> in<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.690> future<00:02:37.840> because

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
some more of that in the future because

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.650 
some more of that in the future because
I<00:02:38.200> really<00:02:38.410> did<00:02:38.590> like<00:02:38.740> what<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.070> did<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:40.510> let's

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
I really did like what that did so let's

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.970 
I really did like what that did so let's
take<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.870> look<00:02:40.990> at<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.200> gear<00:02:41.380> first<00:02:41.680> of<00:02:41.800> all<00:02:41.890> the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
take a look at the gear first of all the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.950 
take a look at the gear first of all the
lighting<00:02:42.190> system<00:02:42.460> I<00:02:42.760> have<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.030> American<00:02:43.510> GJ

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
lighting system I have the American GJ

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.990 
lighting system I have the American GJ
duro<00:02:44.410> truss<00:02:44.770> system<00:02:44.950> also<00:02:45.580> known<00:02:45.820> as<00:02:45.880> the

duro truss system also known as the
light<00:02:46.270> bridge<00:02:46.510> one<00:02:46.780> this<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.410> really<00:02:47.740> good

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
light bridge one this is a really good

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.010 
light bridge one this is a really good
system<00:02:48.100> because<00:02:48.610> primarily<00:02:48.970> it's<00:02:49.510> got<00:02:49.720> crank

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
system because primarily it's got crank

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.420 
system because primarily it's got crank
stance<00:02:50.320> which<00:02:50.560> makes<00:02:50.770> it<00:02:50.860> really<00:02:50.890> easy<00:02:51.100> with

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
stance which makes it really easy with

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.970 
stance which makes it really easy with
setup<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:51.970> don't<00:02:52.360> have<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.540> carry<00:02:52.840> lift<00:02:53.710> up<00:02:53.860> the

LED now this fixture I've had for years
and<00:03:46.360> as<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:47.020> can<00:03:47.140> see<00:03:47.380> it's<00:03:47.680> been<00:03:47.890> through<00:03:48.220> the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
and as you can see it's been through the

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.820 
and as you can see it's been through the
wars<00:03:48.640> a<00:03:48.760> little<00:03:49.090> bit<00:03:49.260> but<00:03:50.260> it<00:03:50.350> still<00:03:50.620> works

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
wars a little bit but it still works

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.740 
wars a little bit but it still works
absolutely<00:03:51.310> amazingly<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:52.090> it's<00:03:52.210> a<00:03:52.300> perfect

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
absolutely amazingly and it's a perfect

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.360 
absolutely amazingly and it's a perfect
sound<00:03:52.990> to<00:03:53.110> light<00:03:53.230> fixture<00:03:53.680> and<00:03:53.860> then<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.220> have

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
sound to light fixture and then I have

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.340 
sound to light fixture and then I have
the<00:03:54.490> trans<00:03:54.730> sessions<00:03:55.150> show<00:03:55.360> director<00:03:55.870> which

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
the trans sessions show director which

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.780 
the trans sessions show director which
is<00:03:56.380> basically<00:03:56.710> a<00:03:56.800> switching<00:03:57.250> unit<00:03:57.550> so<00:03:57.700> it

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
is basically a switching unit so it

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.280 
is basically a switching unit so it
allows<00:03:58.000> me<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.210> turn<00:03:58.450> on<00:03:58.690> and<00:03:58.870> off<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:58.990> lights

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
allows me to turn on and off the lights

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.680 
allows me to turn on and off the lights
individually<00:03:59.920> on<00:04:00.100> the<00:04:00.220> truss<00:04:00.490> and<00:04:01.360> also<00:04:01.630> it

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
individually on the truss and also it

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.420 
individually on the truss and also it
means<00:04:01.840> I<00:04:01.960> have<00:04:02.050> to<00:04:02.110> run<00:04:02.320> one<00:04:02.560> power<00:04:02.830> cable<00:04:02.920> on

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
means I have to run one power cable on

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.250 
means I have to run one power cable on
one<00:04:03.640> signal<00:04:04.090> cable<00:04:04.390> down<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.720> truss<00:04:04.960> and<00:04:05.200> I've

one signal cable down the truss and I've

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.900 
one signal cable down the truss and I've
got<00:04:05.410> control<00:04:05.800> of<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.040> power<00:04:06.250> for<00:04:06.460> all<00:04:06.670> of<00:04:06.820> the

got control of the power for all of the

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.450 
got control of the power for all of the

lights<00:05:43.669> and<00:05:43.940> they're<00:05:44.570> really<00:05:44.750> useful<00:05:44.930> just<00:05:45.289> to

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
lights and they're really useful just to

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:46.689

where<00:05:46.849> maybe<00:05:47.030> I<00:05:47.150> can't<00:05:47.510> get<00:05:47.659> some<00:05:47.870> power<00:05:48.080> so

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
where maybe I can't get some power so

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.050 
where maybe I can't get some power so
easily<00:05:48.470> I<00:05:48.800> can<00:05:49.130> just<00:05:49.280> put<00:05:49.460> one<00:05:49.610> of<00:05:49.699> these<00:05:49.789> down

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060
