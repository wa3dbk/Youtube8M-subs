00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
off with the blue team starts off in

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.960 
off with the blue team starts off in

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
space and they have to go to the planet

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.880 
space and they have to go to the planet
and<00:00:24.119> get<00:00:24.449> both<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> flags<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.740> other

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
and get both of the flags that the other

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.679 
and get both of the flags that the other
team<00:00:26.160> which<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.519> red<00:00:26.730> team<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.269> start<00:00:27.420> off<00:00:27.539> with

team which is red team to start off with
is<00:00:28.289> defending<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.269> basically<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
is defending and so it's basically the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.089

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
premise of it so I want to go ahead and

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.470 
premise of it so I want to go ahead and
let<00:00:32.250> down<00:00:32.399> one<00:00:32.520> explain<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> rules<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.300> then
