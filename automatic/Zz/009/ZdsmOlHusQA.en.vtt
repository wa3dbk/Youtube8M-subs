and I'm using the car pro to I to do the
engraving<00:00:59.160> here<00:00:59.280> today<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.850> bring<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.449> a

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
engraving here today so I bring in a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.479 
engraving here today so I bring in a
bitmap<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.170> produce<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.680> vector<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.160> take

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
bitmap and produce a vector and take

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.359 
bitmap and produce a vector and take
save<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.660> vector<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:04.110> G<00:01:04.350> code<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.890> taken

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
save that vector as G code and taken

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.270 
save that vector as G code and taken
into<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> mill<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.060> uh<00:01:07.040> we'll<00:01:08.040> give<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.250> a
