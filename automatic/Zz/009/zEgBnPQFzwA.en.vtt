we<00:00:14.610> have<00:00:14.789> our<00:00:15.059> full<00:00:15.449> line<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.930> sub<00:00:16.110> vectors

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:16.530 
we have our full line of sub vectors

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.610 
we have our full line of sub vectors
right<00:00:16.770> now<00:00:16.949> we<00:00:17.550> have<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:18.150> in<00:00:18.360> a<00:00:18.449> 93<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:20.240> 96<00:00:21.240> a

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:21.620 
right now we have it in a 93 a 96 a

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
right now we have it in a 93 a 96 a
Nintendo<00:00:22.620> sub<00:00:23.310> vector<00:00:23.520> the<00:00:24.890> 96<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.100> Nintendo

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
Nintendo sub vector the 96 and Nintendo

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.620 
Nintendo sub vector the 96 and Nintendo
have<00:00:27.270> a<00:00:27.720> bit<00:00:28.650> more<00:00:28.860> progressive<00:00:29.400> rocker<00:00:29.880> for

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
have a bit more progressive rocker for

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.580 
have a bit more progressive rocker for
the<00:00:30.780> bottom<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.350> more<00:00:31.770> progressive<00:00:32.120> template

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
the bottom a more progressive template

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.770 
the bottom a more progressive template
so<00:00:34.590> they'll<00:00:35.070> be<00:00:35.399> boards<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.239> will<00:00:36.420> fit<00:00:36.749> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
so they'll be boards that will fit a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.660 
so they'll be boards that will fit a
little<00:00:37.170> bit<00:00:37.289> more<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.769> pocket<00:00:38.249> more<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.579> a

bourne-style<00:01:02.609> wave<00:01:03.290> for<00:01:04.290> speed<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:05.640> board

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
bourne-style wave for speed this board

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.080 
bourne-style wave for speed this board
is<00:01:06.000> really<00:01:06.330> good<00:01:06.800> this<00:01:07.800> port<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.460> probably

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
is really good this port is probably

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.540 
is really good this port is probably
going<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> bit<00:01:09.690> faster<00:01:10.290> yeah<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> 93<00:01:11.460> is

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
going to be a bit faster yeah a 93 is

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.060 
going to be a bit faster yeah a 93 is
probably<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.910> faster<00:01:12.540> surfing<00:01:12.990> board<00:01:13.260> than<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
probably a faster surfing board than the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.880 
probably a faster surfing board than the
96<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> Tenno<00:01:15.210> only<00:01:16.050> because<00:01:16.380> it's

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
96 and the Tenno only because it's

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.460 
96 and the Tenno only because it's
rockers<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> lot<00:01:17.730> faster<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.870> made<00:01:19.170> to

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
rockers a lot faster and it's made to

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.860 
rockers a lot faster and it's made to
drive<00:01:20.160> a<00:01:20.190> lot<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.610> speed<00:01:20.910> off<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.510> flatter

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
drive a lot of speed off of that flatter

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.230 
drive a lot of speed off of that flatter
rocker<00:01:22.230> as<00:01:22.830> opposed<00:01:23.190> to<00:01:23.370> these<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.880> new<00:01:24.030> nine

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
rocker as opposed to these the new nine

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.050 
rocker as opposed to these the new nine
sixes<00:01:24.870> and<00:01:25.110> teto<00:01:25.860> are<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.340> little<00:01:26.910> more

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
sixes and teto are a little more

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.990 
sixes and teto are a little more
progressive<00:01:27.510> for<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.020> pocket<00:01:28.500> wave<00:01:29.000> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
progressive for that pocket wave the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.930 
progressive for that pocket wave the
other<00:01:30.120> thing<00:01:30.390> about<00:01:30.480> the<00:01:30.900> 96<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:32.040> 90<00:01:32.280> are

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
other thing about the 96 and the 90 are

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.440 
other thing about the 96 and the 90 are
actually<00:01:33.600> narrower<00:01:34.080> than<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.860> 93<00:01:35.610> they're<00:01:36.420> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
actually narrower than the 93 they're a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.860 
actually narrower than the 93 they're a
bit<00:01:36.750> narrower<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.830> bit<00:01:38.070> thinner<00:01:39.000> than<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
bit narrower and a bit thinner than the

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.500 
bit narrower and a bit thinner than the
93

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
93

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.810 
93
some<00:01:40.660> vector<00:01:41.050> but<00:01:41.740> don't<00:01:41.980> let<00:01:42.040> that<00:01:42.160> scare<00:01:42.490> you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
some vector but don't let that scare you

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.610 
some vector but don't let that scare you
away<00:01:42.940> because<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.840> way<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.200> data<00:01:44.470> is

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
away because the way the data is

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.410 
away because the way the data is
designed<00:01:45.040> these<00:01:45.310> shapes<00:01:45.820> they're

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
designed these shapes they're

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.250 
designed these shapes they're
surprisingly<00:01:47.290> stable<00:01:48.540> probably<00:01:49.540> more<00:01:49.780> stable

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
surprisingly stable probably more stable

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.530 
surprisingly stable probably more stable
than<00:01:50.290> what<00:01:50.740> than<00:01:50.890> what<00:01:51.190> you<00:01:51.370> would<00:01:52.060> get<00:01:52.240> out<00:01:52.420> of

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
than what than what you would get out of

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.210 
than what than what you would get out of
the<00:01:52.600> 93<00:01:53.140> just<00:01:53.350> because<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.770> way<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.010> rocker

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
the 93 just because the way the rocker

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.050 
the 93 just because the way the rocker
set<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:55.900> Tenno<00:01:56.170> actually<00:01:56.830> felt<00:01:57.130> more<00:01:57.490> stable

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
set the Tenno actually felt more stable

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.030 
set the Tenno actually felt more stable
to<00:01:58.240> me<00:01:58.390> even<00:01:58.720> though<00:01:58.900> it<00:01:59.170> was<00:01:59.290> narrower<00:01:59.620> with<00:02:00.010> a

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
to me even though it was narrower with a

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.340 
to me even though it was narrower with a
narrower<00:02:00.430> tail<00:02:00.760> from<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.420> tail<00:02:01.630> is<00:02:01.660> an<00:02:02.020> inch

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
narrower tail from the tail is an inch

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.650 
narrower tail from the tail is an inch
or<00:02:02.500> two<00:02:02.530> narrower<00:02:03.070> yeah<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.090> thinner<00:02:04.360> yeah

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
or two narrower yeah and thinner yeah
