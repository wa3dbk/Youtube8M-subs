00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.659
 this 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:12.959
 on the other side the bank during the eviction of a stock house 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:17.070
 equalized by washing 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.070
 about 2 tablespoons of butter 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.460
 half a cup or three quarters of a vegetable rate this is optional me in this 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.729
 case I will use frozen 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.550
 a piece of security 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.550
 salut i consume and cabbage powder to taste 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.450
 let's start with 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.460
 heat the butter remember that when butter was missing we should 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.500
 Be careful not to burn 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.570
 so we do not forget the security 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.100
 i that idea of ​​retirement 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.100
 then we are going to empty the rice and we will achieve it 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.430
 well then that we go to roma monsanto to move so that it is even brown 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.180
 and it is important that they do not have it so much in the fire so that it will not be done 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.410
 coffee 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.470
 because we want is that the bank 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.840
 so 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.510
 let's get the water 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.570
 the two houses remember that for each house there are two wells of water so I go 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.940
 to deny water 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.640
 if they will go grabbing gaza and drinks 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.380
 the person that I like nothing the urals 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.660
 but I like more use frozen ones instead of silver 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.780
 so you can use these three options 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.110
 So the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.340
 let's create the vegetables and let's sound like I took chicken and salt to taste 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.190
 once you have sounded 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.640
 let's cover 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.950
 and we are going to leave on medium-low heat approximately between 20 to 25 minutes 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.470
 and when they have spent about 20 minutes of misano it seems palavecino has been dried 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.280
 is going to burn 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.490
 Chileans and this one a little bit to 1 in a party nothing more 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.720
 but little by little so that they are not worth staying even 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.060
 well giner already when this requested or sponge not 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.800
 And it's ready 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.649
 nothing else wrap it in a bit 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.639
 and is ready to follow 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.579
 so finally we do have the rice 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:16.380
 now 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.869
 butterflies 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:22.359
 0 2 16 I was wondering what I could do so that the student will have left 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.599
 capello instead of white 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.749
 Well here what you're doing since you're not gilded with oil 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.419
 and when you do not know it, we have to give that color 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.389
 then the recommendation that he will do it without makeup 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.389
 and apart from that take each bank to work with better taste 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:39.989
 almost full 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.789
 I hope you liked it 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:44.369
 and we read the next video 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:45.339
