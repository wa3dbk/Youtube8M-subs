00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.700 
EBU workshop messenger bag it was a nice
little<00:00:05.640> bag<00:00:05.879> at<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.330> time<00:00:06.600> but<00:00:07.170> it<00:00:07.290> has<00:00:07.440> since

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
little bag at the time but it has since

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.709 
little bag at the time but it has since
been<00:00:07.890> discontinued<00:00:08.670> at<00:00:08.880> least<00:00:09.090> as<00:00:09.240> far<00:00:09.269> as<00:00:09.480> I

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
been discontinued at least as far as I

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.470 
been discontinued at least as far as I
know<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:10.280> imagine<00:00:11.280> it's<00:00:11.460> harder<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.880> find<00:00:12.150> and

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
know I imagine it's harder to find and

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.419 
know I imagine it's harder to find and
while<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:12.990> does<00:00:13.200> have<00:00:13.469> some<00:00:13.710> collectors<00:00:14.219> value

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
while it does have some collectors value

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.970 
while it does have some collectors value
there<00:00:15.150> were<00:00:15.330> few<00:00:15.630> shortcomings<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.379> left<00:00:16.770> a

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
there were few shortcomings that left a

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.090 
there were few shortcomings that left a
bit<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.430> be<00:00:17.580> desired<00:00:17.869> the<00:00:18.869> bag<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.380> very<00:00:19.410> light

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
bit to be desired the bag is very light

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.460 
bit to be desired the bag is very light
thin<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.789> flimsy<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.689> while<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.260> has<00:00:22.320> been

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
thin and flimsy and while it has been

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.220 
thin and flimsy and while it has been
divided<00:00:22.980> sections<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.150> physical<00:00:24.630> dimensions

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
divided sections the physical dimensions

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.890 
divided sections the physical dimensions
are<00:00:25.439> quite<00:00:25.920> small<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:27.119> wasn't<00:00:27.510> well<00:00:27.660> made

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
are quite small so it wasn't well made

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.620

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
for carrying things the biggest issue I

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.440 
for carrying things the biggest issue I
found<00:00:31.019> was<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.529> way<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.769> handled<00:00:32.369> weight<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
found was the way it handled weight the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.270 
found was the way it handled weight the
thin<00:00:33.719> strap<00:00:34.140> was<00:00:34.320> fairly<00:00:34.800> poor<00:00:35.100> at

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
thin strap was fairly poor at

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.549 
thin strap was fairly poor at
distributing<00:00:35.910> weight<00:00:36.149> over<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> shoulder<00:00:37.079> so

Assassin's<00:01:35.920> career<00:01:36.250> title<00:01:36.670> is<00:01:36.820> also

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
Assassin's career title is also

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.170 
Assassin's career title is also
embroidered<00:01:38.080> on<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.380> inside<00:01:39.000> personally<00:01:40.000> I

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
embroidered on the inside personally I

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.150 
embroidered on the inside personally I
think<00:01:40.390> this<00:01:40.840> is<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.020> little<00:01:41.440> excessive<00:01:41.830> and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
think this is a little excessive and

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.150 
think this is a little excessive and
unnecessary<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:43.990> suppose<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.710> branding

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
unnecessary but I suppose the branding

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.450 
unnecessary but I suppose the branding
had<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.520> be<00:01:45.700> there<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.780> inside<00:01:46.990> only<00:01:47.649> has<00:01:48.070> one

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
had to be there the inside only has one

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.540 
had to be there the inside only has one
compartment<00:01:48.910> but<00:01:49.690> it's<00:01:49.869> huge<00:01:50.500> you<00:01:51.100> can<00:01:51.280> easily

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
compartment but it's huge you can easily

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.790 
compartment but it's huge you can easily
carry<00:01:51.970> your<00:01:52.270> laptop<00:01:52.390> anger<00:01:53.050> textbooks<00:01:53.590> and

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
carry your laptop anger textbooks and

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.650 
carry your laptop anger textbooks and
you<00:01:54.100> can<00:01:54.190> probably<00:01:54.490> fill<00:01:54.790> your<00:01:54.970> PlayStation

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
you can probably fill your PlayStation

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.969 
you can probably fill your PlayStation
if<00:01:55.750> you're<00:01:55.869> carrying<00:01:56.110> that<00:01:56.200> around<00:01:56.440> for<00:01:56.800> some
