the<00:01:37.650> e-string<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.549> was<00:01:39.210> at<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.479> keyboard<00:01:39.750> part

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
the e-string I was at that keyboard part

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.719 
the e-string I was at that keyboard part
we<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.380> compare<00:01:40.650> D<00:01:40.920> chord<00:01:46.189> and<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.579> goes

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
we just compare D chord and I just goes

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.940 
we just compare D chord and I just goes
underneath<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.360> lick<00:01:48.829> mm-hmm

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
underneath that lick mm-hmm

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.929 
underneath that lick mm-hmm
so<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.430> verse<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.390> an<00:01:51.659> F<00:01:51.810> sharp<00:01:52.079> minor<00:01:52.939> E

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939

want to but I think they sound better up
the<00:03:05.680> neck<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.130> they're<00:03:06.550> easier<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:06.970> get<00:03:07.120> a

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
the neck and they're easier to get a

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.960 
the neck and they're easier to get a
funkier<00:03:07.540> sound<00:03:07.980> then<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.010> got<00:03:09.160> a<00:03:09.190> section<00:03:09.730> a

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
funkier sound then you got a section a

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.210 
funkier sound then you got a section a
