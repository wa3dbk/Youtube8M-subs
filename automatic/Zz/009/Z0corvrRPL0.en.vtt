00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350 

I<00:00:00.410> made<00:00:01.410> some<00:00:01.680> videos<00:00:01.800> of<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:02.429> aeolian<00:00:03.060> player

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
I made some videos of the aeolian player

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.960 
I made some videos of the aeolian player
piano<00:00:03.810> yesterday<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:05.220> had<00:00:05.400> some<00:00:05.670> comments

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
piano yesterday and I had some comments

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.320 
piano yesterday and I had some comments
about<00:00:06.450> whether<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:07.049> piano<00:00:07.379> can<00:00:07.649> be<00:00:07.910> pumped<00:00:08.910> or

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
about whether the piano can be pumped or

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.870 
about whether the piano can be pumped or
whether<00:00:09.510> it's<00:00:09.809> just<00:00:10.290> electrical<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.639> can

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
whether it's just electrical and it can

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.570 
whether it's just electrical and it can
actually<00:00:12.150> be<00:00:12.420> pumped<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.139> do<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.590> completely

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
actually be pumped to do it completely

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.570 
actually be pumped to do it completely
without<00:00:14.670> electricity<00:00:15.440> this<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> 1960s

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
without electricity this is a 1960s

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.519 
without electricity this is a 1960s
model<00:00:17.970> but<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.240> way<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.539> works<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.990> exactly

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
model but the way it works is exactly

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.710 
model but the way it works is exactly
the<00:00:19.650> same<00:00:19.890> as<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.220> older<00:00:20.580> ones<00:00:20.789> there's<00:00:21.600> a

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
the same as the older ones there's a

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.070 
the same as the older ones there's a
lever<00:00:22.020> here<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:23.250> pull<00:00:23.519> over<00:00:23.960> and<00:00:24.960> it

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
lever here that you pull over and it

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.140 
lever here that you pull over and it
exposes<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.859> compartment<00:00:26.490> where<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> pedals

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
exposes the compartment where the pedals

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.630 
exposes the compartment where the pedals
are<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.779> then<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.050> pedals<00:00:28.380> just<00:00:28.470> fold<00:00:29.400> out

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
are and then the pedals just fold out

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.450 
are and then the pedals just fold out
like<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:31.740> first<00:00:31.920> thing<00:00:32.219> I'm<00:00:32.340> going

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
like this so the first thing I'm going

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.450 
like this so the first thing I'm going
to<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.120> rewind<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.840> roll<00:00:34.190> so<00:00:35.190> I'm<00:00:35.309> just

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
to do is to rewind the roll so I'm just

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.610 
to do is to rewind the roll so I'm just
gonna<00:00:35.550> start<00:00:36.000> I'm<00:00:36.780> gonna<00:00:36.930> start<00:00:37.200> building<00:00:37.380> up

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
gonna start I'm gonna start building up

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.889 
gonna start I'm gonna start building up
a<00:00:37.739> little<00:00:37.890> bit<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.190> vacuum<00:00:38.670> there<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.750> we'll

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
a little bit of vacuum there and we'll

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.810 
a little bit of vacuum there and we'll
just<00:00:40.079> rewind<00:00:42.050> okay<00:00:43.160> now<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.190> think<00:00:44.460> I'm<00:00:44.789> ready

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
just rewind okay now I think I'm ready

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.590 
just rewind okay now I think I'm ready
to<00:00:45.140> ready<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.320> go<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.500> play<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.219> may<00:00:48.210> not<00:00:48.390> have

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
to ready to go to play I may not have

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.510 
to ready to go to play I may not have
enough<00:00:48.840> energy<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.379> pump<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.980> roll<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
enough energy to pump this roll the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.160 
enough energy to pump this roll the
height<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.059> might<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.570> turn<00:00:51.750> over<00:00:51.960> to

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
height here I might have to turn over to

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.990 
height here I might have to turn over to
the<00:00:52.289> vacuum<00:00:52.710> motor<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.489> poop<00:00:53.760> out

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the vacuum motor if I just poop out

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.660 
the vacuum motor if I just poop out
because<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.960> takes<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.320> lot<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.500> energy<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.399> pump

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
because it takes a lot of energy to pump

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.150 
because it takes a lot of energy to pump
it<00:00:56.850> maybe<00:00:57.690> when<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.050> was<00:00:58.170> brand-new<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.890> didn't

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
it maybe when it was brand-new it didn't

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.819 
it maybe when it was brand-new it didn't
quite<00:00:59.250> need<00:00:59.609> so<00:00:59.879> much<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:01.289> have<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.620> pump

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
quite need so much but you have to pump

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.560 
quite need so much but you have to pump
it<00:01:01.980> pretty<00:01:02.160> vigorously<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.969> get<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.359> work

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
it pretty vigorously to get it to work

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:19.999 
it pretty vigorously to get it to work
so<00:01:04.199> now<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.220> got<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.729> play<00:01:05.939> I'm<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> star

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.389 

if<00:01:21.009> I<00:01:21.159> just<00:01:21.399> pump<00:01:21.610> it<00:01:21.820> like<00:01:22.810> this<00:01:23.369> what<00:01:24.369> you

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
if I just pump it like this what you

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.219 
if I just pump it like this what you
might<00:01:24.700> think<00:01:24.729> you<00:01:25.119> could<00:01:25.329> do<00:01:25.539> there's<00:01:26.170> just

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
might think you could do there's just

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.469 
might think you could do there's just
not<00:01:26.590> really<00:01:27.070> there's<00:01:27.909> not<00:01:28.090> really<00:01:28.360> enough

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
not really there's not really enough

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.109 
not really there's not really enough
vacuum<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.469> do<00:01:29.679> it<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:30.250> this<00:01:30.729> may<00:01:30.939> have<00:01:31.060> been

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
vacuum to do it and this may have been

00:01:31.119 --> 00:02:45.949 
vacuum to do it and this may have been
how<00:01:31.479> they<00:01:31.659> intended<00:01:32.229> it<00:01:32.380> but

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:54.649 

oh<00:02:53.090> my<00:02:54.090> gosh

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
oh my gosh

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.839 
oh my gosh
that<00:02:55.170> was<00:02:55.519> was<00:02:56.519> pretty<00:02:56.790> intense<00:02:58.579> but<00:02:59.579> I<00:02:59.640> don't

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
that was was pretty intense but I don't

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.569 
that was was pretty intense but I don't
think<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.299> have<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:01.250> don't<00:03:02.250> think<00:03:02.489> you

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
think you have to I don't think you

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.490 
think you have to I don't think you
necessarily<00:03:02.670> would<00:03:03.599> have<00:03:03.750> had<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.079> pump<00:03:04.319> it

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
necessarily would have had to pump it

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.240 
necessarily would have had to pump it
that<00:03:04.650> vigorously<00:03:05.340> originally<00:03:05.939> but<00:03:06.209> I

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
that vigorously originally but I

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.470 
that vigorously originally but I
demonstrated<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.519> can<00:03:08.549> be<00:03:08.969> done<00:03:09.180> but<00:03:09.420> I

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
demonstrated that it can be done but I

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.679 
demonstrated that it can be done but I
think<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:09.870> just<00:03:09.900> use<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.530> vacuum<00:03:11.040> motor

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:11.689 
think I just use the vacuum motor

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:16.040 
think I just use the vacuum motor
ordinarily<00:03:12.689> because<00:03:13.079> it's<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.349> lot<00:03:13.530> easier
