00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.810
 turbo scan fast scanner description 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.360
 the best iphone scanner is now on the android 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.250
 discount 70 percent turbo scam exceed 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.200
 Your phone's camera is multipage 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.690
 document scanner per weave scanner 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.470
 everyone understands notes man checks 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.529
 marker boards and here are ranked 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.130
 user reviews have such a thing 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.890
 these search mode for high definition 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.570
 scanning is done as far as I understand 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.890
 three shots 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.950
 3 shots in seconds 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.719
 click stuff but pictures here allows 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.960
 get sharp images without max 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.000
 camera movement in scan mode 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.170
 stick a document three times and special 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.210
 the algorithm produces a very sharp result 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.260
 this scan is especially useful for dim 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.360
 illuminated 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.699
 but do not know want to use do 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.390
 photographs of some kind of documents and often 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.309
 I produce this one but I donâ€™t know if 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.860
 such a program lower any movement 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.360
 that is, the beginning of it opened and then make 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.090
 photo then it will be you 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.970
 I suggest to cut it when I do 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.740
 some documents are photographed 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.600
 standard camera and set 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.640
 available on the smartphone there is only 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.240
 one motion brought the camera 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.340
 photographed she left the photo in 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.229
 the gallery is there and stored but here I am 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.670
 try it seems and have a few extra 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.240
 motions may i not right turbo scan 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.030
 apps try that 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.170
 take a picture with more accurately do 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.930
 actually scanned pages 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:46.200
 through her photograph there is 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:49.649
 camera function scan function and gallery 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.439
 Here is this scan makes 3 photos for 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.430
 a clearer choice is likely 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.600
 some kind of algorithm is used that 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.740
 the photographed document becomes 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.409
 clearer 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.149
 more bright let's try to make 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.989
 don't be still picking up the camera 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:15.769
 ate the top button and 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.769
 take a photo of a document click here 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.000
 raise higher 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.880
 with photography happened and 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.850
 the program allows you to immediately cut it 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.830
 received snapshot of the available text we 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.209
 Click here on this tab on this. 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:41.350
 tick and agree with the terms of trimming 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:45.400
 text and now we have exactly 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:49.870
 photographed the text that we 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:53.319
 was needed by these can be reduced 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.480
 brightness of your text made 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.450
 photos are darker 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.610
 lighter here we press the white one will 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.300
 bright right, look extremely like everything 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.940
 disappeared 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.980
 again it became dark right so to speak 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.640
 the color here is black and white look and 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.840
 color has become a photograph 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.910
 how did she come out here again black and white 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.470
 You can return the frame for some 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.700
 the settings that you need and can 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:30.180
 move beyond these red 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:33.340
 roundwheels moving view 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.310
 delete you can rotate the photo here I am 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:41.010
 about these lower functions I say what else 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.010
 click here in the upper right corner 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.470
 pass probably for some service 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.320
 share send send as pdf 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.120
 send and jpeg open pdf well here if 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.350
 click open pdf skill on and on 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:59.400
 programs for opening pdf so here here 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.459
 this pencil down center 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.480
 document name document size a4 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:09.760
 look here are offered various 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.060
 options let's leave it like it is 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.640
 what is this function 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.100
 the camera again return function 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.709
 we are happy with the scan either in the gallery 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.890
 close here is quite convenient 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.300
 an application who wants to download it 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.770
 and install try 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.770
 interesting enough
