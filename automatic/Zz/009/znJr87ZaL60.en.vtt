this<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.000> how<00:02:06.119> you're<00:02:06.240> going<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.420> create<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
this is how you're going to create the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.309 
this is how you're going to create the
smile<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.829> little<00:02:08.129> eye<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.819> goldfish
