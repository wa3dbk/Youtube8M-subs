 Tomato Varieties with Undetermined Growth Tomato Varieties with Determined Growth 

00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:18.495
 Varieties Of Tomatoes With Undetermined Growth: The tomato is originally a liana, which in a favorable environment (where it never freezes). would be vivacious. 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.610
 It is then possible to keep plants for several years and they will continue to grow up to 5 to 7 meters sometimes even more depending on the vigor. Some varieties can even, from the first year, reach surprising heights. 

00:00:31.787 --> 00:00:33.787
 This type of growth will give each end, a series of 3 leaves followed by a bouquet of flowers and again a series of 3 leaves followed again by a bouquet of flowers and so on almost indefinitely 

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:39.787
 and that it is better to stop with its 5th bouquet of flowers in sectionnat the head, under our latitudes, so that all these fruits can reach maturity before the freshness of the aqutomne. 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.390
 These plants are said to be in bush. They are provided with the recessive gene sp (Self Pruning = auto size). This category is divided into several sub-categories: 

00:01:04.462 --> 00:01:06.462
 Varieties A Compact Growth A small development that can be grown in pots, some of which do not need a small larval guard and are small and well proportioned and you can enter into a veranda. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Varieties with Vigorous Determined Growth Fruiting is more graded. Normally, the fixed-growth tomatoes do not prune, but sometimes a slight size is superfluous because of their vigorous habit. 

00:01:35.847 --> 00:01:37.847
 Varieties A Semi-Determined Growth The semi-determinate growth would be a mixture of the two aforementioned. Growth would stop after the 2nd or 3rd bouquet and then resume by giving a more stucco fruiting. 

00:01:49.506 --> 00:01:51.510

 Namely a genetic mutation appeared one day spontaneously in the process of growth of tomatoes of growth in determined. At a certain distance from the center of the plant, the ends of the branch ended with a floral bouquet without pushing
