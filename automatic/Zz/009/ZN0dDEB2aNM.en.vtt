needle I have marked them all green this
should<00:00:06.749> be<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.049> hole<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.709> closest<00:00:08.370> to

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
should be the hole that is closest to

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.459 
should be the hole that is closest to

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
this is the far right needle we will be

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:54.350 
this is the far right needle we will be
working<00:00:47.110> on<00:00:47.170> it<00:00:47.380> on<00:00:47.950> the<00:00:48.160> third<00:00:49.350> guide<00:00:50.350> and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.729 

what<00:00:55.360> you<00:00:55.510> do<00:00:55.660> is<00:00:55.780> you<00:00:55.930> send<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.320> right<00:00:56.500> needle

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
what you do is you send the right needle

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.939 
what you do is you send the right needle
through<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.610> guide<00:00:58.390> on<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:59.320> furthest<00:00:59.739> right

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
through the guide on the furthest right

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.590 
through the guide on the furthest right
on<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.190> needle<00:01:00.489> clamp<00:01:03.360> pull<00:01:04.360> it<00:01:04.449> through<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
on the needle clamp pull it through and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.280 
on the needle clamp pull it through and
then<00:01:07.600> you<00:01:07.750> thread<00:01:08.050> it<00:01:12.750> from<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.869> front<00:01:14.110> to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
then you thread it from the front to

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:41.490 
then you thread it from the front to
back

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.440 

now<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.560> last<00:01:42.860> piece<00:01:43.189> of<00:01:43.220> thread<00:01:43.549> will<00:01:44.149> do<00:01:44.299> is

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
now the last piece of thread will do is

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.700 
now the last piece of thread will do is
swing<00:01:45.140> Tommy<00:01:45.470> looper<00:01:46.659> same<00:01:47.659> concept<00:01:48.259> you'll

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
swing Tommy looper same concept you'll

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.920 
swing Tommy looper same concept you'll
take<00:01:48.890> it<00:01:49.009> from<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.250> column<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.210> back<00:01:50.509> to

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
take it from the column to the back to

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.889 
take it from the column to the back to
the<00:01:51.020> front<00:01:51.200> straight<00:01:51.950> down<00:01:52.220> in<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:53.630> in<00:01:53.750> this

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
the front straight down in and in this

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.620 
the front straight down in and in this
case<00:01:54.170> different<00:01:54.710> from<00:01:54.740> all<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.070> other<00:01:55.250> ones

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
case different from all the other ones

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.969 
case different from all the other ones
when<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.720> stick<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.140> through<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.409> hole<00:01:57.530> on

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
when you stick it through the hole on

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.060 
when you stick it through the hole on
top<00:01:58.539> you<00:01:59.539> have<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.840> send<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:00.200> through<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.799> tube

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
top you have to send it through the tube

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.130 
top you have to send it through the tube
so<00:02:01.820> it<00:02:01.939> doesn't<00:02:02.270> tangle<00:02:02.390> up<00:02:02.689> with<00:02:02.810> any<00:02:02.960> of<00:02:03.080> the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
so it doesn't tangle up with any of the

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.499 
so it doesn't tangle up with any of the

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.750 
behind this unit right here this guy
right<00:03:48.540> here<00:03:48.570> so<00:03:49.470> for<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.770> automatic<00:03:50.160> unit<00:03:50.610> you

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
right here so for the automatic unit you

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.430 
right here so for the automatic unit you
