the SE plugins folder in the root of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.060 
the SE plugins folder in the root of
your<00:01:02.969> memory<00:01:03.210> stick<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:04.379> should<00:01:04.559> look<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
your memory stick and it should look a

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.240 
your memory stick and it should look a
little<00:01:05.100> bit<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:06.000> remote<00:01:06.330> -<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.510> think<00:01:07.250> if

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
little bit like this remote - I think if

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.060 
little bit like this remote - I think if
you<00:01:08.460> already<00:01:08.760> have<00:01:09.049> some<00:01:10.049> plugins<00:01:10.470> installed

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
you already have some plugins installed

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.910 
you already have some plugins installed
on<00:01:11.130> your<00:01:11.220> PSP<00:01:11.490> which<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.450> see<00:01:12.920> then

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
on your PSP which I do you can see then

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.960 
on your PSP which I do you can see then
you're<00:01:14.040> not<00:01:14.100> gonna<00:01:14.310> want<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.729> highlight

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
you're not gonna want to just highlight

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.330 
you're not gonna want to just highlight

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
choose enable unsigned drivers I think

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.389 
choose enable unsigned drivers I think
that's<00:01:54.780> what<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.799> whatever<00:01:56.130> has<00:01:56.369> to

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that's what it is it's whatever has to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.590 
that's what it is it's whatever has to
do<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.700> Drive<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.210> only<00:01:57.450> one<00:01:57.570> I

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
do in Drive it's it's the only one I

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.480 
do in Drive it's it's the only one I
think<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> very<00:01:58.200> last<00:01:58.469> option<00:01:58.860> also<00:01:59.280> and

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
think it's the very last option also and

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.830 
think it's the very last option also and
just<00:01:59.520> click<00:01:59.759> enter<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.450> then<00:02:00.719> when

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
just click enter on that and then when

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.840 
just click enter on that and then when
you<00:02:00.930> boot<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.380> will<00:02:01.560> enable<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.280> install

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
you boot it will enable you to install

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.300 
you boot it will enable you to install

drivers that have not been signed by
Microsoft<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:07.399> don't<00:02:08.399> worry<00:02:08.489> about<00:02:08.520> that

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
Microsoft and don't worry about that

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.639 
Microsoft and don't worry about that
because<00:02:08.849> it'll<00:02:09.090> only<00:02:09.149> happen<00:02:09.390> like<00:02:09.959> every

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
because it'll only happen like every

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.730 
because it'll only happen like every
time<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.920> select<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.520> if

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
time you select it so if

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.740 
time you select it so if
reboot<00:02:12.070> then<00:02:12.310> it'll<00:02:12.790> be<00:02:12.880> back<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.060> normal<00:02:13.180> but

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
reboot then it'll be back to normal but

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.410 
reboot then it'll be back to normal but
your<00:02:13.900> drivers<00:02:14.200> should<00:02:14.380> still<00:02:14.650> be<00:02:14.770> working<00:02:15.420> and

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
your drivers should still be working and

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.570 
your drivers should still be working and
then<00:02:16.750> once<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.020> have<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.500> once<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:18.490> have
