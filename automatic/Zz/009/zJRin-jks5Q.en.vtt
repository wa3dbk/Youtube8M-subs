00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 and basic design of an industrial kitchen 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.919
 In this video we will see the basic design 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.139
 of an industrial kitchen starting from a 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.630
 flat we must locate the points of 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.299
 entry and exit which would be the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.340
 next matter entry point 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.070
 premium or receipt of other merchandise 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.710
 from outside this point should be close 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.170
 of the storage area point of 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.080
 staff entry close to this point 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.580
 you will find the staff changing rooms 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.740
 dirty crockery entry point 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.260
 coming from the dining room it is preferred that 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.300
 this point is independent since in 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.850
 many cuisines especially those that are 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.129
 very small the same point of departure 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.680
 of the service is the same point of 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.690
 dirty tableware entry the room 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.610
 point is the passage of cold foods and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.670
 hot for the service in the dining room 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.399
 and finally the fifth exit point of 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.649
 rubbish already defined the points we should 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.079
 define circuits or trajectories 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.120
 It should be noted that these circuits do not 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.550
 make references to physical spaces 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.670
 but to workflows that can 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.159
 match with some kitchen areas 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.650
 o main and unidirectional circuit 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.650
 between points 1 and 4 that goes from the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.729
 reception as raw materials 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.250
 storage preparation until your 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.189
 service to the dining room should be stressed that 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.899
 this circuit must be unidirectional 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.000
 obeying the march forward is 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.100
 say the workflows and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.590
 movements must go from the reception 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.659
 from the raw material to the service of 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.240
 the food avoiding processes that 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.549
 involve setbacks that can cause 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.429
 cross contamination accidents or 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.140
 delays in work times 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:42.240
 secondary circuit of incorporation and 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.210
 change of workers' clothing to 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.429
 From point 2 this circuit must 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.530
 be totally independent of the area 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.869
 food preparation and other 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.130
 areas since it is considered the source of 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.039
 many cases of pollution 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.409
 food circuit secondary 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.740
 washing and storage of dishwashing 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.959
 from point 3 and other utensils 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.970
 coming from the kitchen is the second 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.100
 most important circuit after 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.079
 main circuit of the preparation of 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.780
 the food as it assures us a 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:15.300
 proper hygiene and storage of 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.730
 and those in the kitchen and is very close to 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.190
 disposal and storage circuit 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.380
 of garbage secondary circuit of 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.440
 storage and disposal of garbage 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.600
 through point 5 this circuit as 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.640
 you see in the diagram is very attached to 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.920
 washing circuit but it should be 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.530
 I differ from this because the 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.540
 waste disposal circuit is the 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.610
 flow of waste movement 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.459
 coming from the dirty crockery up 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.200
 its storage and disposal must be 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.660
 keep in mind that the circuit 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.330
 main food should be parallel 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.610
 to the waste disposal circuit and 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.190
 not perpendicular or cross the 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.870
 kitchens with these circuits 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.180
 perpendicular or crossed are considered 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.519
 a design error and very vulnerable to a 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.739
 pollution outbreak 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.450
