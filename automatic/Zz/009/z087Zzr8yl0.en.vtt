00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
opinion you can just use it for so many

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.220 
opinion you can just use it for so many
things<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:20.420> really<00:02:21.420> chuckling<00:02:21.750> it's<00:02:22.049> quite

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
things just really chuckling it's quite

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.620 
things just really chuckling it's quite
easy<00:02:22.380> it's<00:02:22.500> fine<00:02:22.799> if<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.180> never<00:02:24.180> quit<00:02:24.390> like

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
easy it's fine if you never quit like

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.170 
easy it's fine if you never quit like
digging<00:02:25.049> down<00:02:25.260> then<00:02:25.530> it'll<00:02:26.519> be<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.670> finally

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
digging down then it'll be I finally

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.949 
digging down then it'll be I finally
think<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:30.090> should<00:02:30.239> never<00:02:30.420> have<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.630> dig<00:02:30.810> down

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
think you should never have a dig down

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:39.770 
think you should never have a dig down
like<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.670> until<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:36.230> look<00:02:37.230> okay<00:02:38.450> there's<00:02:39.450> some

like this until I look okay there's some

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.920 
like this until I look okay there's some
iron<00:02:40.940> straight<00:02:41.940> down<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.560> about<00:02:43.560> let's<00:02:44.459> say

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
iron straight down and about let's say

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.650 
iron straight down and about let's say
if<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.140> first<00:02:46.380> set<00:02:46.590> free<00:02:46.980> on<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.730> Windows

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
if you first set free on the Windows

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.060 
if you first set free on the Windows
computers<00:02:49.260> it's<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:50.070> about<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.519> 54th<00:02:52.070> layer

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
computers it's on about the 54th layer

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.340 
computers it's on about the 54th layer
so<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:55.680> pretty<00:02:56.010> easy<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.250> find<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:57.350> in
