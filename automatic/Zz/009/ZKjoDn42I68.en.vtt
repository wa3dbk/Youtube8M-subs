00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.840
 The frame is very unique to drifting 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.836
 Have a personal style 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.260
 I can only share it with you. 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.000
 This is Timmy's first chariot. 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.540
 This is a Yokomo SD 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.040
 Type C model 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.080
 It’s already different from the first time he won a medal. 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.400
 It is now Timmy's backup car. 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.440
 Sometimes used for testing, new parts 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.160
 Or if the factory needs Timmy, it will use this car for testing. 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.860
 You will find something special 

00:01:09.074 --> 00:01:11.074
 Swing type vibration damper 

00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:15.914
 Dual servo design 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.580
 a single carbon fiber chassis 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.920
 Haven't played yet 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.000
 There is no time to test after the modification. 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.340
 Share it with you, or share the merits later or less. 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.690
 This is Timmy's first car. 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:51.580
 This is the most awarded Yokomo 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.040
 DIB 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:05.620
 You will find that it is close to the front motor 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.300
 All are independent rocker arms 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.340
 We have improved toe-in toe-out adjustment 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.080
 Original type C design 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.880
 We followed the modification and testing 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:37.520
 The car's department will be used at the 2014 Yokomo Drift Meeting Special Round. 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:46.220
 We will reinstall this car from the head 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.220
 Because some parts are exhausted 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.720
 Bearing, motor, fork speed 

00:02:57.416 --> 00:02:59.416
 Even belt 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.680
 We will be ready to go to Japan 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:20.040
 The third one is very popular in Japan and Southeast Asia. 

00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:25.001
 Is a full rear drive car 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.072
 The first wheel is unpowered 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.120
 I didn't think about it at the beginning. 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.760
 So I only bought the most flat car of Yokomo. 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.600
 Type B, all SD models 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.760
 You find it very simple 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:57.340
 Use block metal to achieve different weight divisions 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.020
 I don’t need to introduce it. I know what the bureau is. 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.220
 The only thing is 

00:04:08.284 --> 00:04:10.284
 Used dual survo 

00:04:10.284 --> 00:04:11.993
 And double gyro 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.880
 This is a unique place 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.420
 Other parts can be purchased at Yokomo 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.280
 All accessories that increase strength 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.540
 There are a lot of lead iron here. 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.100
 So that the weight of the car itself is different 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.820
 Timmy is very happy because of this car.
