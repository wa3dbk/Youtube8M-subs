00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.110
 come with the bonnern today so far in 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.180
 call of duty black ops 2 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.390
 we play search and destroy as well 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.509
 the beautiful maid turbine and we play 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.450
 with the depth of 20 with full coat and 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.899
 christ of our republic are the drone 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.730
 had killer and the dragon and ours 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.640
 parks in hardliner nimble hand 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.010
 agility so come now 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.990
 actual topic we have black ops 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.000
 get three four days earlier 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.180
 I am quite satisfied with the game 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.560
 the story could be found at 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.750
 next part maybe a bit 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.160
 do not mend so future came like that 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.829
 and because I actually like more 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.900
 the zombie mode as the multiplayer there 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.110
 not yet in the multiplayer of the pons 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.860
 are really good because the shit always 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.079
 still as from mw3 so I have 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.540
 you often played that in the squad 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.310
 something always ruined that now 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.590
 is curious behind me in the most 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.380
 domination or ups confirmed that has 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.790
 brought me right to flÃ¤ming there 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.960
 I could do the controls again 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.260
 against the wall 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.299
 but no matter new game, I'm lucky 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.100
 wish all the people a lot of fun the game 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.820
 Buy now on release day or now 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.890
 already have and it will be a new patch 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.960
 come on that cut 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.600
 version will be re-cut with 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.240
 We informed each other who said so 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.130
 cut first after cut 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.799
 I played two three times but on 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.140
 patch after that I have to see though again 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.280
 uncut so the zombie mode 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.540
 underestimate the genes again 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.960
 the genitals of five, the head shows 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.270
 The poor legs really horny once 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.830
 probably already comes the gameplay 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.530
 from me and ultra the top duo 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.720
 commented and there we play 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.709
 drive the new courage transit there 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.569
 with the bus around the area and you 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.879
 You just have to survive the bus 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.610
 find a little bit of tune by yourself 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:20.340
 Batteries were all right 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.200
 horny mode better than story and 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.440
 That's why I moved together 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.910
 dear zombie 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:32.960
 and for the people the new town 225 big ones 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:36.490
 Ladder chains of the groups and the new 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:41.030
 town 2025 with the black ops cd 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.890
 and the problem is this time this 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.300
 probably on release day just that 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.710
 you can download it is on 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.280
 playstation store and yes so short 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.960
 will not be there until the release day 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.780
 enabled or some having luck 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.640
 have got it now too 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.290
 and what will she say I wanted 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.180
 actually the stubborn ones in the beginning 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.850
 I thought I want what I want in 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.100
 the hard catch is the biggest cut 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.180
 only because of actions like maps needs 20 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.330
 euro could pay more at some point 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.280
 out on the playstation store but otherwise 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.010
 otherwise I have nothing to complain about 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.640
 Searching and destroying games is really good 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.550
 so the weapons are good there gz 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.970
 again the mp 7 this pushes again 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.769
 in the beginning , it's just two instead of just more 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.620
 recoil because you just stop intervention 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.650
 then everything is clear 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:41.320
 but otherwise we like that 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.400
 weapons and if you want to 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.750
 silencer that prevents me 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.160
 eyes with a bit of luxury 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.160
 switches before I'm no longer with 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.820
 the mp 7 at the start 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.040
 probably coming soon in 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.560
 he was using gameplay with ultra gamer 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.180
 the mp 7 we play a bit 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.090
 change and who together again and again 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.440
 with the comment I make 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.720
 For example, today I'm off with it 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:08.380
 I was able to make the next comments 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:10.310
 he and zombie do the dual but so 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.360
 campaign I would not like to network 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.040
 even plans to puke so 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.220
 cheap circle it based on marc there 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.109
 I can not say anything more about that 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:25.340
 So it really annoyed me where I the 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.930
 but scene portaner circle is something else 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.919
 but I still cool in the krawall 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.849
 become signs 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.590
 you can fix it on the floor 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.300
 So you can do that on the floor 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.460
 spread so protect it's real 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.310
 good and you can be in the zombie 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.229
 Mode this transit mode as he 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.860
 also net or transit or I know 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.889
 neither 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.560
 You can also scold yourself later 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.699
 Build that is the break through doors or 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.259
 so I do not know 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.659
 I have not done it yet 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.129
 I hope to do it soon 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.199
 yes then sometimes a little 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:02.690
 tutorial how it works so how it's built 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:05.659
 will be for the stupid among us and one 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.759
 I look around me my friends once in a 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:09.830
 fish like the video grad times two 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:12.050
 minutes online because I would have 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.120
 any I can imagine 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.610
 that someone from my environment is because 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.830
 We have the one time he wanted one with us 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.389
 join in we said ok he has 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.539
 we have come to terms with us 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.909
 that nothing was done for us by the village boss 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:29.990
 although the hdtv me and ultra gamer 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:32.080
 heard and because we thought with ok 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.139
 the joke does not work out that way 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.060
 So now even died one now 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.250
 smaller falls a bit on the web 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.340
 capable of playing with the cinema mode 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.139
 packaged now we are one time 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.479
 little bit about the map so we can do it 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:51.560
 See how beautiful this gorgeous with 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:54.949
 ruby is and that was actually with it 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.020
 our gameplay that was a six to 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:59.960
 one not bad it was my first 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:05.020
 Find and destroy the game gives us one 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.020
 good rating subscribes to us and ciao
