I've<00:02:18.870> done<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.290> without<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.160> it

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
I've done this without that and it

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.220 
I've done this without that and it
totally<00:02:20.520> worked<00:02:20.910> but<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.569> makes<00:02:21.840> me<00:02:21.989> feel<00:02:22.200> a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
totally worked but that makes me feel a

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.199 
totally worked but that makes me feel a
little<00:02:22.500> better<00:02:22.680> versus<00:02:23.430> having<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.790> plastic

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
little better versus having that plastic

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.000 
little better versus having that plastic
bag<00:02:24.360> against<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.959> bottom<00:02:25.140> probably<00:02:25.770> doesn't

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
bag against the bottom probably doesn't

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.040 
bag against the bottom probably doesn't
matter<00:02:26.130> bring<00:02:26.819> that<00:02:27.000> up<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.680> 135<00:02:29.090> okay<00:02:30.090> put<00:02:30.930> in

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
matter bring that up to 135 okay put in

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.840 
matter bring that up to 135 okay put in
the<00:02:31.170> duck<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:32.010> can<00:02:32.160> see<00:02:32.340> because<00:02:32.520> we<00:02:32.730> got

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
the duck and you can see because we got

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.030 
the duck and you can see because we got
most<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.270> air<00:02:33.390> out<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.750> sinks<00:02:34.230> which<00:02:34.830> also

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
most of the air out it sinks which also

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.559 
most of the air out it sinks which also
by<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.340> way<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.520> think<00:02:35.670> in<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.000> olden<00:02:36.300> times

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
by the way I think in the olden times

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.750 
by the way I think in the olden times
this<00:02:37.050> would<00:02:37.230> have<00:02:37.350> meant<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.680> duck<00:02:37.920> was<00:02:38.370> a

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
this would have meant the duck was a

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.210 
this would have meant the duck was a
witch<00:02:39.120> or<00:02:39.420> something<00:02:40.080> like<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.350> all<00:02:41.100> right

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
witch or something like that all right

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.199 
witch or something like that all right

going<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.870> be<00:03:21.930> surprised<00:03:22.350> it's<00:03:22.590> not<00:03:22.650> very<00:03:23.130> hard

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
going to be surprised it's not very hard

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.599 
going to be surprised it's not very hard
to<00:03:24.060> keep<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.450> at<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.690> constant<00:03:25.049> 135<00:03:25.890> or<00:03:26.430> at

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
to keep that at a constant 135 or at

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.490 
to keep that at a constant 135 or at
least<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.880> wasn't<00:03:27.180> for<00:03:27.299> me<00:03:27.329> so<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.019> idea<00:03:28.200> here

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
least it wasn't for me so the idea here

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.590 
least it wasn't for me so the idea here
is<00:03:28.829> we're<00:03:29.190> bringing<00:03:29.609> our<00:03:29.790> duck<00:03:30.090> up<00:03:30.329> to

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
temperature up to the internal

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.180 
temperature up to the internal
temperature<00:03:32.040> we<00:03:32.549> want<00:03:32.760> really<00:03:33.630> slowly<00:03:34.260> really

enough the duck gets 135 and because it
happens<00:03:45.359> so<00:03:45.420> gently<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:46.590> makes<00:03:47.040> for<00:03:47.400> an

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
happens so gently it makes for an

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.539 
happens so gently it makes for an
incredible<00:03:48.060> texture<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.079> a<00:03:49.380> minimum<00:03:49.920> loss<00:03:50.280> of
