 hello dear family how are we in gaza 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.689
 today I have a spectacular preparation very simple fast pie artigas that 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.380
 we always want to make ourselves the chicken left the grill the day 

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:33.570
 Sunday on Monday we do more 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.910
 some empanadas with that chicken we are going to call you with some other vegetables and 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.340
 despite showing what are the ingredients that we see today tapas 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.300
 patties ladies 1 with this recipe reach practically for a dozen 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.950
 so that we give people that the people we have raised in reality 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.570
 the video or we can do it with baked chicken that is about more or less 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.630
 we are going to paint it, we are not going to work 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.880
 we also have a few chard only soybeans 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.450
 Faults and ribs 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.630
 to kate moss verdeo that I really like the green or short distance in 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.400
 diagonal here I have a red bell pepper that is also cut in 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.420
 juliana without seeds a bit of butter for aesthetics and here we have some 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.760
 raisins without seed is important if hard boiled egg and we are going to add 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.110
 also a little olive oil cream cheese that does not miss because they're going 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.100
 a very interesting aroma and here I have a little village beaten 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.470
 simply hostel owed this is the base product that we are going to use this 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.430
 chicken 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.900
 this line that we put to use 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.140
 blind blindly preparing with a brush also continued to 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.410
 brush 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.009
 empanada this is called hard gold 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.289
 where are we going to start 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.500
 let's start by picard a little chicken 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.950
 seasonal 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.490
 already cossío the pp was the day before and if you are not available corneas and what 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.490
 does it contribute like this 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.880
 in principle in fish markets 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.679
 and then you're going to take out some cubes a little sticks pines like this yes 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:57.429
 bill 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:58.299
 good simple 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.469
 here, let's not complicate, he ended up losing a few pieces of chicken, 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.359
 small to place inside your empanadas and the cut is not so relevant 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.919
 how important it is not 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.969
 too long cuts and 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:13.089
 we do not go then to our vote 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:15.779
 and we're going to preheat it a little bit 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:20.839
 but I have rules of age lit the box close preheat the vote 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:24.009
 let's start then by the different elements that we can first 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.560
 the chicken was already cooked in the network the cell is cooked ponce I'm going to start 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:34.680
 for the green olive oil always in your pan for the side ica and oil 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.189
 so that it is done by heating evenly 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.649
 let's put the green 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:42.779
 a little bit of butter that is melting here 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:47.629
 slowly because I eat green first because I need them to leave a 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.200
 little nothing but no 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.790
 I'm going through cooking because we're going to lose color but a process that 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.779
 take package 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:59.279
 the green present when I speak of green or use the green part the green one but 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.019
 that would start a common Valencian onion 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.669
 in this case I want the green 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:04.740
 I love you said 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.679
 its very tender texture also 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:10.449
 then we can use the green 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:14.930
 bolocco morrón or red pepper and now we are going to go with the chicken 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:20.049
 adding the precooked by paper the leaves of chard washed and precooked 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.109
 shenawi living and chopped 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:22.989
 see what 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.010
 in a little while we are setting up our base for our receiver of these 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.279
 farm chicken pies and let's now add element of 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.329
 flavoring a little salt 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.329
 White pepper 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:37.919
 we mix all this 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.499
 two minutes more or less cooking by moving it from time to time 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.719
 and so then we're going to add some cream cheese that I have for 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.719
 here 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.650
 and we will take it 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.989
 to the refrigerator for what 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.009
 Vazquez and temperature once cold we are ready 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:58.909
 to assemble our empanada meanwhile will continue to heat the oven 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.069
 I'm going to go to the news and I'll show you how we continue with everyone
