00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
probably gonna be a little weaker than

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.300 
probably gonna be a little weaker than
the<00:02:09.209> metal<00:02:09.660> spike<00:02:09.989> walls<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.560> that's<00:02:10.860> good<00:02:11.160> but

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
the metal spike walls so that's good but

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.089 
the metal spike walls so that's good but
it<00:02:11.519> is<00:02:11.550> cheaper<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.269> it<00:02:12.840> does<00:02:13.019> do<00:02:13.260> its<00:02:13.499> duty<00:02:13.680> in

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
it is cheaper and it does do its duty in

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.709 
it is cheaper and it does do its duty in
keeping<00:02:14.579> things<00:02:14.700> away<00:02:14.969> from<00:02:15.150> your<00:02:15.299> wall<00:02:15.480> now

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:15.719 
keeping things away from your wall now

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.270 
keeping things away from your wall now
you<00:02:15.780> can<00:02:16.049> break<00:02:16.230> them<00:02:16.319> down<00:02:16.379> for<00:02:16.859> sure<00:02:16.920> but

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
you can break them down for sure but

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.680 
you can break them down for sure but
they<00:02:17.459> will

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
they will

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.860 
they will
hurt<00:02:17.870> things<00:02:18.680> as<00:02:19.040> needed<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:20.390> have<00:02:20.570> the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
hurt things as needed so you have the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.770 
hurt things as needed so you have the
metal<00:02:21.710> spike<00:02:22.160> wall<00:02:22.430> which<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.300> my<00:02:23.450> smoothie

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
metal spike wall which is in my smoothie

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.030 
metal spike wall which is in my smoothie
so<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:23.930> can't<00:02:24.140> take<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.290> look<00:02:24.500> at<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.770> but<00:02:24.890> you

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
so I can't take a look at it but you

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.550 
so I can't take a look at it but you
have<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.430> wooden<00:02:25.880> spike<00:02:26.120> walls<00:02:26.300> so<00:02:26.570> 40<00:02:27.380> would

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
have the wooden spike walls so 40 would

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.980 
have the wooden spike walls so 40 would
10<00:02:27.950> hi<00:02:28.190> 30<00:02:28.670> fiber<00:02:28.970> I'd<00:02:29.420> say<00:02:29.630> that's<00:02:29.780> pretty

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
10 hi 30 fiber I'd say that's pretty

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.960 
10 hi 30 fiber I'd say that's pretty
cheap<00:02:30.260> so<00:02:30.530> that's<00:02:31.220> not<00:02:31.370> bad<00:02:31.550> that's<00:02:31.760> not<00:02:31.880> bad

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
cheap so that's not bad that's not bad

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:32.790 
cheap so that's not bad that's not bad
at<00:02:32.300> all

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
at all

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.890 
at all
okey<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:34.130> next<00:02:34.490> thing<00:02:34.820> we<00:02:35.120> have<00:02:35.330> is<00:02:35.360> the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
okey a the next thing we have is the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.190 
okey a the next thing we have is the
bookshelf<00:02:36.710> now<00:02:36.950> if<00:02:37.070> I<00:02:37.160> can<00:02:37.310> just<00:02:37.460> find<00:02:37.790> that

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
bookshelf now if I can just find that

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.930 
bookshelf now if I can just find that
where<00:02:39.200> are<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:40.070> there<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.370> is<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.580> bookshelf

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
where are you there it is the bookshelf

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.700 
where are you there it is the bookshelf
so<00:02:41.120> in<00:02:41.210> the<00:02:41.300> bookshelf<00:02:41.690> is<00:02:41.870> really<00:02:42.200> useful<00:02:42.530> for

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
so in the bookshelf is really useful for

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.740 
so in the bookshelf is really useful for
keeping<00:02:42.830> all<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.220> your<00:02:43.430> blueprints<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.090> I

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
keeping all of your blueprints and I

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.290 
keeping all of your blueprints and I
think<00:02:44.990> that's<00:02:45.140> super<00:02:45.290> useful<00:02:45.470> because<00:02:46.300> having

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
think that's super useful because having

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.850 
think that's super useful because having
a<00:02:47.420> ton<00:02:47.630> of<00:02:47.660> blueprints<00:02:48.260> just<00:02:48.440> all<00:02:48.590> over<00:02:48.710> the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
a ton of blueprints just all over the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.110 
a ton of blueprints just all over the
place<00:02:49.870> well<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:50.900> know<00:02:51.200> it's<00:02:51.320> a<00:02:51.440> little<00:02:52.120> you

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
place well you know it's a little you

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.730 
place well you know it's a little you
know<00:02:53.150> it's<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.450> little<00:02:53.600> little<00:02:54.080> unorganized

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
know it's a little little unorganized

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.380 
know it's a little little unorganized
but<00:02:54.860> like<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.070> chemo<00:02:55.370> in<00:02:55.580> place<00:02:55.820> now<00:02:56.180> we<00:02:56.240> have

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
but like the chemo in place now we have

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.380 
but like the chemo in place now we have
the<00:02:56.510> bookshelf<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:57.020> have<00:02:57.170> yet<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.440> make<00:02:57.770> one<00:02:58.040> yet

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
the bookshelf I have yet to make one yet

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.240 
the bookshelf I have yet to make one yet
but<00:03:00.350> I'm<00:03:00.440> pretty<00:03:00.620> sure<00:03:00.830> they're<00:03:01.070> pretty

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
but I'm pretty sure they're pretty

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.530 
but I'm pretty sure they're pretty
awesome<00:03:01.310> we<00:03:01.700> don't<00:03:01.850> have<00:03:01.940> much<00:03:02.120> blueprints

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
awesome we don't have much blueprints

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.060 
awesome we don't have much blueprints
yet<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:02.840> probably<00:03:03.140> will<00:03:03.410> make<00:03:03.470> one<00:03:03.830> later

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
yet so I probably will make one later

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.980 
yet so I probably will make one later
when<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.310> need<00:03:04.520> one<00:03:04.670> but<00:03:05.210> as<00:03:05.360> of<00:03:05.510> right<00:03:05.540> now

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
when I need one but as of right now

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.280 
when I need one but as of right now
there<00:03:06.530> is<00:03:06.770> no<00:03:07.190> need<00:03:07.430> for<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:08.020> bookshelf<00:03:09.020> at

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
there is no need for the bookshelf at

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.810 
there is no need for the bookshelf at
the<00:03:09.500> moment<00:03:09.860> at<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.100> moment<00:03:10.130> right<00:03:10.550> now<00:03:10.580> we're

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
the moment at the moment right now we're

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.030 
the moment at the moment right now we're
just<00:03:10.910> kind<00:03:11.000> of<00:03:11.150> focused<00:03:11.480> on<00:03:11.540> building<00:03:12.040> okay

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
just kind of focused on building okay

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.120 
just kind of focused on building okay
that<00:03:13.490> should<00:03:13.760> be<00:03:13.820> all<00:03:14.530> one<00:03:15.530> thing<00:03:15.770> that<00:03:16.100> I

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
that should be all one thing that I

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.980 
that should be all one thing that I
think<00:03:16.490> is<00:03:16.610> really<00:03:16.790> cool<00:03:17.000> is<00:03:17.060> they<00:03:17.390> change<00:03:17.690> the

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
think is really cool is they change the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.630 
think is really cool is they change the
way<00:03:18.110> storages<00:03:18.620> are<00:03:18.800> so<00:03:19.010> now<00:03:19.190> there's<00:03:19.460> no

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
way storages are so now there's no

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.070 
way storages are so now there's no
weight<00:03:20.000> limit

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
weight limit

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.890 
weight limit
there's<00:03:21.410> just<00:03:21.830> slot<00:03:22.820> limits<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:23.360> that<00:03:23.390> that's

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
there's just slot limits so that that's

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.180 
there's just slot limits so that that's
pretty<00:03:24.050> awesome<00:03:24.230> cuz<00:03:24.590> saddles<00:03:24.920> were<00:03:24.980> heavy

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
pretty awesome cuz saddles were heavy

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.210 
pretty awesome cuz saddles were heavy
and<00:03:25.489> in<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.300> old<00:03:26.420> days<00:03:26.510> before<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.260> crash<00:03:27.440> we

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
and in the old days before the crash we

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.770 
and in the old days before the crash we
kept<00:03:28.430> ourselves<00:03:28.580> all<00:03:29.000> we<00:03:29.120> wanted<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.570> keep

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
kept ourselves all we wanted to keep

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.199 
kept ourselves all we wanted to keep
ourselves<00:03:29.900> all<00:03:30.290> in<00:03:30.410> one<00:03:30.500> box<00:03:30.910> but<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:32.000> was<00:03:32.090> too

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
ourselves all in one box but it was too

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.000 
ourselves all in one box but it was too
heavy<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.630> have<00:03:32.900> them<00:03:33.050> all<00:03:33.170> in<00:03:33.380> there<00:03:33.530> so<00:03:33.770> now

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
heavy to have them all in there so now

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.090 
heavy to have them all in there so now
you<00:03:34.940> can<00:03:35.150> have<00:03:35.180> them<00:03:35.660> without<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.739> weight

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
you can have them without the weight

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.460 
you can have them without the weight
limit<00:03:37.430> so<00:03:37.610> that's<00:03:37.760> pretty<00:03:37.970> awesome

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
limit so that's pretty awesome

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.199 
limit so that's pretty awesome
okay<00:03:39.470> now<00:03:39.860> that<00:03:40.070> we've<00:03:40.190> talked<00:03:40.430> about<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.910> I

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
okay now that we've talked about that I

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.710 
okay now that we've talked about that I
wanna<00:03:41.600> introduce<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.410> to<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:44.120> updated<00:03:44.540> base

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
wanna introduce you to the updated base

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.370 
wanna introduce you to the updated base
look<00:03:45.560> at<00:03:45.800> it<00:03:46.120> it's<00:03:47.120> beautiful<00:03:47.660> it<00:03:48.350> is

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380

beautiful as you can see we've got some
spikes<00:03:51.769> up<00:03:52.040> here<00:03:52.519> to<00:03:52.820> keep<00:03:53.000> people<00:03:53.390> from

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
spikes up here to keep people from

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.290 
spikes up here to keep people from
jumping<00:03:54.680> in<00:03:54.769> our<00:03:54.920> base<00:03:55.100> and<00:03:55.700> we've<00:03:55.910> got<00:03:56.120> the

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
jumping in our base and we've got the

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.780 
jumping in our base and we've got the
wooden<00:03:56.570> spikes<00:03:56.930> here<00:03:57.290> on<00:03:57.440> display<00:03:58.070> all<00:03:58.340> around

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
wooden spikes here on display all around

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.570 
wooden spikes here on display all around
the<00:03:58.910> base<00:03:59.170> obviously<00:04:00.310> we'll<00:04:01.310> probably

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
the base obviously we'll probably

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.240 
the base obviously we'll probably
upgrade<00:04:03.820> later<00:04:04.820> so<00:04:05.450> that's<00:04:05.630> okay<00:04:06.130> you<00:04:07.130> know

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
upgrade later so that's okay you know

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.070 
upgrade later so that's okay you know
but<00:04:07.400> for<00:04:07.580> now<00:04:07.790> we've<00:04:08.239> got<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.570> wooden<00:04:08.810> spikes

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
but for now we've got the wooden spikes

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.050 
but for now we've got the wooden spikes
now<00:04:09.380> okay<00:04:09.800> so<00:04:09.860> we're<00:04:10.190> gonna<00:04:10.280> step<00:04:10.610> inside<00:04:10.820> here

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
now okay so we're gonna step inside here

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.199 
now okay so we're gonna step inside here
and<00:04:12.130> before<00:04:13.130> we<00:04:13.250> step<00:04:13.459> inside<00:04:13.580> I've<00:04:13.910> got<00:04:14.120> to

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209

red paint one single stripe all around
the<00:04:30.560> walls<00:04:30.770> pretty<00:04:31.190> awesome<00:04:31.610> pretty<00:04:31.940> awesome

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
the walls pretty awesome pretty awesome

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.790 
the walls pretty awesome pretty awesome
one<00:04:32.750> thing<00:04:32.870> I<00:04:32.930> forgot<00:04:33.080> to<00:04:33.230> mention<00:04:33.440> too<00:04:33.770> is

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
one thing I forgot to mention too is

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.890 
one thing I forgot to mention too is
they're<00:04:34.070> gonna<00:04:34.160> be<00:04:34.250> adding<00:04:34.760> stone<00:04:35.630> walls

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
they're gonna be adding stone walls

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.840 
they're gonna be adding stone walls
which<00:04:36.500> is<00:04:36.770> pretty<00:04:37.340> awesome

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
which is pretty awesome

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.450 
which is pretty awesome
so<00:04:38.630> metal<00:04:39.050> seems<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:39.470> be<00:04:39.590> too<00:04:39.890> expensive<00:04:40.220> at

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
so metal seems to be too expensive at

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.850 
so metal seems to be too expensive at
the<00:04:40.490> moment<00:04:40.850> to<00:04:41.510> be<00:04:41.600> honest<00:04:41.870> for<00:04:42.350> a<00:04:42.410> base<00:04:42.590> this

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
the moment to be honest for a base this

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.910 
the moment to be honest for a base this
size<00:04:43.160> you<00:04:43.520> probably<00:04:44.000> will<00:04:44.180> not<00:04:44.710> surround<00:04:45.710> all

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
size you probably will not surround all

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.310 
size you probably will not surround all
these<00:04:46.100> walls<00:04:46.340> with<00:04:46.550> metal

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
these walls with metal

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.290 
these walls with metal
Ravi's<00:04:48.320> readings<00:04:48.740> as<00:04:48.950> we<00:04:49.850> I<00:04:49.880> don't<00:04:50.090> think<00:04:50.240> we

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
Ravi's readings as we I don't think we

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.880 
Ravi's readings as we I don't think we
have<00:04:50.419> enough<00:04:50.450> manpower<00:04:50.840> but<00:04:51.320> what<00:04:51.410> we<00:04:51.530> will<00:04:51.680> do

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
have enough manpower but what we will do

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.460 
have enough manpower but what we will do
is<00:04:52.100> probably<00:04:52.310> create<00:04:52.730> a<00:04:52.790> separate<00:04:53.180> building

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
is probably create a separate building

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.450 
is probably create a separate building
and<00:04:54.470> that'll<00:04:54.710> be<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:54.800> metal<00:04:55.100> building<00:04:55.190> but

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
and that'll be the metal building but

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.250 
and that'll be the metal building but
stone<00:04:55.700> walls<00:04:55.970> we<00:04:56.210> might<00:04:56.450> be<00:04:56.570> able<00:04:56.690> to<00:04:56.810> do<00:04:56.930> I'm

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
stone walls we might be able to do I'm

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.890 
stone walls we might be able to do I'm
not<00:04:57.290> sure<00:04:57.650> how<00:04:57.800> much<00:04:57.950> they<00:04:58.130> cost<00:04:58.370> but<00:04:58.940> we<00:04:59.600> might

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
not sure how much they cost but we might

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.010 
not sure how much they cost but we might
be<00:04:59.930> able<00:05:00.110> to<00:05:00.380> do<00:05:00.530> that<00:05:00.740> all<00:05:01.160> right<00:05:01.220> so<00:05:02.020> one

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
be able to do that all right so one

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.840 
be able to do that all right so one
thing<00:05:03.230> I'm<00:05:03.350> going<00:05:03.470> to<00:05:03.530> show<00:05:03.770> you<00:05:03.830> before<00:05:04.580> we

look<00:05:05.090> into<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.450> start<00:05:05.660> building<00:05:05.930> here<00:05:06.110> is

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
look into the start building here is
