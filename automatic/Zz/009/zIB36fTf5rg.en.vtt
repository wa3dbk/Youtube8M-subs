see a light that's the bus the bus will
come<00:00:31.109> through<00:00:31.529> later<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.550> an

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
come through later in this it's like an

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.750 
come through later in this it's like an
interactive<00:00:33.360> thing<00:00:33.570> it's<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.620> movie<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.579> bus

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
interactive thing it's a movie the bus

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.580 
interactive thing it's a movie the bus
drives<00:00:36.239> through<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.840> I'll<00:00:36.960> show<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
drives through and I'll show that in the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.610 
drives through and I'll show that in the
next<00:00:37.710> picture<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.870> there's<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.020> bus<00:00:40.200> that's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
next picture but there's the bus that's

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.470 
next picture but there's the bus that's
the<00:00:40.800> light<00:00:40.980> here's<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> diner<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.270> and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the light here's the diner this is and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.290 
the light here's the diner this is and
there's<00:00:42.809> lava<00:00:43.020> lava<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.129> spraying<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:44.969> which

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
there's lava lava is spraying up which

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.610 
there's lava lava is spraying up which
is<00:00:45.450> definitely<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.140> an<00:00:46.230> effect<00:00:46.320> on

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
is definitely going to have an effect on

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.650 
is definitely going to have an effect on
the<00:00:46.770> game<00:00:46.950> how<00:00:47.579> maybe<00:00:47.969> it'll<00:00:48.180> slow<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.420> down

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the game how maybe it'll slow you down

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.450 
the game how maybe it'll slow you down
and<00:00:49.079> maybe<00:00:49.230> it'll<00:00:49.530> stop<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:50.129> from<00:00:50.280> running

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and maybe it'll stop you from running

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.150 
and maybe it'll stop you from running
trains<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.660> could<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.930> big<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:52.770> it's<00:00:52.920> very

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
trains that could be big but it's very

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.299 
trains that could be big but it's very
colorful<00:00:53.940> image<00:00:54.600> there's<00:00:55.020> dust<00:00:55.710> falling<00:00:56.100> from

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
colorful image there's dust falling from

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.819 
colorful image there's dust falling from
the<00:00:56.460> sky<00:00:56.820> trees<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> background<00:00:58.050> kind<00:00:58.710> of

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the sky trees in the background kind of

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.680 
the sky trees in the background kind of
spooky<00:00:59.190> all<00:00:59.789> right<00:00:59.879> let's<00:01:00.059> move<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
spooky all right let's move on to the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.389 
spooky all right let's move on to the
next<00:01:00.719> picture<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.219> be

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
next picture and this is going to be

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.179 
next picture and this is going to be
where<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.449> bus<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.049> coming<00:01:04.439> up<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:04.979> now<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
where the bus is coming up so now the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.850 
where the bus is coming up so now the
buses<00:01:05.610> drove<00:01:05.939> over<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.570> lava<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.140> clearly<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
buses drove over the lava so clearly the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.950 
buses drove over the lava so clearly the
bus<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.159> not<00:01:08.189> affected<00:01:08.790> by<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> lava<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.750> is

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
bus is not affected by the lava that is

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.710 
bus is not affected by the lava that is
very<00:01:10.080> interesting<00:01:10.790> maybe<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.090> could<00:01:12.390> like

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
very interesting maybe that could like

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.060 
very interesting maybe that could like
if<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.990> can't<00:01:13.229> get<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:13.680> maybe<00:01:13.830> there's

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
if you can't get there maybe there's

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.350 
if you can't get there maybe there's
parts<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> map<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:14.820> blocked<00:01:15.090> off<00:01:15.330> by

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
parts of the map that are blocked off by

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.429 
parts of the map that are blocked off by
lava<00:01:15.810> could<00:01:16.799> be<00:01:17.009> that's<00:01:17.580> what<00:01:17.729> I'm<00:01:17.820> thinking

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
lava could be that's what I'm thinking

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.179 
lava could be that's what I'm thinking
so<00:01:20.030> also<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:22.020> bus<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.439> used<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:22.890> know<00:01:23.040> it's

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
so also the bus is used we know it's

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.710 
so also the bus is used we know it's
used<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.700> an<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:23.970> maybe<00:01:24.210> an<00:01:24.299> escape

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
used as like an it's maybe an escape

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.780 
used as like an it's maybe an escape
route<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.799> get<00:01:25.950> away<00:01:26.070> from<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.490> hordes<00:01:26.700> of

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
route to get away from the hordes of

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.640 
route to get away from the hordes of
zombies<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.360> i'll<00:01:28.049> show<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.439> quote

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
zombies and i'll show the quote

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.620 
zombies and i'll show the quote
momentarily<00:01:29.640> but<00:01:30.060> there<00:01:30.270> was<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> quote

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
momentarily but there was a quote

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.370 
momentarily but there was a quote
released<00:01:31.049> about<00:01:31.250> about<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:33.060> drop<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.930> leads

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
released about about the drop that leads

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.319 
released about about the drop that leads
to<00:01:34.619> my<00:01:35.159> conclusion<00:01:35.729> was<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:37.740> diner<00:01:38.329> kind

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
to my conclusion was and the diner kind

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
wonder I wonder if I was kind of hoping

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.740 
wonder I wonder if I was kind of hoping
that<00:01:53.579> maybe<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.880> could<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.149> climb<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.630> on
