currently training and then there's a

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.859 
currently training and then there's a
few<00:02:04.979> other<00:02:05.009> options<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.789> Black<00:02:06.270> Knight<00:02:06.569> and

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
few other options like Black Knight and

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.380 
few other options like Black Knight and
once<00:02:07.619> Black<00:02:07.920> Knight<00:02:08.160> puts<00:02:08.520> blood<00:02:08.789> curse<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.300> an

to have to wait through two of their

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.190 
to have to wait through two of their
attacks<00:03:05.270> like<00:03:06.270> I<00:03:06.390> said<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.780> counter-attack

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
attacks like I said the counter-attack

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.710 
attacks like I said the counter-attack
is<00:03:07.380> going<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.709> be<00:03:07.800> rolling<00:03:07.980> now<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:09.270> doesn't

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
is going to be rolling now it doesn't

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.840 
is going to be rolling now it doesn't
require<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.230> much<00:03:10.290> set<00:03:10.739> up<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.070> with<00:03:11.370> Aries

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
require that much set up and with Aries

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.810 
require that much set up and with Aries
it<00:03:12.209> requires<00:03:12.540> even<00:03:12.930> less<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:14.190> difference<00:03:14.640> is

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
it requires even less the difference is

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.460 
it requires even less the difference is
with<00:03:15.000> saber-tooth<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.810> will<00:03:15.989> have<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.260> cast

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
with saber-tooth you will have to cast

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.830 
with saber-tooth you will have to cast
his<00:03:16.709> berserker<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:18.150> only<00:03:18.390> thing<00:03:18.570> I<00:03:18.660> like

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
his berserker the only thing I like

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.199 
his berserker the only thing I like
about<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:19.170> is<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.709> kicks<00:03:19.920> in<00:03:20.100> quite<00:03:20.520> often<00:03:20.790> has

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
about it is it kicks in quite often has

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.560 
about it is it kicks in quite often has
a<00:03:21.720> really<00:03:22.110> high<00:03:22.200> proc<00:03:22.650> rate<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.130> love<00:03:23.370> that

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
a really high proc rate so I love that

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.970 
a really high proc rate so I love that
now<00:03:24.570> as<00:03:24.750> this<00:03:24.930> wave<00:03:25.170> is<00:03:25.380> finished<00:03:25.830> from

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
that's why I've been farming this

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.229 
that's why I've been farming this
mission<00:03:45.750> specifically<00:03:46.580> anyways<00:03:47.580> this<00:03:47.820> battle

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
mission specifically anyways this battle

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.580 
mission specifically anyways this battle
should<00:03:48.480> get<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.690> little<00:03:49.019> bit<00:03:49.170> more<00:03:49.350> interesting

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
should get a little bit more interesting

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.520 
should get a little bit more interesting
now<00:03:49.860> we're<00:03:50.730> facing<00:03:51.060> too<00:03:51.540> many<00:03:51.750> bosses<00:03:52.019> and

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
now we're facing too many bosses and

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.789 
now we're facing too many bosses and
hammerhead<00:03:53.840> my<00:03:54.840> agents<00:03:55.260> actually<00:03:55.440> getting

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
hammerhead my agents actually getting

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.160 
hammerhead my agents actually getting
kind<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.250> low<00:03:56.459> on<00:03:56.610> health<00:03:56.870> but<00:03:57.870> we're<00:03:57.989> not<00:03:58.140> even

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
kind of low on health but we're not even

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.650 
kind of low on health but we're not even
going<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.590> worry<00:03:58.680> about<00:03:58.950> healing<00:03:59.340> them

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
going to worry about healing them

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.880 
going to worry about healing them
instead<00:04:00.660> I'm<00:04:00.810> going<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.019> use<00:04:01.080> quick<00:04:01.500> reflexes

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
instead I'm going to use quick reflexes

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.479 
instead I'm going to use quick reflexes
and<00:04:02.459> then<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.330> probability<00:04:04.080> filled<00:04:04.380> but<00:04:05.220> yes

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
and then in probability filled but yes

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.009 
and then in probability filled but yes
this<00:04:05.700> field<00:04:05.970> could<00:04:06.269> give<00:04:06.480> them<00:04:06.570> some<00:04:06.810> healing

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
this field could give them some healing

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.500 
this field could give them some healing
if<00:04:07.290> we're<00:04:07.470> lucky<00:04:07.650> enough<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.760> course<00:04:09.330> the

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
if we're lucky enough of course the

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.690 
if we're lucky enough of course the
light<00:04:09.690> fantastic<00:04:09.900> would<00:04:10.650> guaranteed<00:04:11.220> heal<00:04:11.489> us

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
light fantastic would guaranteed heal us

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.009 
light fantastic would guaranteed heal us
well<00:04:12.690> let's<00:04:12.870> go<00:04:13.019> with<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.260> field<00:04:13.530> instead

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
well let's go with the field instead

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.690

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.980 
right this unfortunately isn't a perfect
setup<00:05:27.180> but<00:05:28.180> still<00:05:28.449> we're<00:05:28.599> going<00:05:28.720> to<00:05:28.780> go<00:05:28.900> ahead

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
setup but still we're going to go ahead

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.839 
setup but still we're going to go ahead
and<00:05:29.110> use<00:05:29.380> it<00:05:29.590> because<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:29.979> battle<00:05:30.340> is<00:05:30.490> going

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
and use it because the battle is going

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.270 
and use it because the battle is going
to<00:05:31.000> end<00:05:31.150> pretty<00:05:31.449> soon<00:05:31.770> alright<00:05:32.770> so<00:05:32.949> now<00:05:33.130> we're

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
to end pretty soon alright so now we're

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.770 
to end pretty soon alright so now we're
going<00:05:33.370> to<00:05:33.430> have<00:05:33.550> to<00:05:33.639> sit<00:05:33.880> through<00:05:33.909> for<00:05:34.419> tax

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
going to have to sit through for tax

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.920 
going to have to sit through for tax
from<00:05:35.349> the<00:05:35.500> bosses<00:05:36.300> unfortunately<00:05:37.300> my<00:05:37.509> agent

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
from the bosses unfortunately my agent

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.740 
from the bosses unfortunately my agent
ends<00:05:38.229> up<00:05:38.319> being<00:05:38.530> unable<00:05:38.889> to<00:05:38.949> counter-attack

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
ends up being unable to counter-attack

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.909 
ends up being unable to counter-attack
so<00:05:40.750> it's<00:05:40.930> going<00:05:41.139> to<00:05:41.229> leave<00:05:41.409> these<00:05:41.620> bosses

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
so it's going to leave these bosses

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.950 
so it's going to leave these bosses
