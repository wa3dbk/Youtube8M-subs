hi<00:00:09.360> in<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:09.929> video<00:00:10.200> we'll<00:00:10.530> be<00:00:10.589> looking<00:00:10.709> at<00:00:11.099> the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
hi in this video we'll be looking at the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.759 
hi in this video we'll be looking at the
full<00:00:11.549> processes<00:00:12.209> of<00:00:12.389> coastal<00:00:12.809> erosion<00:00:12.840> which

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
full processes of coastal erosion which

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.460 
full processes of coastal erosion which
is<00:00:13.949> evident<00:00:14.340> on<00:00:14.429> all<00:00:14.580> coastlines<00:00:15.470> bringing

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
is evident on all coastlines bringing

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.100 
is evident on all coastlines bringing

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.170 
but crack gets bigger solution chemicals
and<00:00:43.440> see<00:00:43.590> what<00:00:43.800> dissolves<00:00:44.280> rock<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:44.940> chalk

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
and see what dissolves rock like chalk

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.260 
and see what dissolves rock like chalk
or<00:00:45.329> limestone<00:00:46.130> attrition<00:00:47.130> eroded<00:00:47.700> particles

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
in the water break into smaller

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.680 
in the water break into smaller
fragments<00:00:49.860> as<00:00:50.579> they<00:00:50.730> smash<00:00:51.000> into<00:00:51.210> each<00:00:51.360> other

water scrape against rock and remove
small<00:00:56.700> fragments<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:57.660> question<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.170> why

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
small fragments so the question is why

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.350 
small fragments so the question is why
are<00:00:58.620> some<00:00:59.040> areas<00:00:59.310> more<00:00:59.700> prone<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.940> erosion

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
are some areas more prone to erosion

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.110 
are some areas more prone to erosion
