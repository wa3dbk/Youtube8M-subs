00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.480
 put the hand we find patrick 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.670
 cooking teacher and disciples 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.930
 escoffier and we will introduce you 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.980
 scrambled eggs then in terms 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.320
 ingredients what we need 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.060
 well there it is simple eggs of the 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.949
 pepper salt for seasoning and 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.280
 butter for cooking nothing more 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.460
 simple 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.590
 in less of them than we go so 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.410
 to mix beat it is a few 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.559
 touching up to low on account 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.690
 between 2 to 3 e per person everything depends 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.159
 usage of use that we go in 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.629
 to do ok we will season salt pepper 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:42.280
 mix well 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.589
 during this time I will take my 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.079
 pots better put it to heat and 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.420
 I will put a good nutty 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.789
 of butter to learn in my pans 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.409
 our there now I'm going to incorporated 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:58.989
 but them and I will then stir up so 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.609
 adjust the intensity of my fire so 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.549
 it can not be too fast 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.700
 I will move the whole surface all the way 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:07.720
 bottom of your containers so as to 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.330
 take off so the eyes that go 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.280
 start to coagulate basically on the 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.630
 walls of a container then there what 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.090
 is important in cooking eggs 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.860
 scrambled this is where cooking point does not 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.810
 not too much to cook them effect tillon 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.210
 overcook they will be dry in the mouth 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.670
 will not be nice they have to 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.550
 remain soft creamy if by chance 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.650
 they were overcooked in this case 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.420
 we add at the last moment a 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.590
 little bit of crème fraîche for their 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.300
 give a little smoothness 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.980
 besides I have not seen drags not sure 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.070
 that's why we hope we're going 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.540
 to cook the first time then 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.820
 so we start getting a mix 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.190
 which thickens and if it goes too fast 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.400
 how about on induction do not need 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.690
 be afraid to shift a little bit and 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.260
 to finish cooking as there is 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.510
 the inertia in the container we are going 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.180
 dispose in the top we will feast 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.570
 it was the water bar scrambled 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.860
 thank you button and see you soon 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.860
