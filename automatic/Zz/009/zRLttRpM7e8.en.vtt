dead spots during the ride but these are
mainly<00:04:07.970> used<00:04:08.090> for<00:04:08.299> turning<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.810> train<00:04:09.049> around

riders scream train gets slower ride

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.120 
riders scream train gets slower ride
gets<00:04:22.760> boring<00:04:23.090> okay<00:04:24.050> so<00:04:24.110> most<00:04:24.320> rides<00:04:24.650> get<00:04:24.889> away

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130

with<00:04:25.310> that<00:04:25.750> nemesis<00:04:26.750> is<00:04:26.900> fastest<00:04:27.410> point<00:04:27.740> is

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
with that nemesis is fastest point is

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.070 
with that nemesis is fastest point is
right<00:04:28.160> here<00:04:28.520> before<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.060> loop<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.690> gets

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
right here before the loop it gets

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.689 
right here before the loop it gets
faster<00:04:30.320> throughout<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:31.010> circuit<00:04:31.220> hence

never really feels slow my main critique

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.210 
never really feels slow my main critique
of<00:04:34.729> nemesis<00:04:35.180> is<00:04:35.570> that<00:04:35.900> it's<00:04:36.080> rough<00:04:36.410> but<00:04:37.160> it's

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
of nemesis is that it's rough but it's

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.150 
of nemesis is that it's rough but it's
16<00:04:37.789> years<00:04:38.000> old<00:04:38.240> as<00:04:38.389> well<00:04:38.539> so<00:04:39.020> you<00:04:39.590> can<00:04:39.770> kind<00:04:40.010> of

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
16 years old as well so you can kind of

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.969 
16 years old as well so you can kind of
forgive<00:04:40.430> it<00:04:40.550> for<00:04:40.729> that<00:04:40.850> somewhat<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:42.680> this<00:04:42.860> is

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
forgive it for that somewhat so this is

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:44.560 
forgive it for that somewhat so this is
the<00:04:43.070> part<00:04:43.280> of<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.490> review<00:04:43.820> where<00:04:44.000> I<00:04:44.030> rate<00:04:44.389> the

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
the part of the review where I rate the

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.870 
the part of the review where I rate the
ride<00:04:44.780> in<00:04:44.990> three<00:04:45.229> categories<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:46.010> overall

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
ride in three categories and overall

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.690 
ride in three categories and overall
first<00:04:47.510> visual<00:04:47.900> appeal<00:04:48.260> and<00:04:48.440> theme<00:04:48.680> I<00:04:48.950> think

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
first visual appeal and theme I think

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.300 
first visual appeal and theme I think
the<00:04:50.150> theming<00:04:50.510> on<00:04:50.660> nemesis<00:04:51.080> is<00:04:51.320> fantastic<00:04:52.039> and

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
the theming on nemesis is fantastic and

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.310 
the theming on nemesis is fantastic and
the<00:04:52.910> scenery<00:04:53.300> in<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.479> setting<00:04:53.840> just<00:04:53.990> creates

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
the scenery in the setting just creates

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.469 
the scenery in the setting just creates
a<00:04:54.380> wonderfully<00:04:54.889> intense<00:04:55.190> atmosphere<00:04:55.880> so<00:04:56.360> I'm

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
a wonderfully intense atmosphere so I'm

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.339 
a wonderfully intense atmosphere so I'm
giving<00:04:56.780> it<00:04:56.900> 9<00:04:57.550> design<00:04:58.550> an<00:04:58.729> operation<00:04:59.360> this

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
giving it 9 design an operation this

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:02.080 
giving it 9 design an operation this
ride<00:05:00.650> was<00:05:00.800> very<00:05:01.070> well<00:05:01.340> planned<00:05:01.550> for<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:01.880> space

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
ride was very well planned for the space

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.089 
ride was very well planned for the space
given<00:05:02.539> the<00:05:02.870> ride<00:05:03.050> interactions<00:05:03.680> were<00:05:03.800> the<00:05:03.919> key

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
given the ride interactions were the key

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:05.469 
given the ride interactions were the key
work<00:05:04.310> brilliantly<00:05:04.580> to<00:05:04.970> build<00:05:05.150> anticipation

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
work brilliantly to build anticipation

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.020 
work brilliantly to build anticipation
and<00:05:06.200> the<00:05:06.560> scenery<00:05:06.860> interactions<00:05:07.550> on<00:05:07.729> the<00:05:07.820> ride

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
and the scenery interactions on the ride

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.440 
and the scenery interactions on the ride
make<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:08.539> ride<00:05:08.750> even<00:05:09.110> better<00:05:09.789> and<00:05:10.789> thanks<00:05:11.360> to

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
make the ride even better and thanks to

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.180 
make the ride even better and thanks to
the<00:05:11.539> prompt<00:05:11.780> dispatching<00:05:12.380> of<00:05:12.500> trains<00:05:12.830> on<00:05:12.979> this

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
the prompt dispatching of trains on this

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.770 
the prompt dispatching of trains on this
ride<00:05:13.430> you<00:05:13.610> won't<00:05:13.849> have<00:05:14.000> to<00:05:14.150> wait<00:05:14.300> too<00:05:14.330> long

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
ride you won't have to wait too long

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.770 
ride you won't have to wait too long
compared<00:05:15.260> to<00:05:15.410> some<00:05:15.590> others<00:05:15.889> at<00:05:16.190> Alton<00:05:16.520> Towers

so<00:05:17.780> I'm<00:05:18.139> going<00:05:18.320> to<00:05:18.410> give<00:05:18.530> it<00:05:18.650> a<00:05:18.800> 9<00:05:19.280> the<00:05:19.820> physical

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
so I'm going to give it a 9 the physical

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.839 
so I'm going to give it a 9 the physical
ride<00:05:20.479> the<00:05:21.200> layout<00:05:21.500> of<00:05:21.530> nemesis<00:05:22.130> very<00:05:22.430> well<00:05:22.639> put

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
ride the layout of nemesis very well put

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.610 
ride the layout of nemesis very well put
together<00:05:23.000> producing<00:05:23.870> a<00:05:23.930> mixture<00:05:24.229> of<00:05:24.320> fast

are<00:05:27.200> a<00:05:27.229> few<00:05:27.470> moments<00:05:27.860> of<00:05:27.979> roughness<00:05:28.190> but<00:05:28.580> it's

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
are a few moments of roughness but it's

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.950 
are a few moments of roughness but it's
worth<00:05:29.000> it<00:05:30.580> 9

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.910 
nemesis is a first-class ride some say
it's<00:05:37.150> overrated<00:05:37.720> but<00:05:37.870> I<00:05:38.020> personally<00:05:38.530> think<00:05:38.740> it

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
it's overrated but I personally think it

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.250 
it's overrated but I personally think it
earns<00:05:39.100> a<00:05:39.250> high<00:05:39.430> ranking<00:05:39.850> for<00:05:40.060> its<00:05:40.180> design<00:05:40.540> it's

earns a high ranking for its design it's

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.990 
earns a high ranking for its design it's
certainly<00:05:41.680> not<00:05:41.890> perfect<00:05:42.100> but<00:05:42.550> all<00:05:42.730> of<00:05:42.850> its

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000

certainly not perfect but all of its

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160

well<00:05:45.370> and<00:05:45.670> for<00:05:46.150> that<00:05:46.270> I<00:05:46.480> give<00:05:46.750> nemesis<00:05:47.200> 9<00:05:47.440> out

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650
