says<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> speaker<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.060> small<00:01:09.390> portable<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
says the speaker is small portable and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.780 
says the speaker is small portable and
lightweight<00:01:10.140> while<00:01:10.979> all<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.250> those<00:01:11.369> are<00:01:11.549> true

lightweight while all of those are true
I<00:01:12.000> still<00:01:12.060> think<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.810> decently<00:01:13.229> thick

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
I still think it's a decently thick

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.350 
I still think it's a decently thick
product<00:01:13.950> obviously<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.670> not<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> cell<00:01:15.119> phone

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
product obviously it's not a cell phone

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.359 
product obviously it's not a cell phone
so<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:15.960> expect<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.890> little<00:01:17.159> bit<00:01:17.250> of

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
so you do expect to have a little bit of

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.399 
so you do expect to have a little bit of
bulk<00:01:17.549> carrying<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.090> around<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.840> audio<00:01:19.170> is

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
bulk carrying it around the audio is

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.469 
bulk carrying it around the audio is
loud<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.770> very<00:01:20.189> room<00:01:20.610> filling<00:01:20.939> connecting
