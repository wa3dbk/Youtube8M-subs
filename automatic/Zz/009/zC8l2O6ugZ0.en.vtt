00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.730
 or not 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:27.849
 and I hope that with this I stay very much 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.969
 and that's why today we're going to teach you 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.349
 how to make an exquisite breakfast with what 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:34.690
 What we have left of the payment in this case 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.219
 we have the dark part of the flesh 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.780
 and what we did ingredients 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.360
 quickly let's grab or we'll 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.730
 buy turkey carnitas roll bread 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.730
 purple tomatoes 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:56.560
 it's fresh and super super super easy 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.690
 so he had a great and says nothing of 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.489
 that's not but we're going to use a sauce 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.200
 since it is much healthier 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.689
 of larry then and richer then 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.119
 here we have the bread can you buy this 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.770
 or they can buy the French bread that is 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.189
 a little bit more toasted 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:19.140
 add a little bit of the pesto sauce 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:24.520
 pesto can already buy it made that not 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.590
 can be prey and payment exactly 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.750
 that's why we're going to make the payment 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.729
 carnitas then this is what they are going to 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.069
 give a lot of olive oil a lot 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.829
 Canola oil is going to fry it and that's how it is 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:39.090
 how they look and see there is a rich effect 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.090
 and one out there 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.110
 what he wants in this case I want it 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.060
 the usual as they say here is that 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.009
 nothing then let's put a little bit 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.009
 of quesito fernÃ¡ndez 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.860
 I will pass a teaspoon do not splash 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.600
 what we normally eat is true that 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.600
 we eat a little the cranberries 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.980
 with an accent in a sweet taste between 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.959
 tunisia and salty sweet and sour we're going 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.190
 to add a little mixed lettuce 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:20.920
 and this is called being Chilean 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.860
 hold the sea and cast more for a 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.810
 little carnitas and is that the rod 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:38.680
 as this payment unit says a lot 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:41.290
 every night this turkey is detaching 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.000
 with the family and you are respect and what 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.980
 we can serve in this way I that 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.980
 I made the base with the family too 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.450
 they all made a potato salad 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.310
 others did good more or less there and 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.680
 you can place it and you can 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.530
 place some cherry tomatoes around 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.000
 we'm here to present what 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.530
 I like it is that all these ingredients 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.940
 they are what we already had in the box 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.470
 because even the baby juan know that 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.480
 there had no truth until it 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.989
 buy nothing, do not buy anything 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.989
 of the other 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:18.680
 you can use and we can swim 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.780
 put the bread together with that I want to eat 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.359
 we always have something here that 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.670
 we call a taquito you know is his girlfriend 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.410
 and well let's show him why 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.290
 is that it does not cook us if you make a taco 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.940
 to sit down a kick drum we're going 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.299
 to commission a little dance 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.299

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.070
 what moving the hip but 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.300

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:57.050
