00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.200

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.039
 I prepared for you 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.130

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.189
 cold which is a beautiful suggestion of 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.939
 appetizer the shallow end is in the air and amd 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.210
 house liked the idea and really this 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.730
 type of appetizer 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.890
 you can be serving it cold or 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.430
 hot and very practical you too 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.790
 may be alternating the ingredients I 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.680
 I'm using some ingredients and you 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.500
 may be using other cycles in 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.320
 the taste of your guests 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.730
 check out what we're going to use 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:58.020
 she ham cherry tomato onion 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.420
 petals olive oil and salt to taste 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.230
 and you will also need toothpicks 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.780
 wood 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.930
 I'm going to cut not into too much pieces 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:12.439
 It is not difficult to 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:15.619
 he hold on the skewer medium size 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.619
 generous here 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:28.130
 I'm not half this much, either. 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.290
 used for you to make those 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.770
 appetizers a little bit smaller I go back 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.480
 using the conventional toothpick but 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.480
 you may also be using a 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.810
 huge skewer here with one as a 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.370
 appetizer he too would fall would cool 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.950
 For you it's a spectacle. 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:51.770
 only that the size of the cut would have to 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.770
 be a slightly smaller right section also 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.780
 and only 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.689
 Good, now let's start putting together the 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.819
 related 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:24.829
 check me look make lunch only 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:31.970

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:34.390
 the cherry tomatoe an onion is a 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.390
 petal 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.180
 legal bigger square here 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.379
 repeating 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:56.359
 only she is a very very cool thing 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.390
 also if you like it, right she is 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:02.120
 using a quail egg as 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:07.010
 appetizer also very nice an idea 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.500
 very very simple and your guests 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.609
 really will love being a 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.670
 cool appetizer 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.670
 O 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.530
 our appetizer recipe is already 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.980
 ready 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.000
 It's like I said at the beginning it's the 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.709
 The next time you could be serving cold 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.110
 or hot I'll serve hot then 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.810
 next step I'll show you in two 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.629
 for you guys have an idea and then I 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.879
 I'm going to make the others prepare. 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.700
 olive oil 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.319
 who likes a pepper could 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.150
 now it was time to be doing 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:55.150
 placing a pepper 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.150
 cheeky 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:10.910
 Look what's going to make a fantastic one. 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:11.810
 warming it up let's take it just by remembering 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.230
 friend of the house 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.660
 if the fire has a little high 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.810
 place the brazier a little 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.729
 so he does not receive the fire 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.729
 very very direct 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:35.789
 more or less the time 56 minutes is just 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:43.830
 that being our skewer is already 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:43.830
 delicious taum an aroma in the studio 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:53.229
 I'll remember we made the choice to 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:05:00.630
 to be serving the heated skewer 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:05:00.630
 now that touch is a tidy 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.870
 look at the idea 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.490
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.280
 today's recipe and even barbecue has 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.210
 much more want to see more revenue than 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.490
 on here 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.469
 now if you want a suggestion from 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.780
 go back to the funeral 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:35.780
 A lot of peace, a lot of light, stay with God. 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.480
