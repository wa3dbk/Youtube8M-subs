00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:13.180
 eclairs dough we need 100 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.480
 gram flour 100 grams butter 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.310
 200 grams 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:23.810
 1 pinch of salt and egg if small 3 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:29.689
 if big 2 first we need salt 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:36.100
 a pinch of salt add some flour 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:36.100
 pot pour 200 grams of water 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.160
 put oil and heat up 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.690
 the oil to the water melted and the water begins 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.690
 to boil 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.199
 only boil water needs to be removed from the fire 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.290
 pan and add flour 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.500
 now I'll show my water already 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.649
 start means start to boil all at once 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:19.640
 we collect from the fire for another comfort 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:25.740
 add the flour and salt in one fell swoop 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:28.670
 here's how and immediately stir 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.670
 vigorously 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:50.520
 here flour has become homogeneous with set 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:56.020
 on the fire pan and another two or three minutes 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:04.210
 on fire like that constantly stirring and and 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:07.450
 bring to readiness it's a Tess no more 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:13.600
 two or three minutes everything is very fast 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:17.140
 done but constantly stirring now i'm 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.200
 will show when the dough is ready as it is 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.440
 should look like 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.819
 when the dough begins to fall behind the walls 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.870
 pans 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.959
 that's when she cooked then you can 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:40.480
 make it back this ball I'll show 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:43.510
 how to check too much is not necessary 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.650
 hold because everything is 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.840
 water water then oven rises 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:57.519
 dough up and it turns out in the middle 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:01.239
 corner of the void and you can put the cream if 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.519
 your garden would evaporate when it doesn't 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.130
 will rise 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:12.739
 so you need to do everything quickly not 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:18.049
 too long now let's check 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.049
 if the ball rolls out like that 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:27.730
 Tess is removed from the walls, so we 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.730
 ready but the dough I have ready and 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:36.620
 turn off the fire and leave the dough to 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.889
 shots somewhere up to temperature 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.019
 40 37 degrees so that it can be here 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:44.389
 so touch your fingers and you already see that 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.930
 on warm then already start adding 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.930
 eggs 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:53.599
 when the dough is a little shot we can 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:58.040
 like that touch finger add eggs 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:04:00.409
 on the dough like this do not to the bottom 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.680
 pots because she's still hot she 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:09.639
 dough one by one 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:14.810
 separately break into a plate and pour in and 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:17.560
 immediately very quickly we stir up 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.560
 homogeneous mass 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.830
 must be of a uniform consistency 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:30.419
 the dough should soak up the face well and then 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.419
 add the following 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.790
 well absorbed and now add 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.790
 next egg 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.130
 same we stir well until homogeneous 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:19.560
 consistency only then can 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:25.920
 add more to understand when ready 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:34.200
 dough already need to check it out now 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:40.050
 show stir well then take on 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:44.610
 spoon and if here so slowly it falls 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:50.760
 and leaves such here 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:53.720
 slowly slowly falls off the spoon and here 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.870
 such leave traces 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.870
 she doesn't 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:06.110
 here it is, then it is already ready 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:12.220
 and you can bake and make small 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:16.900
 balls at a distance let's say 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.900
 because not then inflate yet 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.320
 I put a little oil on a baking sheet 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.870
 so that they lag well afterwards when 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:38.210
 come out of the oven 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:40.070
 then take water and finger winter 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.520
 grease here tips one by one 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.520
 a drop of water 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.040
 put on the tip 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:54.260
 and put the oven warmed to 180 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:56.640
 degrees for 15-20 minutes is already 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:07:00.950
 depending on the oven 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.950
 each a little bit different 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:31.419
 Here we have such 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:35.680
 well pouted it is necessary to fill them only 

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:37.539
 or sweet or salty me 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.249
 will show in the following recipes 

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:49.080
 different fillings and sweet and salty 

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:49.080
 take one and show in the middle 

00:07:54.870 --> 00:08:02.080
 that's how much happened 

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:04.110
 eclairs from 100 grams of flour 100 grams 

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:09.930
 butter and three eggs 

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:12.930
 case 35 pieces and it took one hour 

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.930
 smooth
