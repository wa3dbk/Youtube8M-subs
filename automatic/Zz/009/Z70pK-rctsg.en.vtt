build<00:00:04.529> in<00:00:04.950> this<00:00:05.609> video<00:00:05.850> I'll<00:00:05.910> be<00:00:05.940> giving<00:00:06.270> you

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
build in this video I'll be giving you

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.830 
build in this video I'll be giving you
an<00:00:06.629> unboxing<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.379> overview<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.280> msi<00:00:08.760> h<00:00:09.030> 67

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
an unboxing and overview of the msi h 67

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.220 
an unboxing and overview of the msi h 67
ma<00:00:10.200> e<00:00:10.800> 35<00:00:11.550> motherboard<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.780> this<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.080> obviously

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
ma e 35 motherboard so this is obviously

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.369 
ma e 35 motherboard so this is obviously
based<00:00:13.769> off<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:13.980> intel's<00:00:14.519> h<00:00:14.759> 67<00:00:15.450> chipset<00:00:15.870> so

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
based off of intel's h 67 chipset so

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.840 
based off of intel's h 67 chipset so
this<00:00:16.529> supports<00:00:16.920> Intel's<00:00:17.400> Sandy<00:00:17.640> Bridge

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
this supports Intel's Sandy Bridge

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.929 
this supports Intel's Sandy Bridge
processors<00:00:18.029> using<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.960> 1155<00:00:19.710> socket<00:00:20.160> as<00:00:20.880> a

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
processors using the 1155 socket as a

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.179 
processors using the 1155 socket as a
built-in<00:00:21.390> HDMI<00:00:21.779> port<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.470> course<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.859> supports

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
built-in HDMI port of course it supports

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.009 
built-in HDMI port of course it supports
Windows<00:00:23.460> 7<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.939> might<00:00:24.480> try<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.720> hackintosh

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
Windows 7 I might try and hackintosh

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.960 
Windows 7 I might try and hackintosh
this<00:00:25.320> computer<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.859> install<00:00:25.980> Lion<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.730> so

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
this computer to install Lion on it so

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.970 
this computer to install Lion on it so
if<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.900> at<00:00:27.990> least<00:00:28.050> get<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.380> installed<00:00:28.769> and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
if I can at least get it installed and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.320 
if I can at least get it installed and
booted<00:00:29.250> then<00:00:29.429> everything<00:00:29.849> else<00:00:29.939> should<00:00:30.150> work

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
booted then everything else should work

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.590 
booted then everything else should work
just<00:00:30.660> fine<00:00:30.929> as<00:00:31.730> I<00:00:32.730> mentioned<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.149> supports

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
just fine as I mentioned it supports

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.660 
just fine as I mentioned it supports
Intel's<00:00:34.079> Sandy<00:00:34.410> Bridge<00:00:34.680> processors<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.579> it

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
Intel's Sandy Bridge processors and it

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.810 
Intel's Sandy Bridge processors and it
uses<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.030> age<00:00:36.180> 67<00:00:36.750> chipset<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:38.250> also<00:00:38.370> has<00:00:38.579> USB

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
uses the age 67 chipset it also has USB

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.869 
uses the age 67 chipset it also has USB
3.0<00:00:39.480> SATA<00:00:39.930> 6<00:00:40.230> gigabits<00:00:40.350> per<00:00:40.770> second<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.850> also

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
3.0 SATA 6 gigabits per second it also

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.729 
3.0 SATA 6 gigabits per second it also
comes<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.390> OC<00:00:42.840> Genie<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.410> if<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.710> a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
comes with OC Genie so if you have a

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.590 
comes with OC Genie so if you have a
k-series<00:00:44.280> processor<00:00:44.940> then<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.270> could<00:00:45.420> just

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
k-series processor then you could just

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.869 
k-series processor then you could just
push<00:00:46.500> one<00:00:46.710> button<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.219> will<00:00:47.340> go<00:00:47.460> ahead<00:00:47.579> and

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
push one button and it will go ahead and

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.970 
push one button and it will go ahead and
overclock<00:00:48.539> your<00:00:48.719> system<00:00:49.050> although<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:49.860> not

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
overclock your system although it's not

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.700 
overclock your system although it's not
really<00:00:50.129> recommended<00:00:50.399> because<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.120> will<00:00:51.239> often

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
really recommended because it will often

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.080 
really recommended because it will often
increase<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.920> core<00:00:53.129> voltage<00:00:53.489> more<00:00:53.760> than<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
increase the core voltage more than it

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.910 
increase the core voltage more than it
should<00:00:54.300> be<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.660> things<00:00:55.079> will<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.350> quite<00:00:55.680> hot

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
should be so things will get quite hot

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.549 
should be so things will get quite hot
so<00:00:56.600> here's<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> back<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.079> box<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.440> could

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
so here's the back of the box you could

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.080 
so here's the back of the box you could
read<00:00:58.739> some<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.100> info<00:00:59.370> if<00:00:59.579> you'd<00:00:59.730> like<00:00:59.879> I'm

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
read some of the info if you'd like I'm

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.470 
read some of the info if you'd like I'm
not<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:00.690> over<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:02.480> because

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
not going to be going over this because

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.850 
not going to be going over this because
all<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> fun<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.199> inside<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.040> box<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.590> here

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
all the fun is inside of the box so here

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.280 
all the fun is inside of the box so here
we<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.130> our<00:01:08.369> back<00:01:09.000> panel<00:01:09.330> IO<00:01:10.110> shield<00:01:12.140> we<00:01:13.140> also

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
we have our back panel IO shield we also

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.929 
we have our back panel IO shield we also
got<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> couple<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.920> SATA<00:01:14.159> 6<00:01:14.400> gigabits<00:01:14.549> per

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
got a couple of SATA 6 gigabits per

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.300 
got a couple of SATA 6 gigabits per
second<00:01:15.360> cables<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.110> one<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.500> them<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.100> has<00:01:17.130> a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
second cables so one of them it has a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.090 
second cables so one of them it has a
little<00:01:17.750> angle<00:01:18.750> there<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.619> here<00:01:19.860> we<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
little angle there and here we have a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.370 
little angle there and here we have a
molex<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.790> SATA<00:01:21.180> power<00:01:21.450> connector<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.140> will

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
molex to SATA power connector I will

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.560 
molex to SATA power connector I will
probably<00:01:22.560> need<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> case<00:01:24.420> that

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
probably need that because the case that

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.800 
probably need that because the case that
I<00:01:24.630> chose<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:25.290> my<00:01:25.439> H<00:01:25.909> home<00:01:26.909> theater<00:01:27.210> PC<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.689> only

I chose for my H home theater PC it only

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.359 
I chose for my H home theater PC it only
has<00:01:27.990> one<00:01:28.020> SATA<00:01:28.500> connection<00:01:28.979> out<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.310> the

so<00:01:53.850> let's<00:01:54.090> go<00:01:54.210> ahead<00:01:54.300> and<00:01:54.480> go<00:01:54.900> down<00:01:54.930> here<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
so let's go ahead and go down here and

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.230 
so let's go ahead and go down here and
get<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.770> motherboard<00:01:56.250> itself<00:01:59.000> and<00:02:00.000> if

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
get to the motherboard itself and if

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.330 
get to the motherboard itself and if
here<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.660> so<00:02:01.020> visually<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.890> somewhat

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
here it is so visually it's somewhat

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.140 
here it is so visually it's somewhat
similar<00:02:02.730> to<00:02:02.760> the<00:02:03.500> z68<00:02:04.500> AG<00:02:05.160> dat<00:02:05.550> that<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.850> have<00:02:06.030> in

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
similar to the z68 AG dat that I have in

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.400 
similar to the z68 AG dat that I have in
my<00:02:06.240> gaming<00:02:06.570> desktop<00:02:08.450> so<00:02:09.450> here<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> sort

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
my gaming desktop so here it is a sort

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.340 
my gaming desktop so here it is a sort
of<00:02:10.500> has<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.680> dark<00:02:11.070> brown<00:02:11.340> PCB<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.350> let's

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
of has a dark brown PCB to it let's

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.980 
of has a dark brown PCB to it let's
strip<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.680> around<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.070> right<00:02:14.250> way<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:15.660> here<00:02:15.870> we

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
strip it around the right way so here we

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.140 
strip it around the right way so here we
have<00:02:16.110> our<00:02:16.230> 1155<00:02:16.950> socket<00:02:17.430> here<00:02:17.640> we<00:02:17.730> have<00:02:17.880> two
