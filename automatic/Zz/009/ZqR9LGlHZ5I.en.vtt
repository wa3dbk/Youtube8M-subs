 new video on call of duty black 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.779
 red dune ops pleasure because this 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.109
 black ops still has to score 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.330
 the community finally it's just that a 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.679
 detail in the video 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.809
 at that moment I was still needed 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.610
 that I specify it with shu and the fatals 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.760
 rusher so that's a gain can we 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.960
 did at 3 except that there the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.730
 conversation we had I do not have 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.559

 I'm fed up with this electric thing and so 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.059
 it's a detail of a big fair 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.980
 to questions to put things to the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.050
 clear especially at the level of jamie car 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.510
 I have a lot of feedbacks from 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.320
 this question so that's the question 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.880
 number 1 of 2,2 not to have it more no 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.369
 make a season of Frequently Asked Questions 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.020
 but stop there the question that put 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.369
 more posed for now surgery 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.070
 count the number of emails that j 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.590
 exactly from private messages too I 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.509
 had two weeks in comment we will 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.049
 put in atholville usually writing about 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.659
 a leaf 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.689
 I had one hundred and forty eight messages 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.829
 private messages comments messages 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.229
 emails from how come jamie has 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.409
 stopped his videos and why he did not 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.509
 taken back with you 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.210
 because this question I'm going to you there 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.729
 answer so that's damask in my purpose 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.289
 of my little spot finally in my little 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.299
 notebook that I like and where I write all 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.159
 the questions that came back the most 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.689
 is that I told you that is at 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.179
 number one why I had not done 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.439
 more videos with you then this 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.990
 question i will answer you 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.179
 honestly I do not know why 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.179
 I handed over no longer making videos with 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.560
 I all I know is that 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.270
 when I came back ten days I 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.739
 do not know if you finally remember 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.879
 especially for my subscribers who follow me 

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:08.890
 I try I had problems with jany 

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:12.670
 we had a little worry about dofus too 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.220
 which I told for the accounts but 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.170
 that's not a problem the problem is 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.810
 that I never try to go to him 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.640
 and him back in fact so he had 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.720
 not he did not have a good wait 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.980
 do not do that they did not have a good 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.079
 intention I do not really know what 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.190
 went through the head 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.989
 I have the more I walked clearly towards 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.519
 him I put pages views said listening 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.959
 invites month dantÃ© conversation and him 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.230
 clearly they told me no I am 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.319
 with my friends of the day at the same said it 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.970
 like that finally conversations in mind 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.250
 and maybe it's not ready for them 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.569
 find on skype who swears goes up and 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.310
 that I develop that ever because he 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.510
 blocked me so I delete them if it does not 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.120
 was for nothing that I pay skype 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.530
 yes at that moment he listens with me he 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.239
 a hip with my pals no I am 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.040
 busy no I'm doing something so to 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.030
 the end the site is impossible to do 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.980
 videos with us 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.360
 didier clearly i am me if you want 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.830
 not make videos will just have friends on 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.180
 no longer makes videos there is no 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.459
 worry I tell my subscribers have done more 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.620
 videotron by the head for that he told me 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.000
 said at that moment my life said wen other 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.100
 way I think I think he needs 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.140
 to play the heads a human hero I 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.450
 think that just videos to do that 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.400
 videos with him I was not thinking about other 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.020
 thing in fact that not even late 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.420
 it was not I did not think that to do 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.470
 videos finally when I talked to him j 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.239
 listen with me in these conversations 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.959
 we're going guys a little together plays 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.480
 a little bit of pressure but he does not he 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.190
 did not really mature here it is I have you 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.500
 answered this question if you have a 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.760
 message to pass to jamie say the 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.130
 me in comment 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.260
 I will send him a little private message 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.550
 on facebook because yes I will not 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.140
 give you on facebook without his 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.030
 permission anyway it's vanessa 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.040
 sure it does not happen or there I 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.660
 completely forgotten 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.430
 so that's the first question we 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.560
 answered I can stop 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.180
 second question what is your place 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.830
 we will then do my favorite class 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.510
 as you have seen 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.610
 even when I was playing with jamie it was 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.840
 the sacrier because if it's a character 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.030
 that I really love because they eat themselves 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.400
 costs so that the ins that has almost 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.120
 more life he can completely 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.739
 change the match with these boosters 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.600
 so that's the question may has been 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.690
 answered I no longer barred a third 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.470
 question how long have you been playing 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.350
 dofus then the question is very good 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.050
 because my drums I know the game 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.850
 rather since the 1 points 16 as the 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.550
 1.6 you realize 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:37.060
 I play almost since the game's release 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.790
 same limit if I can find my 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.190
 mail which was a kikoo mail like 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.400
 everyone went through that I'm going 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:49.660
 you quote it if you see it's 20 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.580
 swell shot 94 @ hotmail.fr not short 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.460
 electric we represent our neighborhood 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.720
 our department is finally brief 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.660
 it's when I was who would make you 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.810
 I finally find the code you find 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:05.590
 ankama messages when he plans 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.060
 updates for ba for us as 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.680
 send it to us by mail and my name is 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.250
 the biggest update I give 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.470
 and mestella 1.19 which created April release 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.970
 I believe that moment auto mail or 1.20 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.020
 Thu 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.090
 it's a good thing where they have 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.300
 taken out e mail so that it can remain the 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.340
 sort etc etc short third question 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.140
 answered we are at the fourth 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.460
 question what is your server then there 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.830
 this is the most common action that 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.900
 I also have the question is simple clear 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.900
 and net i'm on hull is will not find 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.160
 big would not ask the question 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.150
 it's a question that's really this 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.060
 basic but hey I can answer it 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.970
 still comments anyway 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.380
 a 5-1 question what is your real name 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.510
 so that everybody asks me the 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.660
 question how are you finally called 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.710
 mourad messaging what's your name

 by the whole person nobody knows your true 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.250
 first name because often you type 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.450
 call me the words and why we 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.650
 call me the words if I come back 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.110
 this question if I'm not finished 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.120
 how is my real name already? 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.070
 raoul so as you will have more to 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.419
 about this question that really 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.630
 also see how you are called 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:09.389

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.100
 had when I was young before I can you 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:21.510
 is the most the same plan it just makes me 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:24.750

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:27.440
 to why nemo nickname then that's it 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:31.139
 a delirium I had with a girlfriend 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.700
 which is called diane so to what we see 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:33.760
 there we go up we are at the first of 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.790
 movies and words 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.400
 lula and doc at that moment i'm over 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.250
 we had laughed and I had said 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.780
 bullshit I more than I had after 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.250
 told me yeah you became a kid 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.140

 never remind me of respite one day I 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.020
 the original was finally brief it's a 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:57.690
 places a delusion not so not a 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:07:00.580
 lullaby does not say a delirium with which 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.380
 so yeah that was pretty cool and then 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.240
 two and then I put my words like on 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.880
 our sources very little and then people 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.640
 do not recognize the other's head he had 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.290
 the words so not here so you 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.500

 clerk the betty it's betty who comes 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.120
 to kill me 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:20.670
 so it's really disgusting because 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.230
 it's disgusting he suffers 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.780
 short so let's go back to the fair 

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.760
 nickname document matters it's words 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:31.480
