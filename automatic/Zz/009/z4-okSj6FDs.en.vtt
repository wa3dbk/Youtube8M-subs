00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.690
 good afternoon my name is patricia 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.890
 casino today we are going to develop two 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.129
 simple projects to decorate either 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.110
 a bathroom a little corner in your house are 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.510
 very simple materials that get 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.510
 anywhere and you work 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:29.090
 very fast we are going to work on cardboard 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:34.010
 straw or watercolor paper or thick cardboard 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:36.530
 about m this is the first one is a 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.390
 very simple project is worked 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:45.730
 on cardboard straw or watercolor carton 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:48.629
 worked with very fluid paintings oil paintings 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.579
 translucent for this first project 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.390
 we just need 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:59.409
 a square of 25 x 25 straw cardboard 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.530
 or watercolor paper or piggy paper that 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.720
 have in your house drawing or you get 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.340
 in any stationery and they are pretty 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.340
 cheap pencil 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.050
 water to clean the brush and paints 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.390
 fans and that are translucent are oil paintings 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.460
 translucent very easy to work 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.430
 creamy 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.360
 dilute leds in water to start this 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.990
 design is facilitated to me is facilitated 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.470
 the drawing but if they do not have it they exist 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.530
 infinity of flower outfits like 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.470
 of the iconia that we are going to work 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.330
 on the internet at 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.820
 drawing of the children 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.670
 and they are 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.310
 and simple figures as a kind of 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.380
 little heart without a tip 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.440
 that is going to intertwine 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.750
 to end 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.000
 at the other end we start in a 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.870
 end of the square and we end in the 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.470
 another extreme already having this design with 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:08.680
 the painting and the translucent oil cargo 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.730
 very well the brush after moisturizing what 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:15.400
 and I begin to spread over the surface 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.640
 you do not need to face so much you do not need 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.690
 lots of material with color 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.220
 that follows that in this case it would be green 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.220
 pear 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.220
 we started 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.780
 to melt the two colors can rotate the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.590
 brush in a circular shape stretching the 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.290
 paint as comfortable as they are 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.120
 brushes we use are brushes 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.760
 soft bristle planes 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.300
 that allow to stretch the poquitico of 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.430
 painting 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.490
 no effort this can do 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.430
 Even a child can help them 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:01.550
 your children or the children you have at home 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.550
 because they are supremely easy we see 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.150
 the part of the yellow color of 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.130
 for the petals I go back and start with the 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.980
 same color 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.920
 there is no need to wash the brush 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.380
 I only clean it with a cloth 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.790
 and I start again with the base tone that 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.270
 it's the yellow 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.330
 I have the tone that follows 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.150
 it's a yellow more than yellow little 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:37.090
 toasted 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.090
 step to the next tone that is the orange 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:46.310
 and they are gothic that I use almost nothing of 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.620
 painting the procedure is repetitive 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.620
 because I do the same in each petal 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:59.740
 and the finish is immediate I finish with the 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.740
 magenta color that serves to highlight 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.130
 shadow taking care of that in the part 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.890
 top of each petal there remains light 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.350
 to wait a little bit to dry with 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.500
 black acrylic or with the same paint 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:18.140
 we can delineate black 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.660
 This has an advantage if the line is left 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:24.010
 thin is fine if the line is left 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.010
 thick is fine 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.270
 ideals 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:35.240
 cover the union of the two colors 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.240
 to proceed with the decoration 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.470
 we hope well that it is well well dry 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:46.159
 the project and we seal with this product 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.650
 so well known that it's called water shine 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:52.069
 Look, while I'm painting 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.960
 almost dry where I started is already dry without 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:56.960
 But let's wait a little bit for 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.050
 dry and we will apply it 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:06.020
 let's apply the resin cufflinks are 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:08.979
 two components that are mixed 50 and 50 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.979
 pours 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:16.340
 the resin and hardener that are the 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.340
 two components I mix very well 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.979
 the resin initially looks like 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.710
 some white lines inside the mixture 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:28.270
 and when it is ready it is totally 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:33.220
 transparent and crystalline 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:36.720
 there I proceed to load with the spoon 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:41.030
 and without fear I start to make figures 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:43.060
 on the surface of hockey drips 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.600
 and then with her 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:51.430
 she is expanding then we do 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.780
 thin lines of patience but there 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.380
 that work fast 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:01.030
 because it starts to get like jelly 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:03.620
 cg / la and you can not touch more 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.060
 depending on the amount of resin that 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:10.020
 have applied 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:13.710
 and spend 4 to 6 hours for a drying 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:17.840
 total this would be like the final finish 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.840
 when it is completely dry 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.470
 I hope you liked any 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.009
 restlessness call 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:30.159
 or consult 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:32.340
 what other project alternatives 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:35.449
 we can take out 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.449
 I hope you liked it
