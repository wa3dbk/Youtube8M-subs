 we enter through large ports 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.280
 Beijing is still very scared 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.290
 of figures 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.700

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.990
 however figures 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.990
 policies 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.750
 we follow with the judgment 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.410
 in the fifth set the team 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.440

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.960
 in the bid 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.960
 both cdu 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.580

 hotel main door in lima 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.699
 was the performance itself 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.919
 it will replace two movies 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:26.689
 maracay 80 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.689
 one of the arguments 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.909
