00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.450
 how many people are there 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.830
 idolate of the smartphones from alcatel 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.440
 it 's a question I ask myself 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.340
 this alcatel one touch idol 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.380
 received 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.570
 it is a cheap brother of the idol 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.289
 ultra but with a flywheel 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.390
 core processor and 4.7 inch eps display 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.160
 and an 8 megapixel camera on the 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.289
 back quite a bit in its march 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.000
 this is also true 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.190
 Alcatel aims to eyedo line 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.760
 style and couple means with the French 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.730
 manufacturer 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.070
 mainly very thin this idle is 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.510
 it the 7.9 millimeters thin 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.310
 after all , not the thinnest phone anyway 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.380
 sentence in line but have still 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.030
 this very compact model with the 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.430
 stylish rounded hands I like 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.840
 only the back a bit cheap 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.470
 they quite had what may Peter 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.060
 to do 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.830
 fortunately there is also a black variant and 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.250
 which looks a lot better for 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.170
 is a 4.7 inch GPS display and 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.150
 who although looks kind of 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.560
 a lower resolution than the one 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.390
 bigger brother of this arl 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.509
 namely the idol ultra that has one 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.710
 amoled hd screen this is disturbing 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.860
 no certainly not it still looks 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.200
 very nice and important difference 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.060
 namely the price because it costs 6 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.920
 tens cheaper and I can still get one 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.360
 hope to do fun things with 6 tens 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.100
 in addition, another plus point is 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.770
 purchase this phone 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.409
 And then the very simple fact is that this one 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.030
 and has a three and half mm jack plug 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.280
 because of the dense or thin person 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.690
 the old ultra doesn't want that and that 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.360
 I personally find it very disturbing 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.670
 also whether this phone is two on the side 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.390
 inputs to lose a SIM card 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.920
 being able 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.540
 he therefore has a duo sim option 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.890
 basically means you like you 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.600
 you have a business account 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.250
 you can also stop in your phone with 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.170
 two phone numbers just still 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.780
 with a phone call to the area 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.299
 of multimedia this idle performs 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.430
 great a movie with the one and only yim 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:58.650
 castle in the picture 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.650
 definitely a visit but just digitally 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.290
 oh sorry i am i had some work understand 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.840
 I 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.440
 cool claire the 8 megapixel camera on the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.120
 rear end 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.080
 shoot nice snapshots a can 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.580
 even a little play with 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.380
 Depth of field way makes lockers 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.760
 has it very well done 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.920
 although it must be said that I do it 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.140
 camera me now a bit unclear 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.270
 find that camera but now is part of it 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.640
 the own zest of alcatel that they left 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.470
 android have stopped squeaking 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.120
 peel is actually relatively simple 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.770
 they haven't adjusted you very much 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.120
 for example, have the home screen 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.980
 you also open and then you go 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.230
 directly to the camera for your messages 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.090
 or to telephone and the iconic to one 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.590
 slightly more rounded it looks slightly 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.350
 cozier you can also make it childish 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.720
 call it out but that is by no means 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.130
 it is very solid and that 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.020
 a lot is an advantage instead of 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.730
 for example very busy htc sense or 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.170
 a samsung talks with 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.420
 bit strange is that they have the phone 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.350
 I was completely full having quit 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.300
 all kinds of applications 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.620
 you can't think of it that way or that 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.510
 adele has already pre-installed it 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.600
 I personally find it a bit unnecessary 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.360
 but well maybe you are a fan of it 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.070
 A random app is of course also possible 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.140
 one touch idol has a guide 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.330
 dual core processor and although that anne 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.950
 2013 perhaps as a little drachma 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.610
 it must be possible quickly with this 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.769
 phone 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.390
 certainly go through the internet goes smoothly 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.010
 loading games goes smoothly and it 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.910
 installing an app is really pretty 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.560
 spotless 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.760
 really well done during all number 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.950
 I'm pretty impressed with that 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.720
 you don't really know which one 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.510
 phone you have to buy and you have such 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.670
 250 euros to spend then has alcatel 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.160
 a problem because there are high 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.290
 competitors a whole lot but on and on 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.870
 its excellent performance and nice design 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.170
 is is a 4 star and definitely buy this 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.170
 worth
