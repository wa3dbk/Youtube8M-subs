hundreds<00:00:16.600> of<00:00:16.690> new<00:00:17.140> routes<00:00:17.320> and<00:00:17.619> so<00:00:17.800> I've

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
hundreds of new routes and so I've

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.250 
hundreds of new routes and so I've
claimed<00:00:18.340> many<00:00:19.060> many<00:00:19.449> hundreds<00:00:19.869> of<00:00:19.930> meters<00:00:20.230> of

claimed many many hundreds of meters of

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.250 
claimed many many hundreds of meters of
rock<00:00:20.590> that<00:00:20.619> no<00:00:21.250> one<00:00:21.400> that<00:00:21.490> will<00:00:21.609> be

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
rock that no one that will be

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.240 
rock that no one that will be
non-physically<00:00:23.260> the<00:00:23.440> biggest<00:00:23.740> challenge<00:00:24.100> of
