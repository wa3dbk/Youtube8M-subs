I've tested however you can store these

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.690 
I've tested however you can store these
fellows<00:02:03.899> here<00:02:04.110> now<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.189> place<00:02:05.430> these<00:02:05.640> two

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
fellows here now if we place these two

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.089 
fellows here now if we place these two
here<00:02:06.149> top<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.750> bottom<00:02:07.049> as<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.619> see<00:02:07.950> the

books actually appear in the slots if we
place<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.890> at<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.099> top<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:11.879> get<00:02:12.060> two<00:02:12.300> and

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
place this at the top we get two and

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.980 
place this at the top we get two and

how that works

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.490 
how that works
it's<00:02:17.370> just<00:02:17.700> dynamically<00:02:18.300> as<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.810> please<00:02:19.200> and
