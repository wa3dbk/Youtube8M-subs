like maybe a tablespoon I don't think

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.680

that was a tablespoon you can put water

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.020 
that was a tablespoon you can put water
instead<00:02:21.470> if<00:02:21.769> you<00:02:22.190> don't<00:02:22.370> want<00:02:22.489> to<00:02:22.549> do<00:02:22.610> milk<00:02:22.820> or

can<00:04:15.760> flip<00:04:16.180> it<00:04:16.209> now<00:04:16.690> but<00:04:17.500> if<00:04:17.590> you<00:04:17.709> don't<00:04:17.949> stick

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
can flip it now but if you don't stick

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.900 
can flip it now but if you don't stick
around<00:04:19.470> alright<00:04:20.470> so<00:04:20.739> now<00:04:20.949> is<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.579> dreaded

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
around alright so now is the dreaded

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.610 
around alright so now is the dreaded
time<00:04:22.449> for<00:04:23.020> flipping<00:04:23.470> I<00:04:24.870> take<00:04:25.870> my<00:04:26.020> time<00:04:26.199> like

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
time for flipping I take my time like

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.150 
time for flipping I take my time like
that<00:04:26.889> is<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:28.810> best<00:04:29.080> thing<00:04:29.260> you<00:04:29.350> can<00:04:29.470> do<00:04:29.620> also

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
that is the best thing you can do also

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.800 
that is the best thing you can do also
I'll<00:04:30.310> take<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.550> fork<00:04:31.030> and<00:04:31.150> help<00:04:31.930> lift<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.680> on<00:04:32.949> to

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
I'll take a fork and help lift it on to

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.010 
I'll take a fork and help lift it on to
the<00:04:34.810> spatula<00:04:36.210> you<00:04:37.210> make<00:04:37.419> sure<00:04:37.539> you<00:04:37.630> get<00:04:37.750> right

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
the spatula you make sure you get right

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.620 
the spatula you make sure you get right
up<00:04:38.080> under<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.820> you<00:04:39.820> can<00:04:39.970> even<00:04:40.090> put<00:04:40.330> it<00:04:40.419> a<00:04:40.479> little

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
up under it you can even put it a little

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.790 
up under it you can even put it a little
bit<00:04:40.750> up<00:04:40.840> on<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.050> handle<00:04:41.500> if<00:04:41.590> it's<00:04:41.740> that<00:04:41.860> big<00:04:43.800> so

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
bit up on the handle if it's that big so

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.170 
bit up on the handle if it's that big so
now<00:04:44.979> we're<00:04:45.130> going<00:04:45.220> to<00:04:45.310> add<00:04:45.430> our<00:04:45.700> cheese<00:04:46.120> and

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
now we're going to add our cheese and

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.550 
now we're going to add our cheese and
our<00:04:46.720> ham<00:04:46.990> and<00:04:47.380> I'll<00:04:47.470> bacon<00:04:52.289> normally<00:04:53.289> I<00:04:53.320> would

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
our ham and I'll bacon normally I would

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.409 
our ham and I'll bacon normally I would
add<00:04:53.680> salt<00:04:53.979> and<00:04:54.160> pepper<00:04:54.340> at<00:04:54.610> this<00:04:54.789> point<00:04:55.150> too

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
add salt and pepper at this point too

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.580 
add salt and pepper at this point too
however<00:04:56.729> since<00:04:57.729> the<00:04:58.330> ham<00:04:58.690> is<00:04:59.020> like<00:04:59.169> country

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
however since the ham is like country

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.050 
however since the ham is like country
ham<00:04:59.620> it's<00:05:00.070> going<00:05:00.190> to<00:05:00.250> have<00:05:00.340> a<00:05:00.370> lot<00:05:00.550> of<00:05:00.580> salt<00:05:00.849> on

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
ham it's going to have a lot of salt on

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.350 
ham it's going to have a lot of salt on
it<00:05:01.090> already<00:05:01.479> so<00:05:02.349> you<00:05:02.410> really<00:05:02.770> don't<00:05:02.950> need<00:05:03.360> any

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
it already so you really don't need any

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.210 
it already so you really don't need any
more<00:05:04.630> as<00:05:04.930> of<00:05:05.260> right<00:05:05.410> now<00:05:05.470> because<00:05:05.889> I'm<00:05:06.099> not

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
more as of right now because I'm not

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.969 
more as of right now because I'm not
sure<00:05:06.400> exactly<00:05:06.729> how<00:05:07.000> salty<00:05:07.210> that<00:05:07.660> will<00:05:07.810> be<00:05:07.979> so

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
sure exactly how salty that will be so

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:09.930 
sure exactly how salty that will be so
then<00:05:09.070> we're<00:05:09.160> going<00:05:09.280> to<00:05:09.310> take<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:09.550> hand<00:05:09.729> we're

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
then we're going to take the hand we're

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.230 
then we're going to take the hand we're
going<00:05:10.030> to<00:05:11.039> skin<00:05:12.039> and<00:05:13.500> try<00:05:14.500> to<00:05:14.560> pull<00:05:15.150> you<00:05:16.150> to

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
going to skin and try to pull you to

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.640 
going to skin and try to pull you to
make<00:05:16.389> sure<00:05:16.419> you<00:05:16.570> get<00:05:16.690> it<00:05:16.810> all<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.080> way<00:05:17.289> across

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
make sure you get it all the way across

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.200 
make sure you get it all the way across
it's<00:05:18.130> more<00:05:18.310> important<00:05:18.669> to<00:05:18.699> get<00:05:18.849> it<00:05:18.940> across

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
it's more important to get it across

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.439 
it's more important to get it across
than<00:05:19.690> to<00:05:19.780> get<00:05:19.930> it<00:05:20.050> in<00:05:21.039> the<00:05:21.820> middle<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.240> guess

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
than to get it in the middle I guess

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.510 
than to get it in the middle I guess
because<00:05:22.810> when<00:05:22.960> you<00:05:23.050> fold<00:05:23.349> it<00:05:23.560> over<00:05:23.770> it's<00:05:24.310> all

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
because when you fold it over it's all

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.000 
because when you fold it over it's all
going<00:05:24.910> to<00:05:24.940> come<00:05:25.150> to<00:05:25.630> one<00:05:25.840> side<00:05:26.110> so<00:05:26.770> make<00:05:26.979> sure

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
going to come to one side so make sure

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.240 
going to come to one side so make sure
you<00:05:27.220> get<00:05:27.340> it<00:05:27.460> spread<00:05:27.820> out<00:05:28.919> throughout<00:05:29.919> one

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
you get it spread out throughout one

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.710 
you get it spread out throughout one
half<00:05:30.580> of<00:05:30.760> it<00:05:30.880> and<00:05:31.060> send<00:05:31.210> it<00:05:31.270> through<00:05:31.300> the<00:05:31.539> whole

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
half of it and send it through the whole

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.499 
half of it and send it through the whole
thing

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:38.509 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:40.430 

then<00:05:39.509> I'm<00:05:39.600> just<00:05:39.690> going<00:05:39.840> to<00:05:39.930> take<00:05:40.020> a<00:05:40.050> little<00:05:40.350> bit

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
then I'm just going to take a little bit

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:52.670 
then I'm just going to take a little bit
of<00:05:40.530> bacon<00:05:50.300> now<00:05:51.300> we're<00:05:51.960> going<00:05:52.050> to<00:05:52.110> since<00:05:52.440> this

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
of bacon now we're going to since this

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.260 
of bacon now we're going to since this
side<00:05:52.919> doesn't<00:05:53.160> have<00:05:53.280> very<00:05:53.520> much<00:05:53.610> stuff<00:05:53.910> on<00:05:54.090> it

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
side doesn't have very much stuff on it

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.760 
side doesn't have very much stuff on it
I'm<00:05:54.479> going<00:05:54.660> to<00:05:54.750> put<00:05:55.020> this<00:05:55.139> is<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.470> side<00:05:55.620> that

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
I'm going to put this is the side that

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.219 
I'm going to put this is the side that
I'm<00:05:55.830> going<00:05:55.949> to<00:05:55.979> flip<00:05:56.300> over<00:05:57.300> so<00:05:57.810> I'm<00:05:57.930> just<00:05:58.050> going

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
I'm going to flip over so I'm just going

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.050 
I'm going to flip over so I'm just going
to<00:05:58.259> use<00:05:58.410> my<00:05:58.560> fork<00:05:58.860> and<00:05:59.039> my<00:05:59.100> spatula<00:05:59.669> together

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
to use my fork and my spatula together

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:11.570 
to use my fork and my spatula together
pull<00:06:01.940> to<00:06:07.010> mythic<00:06:09.320> there<00:06:10.320> you<00:06:10.530> and<00:06:10.770> take<00:06:11.400> your

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
pull to mythic there you and take your

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.040 
pull to mythic there you and take your
time<00:06:11.760> with<00:06:11.940> this<00:06:12.060> if<00:06:12.240> you<00:06:12.330> need<00:06:12.479> to<00:06:12.570> turn<00:06:12.750> your

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
time with this if you need to turn your

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.750 
time with this if you need to turn your
heat<00:06:13.260> down<00:06:13.289> really<00:06:13.830> low<00:06:13.949> so<00:06:14.370> you<00:06:14.460> can<00:06:14.639> work

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
heat down really low so you can work

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.010 
heat down really low so you can work
slowly<00:06:15.270> that's<00:06:15.960> totally<00:06:16.590> fine<00:06:16.949> it's<00:06:17.280> not<00:06:17.550> a

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
slowly that's totally fine it's not a

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.240 
slowly that's totally fine it's not a
bad<00:06:19.020> thing<00:06:19.289> to<00:06:19.590> need<00:06:19.770> to<00:06:19.860> work<00:06:19.979> a<00:06:20.070> little

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
bad thing to need to work a little

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.250 
bad thing to need to work a little
slower<00:06:20.490> so<00:06:21.000> I<00:06:21.030> like<00:06:21.300> mine<00:06:21.479> browner<00:06:21.870> than<00:06:22.139> this

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
slower so I like mine browner than this

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.779 
slower so I like mine browner than this
I'm<00:06:22.470> going<00:06:22.590> to<00:06:22.650> let<00:06:22.770> it<00:06:22.800> sit<00:06:23.070> for<00:06:23.250> a<00:06:23.400> minute<00:06:23.669> and

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
I'm going to let it sit for a minute and

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:26.480 
I'm going to let it sit for a minute and
then<00:06:24.300> we'll<00:06:24.510> flip<00:06:24.690> it<00:06:24.810> in<00:06:24.930> just<00:06:25.080> a<00:06:25.139> sec<00:06:25.490> all

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
then we'll flip it in just a sec all

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.740 
then we'll flip it in just a sec all
right<00:06:26.610> now<00:06:26.729> I<00:06:26.760> like<00:06:27.090> mine<00:06:27.270> to<00:06:27.389> be<00:06:27.419> brown<00:06:27.720> on

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
right now I like mine to be brown on

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.450
