00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
house the drawing is large enough that I

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
can provide dimensions for framing and

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.170 
can provide dimensions for framing and

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
construction much easier at this scale

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.060 
construction much easier at this scale
I'd<00:01:12.210> also<00:01:12.510> ask<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.020> contractor<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.890> make<00:01:14.040> a

I'd also ask the contractor to make a

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.700 
I'd also ask the contractor to make a
full-scale<00:01:14.790> mock-up<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.900> site<00:01:16.290> for<00:01:16.590> the
