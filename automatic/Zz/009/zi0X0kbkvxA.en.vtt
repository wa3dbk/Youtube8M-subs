00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:11.120
 and I come to buy what I need 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.549
 play will be 20 be 30 be 90 but that 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.010
 the only thing that corresponds to me is 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.140
 give that fight in training that 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.540
 I fight to make everyone who 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.570
 at the end of the day decide who plays 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.760
 in the end he plans a 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.500
 strategy with certain players and what 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.840
 most important is still the team the 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.090
 group and the three points in dispute the 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.790
 It was 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.140
 in front with everyone he told us he's going to 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.140
 there are variants in all 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.390
 alignments by the fact of starting what 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.220
 better prepared in the liberators 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.400
 then what you are doing is a 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.660
 rotation what you are doing is look 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.480
 who is accommodated according to the 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.420
 characteristics of the rival then all 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.580
 we are here to help you we are final 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.750
 accounts looking for the three points in each 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.519
 match because who plays look at the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.140
 First, you can apologize to the 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.449
 people have to ask for them 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.869
 comrades because a week is planned 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.740
 of work and for a mistake my 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.899
 water an inattention you made me lose 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.090
 five or six days of work I think that 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.870
 beyond the emotion beyond the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.660
 mistake because they are circumstances 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.220
 that the game is presented sometimes without 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.340
 Think about it, things happen 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.500
 Unfortunately, it happened very early on 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.750
 party that was my team in 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.030
 inferiority and now what I want is 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.800
 reverse things do the best 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.140
 possible when it's my turn to be inside 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.300
 the court to help has what 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.670
 I want to collaborate and help the team 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.900
 that I resume the path of victory and 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.840
 that the same competition that has come 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.730
 making the competitive team follow in 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.100
 the trainings for want to use 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.350
 we can all get three points and it's 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.360
 directed to a very excited league 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.720
 because they are important tournaments environment 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.120
 international and well then dress up another 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.860
 Once this shirt and have that opportunity 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.290
 of playing this important tournament I 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.060
 illusion and with the quality that the 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.760
 group with the quality that is showing 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.650
 the tournament tower team behind me 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.750
 It deludes even more into thinking that we can 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.030
 do things better than every time 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.920
 I played in the groups. Look, it's a team 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.240
 no doubt desperate to get 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.670
 results 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.310
 but this is when the category but from 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.260
 the other tournament that I had to face them 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.900
 I have seen that they are hard-working team they are 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.050
 team that everyone is committed 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.880
 with the technician who do not skimp a 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.970
 effort to obtain the result 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.850
 so I think that if we 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.370
 we put on par in that in running 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.620
 and fight on the court plus the 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.120
 quality that we have sure we will take a 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.239
 good result 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.239
 ah
