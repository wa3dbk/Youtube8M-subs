00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.330 

instead<00:01:43.480> of<00:01:43.600> using<00:01:43.870> the<00:01:44.320> instead<00:01:44.950> of<00:01:45.070> using

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
instead of using the instead of using

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.090 
instead of using the instead of using
the<00:01:45.700> guidelines<00:01:46.210> on<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.540> back<00:01:46.750> like<00:01:47.080> a<00:01:47.620> lawn

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
the guidelines on the back like a lawn

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.340 
the guidelines on the back like a lawn
you<00:01:48.760> pull<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.450> whole<00:01:49.600> shoot<00:01:49.900> with<00:01:50.050> a<00:01:50.080> fly<00:01:50.320> ball

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350

you pull the whole shoot with a fly ball
yeah<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:52.000> it<00:01:52.210> makes<00:01:52.420> it<00:01:52.540> really<00:01:52.750> easy<00:01:52.900> to

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
yeah so it makes it really easy to

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.560 
yeah so it makes it really easy to
control<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.890> thing<00:01:57.130> is<00:01:57.370> is<00:01:57.730> I<00:01:57.940> have<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.360> really

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
control the thing is is I have to really

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.480 
control the thing is is I have to really
keep<00:01:58.750> track<00:01:58.990> of<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.320> battery<00:01:59.710> on<00:01:59.890> it<00:01:59.920> because

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
keep track of the battery on it because

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.730 
keep track of the battery on it because
because<00:02:03.490> if<00:02:03.640> you<00:02:03.790> don't<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.720> shuts<00:02:05.080> off<00:02:05.260> and<00:02:05.620> I

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
because if you don't it shuts off and I

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.890 
because if you don't it shuts off and I
need<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:06.100> power<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.550> land<00:02:06.760> it<00:02:06.910> without<00:02:07.090> Landru

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
need the power to land it without Landru

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.650 
need the power to land it without Landru

assume flat right that's probably only

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.150 
assume flat right that's probably only
about<00:02:45.070> 70<00:02:45.700> or<00:02:45.910> 60<00:02:46.150> right<00:02:46.450> there<00:02:46.660> yeah<00:02:48.060> okay

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
without power it doesn't turn real good

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.550 
without power it doesn't turn real good
unless<00:03:55.269> you're<00:03:55.420> falling<00:03:55.870> then<00:03:56.050> you<00:03:56.170> can<00:03:56.350> turn

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
it but you're still coming in too hard I

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.290 
it but you're still coming in too hard I
cracked<00:04:00.160> it<00:04:00.280> up<00:04:00.430> several<00:04:00.610> times<00:04:00.760> trying<00:04:01.120> to

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
cracked it up several times trying to

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.940 
cracked it up several times trying to
get<00:04:01.390> it<00:04:01.480> down<00:04:01.680> I'm<00:04:02.680> going<00:04:02.860> to<00:04:02.920> bring<00:04:03.100> it<00:04:03.190> in

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.800 

one<00:04:09.490> of<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:09.700> things<00:04:09.940> is<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.210> can<00:04:10.240> let<00:04:10.510> it<00:04:10.540> you

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
one of the things is you can let it you

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.470 
one of the things is you can let it you
can<00:04:10.990> let<00:04:11.170> it<00:04:11.200> stall<00:04:11.620> for<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.040> fall<00:04:12.280> if<00:04:13.150> you<00:04:13.300> got

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
can let it stall for the fall if you got

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.030 
can let it stall for the fall if you got
to<00:04:13.600> be<00:04:13.660> able<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:13.959> have<00:04:14.110> enough<00:04:14.380> power<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:14.800> bring

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
to be able to have enough power to bring

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.319 
to be able to have enough power to bring
it<00:04:15.130> out<00:04:15.280> of<00:04:15.310> it<00:04:15.490> at<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.730> end<00:04:15.910> or<00:04:16.120> you're<00:04:16.239> going

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
it out of it at the end or you're going

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.199 
it out of it at the end or you're going
to<00:04:16.390> have<00:04:16.480> trouble<00:04:17.459> it<00:04:18.459> doesn't<00:04:18.820> fly<00:04:18.970> like<00:04:19.180> a

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
to have trouble it doesn't fly like a

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.729 
to have trouble it doesn't fly like a
plane<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.750> that's<00:04:19.840> what<00:04:20.079> took<00:04:20.260> me<00:04:20.320> a<00:04:20.500> while<00:04:20.680> to

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
plane and that's what took me a while to

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.840 
plane and that's what took me a while to
figure<00:04:20.980> now<00:04:23.070> basic<00:04:24.070> controls<00:04:24.430> are<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.640> same

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
figure now basic controls are the same

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.830 
figure now basic controls are the same
right<00:04:25.060> elevator<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.080> aileron<00:04:26.440> no<00:04:27.570> rot<00:04:28.570> a

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
right elevator and aileron no rot a

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.590 
right elevator and aileron no rot a
neuron<00:04:29.200> is<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.530> and<00:04:29.770> then<00:04:30.640> throttle<00:04:31.000> is<00:04:31.360> your

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
neuron is it and then throttle is your

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:40.900 
neuron is it and then throttle is your
up<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:31.810> down<00:04:31.930> okay

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.310 

and<00:04:41.210> stop<00:04:41.480> bringing<00:04:41.690> it<00:04:41.840> out<00:04:41.930> of<00:04:42.080> it<00:04:42.170> now

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
and stop bringing it out of it now

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:50.700 
and stop bringing it out of it now
because<00:04:42.530> it's<00:04:42.860> dropping<00:04:43.070> hard

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.000 

beautiful<00:04:52.020> yeah<00:04:53.020> once<00:04:53.500> you're<00:04:53.590> on<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.830> ground

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
beautiful yeah once you're on the ground

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.790 
beautiful yeah once you're on the ground
you<00:04:54.220> have<00:04:54.340> no<00:04:54.460> control
