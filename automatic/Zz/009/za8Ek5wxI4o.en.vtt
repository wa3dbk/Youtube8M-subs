so<00:01:25.409> how<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.770> executed<00:01:26.390> framed<00:01:27.390> here<00:01:27.630> is

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
so how is it executed framed here is

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.480 
so how is it executed framed here is
multi<00:01:27.990> logging<00:01:28.350> one<00:01:28.590> account<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.070> behind<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
multi logging one account is behind the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.039 
multi logging one account is behind the
scenes<00:01:29.700> ready<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.119> enter<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> dungeon<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.020> the

dungeon in wall to the southwest corner

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.120 
dungeon in wall to the southwest corner
of<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.079> which<00:01:43.500> would<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> wilderness

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
of it which would be in the wilderness

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.460 
of it which would be in the wilderness
now<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.270> stage<00:01:45.509> one<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.990> lure<00:01:46.140> this

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
now this is stage one of the lure this

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
now this is stage one of the lure this
is<00:01:46.649> initiation

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
is initiation

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.760
