00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
hey guys and over here and this is the

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.210 
hey guys and over here and this is the
new<00:00:02.850> minecraft<00:00:03.270> invention<00:00:03.810> it<00:00:04.259> is<00:00:04.650> wireless

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
new minecraft invention it is wireless

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.860 
new minecraft invention it is wireless
redstone<00:00:05.460> that<00:00:05.970> works<00:00:06.180> outside<00:00:06.420> of<00:00:06.810> the

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
redstone that works outside of the

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.640 
redstone that works outside of the
loaded<00:00:07.080> chunks<00:00:08.269> basically<00:00:09.269> as<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:10.380> can<00:00:10.500> see

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
loaded chunks basically as you can see

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.339 
loaded chunks basically as you can see
or<00:00:10.889> use<00:00:11.280> redstone<00:00:11.670> down<00:00:12.000> there<00:00:12.210> just<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.900> single

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
or use redstone down there just a single

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.390 
or use redstone down there just a single
redstone<00:00:13.799> wire<00:00:14.299> if<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.800> trees<00:00:16.800> nothing<00:00:17.220> under

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
redstone wire if I trees nothing under

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:27.830 
redstone wire if I trees nothing under
here<00:00:19.100> let<00:00:20.100> see<00:00:20.640> nothing<00:00:26.119> and<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.539> place<00:00:27.810> a

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
here let see nothing and if you place a

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:36.580 
here let see nothing and if you place a
string<00:00:30.769> see<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:32.279> start<00:00:32.520> getting<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.820> pulse

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.700 

and<00:00:38.719> then<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.960> want<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.200> stop<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.530> pulse

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
and then if you want to stop the pulse

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.819 
and then if you want to stop the pulse
you<00:00:40.920> just<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:41.340> back<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.829> where's

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
you just have to go back to the where's

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.860 
you just have to go back to the where's
a<00:00:43.920> clock<00:00:44.670> if<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.059> want<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.270> stop<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> clock

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
a clock if you want to stop the clock

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.680 
a clock if you want to stop the clock
you<00:00:46.649> should<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.010> go<00:00:47.129> back<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.910> actual

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
you should have to go back to the actual

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.380 
you should have to go back to the actual
machine<00:00:49.469> or<00:00:49.710> go<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.489> inside<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.120> load<00:00:51.239> of

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
machine or go with inside the load of

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.290 
machine or go with inside the load of
chunks<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.899> do<00:00:52.739> some<00:00:53.070> stuff

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.640 

yeah<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.480> go<00:01:00.630> back<00:01:00.780> inside<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.380> loaded

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
yeah just go back inside the loaded

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.170 
yeah just go back inside the loaded
trunks<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.190> look<00:01:02.400> at<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.640> piece<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.060> wire

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
trunks and look at this piece of wire

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.750 
trunks and look at this piece of wire
and<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.720> stops<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.199> entire<00:01:04.379> pulse<00:01:04.760> it's

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
and it stops the entire pulse it's

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.310 
and it stops the entire pulse it's
basically<00:01:06.120> a<00:01:06.770> manual<00:01:07.770> reset<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.270> will<00:01:09.390> and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
basically a manual reset if you will and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.660 
basically a manual reset if you will and
then<00:01:10.500> once<00:01:10.710> you're<00:01:10.890> inside<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.370> loaded

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
then once you're inside the loaded

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.950 
then once you're inside the loaded
chunks<00:01:12.060> yeah<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.260> string<00:01:13.920> looks<00:01:14.630> reacts<00:01:15.630> more

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
chunks yeah the string looks reacts more

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.680 
chunks yeah the string looks reacts more
like<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> button<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.340> by<00:01:18.180> looking<00:01:18.360> at<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
like a button so by looking at the

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.870 
like a button so by looking at the
string<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.710> starts<00:01:20.070> creating<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.490> poles<00:01:20.700> but

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
string it starts creating the poles but

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.270 
string it starts creating the poles but
if<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.119> look<00:01:21.240> away<00:01:21.390> from<00:01:21.690> string<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.979> stops

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
if you look away from string it stops

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.249 
if you look away from string it stops
the<00:01:23.430> pulse<00:01:27.320> now<00:01:29.720> I'll<00:01:30.720> show<00:01:30.899> you<00:01:31.080> why<00:01:31.229> this

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
the pulse now I'll show you why this

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.280 
the pulse now I'll show you why this
works<00:01:31.619> basically<00:01:35.210> basically<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.080> remove

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
works basically basically if you remove

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.050 
works basically basically if you remove
that<00:01:37.320> thing<00:01:37.830> you<00:01:38.729> see<00:01:38.910> it<00:01:39.000> starts<00:01:39.300> pulsing

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
that thing you see it starts pulsing

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.800 
that thing you see it starts pulsing
yeah<00:01:44.270> but<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:47.490> thing<00:01:47.520> with<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.360> it's

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
yeah but the thing with this is it's

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.620 
yeah but the thing with this is it's
like<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.289> actual<00:01:49.560> other<00:01:49.770> wireless<00:01:50.250> redstone

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
like the actual other wireless redstone

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.050 
like the actual other wireless redstone
I'll<00:01:52.280> ways<00:01:53.280> as<00:01:54.590> mine<00:01:55.590> cart<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.160> constantly

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
I'll ways as mine cart is constantly

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.650 
I'll ways as mine cart is constantly
coming<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.350> off<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.800> that<00:01:59.160> tripwire<00:01:59.660> this

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
coming on and off of that tripwire this

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.180 
coming on and off of that tripwire this
is<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:01.050> up<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.320> down<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.770> piston

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
is going up and down like a piston

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.789 
is going up and down like a piston
basically<00:02:03.860> same<00:02:04.860> principle<00:02:05.400> almost<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.799> then

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
basically same principle almost and then

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.590 
basically same principle almost and then
just<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.519> stabilize<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.390> place

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
just to stabilize you have to place

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:20.760 
just to stabilize you have to place
another<00:02:09.750> piece<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:11.570> trip<00:02:12.570> wire<00:02:12.750> above<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:15.830> yeah

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:28.320 

that's<00:02:21.430> how<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:21.670> works<00:02:21.730> but<00:02:26.070> yeah<00:02:27.070> my<00:02:27.400> left

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
that's how that works but yeah my left

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.940 
that's how that works but yeah my left
all<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:28.780> left<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.230> just<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.680> show<00:02:29.830> you<00:02:29.860> how

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
all that is left is just to show you how

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.850 
all that is left is just to show you how
to<00:02:30.040> build<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.960> want<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.260> grab<00:02:32.470> two

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
to build it so you want to grab two

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.800 
to build it so you want to grab two
blocks<00:02:33.130> your<00:02:33.310> choice<00:02:33.550> place<00:02:34.480> them<00:02:34.630> with<00:02:34.780> a

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
blocks your choice place them with a

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.970 
blocks your choice place them with a
three<00:02:35.110> gap<00:02:35.350> in<00:02:36.280> between<00:02:37.230> get<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.440> trip<00:02:38.800> wire

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
three gap in between get to trip wire

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.800 
three gap in between get to trip wire
hooks<00:02:39.390> +1<00:02:40.390> +1<00:02:40.660> they're<00:02:42.270> not<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.300> redstone<00:02:43.690> torch

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
hooks +1 +1 they're not a redstone torch

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.080 
hooks +1 +1 they're not a redstone torch
put<00:02:44.500> string<00:02:45.660> get<00:02:46.660> your<00:02:47.490> rail<00:02:48.490> make<00:02:48.940> it

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
put string get your rail make it

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.460 
put string get your rail make it
straight<00:02:49.390> I<00:02:50.310> use<00:02:51.310> powered<00:02:51.610> rails<00:02:51.820> because

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
straight I use powered rails because

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.250 
straight I use powered rails because
carts<00:02:53.470> don't<00:02:53.650> move<00:02:53.800> is<00:02:53.920> faster<00:02:54.310> for<00:02:54.460> them

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
carts don't move is faster for them

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.170 
carts don't move is faster for them
first<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.380> bit<00:02:56.530> far<00:02:56.770> you<00:02:57.580> have<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.790> get<00:02:57.910> it<00:02:58.030> just

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
first a bit far you have to get it just

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:12.380 
first a bit far you have to get it just
so's<00:02:59.010> just<00:03:00.010> hovering

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.260 

pretty<00:03:13.390> sure<00:03:13.540> destroyed<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:14.140> thing<00:03:14.170> first

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
pretty sure destroyed that thing first

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:22.590 
pretty sure destroyed that thing first
my<00:03:16.270> bad<00:03:20.010> yeah<00:03:21.010> sorry<00:03:21.790> they<00:03:22.090> interfere<00:03:22.450> with

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
my bad yeah sorry they interfere with

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.180 
my bad yeah sorry they interfere with
each<00:03:22.690> other<00:03:22.930> I'm<00:03:23.290> still<00:03:23.530> trying<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.860> find<00:03:24.040> a

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
each other I'm still trying to find a

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.820 
each other I'm still trying to find a
way<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.570> making<00:03:25.570> them<00:03:25.720> so<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:25.960> can<00:03:26.380> put<00:03:26.650> them

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
way of making them so you can put them

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.280 
way of making them so you can put them
on<00:03:26.920> different<00:03:27.100> bands<00:03:27.700> it's<00:03:28.420> like<00:03:28.660> frequency

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
on different bands it's like frequency

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.470 
on different bands it's like frequency
bands<00:03:29.650> so<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.430> can<00:03:30.610> control<00:03:30.910> them<00:03:31.000> different

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
bands so you can control them different

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.260 
bands so you can control them different
ways<00:03:31.830> but<00:03:32.830> that's<00:03:33.400> for<00:03:33.550> another<00:03:33.580> video<00:03:33.880> as

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
ways but that's for another video as

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.140 
ways but that's for another video as
still<00:03:35.020> trying<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.290> figure<00:03:35.410> that<00:03:35.530> out<00:03:36.150> getting

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
still trying to figure that out getting

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.900 
still trying to figure that out getting
there<00:03:37.300> though<00:03:37.800> yeah<00:03:38.800> so<00:03:39.310> now<00:03:39.460> you've<00:03:39.580> got<00:03:39.730> that

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
there though yeah so now you've got that

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.450 
there though yeah so now you've got that
if<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:40.570> if<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.410> place<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.620> redstone<00:03:41.830> on<00:03:42.250> the

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
if you if you place a redstone on the

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.530 
if you if you place a redstone on the
top<00:03:42.670> there<00:03:42.880> you<00:03:43.210> see<00:03:43.450> it's<00:03:43.570> pulsing<00:03:43.960> and<00:03:45.540> now

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
top there you see it's pulsing and now

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.420 
top there you see it's pulsing and now
just<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:46.900> stabilize<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.500> pulsing<00:03:47.890> just<00:03:48.280> place

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
just to stabilize the pulsing just place

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.580 
just to stabilize the pulsing just place
another<00:03:48.610> piece<00:03:48.910> of<00:03:49.290> wire<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.620> trip<00:03:51.459> of<00:03:52.590> string

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
another piece of wire a trip of string

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.060 
another piece of wire a trip of string
there<00:03:53.830> look<00:03:54.550> at<00:03:54.640> that<00:03:54.760> piece<00:03:54.940> of<00:03:54.970> string<00:03:55.330> and

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
there look at that piece of string and

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.510 
there look at that piece of string and
there<00:03:57.070> you<00:03:57.160> go<00:03:57.420> stabilized<00:03:58.420> and<00:03:58.690> now<00:03:59.520> nice

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
there you go stabilized and now nice

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.050 
there you go stabilized and now nice
piece<00:04:00.730> of<00:04:00.760> string<00:04:01.030> down<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:03.670> starts<00:04:03.910> doing

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
piece of string down it starts doing

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.350 
piece of string down it starts doing
that<00:04:05.610> but<00:04:06.610> as<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:08.230> can<00:04:08.320> see<00:04:08.530> that<00:04:09.209> I'll<00:04:10.209> show

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
that but as you can see that I'll show

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.290 
that but as you can see that I'll show
you<00:04:10.450> here<00:04:10.860> you<00:04:11.860> can't<00:04:12.190> put<00:04:12.610> this<00:04:12.730> as<00:04:13.030> in<00:04:13.240> a

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
you here you can't put this as in a

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.670 
you here you can't put this as in a
normal<00:04:13.620> output<00:04:14.620> with<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.250> redstone<00:04:15.580> torch

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.990 

you<00:04:20.680> see<00:04:20.890> right<00:04:21.070> it<00:04:21.459> doesn't<00:04:21.609> affect<00:04:21.910> the

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
you see right it doesn't affect the

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.270 
you see right it doesn't affect the
redstone<00:04:22.360> torch<00:04:22.600> it's<00:04:22.930> not<00:04:23.050> fast<00:04:23.290> enough<00:04:23.440> so

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
redstone torch it's not fast enough so

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.940 
redstone torch it's not fast enough so
you<00:04:24.340> have<00:04:24.640> to<00:04:24.790> use<00:04:24.910> piston<00:04:25.419> as<00:04:26.169> shown<00:04:26.800> over

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
you have to use piston as shown over

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:34.290 
you have to use piston as shown over
here<00:04:30.600> and<00:04:31.600> then<00:04:32.460> yeah<00:04:33.460> so<00:04:33.669> the<00:04:33.790> piston<00:04:34.150> will

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
here and then yeah so the piston will

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.500 
here and then yeah so the piston will
normally<00:04:34.660> be<00:04:34.690> extended<00:04:35.350> it<00:04:35.680> will<00:04:35.860> and<00:04:36.510> then

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
normally be extended it will and then

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.480 
normally be extended it will and then
when<00:04:37.900> you<00:04:38.020> get<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:38.260> pulse<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.740> retracts<00:04:39.190> and

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
when you get the pulse it retracts and

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.909 
when you get the pulse it retracts and
goes<00:04:40.330> over<00:04:40.540> here<00:04:40.870> goes<00:04:41.230> over<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:41.620> redstone

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
goes over here goes over the redstone

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:48.450 
goes over here goes over the redstone
torch<00:04:42.250> which<00:04:42.520> releases<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:43.090> pulse<00:04:45.690> yeah<00:04:47.460> so

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
torch which releases the pulse yeah so

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.120 
torch which releases the pulse yeah so
basically<00:04:48.669> that's<00:04:48.910> how<00:04:49.030> that<00:04:49.180> works<00:04:49.240> and<00:04:50.130> i'll

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
basically that's how that works and i'll

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.490 
basically that's how that works and i'll
be<00:04:51.400> sure<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:51.580> be<00:04:51.730> improving<00:04:52.030> this<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.510> i<00:04:53.260> just
