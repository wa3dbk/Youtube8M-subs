different screens on the lg g3 and the
note<00:00:23.250> 4<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:24.180> would<00:00:24.300> be<00:00:24.449> one<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.930> many<00:00:25.170> things

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
phone it's also one of the most

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.200 
phone it's also one of the most
important<00:00:29.130> factors<00:00:29.490> when<00:00:29.670> choosing<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:30.029> phone

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
because this is what you're going to

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.049 
because this is what you're going to
look<00:00:31.679> at<00:00:31.890> while<00:00:32.250> you're<00:00:32.460> using<00:00:32.640> your<00:00:32.910> phone

you'll be looking at the screen so it

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.790 
you'll be looking at the screen so it
should<00:00:35.880> weigh<00:00:36.090> heavily<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.660> your<00:00:36.960> decision<00:00:37.440> so

one of these would be a good phone if

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.270 
one of these would be a good phone if
you're<00:01:06.930> looking<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.350> phone<00:01:07.590> size<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.220> you

you're looking for phone size and you

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.160 
you're looking for phone size and you
want<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> smaller<00:01:08.820> device<00:01:09.090> obviously<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> LG

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
want a smaller device obviously the LG

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.870 
want a smaller device obviously the LG
g3<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.860> way<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.040> go<00:01:11.250> you're<00:01:11.610> not<00:01:11.640> really

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
g3 is the way to go you're not really

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.730 
g3 is the way to go you're not really
giving<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.270> much<00:01:12.570> when<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.260> comes<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> screen

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
giving up much when it comes to screen

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.350 
giving up much when it comes to screen
real<00:01:13.950> estate<00:01:14.280> if<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.549> go<00:01:14.670> with<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.909> g3

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
real estate if you go with the g3

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.140 
real estate if you go with the g3
because<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.799> slightly<00:01:17.040> smaller<00:01:17.610> one

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
because it is just slightly smaller one

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.460 
because it is just slightly smaller one
thing<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.360> should<00:01:18.570> consider<00:01:18.659> when<00:01:19.350> you're

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
thing you should consider when you're

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.679 
thing you should consider when you're
thinking<00:01:19.530> about<00:01:19.890> screen<00:01:20.340> size<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
thinking about screen size is that the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.440 
thinking about screen size is that the
LG<00:01:21.960> g3<00:01:22.110> does<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.909> on-screen<00:01:23.909> buttons<00:01:24.299> so

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
LG g3 does have on-screen buttons so

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.030 
LG g3 does have on-screen buttons so
that<00:01:24.570> actually<00:01:24.930> does<00:01:25.110> take<00:01:25.500> away<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> little

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
that actually does take away a little

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.359 
that actually does take away a little
bit<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:27.210> screen<00:01:27.570> real<00:01:27.780> estate<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.950> note<00:01:29.070> 4

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
bit of the screen real estate the note 4

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.310 
bit of the screen real estate the note 4
has<00:01:30.090> no<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.450> on-screen<00:01:30.750> buttons<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.079> actually

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320

than the LG g3 both phones are turned to
full<00:02:38.730> brightness<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.810> can<00:02:39.989> see<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> clear

note<00:02:43.050> 4<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.349> definitely<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.860> much<00:02:44.130> brighter

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
note 4 is definitely a much brighter

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.479 
note 4 is definitely a much brighter

does have a brighter screen I find that

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.940 
does have a brighter screen I find that
the<00:02:50.310> LG<00:02:50.610> g3<00:02:50.819> is<00:02:51.330> actually<00:02:51.780> easier<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.440> see<00:02:52.680> in

the LG g3 is actually easier to see in

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.890 
the LG g3 is actually easier to see in
sunlight<00:02:53.519> which<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.269> kind<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.540> odd<00:02:54.720> because

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
sunlight which is kind of odd because

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.809 
sunlight which is kind of odd because
it's<00:02:55.200> not<00:02:55.319> as<00:02:55.530> bright<00:02:55.799> as<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.069> g3<00:02:56.459> but<00:02:56.640> for

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
it's not as bright as the g3 but for

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.270 
it's not as bright as the g3 but for
some<00:02:57.060> reason<00:02:57.480> I'm<00:02:57.660> not<00:02:58.170> sure<00:02:58.410> if<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.799> has<00:02:58.830> I

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
some reason I'm not sure if it has I

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.150 
some reason I'm not sure if it has I
just<00:02:59.340> a<00:03:00.120> screen<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:00.959> less<00:03:01.260> prone<00:03:02.130> to

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
just a screen that is less prone to

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.670 
just a screen that is less prone to
glare<00:03:02.760> than<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.720> note<00:03:03.870> 4<00:03:04.110> I'm<00:03:04.319> not<00:03:04.500> really

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
glare than the note 4 I'm not really

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.339 
glare than the note 4 I'm not really
sure<00:03:04.830> what<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.670> difference<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:06.330> but<00:03:07.110> when<00:03:07.260> I'm

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
sure what the difference is but when I'm

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.020 
sure what the difference is but when I'm
standing<00:03:07.620> outside<00:03:07.769> in<00:03:08.160> direct<00:03:08.430> sunlight<00:03:08.700> it

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
standing outside in direct sunlight it

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.000 
standing outside in direct sunlight it
seems<00:03:09.269> like<00:03:09.420> as<00:03:09.569> I<00:03:09.810> can<00:03:10.049> see<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.319> LG<00:03:10.590> g3

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
seems like as I can see the LG g3

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.009 
seems like as I can see the LG g3
I'm<00:03:11.489> much<00:03:11.700> clearer<00:03:11.970> than<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.209> note<00:03:12.299> 4<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.569> tend

much neck and neck as far as the screens
are<00:04:53.940> concerned<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:54.510> actually<00:04:54.720> enjoyed<00:04:55.230> the

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
are concerned I actually enjoyed the

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.620 
are concerned I actually enjoyed the
extra<00:04:55.860> real<00:04:56.040> estate<00:04:56.370> although<00:04:56.940> this<00:04:57.150> phone<00:04:57.390> is

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
extra real estate although this phone is

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.050 
extra real estate although this phone is
much<00:04:57.930> bulkier<00:04:58.320> I<00:04:58.470> do<00:04:58.590> have<00:04:58.740> to<00:04:58.890> kind<00:04:59.070> of<00:04:59.160> move

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
much bulkier I do have to kind of move

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.370 
much bulkier I do have to kind of move
it<00:05:00.180> around<00:05:00.240> in<00:05:00.480> my<00:05:00.570> hand<00:05:00.720> to<00:05:00.870> get<00:05:01.020> to<00:05:01.170> all

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
it around in my hand to get to all

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.980 
it around in my hand to get to all
corners<00:05:02.010> of<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.400> screen<00:05:02.640> but<00:05:03.390> not<00:05:03.600> having<00:05:03.840> the

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
corners of the screen but not having the

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.050 
corners of the screen but not having the
on-screen<00:05:04.560> buttons<00:05:04.920> on<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.400> screen<00:05:05.670> itself

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
on-screen buttons on the screen itself

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.000 
on-screen buttons on the screen itself
and<00:05:06.300> then<00:05:06.660> having<00:05:06.960> that<00:05:06.990> tiny<00:05:07.500> bit<00:05:07.740> of<00:05:07.890> extra

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
and then having that tiny bit of extra

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.220 
and then having that tiny bit of extra
screen<00:05:08.400> real<00:05:08.430> estate<00:05:08.640> is<00:05:09.030> a<00:05:09.330> plus<00:05:09.660> in<00:05:09.870> my<00:05:09.900> mind

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
screen real estate is a plus in my mind

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.230 
screen real estate is a plus in my mind

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.210 
and then the Super AMOLED screen is much
brighter<00:05:12.540> and<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.440> colors<00:05:13.710> are<00:05:13.860> more<00:05:14.040> vibrant

brighter and the colors are more vibrant

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.700 
brighter and the colors are more vibrant
it<00:05:14.550> just<00:05:14.730> looks<00:05:15.120> better<00:05:15.420> to<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.230> eye<00:05:16.260> but
