growth is that your biceps and triceps

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.349 
growth is that your biceps and triceps
only<00:01:39.139> require<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.619> very<00:01:40.249> small<00:01:40.759> amount<00:01:41.149> of

direct stimulation so if you want to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.510 
direct stimulation so if you want to
achieve<00:01:44.659> some<00:01:45.079> real<00:01:45.350> bicep<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.009> tricep
