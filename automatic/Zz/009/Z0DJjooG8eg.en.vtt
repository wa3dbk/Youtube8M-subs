the<00:02:43.120> same<00:02:43.330> DIY<00:02:43.780> polishes<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.290> we<00:02:44.530> made

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
the same DIY polishes that we made

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.800 
the same DIY polishes that we made
before<00:02:44.830> but<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.310> wanted<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.850> get<00:02:46.000> super<00:02:46.480> precise

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
before but I wanted to get super precise

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.160 
before but I wanted to get super precise
and<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.260> used<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.650> tiny<00:02:48.040> little<00:02:48.340> brush<00:02:48.900> but<00:02:49.900> it

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
and I used a tiny little brush but it

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.930 
and I used a tiny little brush but it
took<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.380> long<00:02:50.590> time<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:51.040> color<00:02:51.250> everything<00:02:51.580> in

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
took a long time to color everything in

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.380 
took a long time to color everything in
nicely<00:02:52.209> oh<00:02:52.660> well<00:02:53.790> looks<00:02:54.790> pretty<00:02:54.880> cool<00:02:55.180> though

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
nicely oh well looks pretty cool though

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.570 
nicely oh well looks pretty cool though
I<00:02:55.600> think<00:02:56.230> will<00:02:56.560> look<00:02:56.680> much<00:02:56.920> better<00:02:57.160> in<00:02:57.400> more

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
I think will look much better in more

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.010 
I think will look much better in more
vibrant<00:02:58.060> colors
