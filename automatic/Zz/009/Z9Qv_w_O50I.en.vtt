00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.510 
so first he'll flip nice and popped
obviously<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.079> didn't<00:00:49.350> get<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.680> spin<00:00:50.010> fully

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
obviously you didn't get the spin fully

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.799 
obviously you didn't get the spin fully
down<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.270> that's<00:00:51.390> okay

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
down but that's okay

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.900 
down but that's okay
second<00:00:54.809> he'll<00:00:54.989> flip<00:00:55.199> same<00:00:55.530> thing<00:00:55.860> nice<00:00:56.699> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
second he'll flip same thing nice and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.610 
second he'll flip same thing nice and
pop<00:00:57.120> though<00:00:57.360> leaser<00:00:57.780> you're<00:00:58.109> leveling<00:00:58.500> out

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
pop though leaser you're leveling out

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.009 
pop though leaser you're leveling out
the<00:00:58.680> board<00:00:59.070> nice<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.489> straight

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.240 

cool<00:01:04.019> then<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.409> one<00:01:04.559> went<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.860> little<00:01:05.129> bit

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
cool then that one went a little bit

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.270 
cool then that one went a little bit
rocket<00:01:05.930> just<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.110> guys<00:01:07.229> know<00:01:07.290> what<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.010> mean

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
rocket just so you guys know what I mean

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.370 
rocket just so you guys know what I mean
when<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.460> say<00:01:08.729> rocket<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.299> means<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.990> board

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
when I say rocket it means the board

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.950 
when I say rocket it means the board
goes<00:01:11.280> with<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> nose<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.360> high<00:01:12.630> up<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
goes with the nose like high up in the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.620 
goes with the nose like high up in the
air<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> tail<00:01:13.799> further<00:01:14.310> down<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.540> you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
air and the tail further down so you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.149 
air and the tail further down so you
want<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.900> level<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> board<00:01:16.560> out<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> air

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
want to level the board out in the air

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.460 
want to level the board out in the air
so<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.520> doesn't<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.570> that's<00:01:19.290> called

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
so it doesn't do that and that's called

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.460 
so it doesn't do that and that's called
rocket<00:01:20.060> good<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.509> these<00:01:21.720> other<00:01:21.960> ones<00:01:22.259> it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
rocket good so on these other ones it

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.340 
rocket good so on these other ones it
looks<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.770> you're<00:01:22.950> flipping<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> better

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
looks like you're flipping it better

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.039 
looks like you're flipping it better
getting<00:01:25.350> closer<00:01:26.509> it<00:01:27.509> looks<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.869> you've

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
getting closer it looks like you've

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.830 
getting closer it looks like you've
practiced<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.770> hill<00:01:29.009> flip<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.460> lot<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.659> you've

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
practiced the hill flip a lot and you've

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.649 
practiced the hill flip a lot and you've
put<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.079> lot<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.439> work<00:01:31.680> into<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.579> one<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
put a lot of work into it and one of the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.130 
put a lot of work into it and one of the
things<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:35.100> see<00:01:35.369> by<00:01:35.880> watching<00:01:36.540> me<00:01:36.840> ski

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
things that I can see by watching me ski

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.020 
things that I can see by watching me ski
is<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.009> again<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.430> looks<00:01:38.610> like<00:01:38.820> you're<00:01:39.000> just

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
is that again it looks like you're just

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.420 
is that again it looks like you're just
a<00:01:39.390> little<00:01:39.659> bit<00:01:39.990> uncomfortable<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.369> think

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
a little bit uncomfortable like I think

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.429 
a little bit uncomfortable like I think
it<00:01:41.700> would<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.090> lot<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.420> good<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:43.229> to

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
it would do you a lot of good just to

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.249 
it would do you a lot of good just to
ride<00:01:44.189> your<00:01:44.399> board<00:01:44.670> around<00:01:44.909> going<00:01:45.299> fast<00:01:45.780> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
ride your board around going fast and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.859 
ride your board around going fast and
then<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.189> learn<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.270> tricks<00:01:48.570> in

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
then to learn all of the tricks in

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.710 
then to learn all of the tricks in
between<00:01:49.350> Ollie<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.070> he'll<00:01:50.399> flip<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.970> think

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
between Ollie and he'll flip I think

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.899 
between Ollie and he'll flip I think
learning<00:01:52.590> those<00:01:53.009> tricks<00:01:53.369> would<00:01:53.549> help<00:01:53.790> your

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
learning those tricks would help your

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.980 
learning those tricks would help your
he'll<00:01:54.149> flip<00:01:54.360> out<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> lot<00:01:56.540> so<00:01:57.540> here<00:01:57.750> I'm<00:01:57.869> gonna

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
he'll flip out a lot so here I'm gonna

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.780 
he'll flip out a lot so here I'm gonna
run<00:01:58.200> through<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.619> tricks<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.250> suggest

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
run through the tricks that I suggest

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.910 
run through the tricks that I suggest
it's<00:02:00.149> writing<00:02:00.780> basics<00:02:01.409> how<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.590> ollie

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
it's writing basics how to ollie

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.429 
it's writing basics how to ollie
frontside<00:02:02.610> 180<00:02:02.939> backside<00:02:03.479> 180<00:02:03.750> pop<00:02:04.049> shuvit

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
frontside 180 backside 180 pop shuvit

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.679 
frontside 180 backside 180 pop shuvit
frontside<00:02:04.920> shove-it<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.579> then<00:02:06.090> heel<00:02:06.390> flip

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
frontside shove-it and then heel flip

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.600 
frontside shove-it and then heel flip
and<00:02:06.960> then<00:02:07.770> kickflip

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and then kickflip

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.809 
and then kickflip
so<00:02:09.390> Ollie<00:02:10.069> frontside<00:02:11.069> 180<00:02:11.400> backside<00:02:12.090> 180

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
so Ollie frontside 180 backside 180

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.759 
so Ollie frontside 180 backside 180

the board is gonna spin a little better
this<00:03:28.720> was<00:03:28.900> actually<00:03:29.109> a<00:03:29.290> good<00:03:29.590> attempt<00:03:30.159> because

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
this was actually a good attempt because

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.479 
this was actually a good attempt because
you<00:03:31.720> just<00:03:32.199> took<00:03:32.349> your<00:03:32.409> back<00:03:32.769> foot<00:03:33.040> off<00:03:33.069> and

then landed with your front foot which
is<00:03:35.829> good<00:03:36.220> because<00:03:36.400> that's<00:03:36.759> a<00:03:36.879> good<00:03:37.090> way<00:03:37.239> to

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
is good because that's a good way to

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.199 
is good because that's a good way to
practice<00:03:37.959> in<00:03:38.229> order<00:03:38.439> to<00:03:38.799> get<00:03:39.069> the<00:03:39.459> spin<00:03:39.819> and

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
practice in order to get the spin and

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.199 
practice in order to get the spin and
the<00:03:40.299> flick<00:03:40.629> of<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.870> he'll<00:03:41.139> flip<00:03:41.379> fully<00:03:41.680> down

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
the flick of the he'll flip fully down

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.360 
the flick of the he'll flip fully down
so<00:03:43.209> what<00:03:43.389> you<00:03:43.509> should<00:03:43.569> do<00:03:43.989> honestly<00:03:44.739> is<00:03:45.040> just

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
so what you should do honestly is just

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.499 
so what you should do honestly is just
practice<00:03:45.819> that<00:03:46.030> part<00:03:46.900> of<00:03:47.049> it<00:03:47.229> a<00:03:47.470> lot<00:03:48.459> step<00:03:49.299> off

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:49.509 
practice that part of it a lot step off

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:51.089 
practice that part of it a lot step off

eventually when you get both of those

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.069 
eventually when you get both of those
two<00:04:11.799> steps<00:04:12.129> very<00:04:12.310> comfortable<00:04:13.150> then<00:04:13.810> you<00:04:13.930> can

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
two steps very comfortable then you can

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.920 
two steps very comfortable then you can
