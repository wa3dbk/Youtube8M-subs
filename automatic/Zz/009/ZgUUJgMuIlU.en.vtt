almost<00:02:31.600> full<00:02:31.990> health<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.500> could<00:02:32.650> have<00:02:32.740> just

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
almost full health and I could have just

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.020 
almost full health and I could have just
alpha<00:02:33.130> strikes<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.460> rabbit<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.760> death<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.000> I

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
alpha strikes the rabbit to death and I

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.150 
alpha strikes the rabbit to death and I
decide<00:02:34.270> indeed<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.690> do<00:02:34.900> just<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.530> now

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
decide indeed you do just that and now

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.870 
decide indeed you do just that and now
that<00:02:36.610> I'm<00:02:36.700> faster<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:39.010> kind<00:02:39.490> of<00:02:39.580> want<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.790> do

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
that I'm faster you kind of want to do

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.190 
that I'm faster you kind of want to do
damage<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.270> first<00:02:40.510> turn<00:02:40.720> against<00:02:40.930> Ricky

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
damage the first turn against Ricky

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.780

because<00:02:41.440> after<00:02:41.830> this<00:02:41.980> first<00:02:42.220> turn<00:02:42.400> he's<00:02:42.640> gonna

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
because after this first turn he's gonna

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.520 
because after this first turn he's gonna
go<00:02:43.000> ahead<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.300> cast<00:02:43.810> his<00:02:43.930> own<00:02:44.050> cute<00:02:44.320> face<00:02:44.500> and

it's gonna be a lot harder to get damage
on<00:02:45.970> him<00:02:46.090> so<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.660> decided<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:47.020> alpha<00:02:47.320> strike<00:02:47.560> and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
on him so I decided to alpha strike and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.320 
on him so I decided to alpha strike and
then<00:02:48.010> renew<00:02:48.340> my<00:02:48.460> tranquil<00:02:48.850> that's<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.090> just<00:02:49.210> be

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
then renew my tranquil that's it just be
