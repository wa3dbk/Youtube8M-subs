00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.170
 this is ours 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.929
 cozy chip that created already 13 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.450
 For years she has been visiting her three beautiful daughters 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.700
 they want to take tatyana away from us 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.680
 can believe and with three children want 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.510
 evict the news that the house is in 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.250
 which she lives changed owner as 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.140
 out of the blue she is alone 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.920
 brings up daughters and every penny in 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.330
 family counts 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.699
 and now almost all child allowance 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.849
 will have to give for the apartment I 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.890
 I can written there if we do not 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.230
 sign a lease on his 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.489
 I must be significantly evicted to no one 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.550
 help here and the real 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.590
 yourself where to go really nowhere 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.840
 let me go outside and live in 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.780
 a tent with three children small 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.579
 a similar situation seemed like 89 more families 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.500
 this apartment building is not a tenant 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.480
 hide emotions they all got housing 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.250
 by perpetuity for decades 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.930
 worked hard to a building company and ask 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.340
 only utility bills true 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.500
 exploiting the house very soon 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.390
 the company began to incur losses early 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.120
 years for service in particular this 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.719
 houses in brest and settlements of all 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.150
 housing issues were 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.920
 a separate company has been established whether new 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.659
 owner former achievements of workers 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.430
 enterprises today do not worry residents 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.020
 less than when receiving keys 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.610
 We were offered three options or we 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.530
 buy these apartments for commercial 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.270
 cost or dress as charge on 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.750
 housing either vacated occupied 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.729
 apartments 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.830
 desperate tenants asked for help 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.810
 to the local authorities but they found out that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.890
 removed from the queue at the apartment as they consider 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.979
 people are illegal 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.530
 this was removed from the state line 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.720
 then I don't understand how we could 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.670
 be in a private house in accordance 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.530
 with the current housing legislation 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.509
 in need of better housing conditions 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.630
 recognized citizens who on 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.549
 each family member accounted for less than 15 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.570
 square meters total area 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.760
 one man 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.320
 so these people 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.110
 were deregistered since they were 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.820
 endowed with a total area of living space 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.010
 more than 15 square meters per one 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.870
 man according to experts private 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.350
 the company has the right to conclude a new 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.570
 contract 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.520
 but on old terms prove it 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.720
 the truth will have to be the judges therefore while in 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.310
 city â€‹â€‹administration residents 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.650
 advised to find a competent lawyer 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.030
 private company management explains its 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.890
 organization's resources intends 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.930
 to use as efficiently as possible but 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.880
 outside nobody evicted would not be accepted 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.880
 decision to vacate 17 apartments from 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.130
 charging for residential use 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.230
 premises well in principle among these 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.740
 apartments and there are apartments where they live 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.210
 disabled 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.190
 there are warriors end the mood 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.800
 Afghan soldiers here have to drink our 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.630
 pensioners are not planned to evict those 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.950
 who will continue in good faith though 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.540
 and I would even pay for the same 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.090
 utility payments because there is in 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.380
 home and those who delay payment 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.140
 we will take on each of them 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.660
 separate solution but let's say with the possible 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.850
 either 50 percent exemption or 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.860
 may even turn on someone again 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.200
 same list of those 17 of whom we 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.300
 have already identified however such a promise 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.250
 the glands of a frequent apartment building are not 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.600
 believe one and a half year old ulyana of course 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.120
 do not understand anything in the apartment 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.130
 twists and turns like this that her moms don't have money 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.590
 on a good lawyer while in response tatyana 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.780
