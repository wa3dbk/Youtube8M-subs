hunter now hunters are a very unique

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.670 
hunter now hunters are a very unique
class<00:00:16.859> because<00:00:17.520> they<00:00:18.240> are<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:18.690> easy<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.170> level

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
class because they are so easy to level

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.320 
class because they are so easy to level
while<00:00:20.430> leveling<00:00:21.150> up<00:00:21.480> your<00:00:22.289> pet<00:00:22.560> tanks<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.910> mob

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
while leveling up your pet tanks the mob

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.120 
while leveling up your pet tanks the mob
you<00:00:24.600> shoot<00:00:24.869> down<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.170> mob<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.380> heal<00:00:25.740> your<00:00:25.890> pet

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
you shoot down the mob you heal your pet

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.830 
you shoot down the mob you heal your pet
you<00:00:26.400> go<00:00:26.580> out<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.390> repeat<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> process

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
you go out and you repeat the process

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.380 
you go out and you repeat the process
and<00:00:28.439> because<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.160> people<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
and because of that people have the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.870 
and because of that people have the
misconception<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:31.410> hunters<00:00:32.070> are<00:00:32.309> very<00:00:32.520> easy

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
misconception that hunters are very easy

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.479 
misconception that hunters are very easy
and<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.450> simple<00:00:33.780> class<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.140> play<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:35.190> game

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
and a simple class to play in in game

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.610 
and a simple class to play in in game
rating<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.329> that's<00:00:36.540> definitely<00:00:36.960> not<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
rating but that's definitely not the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.610 
rating but that's definitely not the
case<00:00:37.649> hunters<00:00:38.309> are<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:39.300> very<00:00:39.570> complex<00:00:40.230> class

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
case hunters are a very complex class

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.680 
case hunters are a very complex class
and<00:00:40.950> there's<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.610> lot<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.059> stuff<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.570> have

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
and there's a lot of stuff that you have

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.150 
and there's a lot of stuff that you have
to<00:00:42.780> worry<00:00:42.960> about<00:00:43.020> as<00:00:43.440> well<00:00:43.770> as<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.920> lot<00:00:44.129> of

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
skills you have to worry about to play

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.979 
skills you have to worry about to play
your<00:00:46.110> class<00:00:46.350> well<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.570> I'm<00:00:48.719> gonna<00:00:48.840> give

you these tips and hopefully you can
take<00:00:50.700> them<00:00:50.879> away<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:53.000> use<00:00:54.000> these<00:00:54.239> tips<00:00:54.510> so

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
take them away and use these tips so

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.439 
take them away and use these tips so
that<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.559> can<00:00:55.710> separate<00:00:56.100> yourself<00:00:56.390> out<00:00:57.390> of

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
that you can separate yourself out of

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.540 
that you can separate yourself out of
all<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.320> other<00:00:58.530> thousands<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.219> hunters<00:00:59.520> who

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
all the other thousands of hunters who

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.770 
all the other thousands of hunters who
don't<00:00:59.969> really<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.570> in-game<00:01:00.750> experience

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
don't really have the in-game experience

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.130 
don't really have the in-game experience
and<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.290> let's<00:01:04.769> start<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:06.570> first<00:01:06.750> skill<00:01:07.049> I'm

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
and so let's start the first skill I'm

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.770 
and so let's start the first skill I'm
gonna<00:01:07.290> talk<00:01:07.470> about<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.909> disengage<00:01:08.909> disengage

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
gonna talk about is disengage disengage

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.250 
gonna talk about is disengage disengage
is<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> skill<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.689> while<00:01:12.689> you're<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:12.900> combat

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
is a skill that while you're in combat

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.640 
is a skill that while you're in combat
leaps<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> hunter<00:01:14.610> backwards<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.420> what<00:01:16.380> this

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
leaps the hunter backwards and what this

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.550 
leaps the hunter backwards and what this
does<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.220> let's<00:01:17.700> say<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:17.970> PvP<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.689> melee<00:01:19.350> gets

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
does is let's say in PvP a melee gets

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.670 
does is let's say in PvP a melee gets
close<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.670> disengage<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
close to you you can just disengage and

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.100 
close to you you can just disengage and
continue<00:01:22.680> shooting<00:01:22.979> them<00:01:23.130> from<00:01:23.159> range<00:01:24.110> but

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
continue shooting them from range but

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.550 
continue shooting them from range but
this<00:01:25.290> also<00:01:25.560> has<00:01:25.860> some<00:01:26.520> great<00:01:27.210> PvE<00:01:27.750> mechanics

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
this also has some great PvE mechanics

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.130 
this also has some great PvE mechanics
and<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.790> very<00:01:30.000> important<00:01:30.420> skill<00:01:30.540> along

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
and it's a very important skill along

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.260 
and it's a very important skill along
with<00:01:31.350> any<00:01:31.590> other<00:01:31.680> skill<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.670> changes<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
with any other skill that changes the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.420 
with any other skill that changes the
character's<00:01:33.720> position<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.920> game<00:01:35.100> because

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
character's position in the game because

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.460 
character's position in the game because
it's<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.210> very<00:01:36.450> good<00:01:36.840> use<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.079> game<00:01:37.500> mechanics

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
it's a very good use of game mechanics

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.510 
it's a very good use of game mechanics
now<00:01:39.430> as<00:01:40.240> you<00:01:40.600> saw<00:01:40.750> I<00:01:40.780> just<00:01:41.110> let<00:01:41.350> backwards<00:01:41.920> with

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
now as you saw I just let backwards with

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.880 
now as you saw I just let backwards with
disengage<00:01:43.080> you<00:01:44.080> got<00:01:44.230> some<00:01:44.500> time<00:01:44.650> to<00:01:44.770> think

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
disengage you got some time to think

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.910 
disengage you got some time to think
outside<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.310> box<00:01:45.580> though<00:01:46.230> let's<00:01:47.230> say<00:01:47.440> I<00:01:47.470> am

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
outside the box though let's say I am

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.850 
outside the box though let's say I am
here<00:01:48.340> in<00:01:48.520> naxxramas<00:01:49.180> after<00:01:50.170> patchwork<00:01:50.680> and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
here in naxxramas after patchwork and

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.160 
here in naxxramas after patchwork and
there<00:01:51.580> is<00:01:51.730> a<00:01:51.760> magnet<00:01:52.150> here<00:01:52.180> why<00:01:52.870> is<00:01:52.930> there

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
there is a magnet here why is there

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.930 
there is a magnet here why is there
magnet<00:01:53.470> here<00:01:53.650> I<00:01:53.770> think<00:01:54.220> I<00:01:54.250> know<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.490> reason<00:01:54.790> I

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
magnet here I think I know the reason I

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.970 
magnet here I think I know the reason I
shoot<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.600> put<00:01:55.930> myself<00:01:56.050> in<00:01:56.410> combat<00:01:56.800> and

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
shoot it put myself in combat and

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.710 
shoot it put myself in combat and
disengage<00:01:57.460> right<00:01:57.760> over<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.150> green<00:01:58.330> pool<00:01:58.570> of

disengage right over the green pool of

and Here I am again in next time isn't a

and Here I am again in next time isn't a
deus<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.600> next<00:02:04.990> time<00:02:05.140> he<00:02:06.070> casts<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.910> polarity

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
deus and next time he casts a polarity

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.540 
deus and next time he casts a polarity
shift<00:02:07.870> and<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.410> get<00:02:08.619> your<00:02:08.740> polarity<00:02:09.250> change

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
shift and you get your polarity change

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.840 
shift and you get your polarity change
instead<00:02:10.450> of<00:02:10.510> running<00:02:10.869> around<00:02:11.280> jump<00:02:12.280> turn

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
instead of running around jump turn

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.630 
instead of running around jump turn
around<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.420> disengage<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:15.340> you'll<00:02:15.490> get

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
around and disengage and so you'll get

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.460 
around and disengage and so you'll get
over<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.300> other<00:02:16.390> side<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:16.690> much<00:02:17.020> faster

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
over to the other side that much faster

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.210 
over to the other side that much faster
and<00:02:17.590> have<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:17.980> extra<00:02:18.400> few<00:02:18.640> seconds<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.210> DPS

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
and have that extra few seconds to DPS

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.370 
and have that extra few seconds to DPS
now<00:02:21.220> just<00:02:21.430> remember<00:02:21.700> this<00:02:22.420> engage<00:02:22.810> can't

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
now just remember this engage can't

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.710 
now just remember this engage can't
really<00:02:23.800> work<00:02:24.100> once<00:02:24.640> your<00:02:25.000> back<00:02:25.240> is<00:02:25.480> turned

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
really work once your back is turned

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.940 
really work once your back is turned
uphill<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.220> what<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.460> need<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.670> do<00:02:27.850> is

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
uphill and so what you need to do is

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.220 
uphill and so what you need to do is
before<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.280> disengage<00:02:30.610> jump<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.750> then

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
before you disengage jump and then

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.350 
before you disengage jump and then
disengage<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.980> what<00:02:33.340> happens<00:02:33.880> when<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.210> do

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
disengage and what happens when you do

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.610 
disengage and what happens when you do
that<00:02:34.540> is<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:36.280> will<00:02:36.550> just<00:02:36.930> move<00:02:37.930> backwards

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
that is you will just move backwards

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.780 
that is you will just move backwards
leap<00:02:39.550> backwards<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.810> much<00:02:41.110> further<00:02:41.410> and

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
leap backwards that much further and

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.040 
leap backwards that much further and
this<00:02:42.790> can<00:02:42.940> also<00:02:43.090> work<00:02:43.239> for<00:02:43.570> let's<00:02:43.750> say<00:02:43.870> if

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
this can also work for let's say if

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.080 
this can also work for let's say if
you're<00:02:44.230> shot<00:02:44.980> up<00:02:45.130> on<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.550> ground<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:46.060> can

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
you're shot up on the ground you can

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.060 
you're shot up on the ground you can
disengage<00:02:46.630> before<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:47.350> hit<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.530> ground<00:02:47.860> and

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
disengage before you hit the ground and

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.050 
disengage before you hit the ground and
save<00:02:48.700> yourself<00:02:49.060> fall<00:02:49.420> damage<00:02:50.250> now<00:02:51.250> there's<00:02:51.970> a

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
save yourself fall damage now there's a

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.300 
save yourself fall damage now there's a
lot<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.570> uses<00:02:52.750> for<00:02:53.020> disengage<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:54.010> really

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
lot of uses for disengage and you really

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.820 
lot of uses for disengage and you really
have<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.520> just<00:02:54.970> open<00:02:55.810> your<00:02:55.900> mind<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.440> think

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
have to just open your mind and think

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.910 
have to just open your mind and think
outside<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.430> box<00:02:57.700> into<00:02:58.510> what<00:02:59.140> other<00:02:59.410> uses

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
outside the box into what other uses

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.820 
outside the box into what other uses
disengage<00:03:00.550> has

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
disengage has

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.120 
disengage has
next<00:03:02.340> still<00:03:02.670> no<00:03:02.820> talk<00:03:02.970> about<00:03:03.240> is<00:03:03.390> deterrence

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
next still no talk about is deterrence

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.950 
next still no talk about is deterrence
deterrence<00:03:05.130> is<00:03:05.310> also<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.880> PvP<00:03:06.330> skill<00:03:06.630> which

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
deterrence is also a PvP skill which

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.210 
deterrence is also a PvP skill which
stops<00:03:07.440> all<00:03:07.740> melee<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.520> spell<00:03:08.850> attacks<00:03:09.390> and

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
stops all melee and spell attacks and

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.250 
stops all melee and spell attacks and
say<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.460> saves<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:11.850> so<00:03:12.060> yourself<00:03:12.660> from<00:03:12.840> damage

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
say it saves you so yourself from damage

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.690 
say it saves you so yourself from damage
for<00:03:13.920> five<00:03:14.310> seconds<00:03:14.760> now<00:03:15.300> what<00:03:15.810> other<00:03:16.700> uses

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
for five seconds now what other uses

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.640 
for five seconds now what other uses
this<00:03:18.360> skill<00:03:18.690> has<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:19.200> in<00:03:19.890> PvE<00:03:21.200> let's<00:03:22.200> say<00:03:22.410> a

this skill has is in PvE let's say a

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.600 
this skill has is in PvE let's say a

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
the healers and the DPS what you can do

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.830 
the healers and the DPS what you can do
is<00:03:37.050> use<00:03:37.740> distracting<00:03:38.400> shot<00:03:38.640> it'll<00:03:39.390> grab<00:03:39.600> a

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
grove of that mob for six seconds and

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.080 
grove of that mob for six seconds and
then<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.710> can<00:03:43.860> use<00:03:44.010> deterrence<00:03:44.520> to<00:03:44.670> protect

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
then you can use deterrence to protect

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.140 
then you can use deterrence to protect
yourself<00:03:45.420> for<00:03:45.960> five<00:03:46.140> seconds<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:47.000> what<00:03:48.000> is

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
yourself for five seconds and what is

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.780 
yourself for five seconds and what is
this<00:03:48.630> good<00:03:49.260> for<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.190> can<00:03:50.340> give<00:03:50.580> your

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
this good for is that you can give your

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.930 
this good for is that you can give your
entire<00:03:50.970> team<00:03:51.570> six<00:03:52.500> or<00:03:52.680> five<00:03:52.980> extra<00:03:53.400> seconds<00:03:53.850> to

DPS this boss or this mob and that could

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.690 
DPS this boss or this mob and that could
save<00:03:57.480> your<00:03:58.140> entire<00:03:58.290> party<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.130> it<00:03:59.460> could<00:03:59.610> be

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
the difference between a wipe or not now

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.100 
the difference between a wipe or not now
you<00:04:02.490> might<00:04:02.700> think<00:04:02.730> once<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:03.600> do<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:03.870> you're

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
you might think once you do this you're

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.750 
you might think once you do this you're
sacrificing<00:04:04.380> yourself<00:04:04.800> but<00:04:05.370> you're<00:04:05.550> really

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
sacrificing yourself but you're really

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.979

arrow is one of the mechanics a very
important<00:04:36.450> mechanic<00:04:36.840> I<00:04:36.930> would<00:04:37.080> say<00:04:37.260> of<00:04:37.470> the

important mechanic I would say of the

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.240 
important mechanic I would say of the
hunter<00:04:37.980> now<00:04:38.430> it's<00:04:38.700> less<00:04:38.970> use<00:04:39.800> ever<00:04:40.800> since

wrath of the lich king came out but it's
still<00:04:43.980> very<00:04:44.190> important<00:04:44.669> other<00:04:45.540> than<00:04:45.690> in<00:04:46.050> pvp

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
still very important other than in pvp

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.310 
still very important other than in pvp
uses<00:04:47.010> there<00:04:47.610> is<00:04:47.640> also<00:04:48.169> PvE

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
uses there is also PvE

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.210 
uses there is also PvE
and<00:04:49.560> just<00:04:49.740> raining<00:04:50.390> uses<00:04:51.830> what<00:04:52.830> you<00:04:52.950> could<00:04:53.100> do

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
and just raining uses what you could do

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.060 
and just raining uses what you could do
is<00:04:53.400> say<00:04:53.610> next<00:04:54.180> time<00:04:54.480> a<00:04:54.600> healer<00:04:55.140> pulls<00:04:55.530> a<00:04:55.830> mob

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
is say next time a healer pulls a mob

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
is say next time a healer pulls a mob
and<00:04:56.340> a<00:04:56.970> ad<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.860> it's<00:04:58.860> got<00:04:59.100> aggro<00:04:59.460> what<00:05:00.000> you

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
and a ad and it's got aggro what you

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.460 
and a ad and it's got aggro what you
could<00:05:00.240> do<00:05:00.390> is<00:05:00.660> shoot<00:05:01.350> a<00:05:01.620> freezing<00:05:02.430> arrow<00:05:02.580> and

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
could do is shoot a freezing arrow and

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.740 
could do is shoot a freezing arrow and
the<00:05:04.470> healer<00:05:05.160> could<00:05:05.430> possibly<00:05:05.820> be<00:05:06.210> saved<00:05:06.480> and

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
the healer could possibly be saved and

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.219 
the healer could possibly be saved and
not<00:05:06.870> killed<00:05:07.290> and<00:05:07.530> so<00:05:08.130> the<00:05:08.690> tank<00:05:09.690> can<00:05:09.870> go<00:05:10.169> to

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
not killed and so the tank can go to

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.800 
not killed and so the tank can go to
just<00:05:10.860> pull<00:05:11.310> that<00:05:11.340> mob<00:05:11.940> off<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.330> healer<00:05:12.630> and

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
just pull that mob off the healer and

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.850 
just pull that mob off the healer and

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
also in PvP as well what I usually do is

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.180 
also in PvP as well what I usually do is

where the enemy is going to be and not

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.770 
where the enemy is going to be and not
where<00:05:23.400> it<00:05:23.550> is<00:05:23.580> because<00:05:24.090> it<00:05:24.240> does<00:05:24.390> have<00:05:24.600> an

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
where it is because it does have an

where it is because it does have an
arming<00:05:25.169> timer<00:05:26.660> now<00:05:27.740> one<00:05:28.740> very<00:05:29.070> very<00:05:29.400> important

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000

it's very important for survival and

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.310 
it's very important for survival and
marksman<00:05:35.550> but<00:05:35.729> it's<00:05:36.360> even<00:05:36.539> more<00:05:36.690> important

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
passive so let's say I'm attacking this

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.490 
passive so let's say I'm attacking this
boss<00:06:05.610> but<00:06:06.090> then<00:06:06.240> an<00:06:06.419> ad<00:06:06.600> shows<00:06:06.840> up<00:06:07.050> so<00:06:07.470> I

appears<00:07:40.400> in<00:07:40.640> melee<00:07:41.120> range<00:07:41.150> you<00:07:41.930> you<00:07:42.470> pop<00:07:42.740> out<00:07:42.950> a

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:43.880 
appears in melee range you you pop out a

death and then you can just send your
pet<00:07:49.940> in<00:07:50.090> again<00:07:50.360> and<00:07:50.480> this<00:07:50.660> could<00:07:50.870> also<00:07:51.020> work

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:51.290 
pet in again and this could also work

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.770 
pet in again and this could also work
for<00:07:51.530> let's<00:07:51.770> say

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:53.780 
for let's say

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.479 
for let's say
