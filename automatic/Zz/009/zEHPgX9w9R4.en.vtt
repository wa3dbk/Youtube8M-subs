the personality I mentioned earlier but

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.759 
the personality I mentioned earlier but
it's<00:02:34.209> also<00:02:34.360> kind<00:02:34.690> of<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.840> way<00:02:34.959> David<00:02:35.470> sings

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
it's also kind of the way David sings

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.330 
it's also kind of the way David sings
with<00:02:36.129> this<00:02:36.280> really<00:02:36.459> thin<00:02:37.560> shaky<00:02:38.560> vocal<00:02:39.129> that

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
memorable ride in the world but it's a

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
smooth one the thing is albums that have

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.110 
smooth one the thing is albums that have
kind<00:03:28.150> of<00:03:28.299> this<00:03:28.419> boyish<00:03:29.079> charm<00:03:29.859> aspect<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.940> them

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
kind of this boyish charm aspect to them

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.629 
kind of this boyish charm aspect to them
can<00:03:31.359> wear<00:03:31.569> thin<00:03:31.870> for<00:03:32.200> me<00:03:32.349> a<00:03:32.530> little<00:03:33.099> bit<00:03:33.370> and

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
can wear thin for me a little bit and

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.640 
can wear thin for me a little bit and
there<00:03:34.180> are<00:03:34.299> a<00:03:34.329> few<00:03:34.569> tracks<00:03:34.930> on<00:03:35.230> here<00:03:35.440> where<00:03:35.590> I

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
there are a few tracks on here where I

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.280 
there are a few tracks on here where I
think<00:03:35.739> this<00:03:36.579> album<00:03:37.060> kind<00:03:37.540> of<00:03:37.630> dips<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:38.049> little

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
think this album kind of dips a little

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.039 
think this album kind of dips a little
too<00:03:38.440> far<00:03:38.799> into<00:03:39.160> that<00:03:39.700> trough<00:03:40.120> relying<00:03:40.720> on<00:03:41.019> that

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
too far into that trough relying on that

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.069 
too far into that trough relying on that
to<00:03:41.919> make<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.250> songs<00:03:42.489> interesting<00:03:43.419> for<00:03:43.780> me<00:03:43.810> the

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
to make the songs interesting for me the

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.020 
to make the songs interesting for me the
song<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.319> rock<00:03:44.650> is<00:03:44.980> kind<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.310> like<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.760> and

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
song the rock is kind of like that and

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.780 
song the rock is kind of like that and
the<00:03:46.840> song<00:03:47.109> be<00:03:47.530> a<00:03:47.560> doll<00:03:47.829> and<00:03:47.859> take<00:03:48.250> my<00:03:48.430> heart<00:03:48.669> is

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
the song be a doll and take my heart is

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.640 
the song be a doll and take my heart is
like<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.209> as<00:03:49.359> well<00:03:49.389> but<00:03:49.900> what<00:03:50.230> kind<00:03:50.380> of<00:03:50.500> makes

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
like that as well but what kind of makes

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.490 
like that as well but what kind of makes
that<00:03:50.889> track<00:03:51.310> even<00:03:52.239> worse<00:03:52.450> specifically<00:03:53.230> is

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
that track even worse specifically is

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.830 
that track even worse specifically is
that<00:03:54.010> David<00:03:54.280> as<00:03:54.970> much<00:03:55.209> as<00:03:55.329> I<00:03:55.419> like<00:03:55.629> his<00:03:55.810> voice

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
that David as much as I like his voice

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.229 
that David as much as I like his voice
he<00:03:56.290> pulls<00:03:56.590> out<00:03:56.769> his<00:03:56.980> worst<00:03:57.340> singing<00:03:58.030> on<00:03:58.150> the

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
he pulls out his worst singing on the

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.559 
he pulls out his worst singing on the
entire<00:03:58.599> album<00:03:59.200> on<00:03:59.349> that<00:03:59.980> song<00:04:00.310> he's<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:01.269> off

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
entire album on that song he's so off

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.619 
entire album on that song he's so off
pitch<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.560> maybe<00:04:02.739> just<00:04:03.040> not<00:04:03.280> as<00:04:03.519> a<00:04:03.579> motive<00:04:04.419> as

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
pitch and maybe just not as a motive as

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.300 
pitch and maybe just not as a motive as
i<00:04:04.690> would<00:04:04.900> have<00:04:05.019> liked<00:04:05.319> him<00:04:05.470> to<00:04:05.620> be<00:04:05.799> and<00:04:06.040> it's

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
i would have liked him to be and it's

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.430 
i would have liked him to be and it's
not<00:04:06.489> a<00:04:06.519> hard<00:04:06.849> song<00:04:07.090> not<00:04:07.359> a<00:04:07.389> complicated<00:04:07.870> song<00:04:08.379> I

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
not a hard song not a complicated song I

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.780 
not a hard song not a complicated song I
think<00:04:08.769> it<00:04:08.859> just<00:04:08.889> might<00:04:09.190> have<00:04:09.340> been<00:04:09.459> able<00:04:09.639> to

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
think it just might have been able to

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.849 
think it just might have been able to
get<00:04:09.910> fixed<00:04:10.510> with<00:04:10.720> a<00:04:10.750> second<00:04:11.470> take<00:04:11.650> or

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
get fixed with a second take or

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.289 
get fixed with a second take or
