00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
that we're loading our body and by

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.449 
that we're loading our body and by
loading<00:01:17.149> I<00:01:17.479> mean<00:01:17.689> get<00:01:17.929> down<00:01:17.959> really<00:01:18.740> flex<00:01:19.219> the

00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:19.459 
loading I mean get down really flex the

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:22.539 
loading I mean get down really flex the
legs<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.119> get<00:01:20.389> into<00:01:20.719> a<00:01:20.749> position<00:01:21.219> where<00:01:22.219> once

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
legs and get into a position where once

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.730 
legs and get into a position where once
the<00:01:22.850> ball<00:01:23.090> starts<00:01:23.719> to<00:01:23.810> come<00:01:24.139> up<00:01:24.170> off<00:01:24.529> the

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
the ball starts to come up off the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.330 
the ball starts to come up off the
bounce

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
bounce

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.109 
bounce
we're<00:01:25.850> going<00:01:25.969> to<00:01:26.060> go<00:01:26.179> from<00:01:26.420> loading<00:01:27.049> to

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
we're going to go from loading to

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.929 
we're going to go from loading to
exploding<00:01:29.119> up<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:30.590> hit<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:31.009> shot<00:01:31.249> close<00:01:31.729> to
