00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
easily so I'm kind of worried about that

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.149

you can't see all the middle the cool

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.619 
you can't see all the middle the cool
thing<00:02:33.610> is<00:02:33.849> on<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:35.430> case<00:02:36.430> extends<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.269> front<00:02:37.510> of

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
thing is on the case extends in front of

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.569 
thing is on the case extends in front of
the<00:02:37.690> screen<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:38.709> let's<00:02:38.860> say<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.010> drop<00:02:39.310> it<00:02:39.489> like

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
the screen so let's say you drop it like

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:45.930 
the screen so let's say you drop it like
this<00:02:40.290> nothing<00:02:41.290> happens<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:45.220> only<00:02:45.489> thing<00:02:45.700> that

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
this nothing happens the only thing that

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.670 
this nothing happens the only thing that
could<00:02:46.180> happen<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:46.660> if<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.140> dropped<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.560> on

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
could happen is if you dropped it on

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.530 
could happen is if you dropped it on
like<00:02:47.799> an<00:02:47.950> angle<00:02:48.340> or<00:02:48.430> something<00:02:48.849> been<00:02:49.180> with<00:02:49.360> it

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
like an angle or something been with it

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:57.180 
like an angle or something been with it
but<00:02:50.470> that's<00:02:51.099> a<00:02:51.190> nice<00:02:51.310> feature<00:02:51.629> so<00:02:56.190> this

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
but that's a nice feature so this

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.770 
but that's a nice feature so this
doesn't<00:02:57.430> really<00:02:57.549> get<00:02:57.819> in<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.060> way<00:02:58.209> this

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
doesn't really get in the way this

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.440 
doesn't really get in the way this
coming<00:02:59.410> out<00:02:59.530> um<00:02:59.829> very<00:03:00.609> nice<00:03:02.849> it<00:03:03.849> doesn't<00:03:04.299> add

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
coming out um very nice it doesn't add

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.089 
coming out um very nice it doesn't add
weight<00:03:05.079> but<00:03:05.500> it's<00:03:05.859> kind<00:03:06.129> of<00:03:06.250> bulkier<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.209> guess

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
weight but it's kind of bulkier I guess
