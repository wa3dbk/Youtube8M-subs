 infinitos de nenuco the kitchenette the only 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.910
 I bought it in theaters but also 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.470
 you can buy somewhere else and some 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.600
 kitchen meals in the never 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:17.770
 they are mixed with some that I have 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.710

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.540
 that will not be the kitchen of never 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.570

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.060

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.940
 dessert 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.610
 because it is accompanied with coffee 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.590
 special one that now I will tell you how it goes 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.900
 first we start the ingredients 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.170
 peas that are not in the kitchenette 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:46.600

 It can be if you can put it in the fridge 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.290
 and at the moment I do not need anything else 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:01:01.190
 let's start with a knife 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.190
 and start slicing the carrot 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.340
 good 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.859
 and more or less 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.829
 this also I bought it apart that 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:18.719
 goes with the peas but you can do 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:22.990
 this created vale 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:28.530
 we take a casserole and this also from 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.530
 the kitchen we throw everything inside 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:37.610
 let's put in some water 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.180
 I have put water you can do it with 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.450
 your imagination that has 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.979
 we need a ladle to test 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.380
 the good salt I also have a rag 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.009
 dipper salt and pepper salt and pepper 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.009
 can 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.790
 okay 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.790
 what are we going to try 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.690
 It's pretty good but it lacks a 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.990
 little salt 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.990
 to 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.540
 we throw a little bit and that cooks 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.170
 boil 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.170
 nothing 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.440
 once it has boiled it is time 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.030
 to take it out and the chicken and the peas already 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.030
 they will not be there will only be the soup 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.110
 we set aside this here and 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.590
 we started making the accompaniments 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.600
 we take a plate and something that you have 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.710
 accompaniment I had cookies with 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:54.730
 caviar salted cookies 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:58.510
 and you can go with something else but I 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.420
 at the moment I like it yes it's worth now 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.810
 we prepare the coffee this we leave to 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.810
 a side 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.140
 and let's start with the coffee maker 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.590
 once opened we have to put the 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.240
 capsule that is there and a glass of the only 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:23.020
 that there will be there in sticking a sticker 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.670
 and a 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:29.560
 thing that is put up to protect 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.099
 Lets put 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.099
 ah 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:41.830
 this here is that I have fallen down 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:44.190
 before time and we remove the lid and 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.520
 we put 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.520

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.680
 this 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:03.870
 you can not add you because 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.650
 because this thing when the tapas 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.220

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.040

 without you falling a braid 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:32.190
 and also finally you can put 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.740

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:39.650
