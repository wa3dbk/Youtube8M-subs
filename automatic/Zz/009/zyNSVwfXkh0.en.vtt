a GPU that I'm really really proud of

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.359 
a GPU that I'm really really proud of
when<00:00:15.509> we<00:00:15.630> built<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.080> we<00:00:16.619> wanted<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.920> be<00:00:17.190> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
when we built this we wanted to be the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.029 
when we built this we wanted to be the
world's<00:00:17.789> fastest<00:00:18.539> GPU<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.470> we<00:00:19.560> accomplished

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
world's fastest GPU and we accomplished

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.310 
world's fastest GPU and we accomplished
that<00:00:20.070> but<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.119> also<00:00:21.270> wanted<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> be<00:00:21.869> extremely

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
that but we also wanted to be extremely

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.960 
that but we also wanted to be extremely

up a lot of heat and that's what we've

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.950 
up a lot of heat and that's what we've
built<00:00:32.610> here<00:00:32.730> we<00:00:33.360> invented<00:00:33.750> some<00:00:33.930> new

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
built here we invented some new

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.569 
built here we invented some new
technology<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.770> goes<00:00:34.860> hand<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.280> hand<00:00:35.340> with

technology that goes hand in hand with

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.190 
technology that goes hand in hand with
this<00:00:35.760> graphics<00:00:36.180> card<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> first<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.020> call

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
this graphics card the first one we call

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.040 
this graphics card the first one we call
GPU<00:00:37.649> boost<00:00:37.950> which<00:00:38.460> boosts<00:00:39.030> your<00:00:39.210> clock<00:00:39.719> speed

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
GPU boost which boosts your clock speed

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.049 
GPU boost which boosts your clock speed
when<00:00:40.290> you're<00:00:40.410> playing<00:00:40.590> certain<00:00:40.980> games<00:00:41.190> so

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
when you're playing certain games so

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.119 
when you're playing certain games so
here<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.329> our<00:00:42.420> GPU<00:00:42.809> boost<00:00:43.079> works<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.800> used<00:00:44.010> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
here is our GPU boost works we used to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.740 
here is our GPU boost works we used to
set<00:00:44.370> our<00:00:44.489> clocks<00:00:44.670> based<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.570> power

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
set our clocks based on the power

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.180 
set our clocks based on the power
consumed<00:00:46.230> when<00:00:46.410> you're<00:00:46.559> running<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.890> really

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
consumed when you're running a really

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.889 
consumed when you're running a really
stressful<00:00:47.430> application<00:00:48.239> but<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.690> found

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
stressful application but we found

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.360 
stressful application but we found
there's<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.230> lot<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.440> 3d<00:00:49.800> games<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.340> actually

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
there's a lot of 3d games that actually

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.850 
there's a lot of 3d games that actually
don't<00:00:50.879> consume<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.480> much<00:00:51.539> power<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.260> what<00:00:52.770> do

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
don't consume that much power so what do

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.380 
don't consume that much power so what do
you<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.250> extra<00:00:53.309> power<00:00:53.760> well<00:00:54.239> what

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
you do with that extra power well what

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.779 
you do with that extra power well what
GPU<00:00:54.719> boost<00:00:55.020> does<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.530> lets<00:00:56.010> us<00:00:56.190> convert<00:00:56.610> that

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
GPU boost does it lets us convert that

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.840 
GPU boost does it lets us convert that
power<00:00:57.059> into<00:00:57.960> increased<00:00:58.530> clock<00:00:58.800> speeds<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.730> we

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
power into increased clock speeds and we

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.000 
power into increased clock speeds and we
do<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.120> automatically<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.230> result<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.800> when

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
do it automatically the result is when

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.830 
do it automatically the result is when
you're<00:01:02.129> playing<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.489> game<00:01:02.730> you'll<00:01:03.270> get<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> boost

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
you're playing a game you'll get a boost

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.289 
you're playing a game you'll get a boost
in<00:01:04.110> your<00:01:04.439> GPU<00:01:04.799> clock<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.549> will<00:01:05.729> result<00:01:06.060> in

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
in your GPU clock that will result in

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.210 
in your GPU clock that will result in
increased<00:01:06.840> gaming<00:01:07.200> performance<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:07.890> really

what<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.430> did<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.760> invented<00:01:15.240> technologies

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
what we did is we invented technologies

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.870 
what we did is we invented technologies
on<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.530> AAA<00:01:16.680> side<00:01:17.159> we're<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.670> call<00:01:17.850> it

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
on the AAA side we're going to call it

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.810 
on the AAA side we're going to call it
TX<00:01:18.330> AAA<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.439> really<00:01:19.770> gets<00:01:20.280> rid<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.580> all<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
TX AAA and it really gets rid of all the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.609 
TX AAA and it really gets rid of all the
jaggies<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> game<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.140> doesn't<00:01:22.439> take

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
jaggies in the game but it doesn't take

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.080 
jaggies in the game but it doesn't take
a<00:01:22.650> performance<00:01:23.189> hit<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.820> great

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
a performance hit so you can have great

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.120 
a performance hit so you can have great
image<00:01:24.420> quality<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:25.229> really<00:01:25.500> fast<00:01:25.770> smooth

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
image quality but really fast smooth

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.819 
image quality but really fast smooth
gaming<00:01:26.369> performance<00:01:27.200> we've<00:01:28.200> also<00:01:28.350> made<00:01:28.650> some

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
gaming performance we've also made some

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.980 
gaming performance we've also made some
advancements<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.640> area<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.090> physics<00:01:30.570> so

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
advancements in the area of physics so

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.020 
advancements in the area of physics so
previously<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.650> had<00:01:31.770> our<00:01:31.950> apex<00:01:32.400> destruction

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
previously we had our apex destruction

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.580 
previously we had our apex destruction
module<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.020> wanted<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:34.409> this

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
module and if you wanted to have this

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.710 
module and if you wanted to have this
type<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.860> destruction<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.670> video<00:01:35.909> game<00:01:35.970> what

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
type of destruction in a video game what

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.230 
type of destruction in a video game what
the<00:01:36.750> artist<00:01:37.200> would<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:38.189> pre<00:01:38.579> compute<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.850 
the artist would do was pre compute the
fracture<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.930> then<00:01:40.320> once<00:01:40.530> you're<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
fracture and then once you're in the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.950 
fracture and then once you're in the
video<00:01:41.100> game<00:01:41.159> if<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.030> shot<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.450> pillar<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
video game if you shot the pillar it

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.260

would<00:01:43.079> fracture<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.680> specific<00:01:43.890> way<00:01:44.270> what

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
would fracture in a specific way what

now<00:01:57.930> let's<00:01:58.110> look<00:01:58.230> at<00:01:58.320> what<00:01:58.500> we've<00:01:58.620> done<00:01:58.770> with

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
now let's look at what we've done with

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.160 
now let's look at what we've done with
fur<00:01:59.220> and<00:01:59.520> video<00:01:59.790> games<00:02:00.030> now<00:02:00.420> if<00:02:00.660> you<00:02:00.840> wanted<00:02:01.080> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
fur and video games now if you wanted to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.020 
fur and video games now if you wanted to
build<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.620> beast<00:02:01.860> like<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.340> before<00:02:02.760> you'd

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
build a beast like this before you'd

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.940 
build a beast like this before you'd
have<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> hundred<00:02:03.600> hairs<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.170> interpolated

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
have a hundred hairs and interpolated

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.430 
have a hundred hairs and interpolated
between<00:02:05.100> all<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> hairs<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.150> you<00:02:07.080> guys<00:02:07.229> have

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
between all the hairs and you guys have

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.020 
between all the hairs and you guys have
seen<00:02:07.650> it<00:02:07.800> you've<00:02:07.920> seen<00:02:08.130> lots<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.610> characters

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
seen it you've seen lots of characters

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.669 
seen it you've seen lots of characters
where<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.509> doesn't<00:02:09.810> look<00:02:09.869> realistic<00:02:10.470> or

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
where it just doesn't look realistic or

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.740 
where it just doesn't look realistic or
you<00:02:11.130> see<00:02:11.310> bald<00:02:11.610> characters<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.330> video<00:02:12.540> games

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
you see bald characters and video games

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.449 
you see bald characters and video games
or<00:02:13.050> they<00:02:13.170> have<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.560> know<00:02:13.650> plastic<00:02:13.920> looking

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
or they have you know plastic looking

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.550 
or they have you know plastic looking
hair<00:02:14.670> well<00:02:15.360> here<00:02:15.720> we're<00:02:15.900> stimulating<00:02:16.140> a

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
hair well here we're stimulating a

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.470 
hair well here we're stimulating a
hundred<00:02:16.860> thousand<00:02:17.340> hairs<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:17.760> real<00:02:17.970> time<00:02:18.240> and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
hundred thousand hairs in real time and

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.150 
hundred thousand hairs in real time and
you<00:02:18.990> can<00:02:19.110> see<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.350> just<00:02:19.500> looks<00:02:19.680> super

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
you can see it just looks super

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.130 
you can see it just looks super
realistic<00:02:20.550> we<00:02:21.209> can<00:02:21.360> even<00:02:21.600> do<00:02:21.720> some<00:02:21.930> really

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
realistic we can even do some really

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.810 
realistic we can even do some really
cool<00:02:22.380> effects<00:02:22.800> like<00:02:23.010> these<00:02:23.250> hair<00:02:23.550> dryer

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
cool effects like these hair dryer

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.250 
cool effects like these hair dryer
effects<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.480> we're<00:02:24.630> looking<00:02:24.900> at<00:02:25.020> right<00:02:25.050> now

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
effects that we're looking at right now

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.280 
effects that we're looking at right now
so<00:02:25.980> once<00:02:26.520> again<00:02:26.640> just<00:02:27.030> adding<00:02:27.510> more<00:02:27.720> realism

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
so once again just adding more realism

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.180 
so once again just adding more realism
to<00:02:28.650> video<00:02:28.920> games<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:30.680> then<00:02:31.680> finally<00:02:32.040> we

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
to video games and then finally we

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.220 
to video games and then finally we
wanted<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.489> have<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.610> richer<00:02:33.030> experience<00:02:33.239> so

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
wanted you have a richer experience so

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.320 
wanted you have a richer experience so
things<00:02:34.680> like<00:02:34.830> 3d<00:02:35.190> vision<00:02:35.370> surround<00:02:35.790> off<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.300> a

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
things like 3d vision surround off of a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.540 
things like 3d vision surround off of a
single<00:02:36.810> graphics<00:02:37.200> card<00:02:37.440> or<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.620> single<00:02:37.950> GPU<00:02:38.310> and

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
single graphics card or a single GPU and

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.440 
single graphics card or a single GPU and
even<00:02:39.270> support<00:02:39.660> up<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.870> four<00:02:40.050> displays<00:02:41.450> so

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
even support up to four displays so

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.540 
even support up to four displays so
there<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.630> have<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.200> geforce<00:02:43.620> gtx<00:02:44.070> 680

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
there you have it the geforce gtx 680

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.060 
there you have it the geforce gtx 680
it's<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.060> fastest<00:02:45.630> most<00:02:46.170> efficient<00:02:46.680> GPU

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
it's the fastest most efficient GPU

00:02:47.070 --> 00:03:00.600 
it's the fastest most efficient GPU
we've<00:02:47.310> ever<00:02:47.489> built

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.670
