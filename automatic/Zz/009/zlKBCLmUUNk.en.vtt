00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.240
 start kim sometimes it seems to me that 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:24.539

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.870
 many kingdoms the main characters are 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.820
 boy items magic each by 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.340
 part-time today throws on their 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.020
 the main job is saving the earth from 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.570
 all sorts of posts for me from 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.800
 time helps sea ​​1005 I you 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.660
 I write rock musicians

 and how much boule boules or vice versa 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.619
 project code week king 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.470
 it will start a minute it is not in principle it 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.850
 all as in any self-respecting shone 1 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.710
 the series begins with a zombie attack and how 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.610
 any self-respecting series to watch 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.290
 only the first series 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.360
 understand anything and further plot 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.430
 it’s quite difficult for cartoons 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.330
 you will need from at least 5 input 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.090
 the network is possible again and again 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.700
 I personally was very difficult to stay 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.270
 okay let's classic 5 reasons 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.829
 First of all, this is one of the best stories. 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.400
 postapocalyptic world and believe me 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.520
 me yes yes this is me 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.520
 postapocalyptic world 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.930
 In each series, many people sing 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.130
 repchik or valine dub step or Krol 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.170
 or rock or blog and lyrics 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.650
 bears deep philosophical overtones 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.430
 i'm out of here baby and dance i can addressing 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.780
 diaper oh shake I'm burly and can i 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.210
 to hit everyone 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.790
 everybody give a third reason 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.430
 specific material well that is how 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.440
 specific bearded men i certainly 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.630
 understand and here it does not seem to me 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.640
 there are problems in our yard asleep 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.800
 a huge man from a volcano and he is 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.780
 hot geese get serious seriously 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.390
 I will choose but also all the rest 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.550
 secondary characters their joy then I 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.740
 shower get out because you want handy 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.710
 the fifth reason is that the show is very 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.750
 us good and friendship but not the fact 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.820
 what's possibly near some not 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.170
 specifically in the future I will gather strength and 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.180
 finally ikea fairy tale 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.850
 Fiona by the way is the female version of Finn 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.680
 seriously watch adventure time and 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.110
 remember how to enjoy 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.000
 cartoon just remember that the show 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.239
 pretty specific if not 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.709
 say more are not adequate therefore 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.630
 faint of heart pregnant 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.290
 conservative parent look at all 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.939
 do not save like this and then read 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.030
 since you yourself know what to do 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.799
 after watching this video 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:19.230
 all the first is one of the best 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:20.659
 Voltaire stories 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.810
 this is one of the best in history 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.810
 postapocalyptic world
