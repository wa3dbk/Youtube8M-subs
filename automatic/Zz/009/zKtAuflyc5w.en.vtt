Shane<00:00:26.609> what<00:00:26.880> was<00:00:27.180> your<00:00:27.359> involvement<00:00:27.449> with

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
Shane what was your involvement with

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.509 
Shane what was your involvement with
this<00:00:27.960> project<00:00:28.140> myself<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.099> video<00:00:29.310> team

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
this project myself in the video team

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.099 
this project myself in the video team
we're<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.789> charge<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.119> designing<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.570> rig

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
we're in charge of designing this rig

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.959 
we're in charge of designing this rig
so<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.500> precisely<00:00:32.009> measured<00:00:32.399> each<00:00:32.520> GoPro

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
so we precisely measured each GoPro

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.250 
so we precisely measured each GoPro
dimension<00:00:33.360> because<00:00:33.510> there's<00:00:33.630> not<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> 3d<00:00:34.020> model

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
dimension because there's not a 3d model

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.200 
dimension because there's not a 3d model
of<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.350> Internet<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:35.190> sent<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.730> laser

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
of the Internet we sent it to a laser

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.810 
of the Internet we sent it to a laser

cutting place engineer place they

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.340 
cutting place engineer place they
precisely<00:00:39.270> cut<00:00:39.510> out<00:00:39.600> each<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.930> brackets

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
precisely cut out each of the brackets

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.690 
precisely cut out each of the brackets
we've<00:00:40.559> bent<00:00:40.800> down<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.219> could<00:00:41.370> fit<00:00:41.579> him

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
we've bent down so we could fit him

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.430 
we've bent down so we could fit him
perfectly<00:00:41.879> at<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.300> right<00:00:42.570> angle<00:00:42.989> facing

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
perfectly at the right angle facing

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.520 
perfectly at the right angle facing
Center<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.489> had<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.700> bend<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.210> square<00:00:46.020> tubing

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
Center we had to bend a square tubing

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.160 
Center we had to bend a square tubing
and<00:00:46.969> perfectly<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.090> perfect<00:00:48.870> 8-foot<00:00:49.140> radius

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and perfectly a perfect 8-foot radius

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.350 
and perfectly a perfect 8-foot radius
and<00:00:49.860> then<00:00:49.950> drill<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> holes<00:00:50.640> then<00:00:51.120> placed

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
and then drill the holes then placed

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.580 
and then drill the holes then placed
each<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> brackets<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.199> there<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:52.440> all

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
each of the brackets on there with all

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.549 
each of the brackets on there with all
those<00:00:53.219> cameras<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.449> could<00:00:54.690> use<00:00:54.989> bullet

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
those cameras so we could use bullet

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.979 
those cameras so we could use bullet
time<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.430> see<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.210> stop<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.840> action

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
time to see that stop the action

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.619 
time to see that stop the action
Stephanie<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.739> dead<00:00:58.949> center<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> rig<00:00:59.940> so

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
Stephanie in a dead center of the rig so

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.000 
Stephanie in a dead center of the rig so
this<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.500> largest<00:01:02.149> GoPro<00:01:03.409> array<00:01:04.409> array

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
this is the largest GoPro array array

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.260 
this is the largest GoPro array array
that<00:01:06.000> has<00:01:06.030> ever<00:01:06.450> been<00:01:06.979> conceived<00:01:08.180> to<00:01:09.180> our

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
that has ever been conceived to our

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.450 
that has ever been conceived to our
knowledge<00:01:09.500> so<00:01:10.500> they<00:01:10.619> turn<00:01:10.799> them<00:01:10.950> all<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.100> right

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
knowledge so they turn them all on right

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.380 
knowledge so they turn them all on right
now<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:11.729> need<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.060> manually

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
now they need to do it manually

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.359 
now they need to do it manually
everything<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.110> done<00:01:13.290> manually<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:13.979> we<00:01:14.189> had<00:01:14.340> a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
everything is done manually so we had a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.490 
everything is done manually so we had a
change<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.700> setting<00:01:14.880> earlier<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.229> we<00:01:16.290> had<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
change of setting earlier and we had to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.920 
change of setting earlier and we had to
do<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.740> one<00:01:17.070> by<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.430> by<00:01:18.030> one<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.659> took<00:01:18.810> about

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
do it one by one by one so it took about

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.490 
do it one by one by one so it took about
30<00:01:19.350> minutes<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.799> 45<00:01:20.009> minutes<00:01:21.320> ready<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.380> go

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
30 minutes to 45 minutes ready to go

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.219 
30 minutes to 45 minutes ready to go
yeah<00:01:23.369> okay<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.540> ready<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.720> go<00:01:24.869> which

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
yeah okay so it's ready to go which

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.710 
yeah okay so it's ready to go which
means<00:01:25.259> we're<00:01:26.189> burning<00:01:26.460> fuel<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.509> just

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
means we're burning fuel but it just

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.630 
means we're burning fuel but it just
means<00:01:27.869> okay<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.530> we're<00:01:28.829> gonna<00:01:28.920> try<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.159> puppy

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
means okay so we're gonna try the puppy

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.770 

there's<00:01:51.340> n<00:01:51.460> things<00:01:51.700> in<00:01:51.819> 360s<00:01:52.390> now<00:01:52.539> we're<00:01:52.689> doing

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
there's n things in 360s now we're doing

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.450 
there's n things in 360s now we're doing
like<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.020> straight<00:01:53.319> line<00:01:53.439> array<00:01:53.679> and<00:01:54.280> it's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
like a straight line array and it's

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.300 
like a straight line array and it's
looks<00:01:54.609> really<00:01:54.759> cool<00:01:54.880> visually<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.799> faster<00:01:57.219> it

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
looks really cool visually the faster it

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.800 
looks really cool visually the faster it
moves<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.729> better<00:01:57.939> and<00:01:58.240> then<00:01:58.329> any<00:01:58.539> kind<00:01:58.600> of

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
moves the better and then any kind of

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.910 
moves the better and then any kind of
movement<00:01:59.079> it<00:01:59.289> does<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.770> better

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
movement it does the better

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:26.000 
movement it does the better

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
does that take to actually edit that

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.899 
does that take to actually edit that
down<00:02:49.139> it<00:02:50.139> takes<00:02:50.409> about<00:02:50.739> four<00:02:51.129> hours<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.519> sync

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
down it takes about four hours to sync

all<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.180> video<00:02:52.389> tracks<00:02:52.780> pick<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.200> right<00:02:53.379> spot

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
all the video tracks pick the right spot

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.470 
all the video tracks pick the right spot
put<00:02:54.370> them<00:02:54.459> together<00:02:54.609> make<00:02:55.030> sure<00:02:55.209> they're<00:02:55.389> all

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
put them together make sure they're all

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.059

timed right and then reposition them

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.520 
timed right and then reposition them
because<00:02:57.370> they're<00:02:58.239> not<00:02:58.389> exactly<00:02:58.930> all<00:02:59.049> centered
