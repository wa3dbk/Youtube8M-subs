to<00:04:42.279> my<00:04:42.430> eyes<00:04:42.490> are<00:04:42.819> improve<00:04:43.680> so<00:04:44.680> let's<00:04:45.009> start

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:45.249 
to my eyes are improve so let's start

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:47.129 
to my eyes are improve so let's start
with<00:04:45.460> Kimi<00:04:45.849> as<00:04:45.969> well<00:04:46.150> as<00:04:46.300> you<00:04:46.479> have<00:04:46.629> the<00:04:46.749> record

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.929 
with Kimi as well as you have the record
of<00:04:47.289> winnings<00:04:47.620> of<00:04:48.370> any<00:04:48.629> drivers<00:04:49.629> here<00:04:50.909> give<00:04:51.909> me

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:51.939 
of winnings of any drivers here give me

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:58.350 
of winnings of any drivers here give me
a<00:04:53.310> chance<00:04:54.310> I<00:04:55.860> think<00:04:56.860> I<00:04:57.009> would<00:04:57.219> go<00:04:57.400> back<00:04:57.669> to<00:04:57.729> how

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
a chance I think I would go back to how

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.260 
a chance I think I would go back to how
the<00:04:58.419> last<00:04:58.930> chicane<00:04:59.169> were<00:04:59.650> the<00:05:00.370> coming<00:05:01.090> into

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
the last chicane were the coming into

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.740 
the last chicane were the coming into
the<00:05:01.509> chicane<00:05:01.900> and<00:05:02.169> and<00:05:02.979> I<00:05:03.789> guess<00:05:04.300> it<00:05:04.539> was

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
the chicane and and I guess it was

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.740 
the chicane and and I guess it was
called<00:05:05.050> bus<00:05:06.009> stop<00:05:06.310> on<00:05:06.520> that<00:05:06.699> time<00:05:07.000> and<00:05:07.029> that

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
called bus stop on that time and that

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.899 
called bus stop on that time and that
was<00:05:07.900> more<00:05:08.550> nicer<00:05:09.550> than<00:05:09.939> what<00:05:10.150> it<00:05:10.270> is<00:05:10.389> now<00:05:10.449> why<00:05:11.229> I

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
was more nicer than what it is now why I

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.909 
was more nicer than what it is now why I
thought<00:05:12.909> it<00:05:13.120> was<00:05:13.270> just<00:05:13.569> better<00:05:13.839> it<00:05:14.469> was<00:05:14.620> kind

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
thought it was just better it was kind

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.879 
thought it was just better it was kind
of<00:05:15.509> more<00:05:16.509> like<00:05:16.569> it<00:05:16.839> should<00:05:17.080> now<00:05:17.259> is<00:05:17.469> kind<00:05:17.800> of

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
of more like it should now is kind of

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.059 
of more like it should now is kind of
one<00:05:18.580> part<00:05:18.909> is<00:05:19.120> a<00:05:19.469> bit<00:05:20.469> different<00:05:20.680> than<00:05:21.009> the

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
one part is a bit different than the

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:22.709 
one part is a bit different than the
others<00:05:21.400> you<00:05:21.550> know<00:05:21.669> that<00:05:21.969> the<00:05:22.150> new<00:05:22.300> one<00:05:22.509> it

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
others you know that the new one it

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:24.480 
others you know that the new one it
doesn't<00:05:23.139> feel<00:05:23.349> like<00:05:23.409> it's<00:05:23.770> fitting<00:05:24.159> exactly

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
doesn't feel like it's fitting exactly

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.360 
doesn't feel like it's fitting exactly
there<00:05:24.879> and<00:05:25.089> does<00:05:25.180> not<00:05:25.300> flow<00:05:25.589> yeah<00:05:26.589> I<00:05:26.979> think<00:05:27.099> it

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
there and does not flow yeah I think it

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.249 
there and does not flow yeah I think it
was<00:05:27.430> nice<00:05:27.669> a<00:05:27.699> corner<00:05:28.150> you<00:05:28.300> know<00:05:28.419> so<00:05:28.839> there<00:05:29.139> was

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
was nice a corner you know so there was

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:31.379 
was nice a corner you know so there was
a<00:05:29.289> bit<00:05:29.500> more<00:05:29.680> speed<00:05:29.949> and<00:05:30.250> with<00:05:30.759> all<00:05:30.909> the<00:05:31.120> curves

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
a bit more speed and with all the curves

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.119 
a bit more speed and with all the curves
more<00:05:32.490> I<00:05:33.810> guess<00:05:34.810> know<00:05:35.439> much<00:05:35.649> else<00:05:35.680> has<00:05:36.099> changed

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:36.129 
more I guess know much else has changed
