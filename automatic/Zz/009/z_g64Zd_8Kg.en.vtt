here ready to show you around the Lego
Mindstorms<00:00:08.730> pinball<00:00:09.210> machine<00:00:09.540> now<00:00:10.019> first<00:00:10.320> I'm

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
Mindstorms pinball machine now first I'm

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.259 
Mindstorms pinball machine now first I'm
going<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.679> start<00:00:10.889> with<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.190> design<00:00:11.460> then<00:00:11.969> I'm

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
going to start with the design then I'm

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.470 
going to start with the design then I'm
going<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.509> test<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.320> pinball<00:00:13.769> machine<00:00:13.799> out

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
going to test the pinball machine out

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.830 
going to test the pinball machine out
first<00:00:15.480> start<00:00:15.900> with<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.080> design<00:00:17.000> over<00:00:18.000> here<00:00:18.330> is

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
first start with the design over here is

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.010 
first start with the design over here is
the<00:00:19.170> lego<00:00:19.460> mindstorms<00:00:20.460> NXT<00:00:20.580> brick<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.810> is

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
the lego mindstorms NXT brick this is

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.859 
the lego mindstorms NXT brick this is
mounted<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.590> honor<00:00:23.070> beam<00:00:23.789> which<00:00:24.240> connects<00:00:24.750> to

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
mounted on honor beam which connects to

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.400 
mounted on honor beam which connects to
these<00:00:25.080> rods<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:25.740> hold<00:00:25.949> steady<00:00:26.490> over<00:00:27.320> here<00:00:28.320> is

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
these rods it's hold steady over here is

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.560 
these rods it's hold steady over here is
the<00:00:28.529> color<00:00:28.740> sense<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.460> color<00:00:29.760> sensor<00:00:30.000> detects

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the color sense the color sensor detects

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.380 
the color sense the color sensor detects
whenever<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.679> ball<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:31.980> put<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.399> place<00:00:32.730> when

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
whenever the ball is put in place when

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.990 
whenever the ball is put in place when
it<00:00:33.510> detects<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.989> balls<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.500> place<00:00:35.000> these

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
it detects that the balls in place these

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.030 
it detects that the balls in place these
aren't<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.630> makes<00:00:36.840> these<00:00:37.050> orange<00:00:37.469> teeth<00:00:37.739> spin

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
aren't it makes these orange teeth spin

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.819 
aren't it makes these orange teeth spin
around<00:00:38.450> underneath<00:00:39.450> these<00:00:39.780> rods<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.440> motor

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829

of the motor up up and up and down just

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.179 
of the motor up up and up and down just
like<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> left<00:01:24.200> over<00:01:25.200> here's<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
like the left over here's the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.640 
like the left over here's the
when<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.450> held<00:01:27.689> with<00:01:27.869> an<00:01:27.990> elastic<00:01:28.229> to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
when this is held with an elastic to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.609 
when this is held with an elastic to
keep<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.979> sturdy<00:01:29.540> 120<00:01:30.540> pressed<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.170> shoots<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
keep it sturdy 120 pressed it shoots the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.980 
keep it sturdy 120 pressed it shoots the
ball<00:01:31.799> out<00:01:32.009> just<00:01:32.250> like<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.400> real<00:01:32.640> devotion<00:01:33.030> this

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
ball out just like a real devotion this

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.730 
ball out just like a real devotion this
could<00:01:34.229> hold<00:01:34.409> up<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.650> three<00:01:34.950> bowls<00:01:35.630> on<00:01:36.630> top<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
could hold up to three bowls on top and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.800 
could hold up to three bowls on top and
the<00:01:37.860> screen<00:01:38.220> ones<00:01:38.670> turned<00:01:39.030> when<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.600> turned

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
the screen ones turned when it is turned

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.950 
the screen ones turned when it is turned
on<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.229> displease<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:41.070> your<00:01:41.670> your<00:01:42.299> score<00:01:42.750> and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
on it displease this your your score and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.630 
on it displease this your your score and
a<00:01:43.380> time<00:01:44.000> over<00:01:45.000> here<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.509> basically<00:01:46.579> where<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
a time over here is basically where the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.060 
a time over here is basically where the
it<00:01:48.030> basically<00:01:48.540> touches<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> balls<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.890> you

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
it basically touches the balls for you

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.060 
it basically touches the balls for you
so<00:01:50.549> when<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.820> goes<00:01:50.970> under<00:01:51.350> but<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.439> gets<00:01:52.530> by<00:01:53.040> it

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
so when it goes under but it gets by it

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.219 
so when it goes under but it gets by it
it<00:01:53.520> catches<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.329> doesn't<00:01:54.509> go<00:01:54.720> over<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
it catches it so doesn't go over the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.130 
it catches it so doesn't go over the
place<00:01:56.270> sometimes<00:01:57.270> though<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.600> only<00:01:57.780> problem

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
place sometimes though the only problem

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.740 
place sometimes though the only problem
I've<00:01:58.200> had<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:59.009> sometimes<00:01:59.790> you'll

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
I've had with this is sometimes you'll

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.539 
I've had with this is sometimes you'll
see<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.110> when<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.229> demonstrated<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.040> gets<00:02:02.219> stuck

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
see it when I demonstrated it gets stuck

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.240 
see it when I demonstrated it gets stuck
right<00:02:02.820> here<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:03.600> wear<00:02:03.810> them<00:02:04.049> with<00:02:04.860> where<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
right here like wear them with where the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.760 
right here like wear them with where the
two<00:02:05.460> beams

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
two beams
