00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 personal hello okay I'm the number one thousand 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.750
 and that here the easy music 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.210
 in this video talk about three songs that 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.740
 has an extremely simple hit but 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.740
 also very efficient 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.810
 the bittersweet symphony beating leading 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.150
 caught my attention long before 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.460
 to know the band better is a hit 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.340
 full of a donkey's box but 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.880
 repeats the same way from beginning to end 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.880
 from music 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.039
 your worth 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.440
 I love you 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.070
 i 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.489
 in a free interpretation we can 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.710
 say that the letter talks about how our 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.750
 life within a mold begins our 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.909
 search for money by ascension 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.200
 social leaves would not be up to a bit 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.909
 melancholic right? 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.619
 the battery beat complements 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.380
 meaning it is also within a 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.690
 it repeats itself from beginning to end and 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.460
 Although it is simple, it has a little 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.460
 this melancholy that the letter passes 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.110
 James 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.110
 little grandson 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.369
 jason do curvelo calls attention to 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.320
 several interesting elements 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.399
 first a battery turn that is well 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.399
 striking in music 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.189
 the music also has a good lead 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.500
 interesting without using a box with both 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.429
 timbau hands using the tone and 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.799
 butt 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.810
 the drummer the firewall and also uses 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.269
 enough in the band's songs 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.800
 the tambourine half moon is a great choice for 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.250
 who wants to put a different sound on the 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.250
 kit 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.150
 it's time for soil bacteria folds boxes 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:38.200
 Give more for a simple way 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.200
 leaves the music heavier 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:03:00.969
 and at the end that remarkable turn with the 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:03.849
 quieter music to end the last 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:06.040
 song is bike down by love singer 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.889
 her band has the keyboardist's sound and a 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.769
 drummer fight israel well beat and 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:15.250
 He did not try not to have a plate. 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:26.290
 chimbau deaf bass drum and the little feet 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:28.389
 sufficient proof proves that the 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.919
 drummer is also important in pop 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.049
 electronic right 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:34.329
 the Lord could have chosen to have done the 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.040
 pre- recorded drums on shows 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.060
 her as she does to others 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.159
 instruments 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.389
 only she did not choose to have a 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.669
 drummer live 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:44.680
 most likely because I breathe it 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:51.370
 human being taken to another texture 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:56.129
 for the song on bike down o bÃª bateria 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.129
 pretty chimbau box and butt 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.640
 but the part that I like the most 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.980
 taken when he uses the deaf and the 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.780
 electronic feet it notices that it does 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.239
 is carried in southern Lebanon a little 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.879
 the old jazz drummers after 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.480
 I hit the box and there was a sound of the little foot 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.480
 electronic 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.889
 liked this short video sharing and 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.139

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.419
