00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.260
 insufficient 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.199
 if it was a fiction 

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:11.809
 the magazines and comic books was difficult 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.679
 all this made the president of the bc 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.679
 interview with 35 residences 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:20.429
 analyzing these three months 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.429
 27 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.640
 to qualify 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.520
 carlos caesar 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.520
 the recent scandal 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
 to register 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.700
 homes 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.700
 0 11% 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.510
 lol 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.120
 these icms services 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.070
 on Tuesday 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.480
 besides formula 1 explained that the club has a curriculum 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.880
 you do not have to explain beyond the quota 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.020
 year to date 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.020
 our municipality 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.020
 released on bail 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.150
 representing 20 years in portugal after stumbling away from thinkers' club. 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.830
 I can reveal 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.250
 the yen piano strings 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.640
 with five minutes of culverts and direct commercial galleries with the son 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.450
 by note 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.999
 about 75% 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:49.380
 despite skepticism 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.380
 french 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.460
 marked the second 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.460
 five movements as its previous year's counterpart 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.059
 the state presidents 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:14.059
 on the 14th Sunday before the sport 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.569
 the hypothesis of assisted suicide 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.569
 according to the deputy the shirt of our leader 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.209
 we feel normal 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.269
 sarkozy 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.269
 the team but we can not in the last two days 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.709
 at the time of arrest 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.979
 less than 5% 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:50.979
 by the end of the game 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.429
 I'm really a fantastic environment 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.719
 however in the same year 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.629
 was held for a long period 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.629
 the club itself 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.709
 in the last years 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.709
 it's not just people are very promising 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:23.699
 that moment 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.699
 during the 15 most populous municipalities 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:32.169
 in the last game of the first half the Flemish pressed in the first 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.169
 minutes 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:38.839
 for him the great merit of the port he is unaware of 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:58.149
 197 181 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.629
 we knew that the saints threw under the rubble 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.539
 that was close 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:09.639
 and so the name came to dynamize the problems 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:14.129
 we need 2012 Rio 2016 and life-threatening 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.219
 all this time 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.090
 so the effort in this regard 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.699
 37 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.469
 Who are we to Sao Paulo? 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:33.819
 Jose Mourinho 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.819
 the municipality of pilar 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.930
 the downward trajectory 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.930
 priscilla sun 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.110
 dagoberto and fernandinho 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.990
 all about celebrities 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.990
 to calculate white and null votes 8% 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.039
 with the expansion the brazil champions 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.310
 the banking crisis that the decision means that who cares
