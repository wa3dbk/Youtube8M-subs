this<00:02:13.250> base<00:02:13.730> right<00:02:13.940> here<00:02:14.000> even<00:02:14.780> though<00:02:14.900> I

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
this base right here even though I

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.740 
this base right here even though I
really<00:02:15.380> like<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:16.240> symmetrical<00:02:17.240> type<00:02:17.480> based

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
really like the symmetrical type based

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.630 
really like the symmetrical type based
layouts<00:02:18.110> this<00:02:18.500> one<00:02:18.710> even<00:02:18.920> though<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.250> is<00:02:19.280> not

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
layouts this one even though it is not

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.640 
layouts this one even though it is not
symmetrical<00:02:20.270> has<00:02:20.540> been<00:02:20.840> working<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.410> is

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
symmetrical has been working and is

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.130 
symmetrical has been working and is
pretty<00:02:22.010> much<00:02:22.100> 13<00:02:22.640> defenses<00:02:23.210> in<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.450> row<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:23.900> far

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
pretty much 13 defenses in a row so far

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.020 
pretty much 13 defenses in a row so far
the<00:02:25.130> one<00:02:25.370> thing<00:02:25.490> that<00:02:25.550> i<00:02:25.700> would<00:02:25.790> change

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
the one thing that i would change

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.750 
the one thing that i would change
or<00:02:27.120> keep<00:02:27.720> an<00:02:27.870> eye<00:02:28.020> on<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.440> if<00:02:28.800> your<00:02:29.160> mortars<00:02:29.520> are

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
or keep an eye on is if your mortars are

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.490 
or keep an eye on is if your mortars are
in<00:02:30.030> one<00:02:30.300> compartment<00:02:30.660> it's<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.110> little<00:02:31.380> bit

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
in one compartment it's a little bit

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.220 
in one compartment it's a little bit
risky<00:02:31.980> but<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.610> fact<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.150> do<00:02:33.390> have<00:02:33.690> a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
risky but the fact that you do have a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.020 
risky but the fact that you do have a
bunch<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.770> other<00:02:34.950> defenses<00:02:35.520> in<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.760> core<00:02:36.000> of

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
bunch of other defenses in the core of

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.300 
bunch of other defenses in the core of
the<00:02:36.180> base<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:37.170> bunch<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.620> Defense's

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
the base and a bunch of Defense's

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.250 
the base and a bunch of Defense's
surrounding<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.030> core<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.450> base<00:02:39.630> if<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
surrounding the core of the base if the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.160 
surrounding the core of the base if the
Giants<00:02:40.709> or<00:02:40.830> any<00:02:41.190> type<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.459> other<00:02:42.170> attackers

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
Giants or any type of other attackers

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.410 
Giants or any type of other attackers
make<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.680> into<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.100> core<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.550> base<00:02:44.730> then

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
make it into the core of the base then

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.420 
make it into the core of the base then
the<00:02:46.230> surrounding<00:02:46.709> defenses<00:02:47.250> could

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
the surrounding defenses could

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.090 
the surrounding defenses could
potentially<00:02:48.000> take<00:02:48.209> them<00:02:48.420> down<00:02:48.690> but<00:02:49.350> in<00:02:49.800> terms

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
potentially take them down but in terms

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.309 
potentially take them down but in terms
of<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.640> air<00:02:50.850> super<00:02:51.239> placement<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.810> do<00:02:51.870> like<00:02:52.170> it

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
of the air super placement I do like it

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.500 
of the air super placement I do like it
it's<00:02:52.500> centralized<00:02:53.069> as<00:02:53.280> well<00:02:53.940> as<00:02:54.120> kind<00:02:54.450> of

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
it's centralized as well as kind of

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.210 
it's centralized as well as kind of
protecting<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.110> air<00:02:55.260> defenses<00:02:55.770> you<00:02:55.920> have<00:02:56.069> to

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
protecting the air defenses you have to

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.640 
protecting the air defenses you have to
kind<00:02:56.520> of<00:02:56.550> choose<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.819> side<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.959> this<00:02:58.110> case<00:02:58.350> we

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
kind of choose a side so in this case we

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.070 
kind of choose a side so in this case we
are<00:02:58.680> choosing<00:02:59.100> to<00:02:59.310> protect<00:02:59.930> sort<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:00.989> the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
are choosing to protect sort of the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.110 
are choosing to protect sort of the
bottom<00:03:01.410> side<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.769> base<00:03:01.950> or<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.730> can<00:03:02.880> also

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
bottom side of the base or you can also

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.759 
bottom side of the base or you can also
if<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.690> want<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.050> protect<00:03:04.410> like<00:03:04.620> the

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
if you want to protect like the

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.560 
if you want to protect like the
perceived<00:03:05.250> weak<00:03:05.820> side<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.150> your<00:03:06.239> base<00:03:06.390> I'd

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
perceived weak side of your base I'd

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.270 
perceived weak side of your base I'd
actually<00:03:06.810> maybe<00:03:07.200> try<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> change<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.070> so<00:03:08.250> that

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
actually maybe try to change it so that

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.979 
actually maybe try to change it so that
it's<00:03:08.550> facing<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.940> top<00:03:09.239> left<00:03:09.630> side<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.930> your

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
it's facing the top left side of your

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.449 
it's facing the top left side of your
base<00:03:10.200> because<00:03:10.830> then<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.070> have<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.250> clan

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
base because then you have the clan

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.729 
base because then you have the clan
castle<00:03:11.489> on<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.150> right<00:03:12.690> side<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.410> two<00:03:13.590> air

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
castle on the right side the two air

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.500 
castle on the right side the two air
defenses<00:03:14.250> on<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.519> top<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:14.970> bottom<00:03:15.150> and

defenses on the top and the bottom and

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.300

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.199 
rearranging to get that elixir storage
inside<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.829> then<00:03:47.220> once<00:03:47.459> that's<00:03:47.670> in<00:03:48.000> there

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.500 
have like update footage and that's the
reason<00:04:22.590> why<00:04:22.620> because<00:04:23.070> some<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.610> videos

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510
