so I was kind of harsh harping on the
Pokedex<00:00:14.099> earlier<00:00:14.610> my<00:00:15.179> other<00:00:15.360> video<00:00:15.719> but<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:17.039> be

honest<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.210> kind<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.539> ghetto<00:00:18.779> for<00:00:19.050> me<00:00:19.170> but<00:00:19.470> I

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
honest it is kind of ghetto for me but I

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.950

I<00:00:20.010> do<00:00:20.220> kind<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.090> like<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.539> be<00:00:21.689> honest

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
you can't actually see pretty cool 3d

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.049 
you can't actually see pretty cool 3d
models<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:30.570> actually<00:00:30.720> zoom<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.410> on

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
models that you can actually zoom in on

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
you can see their faces up close then

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.479 
you can see their faces up close then

a little spin or something honey and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.630 
a little spin or something honey and
it's<00:00:49.860> pretty<00:00:50.070> cool<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:51.770> like<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.949> flip<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.460> did

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
it's pretty cool I like a flip and I did

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.049 
it's pretty cool I like a flip and I did
a<00:00:53.670> flip<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.430> definitely<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.879> all

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
a flip and you can definitely get all

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.330 
a flip and you can definitely get all
their<00:00:57.239> stats<00:00:57.660> pretty<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:59.280> pretty

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
their stats pretty it's pretty

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.580 
their stats pretty it's pretty
interesting<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.870> don't<00:01:01.289> really<00:01:01.440> like

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
interesting I just I don't really like

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.709 
interesting I just I don't really like
it<00:01:01.739> because<00:01:01.949> there's<00:01:02.129> only<00:01:02.250> 50<00:01:02.760> Pokemon<00:01:03.359> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
it because there's only 50 Pokemon and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.070 
it because there's only 50 Pokemon and
none<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.500> these<00:01:04.589> Pokemon<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> really<00:01:05.670> know<00:01:06.080> from

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
none of these Pokemon I really know from

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.160 
none of these Pokemon I really know from
any<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.590> games<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.570> I<00:01:09.570> think<00:01:09.900> I've<00:01:09.990> been

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
any of the games and I think I've been

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.289 
any of the games and I think I've been
better<00:01:10.350> at<00:01:10.650> all<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.070> pokemon<00:01:11.549> that'd<00:01:11.820> be<00:01:12.000> epic

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
better at all the pokemon that'd be epic

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.000 
better at all the pokemon that'd be epic
and<00:01:12.960> then<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.080> could<00:01:13.229> actually<00:01:13.320> learn<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> few

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and then I could actually learn a few

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.789 
and then I could actually learn a few
things<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.869> said<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.170> still<00:01:16.560> think

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
things but like I said I still think

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.670 
things but like I said I still think
it's<00:01:16.920> pretty<00:01:17.189> cool<00:01:17.659> you<00:01:18.659> know<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.049> free<00:01:19.439> I

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
it's pretty cool you know it's free I

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.640 
it's pretty cool you know it's free I
can't<00:01:20.340> harp<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.240> free<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.930> can't<00:01:22.140> stress

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
can't harp on free and I can't stress

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.749 
can't harp on free and I can't stress
that<00:01:22.680> enough<00:01:24.380> like<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.619> looks<00:01:25.860> pretty<00:01:26.189> cool<00:01:26.430> I

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
that enough like so looks pretty cool I

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.910 
that enough like so looks pretty cool I
don't<00:01:27.330> think<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.540> 3d<00:01:27.869> effect<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.439> great

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
don't think the 3d effect is that great

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.920 
don't think the 3d effect is that great
it<00:01:29.159> doesn't<00:01:29.430> look<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.549> great<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.970> 3d<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.600> I

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
it doesn't look that great in 3d but I

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.810 
it doesn't look that great in 3d but I
mean<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:31.680> looking<00:01:32.040> at<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.579> is

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
mean just looking at it like this is

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.300 
mean just looking at it like this is
pretty<00:01:33.090> cool<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.720> mean<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.439> shows<00:01:34.650> really<00:01:34.950> close

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
pretty cool I mean it shows really close

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.390 
pretty cool I mean it shows really close
design<00:01:35.960> they<00:01:36.960> do<00:01:37.020> little<00:01:37.259> animations<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
design they do little animations and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.780 
design they do little animations and
it's<00:01:38.700> nice<00:01:38.970> when<00:01:40.130> they<00:01:41.130> apparently<00:01:41.400> makes

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
it's nice when they apparently makes

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.160 
it's nice when they apparently makes
sound<00:01:42.150> dude<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.750> guy<00:01:42.930> has<00:01:44.119> as<00:01:45.119> like<00:01:45.360> heads<00:01:45.810> on

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
sound dude this guy has as like heads on

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:55.910 
sound dude this guy has as like heads on
his<00:01:46.350> hands<00:01:50.780> word<00:01:51.799> okay<00:01:54.320> so<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.470> think<00:01:55.799> it's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
his hands word okay so I do think it's

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.399 
his hands word okay so I do think it's
cool<00:01:56.250> they<00:01:56.490> make<00:01:56.670> all<00:01:56.820> their<00:01:57.000> sounds<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.110> mean

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
cool they make all their sounds I mean

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.530 
cool they make all their sounds I mean
this<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.680> pretty<00:01:58.950> cool<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.610> still<00:02:00.360> don't<00:02:00.509> think

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
this is pretty cool I still don't think

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.370 
this is pretty cool I still don't think
it's<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.840> game<00:02:01.399> but<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.820> pretty<00:02:03.540> cool<00:02:03.899> sorts

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
it's a game but it's pretty cool sorts

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.109 
it's a game but it's pretty cool sorts
of<00:02:04.500> information<00:02:04.770> if<00:02:05.280> you're<00:02:05.369> into<00:02:05.640> Pokemon

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
of information if you're into Pokemon

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.820 
of information if you're into Pokemon
that<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.390> don't<00:02:06.570> know<00:02:06.719> about

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
that you don't know about

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.950 
that you don't know about
probably<00:02:08.580> why<00:02:08.700> they<00:02:08.880> are<00:02:09.030> showing<00:02:09.060> these<00:02:09.630> that

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
probably why they are showing these that

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.990 
probably why they are showing these that
you<00:02:10.110> never<00:02:10.259> well<00:02:10.860> I've<00:02:11.040> never<00:02:11.400> seen<00:02:11.730> because

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
you never well I've never seen because

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000 
you never well I've never seen because
