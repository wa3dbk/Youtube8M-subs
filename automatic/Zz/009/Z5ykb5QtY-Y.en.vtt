00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740
 man i think this fuck said something 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.740
 for me you have computer science oh yes 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.490
 Hello and welcome last 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.020
 game dev my name is tom and me 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.960
 Welcome to the fourth and last 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.869
 sequence of the video series koalitions query 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.369
 two of the room nothing reflexes mÃ¼ller in 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.870
 We have the last two consequences 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.420
 busy with how we find out 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.370
 whether two circles or two rectangles 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.480
 we want to collide with each other today 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.910
 to deal with it as we do 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.100
 Find out if a circle and a 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.970
 rectangle collide with each other 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.530
 so overlap 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.300
 this is a bit more difficult 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.830
 as with the other two variants 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.220
 because here we are two completely different 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.210
 have geometric basic shapes 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.960
 unfortunately, it comes pretty much 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.220
 often like breakout 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.659
 just like with the last painting I want 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.570
 show you this little graphic 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.760
 The red area is the area in the 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.490
 the circle must be around 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.380
 somehow overlap with the rectangle 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.979
 You're welcome to try that out ! 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.020
 remember yes it is as unbelievable as 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.170
 but now comes to find out 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.329
 whether the circle is within this red 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.890
 area is to think do a bit 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.929
 and half a bottle of vodka becomes one 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.049
 find out that one of the 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:29.299
 following three send must agree 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.969
 to ensure a collision rate 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.109
 One of the center of the circle is located 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:38.450
 within the rectangle juice 2 one of the 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:43.189
 corner of the rectangle is located 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:48.409
 within the circle and set 3 of the 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:51.380
 circle slightly overlaps one side of the 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.990
 Rectangles without the other two 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.240
 and we must all 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.639
 Review these three eventualities 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.109
 to make a collision impeccable 

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.240
 recognize the first sentence is the 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:03.649
 the easiest way how can we get out if that 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.020
 circle center within the 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.759
 Rectangles is pretty easy 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.910
 we just have to check 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.440
 the circle lies in the middle point below 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.570
 the upper line of the legal 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.610
 kiss and above the lower one 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.320
 rectangles at the same time pattern circle 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.600
 Center of construction left of the 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.980
 right side of the right side and 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.490
 right from the left side of the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.500
 Rectangles because then he has to be within 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.030
 of the rectangle and we have up 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.270
 every case a coalition 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.700
 Set two is one of the cornerstones of the 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.800
 Rectangles is inside the circle 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.320
 if you looked at the second episode 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.330
 then you should have blood again immediately 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.190
 You almost do not cry that day 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.820
 he just looks again the second 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.960
 follow 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.930
 and imagine the corner point 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.760
 circle with radius 0 will be if 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.550
 the distance between these two 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.010
 thus score the corner point and the circle 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.370
 Center is less than the radius 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.560
 of the circle then the corner point 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.240
 be within the circle and these 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.400
 We have to query for each of the four 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.040
 make corners for each so we have now 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.530
 implemented two sentences and now comes 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.910
 the question on when the circle 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.100
 not within the 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.430
 Rectangles is not a corner of the 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.750
 Rectangles within the circle can 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.620
 then even a coalition 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.530
 occur 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.040
 that is a misconception of me completely 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.320
 often in the brain itself, no 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.930
 there are exactly the following 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.640
 situation here we see for circles or 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.800
 rectangles and we see clearly 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.290
 the circles overlap with the rectangle 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.660
 if you now set one of our 2 exactly 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.820
 You will notice both 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.440
 Worry horror cinema coalition but we 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.780
 see there is one so still has to 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.950
 give any sentence 3 I show this 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.430
 pizza so I put a cut 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.930
 can 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.590
 if we look closely we see yes 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.610
 that the radius of the circle is inside 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.670
 the rectangle is so the distance must be 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.610
 from the circle to the top of the rectangle 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.459
 be smaller than the radius of the circle 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.940
 itself and that is about fulfilled 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:13.100
 this pixel to now is natural 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.510
 much more than we really need 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.150
 would get wrong results so 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.269
 we have to do it all a bit more 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.940
 constrict 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.880
 not only does the radius have to be bigger 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.730
 be as the distance between k 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.380
 center point and upper square edge 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.470
 but also the center of the circle must 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.760
 between the two psion values 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.710
 the lateral walls of the rectangle 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.610
 not between the walls between those 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.010
 and then we have just that 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.930
 Result is the smoking and this 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.150
 We have to ask for each page of the query 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.950
 implement rectangles with these three 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.510
 We have to set a lot 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.570
 implement query 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.890
 but once a query says yes find 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.300
 the collision takes place and we can do that 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.430
 cancel rest 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.670
 This is very convenient as well 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.110
 I'll give you this collision query 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.550
 independently to implement because 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.110
 this one finally learns best 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.510
 I did that with me too 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.950
 it looks like this is about 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.920
 quite confusing and totally the 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.270
 pigs code which is indeed a small 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.950
 programmer technical orgasm but 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.290
 Google on it in two years at the latest 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.550
 and me something like that 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.470
 You can not read so always nice 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.630
 comment on the code and then it is 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.000
 okay but cool is somehow anyway 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.260
 Comment on my post write me 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.610
 please in the comments with which 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.390
 topics I will deal with in the future 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.030
 should 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.900
 So what you like about the 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.790
 programming or special games 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.380
 want to know programming and if I want 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.700
 a bit of superstition or not 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.630
 I'll have a read then 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.220
 deal with it 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.810
 if you liked this video and 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.250
 I brought over as understandable 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.940
 give me a positive one too 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.800
 rating 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.360
 you can see more of me on one 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.010
 Channel down here you can 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.420
 Start the video series from the beginning and still 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.310
 times to refresh the basics 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.030
 and I wish you a nice one 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.030
 day cover
