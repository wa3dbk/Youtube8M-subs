00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
okay I got faster motorcycle I've done

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.540 
okay I got faster motorcycle I've done
this<00:00:19.020> before<00:00:19.199> but<00:00:19.380> yeah<00:00:19.980> might've<00:00:20.430> been<00:00:20.490> just

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
this before but yeah might've been just

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.630 
this before but yeah might've been just
a<00:00:20.730> random<00:00:21.060> glitch<00:00:21.390> but<00:00:22.070> the<00:00:23.070> way<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.310> happened

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
a random glitch but the way it happened

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.130 
a random glitch but the way it happened
to<00:00:23.730> think<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.510> looks<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:24.990> could<00:00:25.109> be

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
to think it looks like it could be

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.000 
to think it looks like it could be
replicated<00:00:27.320> that's<00:00:28.320> how<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.439> remember<00:00:28.800> which

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
replicated that's how I remember which

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.710 
replicated that's how I remember which
motorcycle<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.609> had<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> got<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> faster<00:00:30.420> one<00:00:30.570> now

but we'll try it

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.410 
but we'll try it
pistol<00:00:38.640> wheelie<00:00:38.960> yep<00:00:39.960> there<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.320> go<00:00:41.420> he's

wheelie and you can land up here if we

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.580 
wheelie and you can land up here if we

belong overpass so as you can see you're

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.720 
belong overpass so as you can see you're
not<00:00:52.710> definitely<00:00:53.160> not<00:00:53.219> supposed<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:53.699> up

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
not definitely not supposed to be up

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.410 
not definitely not supposed to be up
here<00:00:57.859> because<00:00:58.910> there's<00:00:59.910> where<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.300> can

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
container down there and so there's no

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.280 
container down there and so there's no
way<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.820> get<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.030> here<00:01:06.240> normally<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:09.600> uh
