 the original game are second and so much 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.569
 It serves to lengthen the history of 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.119
 those that we are left wanting to 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.590
 more as well as first contact for 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.829
 those that were not made with adventure 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.090
 from the sincro something incomprehensible already 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.579
 which is one of the best games 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.689
 exclusives of the new generation of 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.670
 sony 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.860
 this proposal is divided into two parts 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.950
 the adventure as such with missions 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.869
 main and challenges and the arenas a 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.939
 bounded area with many challenges where to go 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.630
 overcoming different hordes of enemies and 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.530
 share our results online 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.060
 regarding the first game option 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.179
 this dlc tells us the facts 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.530
 previous lived by crowe the game 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.750
 starts in the prison of kudrow key 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.090
 where they will be telling playable facts 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.799
 like flash marx learning 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.440
 our new actions in the area of 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.600
 zone training that serves as sand in 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.609
 the other game mode your memories 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.140
 start showing us what date has 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.570
 been hiding his powers during 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.000
 long time living with his brother 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.489
 messing around and doing little work 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.660
 in Russians to survive both of them 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.250
 hard penalties 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.920
 but in what seems the last job 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.990
 of his brother something goes wrong and date is 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.540
 is forced to use those powers again 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.220
 so that both can escape is to 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.560
 from that moment when the 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.980
 alarms in the city a driver not 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.140
 controlled not captured the bp has already 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.480
 detected and will not hesitate to go for 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.010
 us away from escaping soon 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.750
 we will begin to remember how they were 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.040
 our powers at the same time as 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.260
 we fulfill our first missions 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.510
 main indicators indicated by the different 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.330
 characters that influence in a way or 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.040
 another in our destiny the development 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.570
 we are placed alternatively in the 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.580
 different neighborhoods of Seattle and the 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.560
 prison of the cav and gael aims 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.750
 escape as far as dominate totally 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.850
 his powers we also have a part 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.940
 final in a snowy area on the outskirts 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.580
 of the city in this DLT there is no option 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.950
 to be hero or infamous the adventure is 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.960
 unidirectional and we move towards 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.630
 marked and defined facts that outline 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.790
 to the female we see in se con sol de 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.890
 shy withdrawn and hidden 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.780
 exhibitionist of his hunting powers 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.470
 of distributors of drugs and antich 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.510
 eupv as we saw with this transformation 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.670
 is what we see in the game for the 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.740
 author the story could have been 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.380
 better since it 's quite predictable 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.420
 from the beginning still the interest is 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.610
 focuses more on seeing the indicated evolution 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.180
 of this character that does not follow a 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.040
 script somewhat loose compared to the original 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.320
 playability confech is identical to the one 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.300
 We were offered with dell without charge using 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.040
 the same button arrangement the 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.500
 most notable difference is that date 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.420
 only controls the power of neon only one 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.850
 of the four that we were allowed in the 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.310
 original game enhance our 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.870
 actions and unlock new ones 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.530
 do it by spending skill points 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.910
 or esp required for each unlock 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.590
 these are achieved complete different 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.350
 challenges fulfilling missions or collecting 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.100
 certain amount of spheres in theories 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.670
 arranged by all are made 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.230
 normally in high forums to be able 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.700
 get us more skill points and 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.280
 well unlock new movements or 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.440
 improvements there are side missions or challenges 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.240
 these are performing graffiti with neon 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.430
 careers in which we must go through 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.430
 the various ethereal portals and save 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.590
 civilians 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.020
 are proposals that lengthen the 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.870
 game in addition to giving us more points 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.430
 s &amp; p we can fulfill them between missions or 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.320
 leave them for when we have finished the 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.110
 story as we saw also in the game 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.880
 original of ps 4 as crowe also 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.130
 We have a special action that 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.380
 we execute using the crosshead the 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.120
 singularity and its evolution the supernova 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.740
 besides being the most actions 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.300
 demolishing all are those that 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.160
 they are more spectacular for the 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.100
 seen with thousands of light particles 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.170
 the rhythm of the game moving on the screen 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.720
 it's something faster with very attacks 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.700
 colorful fluids auctions and speeds 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.190
 of vertigo that are achieved if we pass 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.600
 repeatedly by the neon arcs the 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.030
 missions range from eliminating threats 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.830
 from the area destroy enemy vehicles 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.330
 protect moving vehicles uploaded 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.180
 to them to present us which 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.300
 sniper etc there is a good variety 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.680
 inspired by what we saw months ago 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.300
 rest of the functions of the command the 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.890
 touch panel allows us to absorb and 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.260
 recharge the neon in the zones 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.970
 relevant to graphite you have to go 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.220
 moving the command so that we paint the 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.740
 different drawings pressing in addition r2 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.000
 the loudspeaker heard the missions 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.310
 they entrust us and he 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.590
 of the control takes a violet tone as the 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.090
 powers of french and the worship of 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.100
 story without counting any of the 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.010
 secondary missions round the four 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.620
 hours at the end is missing 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.840
 something more than a composer a lot 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.540
 more forceful would have closed better 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.820
 this chapter still the final facts 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.550
 they link perfectly with the moment in the 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.370
 that starts second are and that detail 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.620
 hey well look like the other way of 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.690
 game the arenas are divided into alpha beta 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.520
 and gamma each of them offers 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.680
 different challenges as well as enemies 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.200
 holographic to eliminate including 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.320
 armed bodies demons angels drones 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.870
 spiders crazy our score 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.560
 will be shared online what motivates 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.030
 world spikes 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.340
 during the course of the adventure 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.320
 we will unlock half of these 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.450
 arenas but when completing the game it 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.590
 unlocks the other half plus also if 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.650
 we have the original game 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.419
 we can also play with the without 15 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.860
 euros for about five hours of play more 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:50.900
 challenges that go up to three or four 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.180
 more hours and the sands that add up 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.790
 as many hours according to the interest that 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.250
 we have to overcome score is a 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.870
 good offer in this dlc that gives more life 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.669
 to a game that we do not get tired of 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.669
 recommend from session
