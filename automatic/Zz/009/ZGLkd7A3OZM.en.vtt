00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
this glitch you will need a turbine and

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.099 
this glitch you will need a turbine and
you<00:00:23.189> will<00:00:23.310> need<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.519> riot<00:00:23.760> shield<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.359> you'll

you will need a riot shield and you'll

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.050 
you will need a riot shield and you'll
need<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.410> go<00:00:25.529> either<00:00:26.039> at<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.580> corner<00:00:26.820> where<00:00:27.029> I

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
need to go either at this corner where I

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.769 
need to go either at this corner where I
am<00:00:27.269> right<00:00:27.330> now<00:00:27.689> or<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.619> opposite<00:00:29.460> corner

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
am right now or in the opposite corner

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.089 
am right now or in the opposite corner
and<00:00:30.779> what<00:00:31.080> you'll<00:00:31.230> need<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.410> do<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.800> put<00:00:32.070> down

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
and what you'll need to do is put down

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.610 
and what you'll need to do is put down
the<00:00:32.399> turbine<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.059> then<00:00:33.719> get<00:00:33.870> your<00:00:33.899> ID<00:00:34.290> shield

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
the turbine and then get your ID shield

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.110 
the turbine and then get your ID shield
out<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.309> kind<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.610> pushes<00:00:35.880> you

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
out so that it kind of pushes you

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.360 
out so that it kind of pushes you
backwards<00:00:36.600> now<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.680> glitch<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:37.920> very

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
backwards now this glitch is very

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.049 
backwards now this glitch is very
difficult<00:00:38.670> but<00:00:39.570> however<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.590> get<00:00:40.800> lucky

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
difficult but however you can get lucky

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.729 
difficult but however you can get lucky
so<00:00:42.059> once<00:00:42.239> you're<00:00:42.540> down<00:00:42.660> here<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> barrier

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
so once you're down here it is a barrier

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.600 
so once you're down here it is a barrier
glitch<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.340> zombies<00:00:45.270> cannot<00:00:45.570> get<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.399> if<00:00:47.399> you

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
glitch and zombies cannot get you if you

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.430 
glitch and zombies cannot get you if you
do<00:00:47.760> get<00:00:48.000> managed<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.510> get<00:00:48.629> down<00:00:48.809> here<00:00:49.110> there<00:00:49.320> is

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
do get managed to get down here there is

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.069 
do get managed to get down here there is
def<00:00:49.710> barriers<00:00:50.190> under<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> zombie<00:00:51.449> spawn<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
def barriers under the zombie spawn and

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.319 
def barriers under the zombie spawn and
if<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.440> go<00:00:52.559> too<00:00:52.620> far<00:00:52.980> out<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:53.969> wouldn't

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
if you go too far out so I wouldn't

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.729 
if you go too far out so I wouldn't
recommend<00:00:54.570> doing<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.960> as<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.469> glitch<00:00:55.710> is

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
recommend doing that as this glitch is

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.979 
recommend doing that as this glitch is
very<00:00:56.100> difficult<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:57.690> want<00:00:57.899> to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
