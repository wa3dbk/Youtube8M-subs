than<00:04:05.510> I<00:04:05.739> but<00:04:06.739> still<00:04:07.129> Sigma<00:04:07.580> is<00:04:07.640> a<00:04:07.730> dick<00:04:08.060> though

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
than I but still Sigma is a dick though

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.199 
than I but still Sigma is a dick though
some<00:04:09.650> of<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:09.860> times<00:04:10.160> like<00:04:10.489> I<00:04:10.670> went<00:04:10.970> all<00:04:11.120> the

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
some of the times like I went all the

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.350 
some of the times like I went all the
way<00:04:11.269> to<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:11.630> top<00:04:11.870> wall<00:04:12.590> he<00:04:13.430> still<00:04:13.760> dragged<00:04:14.120> me

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
way to the top wall he still dragged me

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.289 
way to the top wall he still dragged me
like<00:04:14.810> all<00:04:15.019> the<00:04:15.080> way<00:04:15.319> to<00:04:15.380> his<00:04:15.620> mouth<00:04:15.970> somehow<00:04:16.970> I

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
like all the way to his mouth somehow I

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.780 
like all the way to his mouth somehow I
guess<00:04:17.959> because<00:04:18.169> I<00:04:18.290> didn't<00:04:18.560> have<00:04:18.680> ground<00:04:19.459> or

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
guess because I didn't have ground or

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.879 
guess because I didn't have ground or
wall<00:04:20.329> I<00:04:20.690> guess<00:04:20.959> I<00:04:21.079> think<00:04:21.229> it's<00:04:21.320> because<00:04:21.440> mostly

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
wall I guess I think it's because mostly

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.500 
wall I guess I think it's because mostly
because<00:04:22.040> I<00:04:22.190> didn't<00:04:22.340> have<00:04:22.430> ground<00:04:22.820> just<00:04:23.270> to

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
because I didn't have ground just to

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.260 
because I didn't have ground just to
slide<00:04:23.990> away<00:04:24.139> it<00:04:25.100> just<00:04:25.130> dragged<00:04:25.760> me<00:04:25.910> right<00:04:26.060> to

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
slide away it just dragged me right to

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.780 
slide away it just dragged me right to
his<00:04:26.389> mouth<00:04:26.660> it's<00:04:26.960> like<00:04:27.110> no<00:04:27.460> that's<00:04:28.460> not<00:04:28.700> gonna
