 I had a lot of presents this month 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.730

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.470

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.680

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.370

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.100
 Russian Museum 110 years old vernissage portrait 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.140
 Chaliapin was very nice to receive 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.180
 just here are some such little things signs 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.370
 attention to insane it's all nice 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.120
 a long time ago I had heard a lot 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.680
 stickers 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.899
 on nails instead of varnish but here more 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.270
 summer drawing so i think i use 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.180
 in the summer this thing is not even 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.210
 opened citrus twist is called from 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.900
 tea grace and also from tea to grace 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.060
 crazy beautiful shade in this varnish 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.070
 very many-sided you asked me already 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.680
 repeatedly when he had my man ok 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.860
 so this is such a beautiful lacquer he and 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.590
 red he and pink he and burgundy 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.680
 he is with a golden sheen that is generally 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.040
 very beautiful varnish is really very 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.090
 New Year's even color is called rather 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.130
 shade 80 1359 on generally write all 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.770
 names as usual in infobox 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.470
 I strongly advise you to take a closer look 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.009
 in love with this color but unfortunately 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.619
 tea guest even with a famous base 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.220
 I donâ€™t keep my view from the USA 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.590
 nails 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.509
 but there colors are just unreal 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.780
 which is my collection of color 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.000
 desperate eyes are not really here 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.430
 unusual they are now attracting 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.290
 attention and constantly when the basics of lacquer 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.350
 desperate english my friends here 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.270
 it is these varnishes that draw attention to 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.579
 perseverance as i said not very well 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.039
 I have a maximum of two days even with 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.200
 any and base if we were top 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.200
 coating. here, too, in principle, myself 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.980
 ordinary but generally how color can i get you 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.050
 give advice 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.060
 and two nail polish products 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.879
 which I learned only because of this 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.150
 I haven't heard a gift before 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:27.900
 called a file a snow monkey from with 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.400
 claw and also to the world's best this is set 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.530
 for polishing nails 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.500
 file on both sides of this set 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.660
 helped me deal with the problem of foliation 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.970
 and brittle nails so I will definitely 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.099
 I dedicate to him a separate video, he told me 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.470
 like crazy i can't imagine what 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.680
 I will do without it when the end 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.810
 these two stress are showing here 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.819
 a bottle so well, in general, everything else 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.440
 let me tell you in a separate video 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.290
 because it is worth attention next 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.209
 the gift was in such a package and honestly to you 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.190
 I will say that here is the last time me very 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.230
 difficult to surprise some makeup 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.709
 because already a lot of things tested 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.420
 but from this gift I just jumped 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.920
 to the ceiling so much to me 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.230
 liked it from and to 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.870
 because you can see that the gift was chosen 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.590
 that's just under me here all 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.030
 shades that I love here too 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.159
 makeup mainly 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.980
 Well, in general, I'll show you now without 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:27.209
 weaving Laura Mercier I long ago 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.420
 I was looking for my golden hue and this one 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.819
 the shade is called golden platinum then 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.030
 have it come with exactly platinum so 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.159
 podton super shadows right now they have 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.220
 my eyes but of course with this 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:44.069
 artificial evening light they 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.129
 super nice store like i said i 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.299
 fell in love with this shade of golden and 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.659
 for me that's it 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.730
 perfect golden shade for you now 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.280
 I'll try to make my own if I see 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.530
 this here is a shimmer basically ie this is not 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.319
 matte some kind of shadow but she is so 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.110
 beautifully plays on the eyes of this shade i 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.360
 I can only describe the perfect 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.700
 golden hue for brunettes 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.610
 This product I already tried is familiar with 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:17.820
 him and of course glad to receive and again 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:20.820
 This is a floor tire primer from urban decay base 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.340
 i'm 11 just a gram here in it but 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.770
 I have enough of it for a long time even 3 grams 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.550
 enough for a year to be honest though well if 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.650
 certainly not with daily use 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.530
 Super base perfectly holds any shadows 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.360
 except mineral I do not know the mineral order 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.250
 it does not hold on to it at all 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.320
 another story about the mineral already 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.240
 probably cosmetics here were also 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.000
 lovely earrings that i'm with 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.660
 I will wear with pleasure and in the summer they 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.210
 bright that coral pink shades 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.770
 super from file twenty one about it 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.760
 product too long ago 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.590
 heard 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.630
 I have 380 b shadows Wheaton Wilde cool 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.640
 quality I know that this is a mass market but 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.130
 despite the fact that it is like 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.200
 mass market shade of color is completely not 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.720
 will say that they somehow look cheap on 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.220
 all eyes absolutely contain in themselves 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.460
 satin finish 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.190
 shades cool shades here even pink 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.280
 I liked this one too 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.570
 his eyes look amazing super in 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.090
 Generally, I can advise you 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.070
 just these everyday shades are a pity 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.210
 that instead of this shade here is not 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:32.430
 used some frosted as well 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.920
 class the same quality awesome on 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.200
 previous base in a tu fais base 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.600
 keeps avro palette niki basic siam 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.750
 Already told in a separate video this 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.630
 Anyone forever I love her so much 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.110
 my masthead from the day I received 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.510
 this palette of super shadow holds on beautifully 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.320
 beautiful colors without red without 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:58.920
 brick patton love all the tips 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:03.030
 then it was lipstick from lime krim me 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:05.730
 called coquette shade now you 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:09.450
 I'll show you too, that's exactly my 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.190
 shade look not y giving charm 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.710
 such 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.850
 super like we want on of course 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.580
 wonderful but unfortunately lipstick 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.640
 rolls in a white strip on the lips and 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:24.190
 I did not like it here pleasant 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.930
 milk chocolate flavors in principle on 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.020
 lips are well-groomed as always such lipstick 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.690
 Go great but if there are big 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.180
 peeling either here now in winter something on their 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.040
 emphasize uniquely I try more 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.130
 nourishing balm and use 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:43.030
 then cool effect was also here 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:45.250
 bibi cream whose name I tell you 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.610
 I will sign under this video because here 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.830
 all sorts of names 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:53.680
 I haven't tried it yet 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.780
 need to read about it on the Internet if you 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.480
 know something about it or use it 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.780
 be sure to write me and the last 100 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:06.130
 I'll show it to you 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:07.860
 vitamin vitamin spray such from 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.840
 urban decay 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.670
 miniature and I understand it so 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.130
 use either before applying 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.050
 night cream or before applying 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:20.590
 daytime before makeup i first 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:22.300
 I thought it was for fixing makeup 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.820
 no it's like for 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.340
 as the base probably holds makeup better 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.500
 As of this writing, this spray and yet 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.120
 not used but if there is something 

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.490
 The interesting thing is sure to tell in 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.410
 any other videos about him and you 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.240
 such half a kilo of gifts there were all 

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.410
 different probes but I didnâ€™t get them 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.300
 show because not yet 

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.850
 used and when using you 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:46.860
 I'll show you in an empty jar, thanks for all 

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.860
 attention and see you in new videos for now
