00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.550
 for the employees of 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.640
 Road maintenance in the district of Bautzen 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.619
 came with the snow and the work with it 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.240
 the streets passable is that 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.730
 Team around RenÃ© seeps around the clock 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.260
 on road 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.420
 1650 kilometers of federal and state 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.309
 It is important to look after the roads 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.720
 this is in the district of Bautzen 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.870
 extensive fleet available 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.970
 So in our six road maintenance 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.360
 we are subordinated to us 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.829
 two trucks each and two multi-purpose 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.140
 device carrier type unimog available 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:56.520
 There is also a small device carrier 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.309
 for the care of the bike paths and if these 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.620
 technology should not be enough 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.840
 We deal with foreign entrepreneurs and contracts 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.090
 completed the transaction 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.590
 the winter service support if 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.940
 but the snow will not come 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.040
 just drove on it 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.560
 The vehicles work according to one 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.990
 Sophisticated system so we work 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.030
 actually say by priority list 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.700
 I wonder how important this is 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.170
 road is where you naturally 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.869
 has to say in the federal highway has one 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.420
 higher priority than a downstream one 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.340
 This happens too often 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.439
 rumored for winter services camera 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.299
 winter often surprising while in 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.200
 the road maintenance about 1000 tons 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.030
 store salt 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.220
 That way, employees can only react 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.780
 even if snowfall is reported so 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.939
 we actually react 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.619
 basically on the weather reports 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.280
 the German Weather Service to me 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.909
 get updated several times a day if 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.500
 there now in the forecast winter 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.619
 is announced in the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.420
 Road maintenance the roster 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.159
 are set up accordingly 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.780
 snowploughs first then go 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.409
 It does not take long to get to the streets 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.180
 are cleared 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.150
 but sometimes it takes too 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.239
 a bit longer if there is a traffic jam somewhere 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.549
 Let's face it exactly like everyone else 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.090
 other motorists also and can 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.519
 of course, then ours 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.970
 do not necessarily clear times anymore 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.970
 follow
