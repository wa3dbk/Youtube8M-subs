things<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:23.750> want<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.020> say<00:02:24.080> real<00:02:24.470> quick<00:02:24.530> I'm<00:02:24.800> not

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
things I want to say real quick I'm not

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.880 
things I want to say real quick I'm not
putting<00:02:25.790> much<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.599> the<00:02:26.660> footage<00:02:26.989> up<00:02:27.230> because<00:02:27.709> I

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
putting much of the footage up because I

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.440 
putting much of the footage up because I
only<00:02:28.220> wrote<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.640> for<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.819> couple<00:02:28.940> of<00:02:29.150> minutes

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
only wrote it for a couple of minutes

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.470 
only wrote it for a couple of minutes
you<00:02:29.569> know<00:02:29.720> so<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:31.160> admittedly<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.760> platform<00:02:32.360> a

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
you know so and admittedly I platform a

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.970 
you know so and admittedly I platform a
good<00:02:32.630> opinion<00:02:32.870> on<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.200> vibe<00:02:33.319> in<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> couple<00:02:33.950> of

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
good opinion on the vibe in a couple of

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.650 
good opinion on the vibe in a couple of
minutes<00:02:34.310> but

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.950 

cons<00:02:37.350> are<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:37.830> real<00:02:38.070> quickly<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:39.630> it's<00:02:39.810> not

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
cons are so real quickly and it's not

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.960 
cons are so real quickly and it's not
really<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.320> corn<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.890> mean<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.280> just<00:02:41.310> feels<00:02:41.760> a

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
really a corn I mean it just feels a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:52.910 
really a corn I mean it just feels a
little<00:02:42.150> bit<00:02:42.360> overkill<00:02:50.540> right<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:51.900> not<00:02:52.890> in

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
little bit overkill right like not in

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.070 
little bit overkill right like not in
the<00:02:53.280> sense<00:02:53.550> that<00:02:53.700> i've<00:02:54.210> got<00:02:54.390> too<00:02:54.570> much<00:02:54.600> power

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
the sense that i've got too much power

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.470 
the sense that i've got too much power
and<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:55.980> bad<00:02:56.220> it's<00:02:56.580> not<00:02:56.760> like<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.240> just

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
and this is bad it's not like that just

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.990 
and this is bad it's not like that just
in<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.870> fact<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:59.190> feels<00:02:59.490> like<00:02:59.790> it's

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
in the fact that it feels like it's

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.970 
in the fact that it feels like it's
unnecessary<00:03:00.810> power<00:03:01.140> at<00:03:01.470> least<00:03:01.710> for<00:03:01.920> the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
unnecessary power at least for the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.180 
unnecessary power at least for the
street<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.670> know<00:03:02.820> like<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.270> just<00:03:03.450> feels<00:03:04.190> you

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
street you know like it just feels you

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.070 
street you know like it just feels you
know<00:03:05.220> not<00:03:05.550> like<00:03:05.730> not<00:03:06.450> like<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.780> shouldn't

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
know not like not like you shouldn't

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.390 
know not like not like you shouldn't
have<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.440> or<00:03:07.710> anything<00:03:07.890> like<00:03:07.980> nothing<00:03:08.370> like

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
have it or anything like nothing like

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.790 
have it or anything like nothing like
that<00:03:08.670> just<00:03:08.910> like<00:03:09.210> i<00:03:09.630> don't<00:03:10.350> know<00:03:10.410> how<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.590> say

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
that just like i don't know how to say

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.280 
that just like i don't know how to say
it<00:03:10.950> really

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
it really

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.780 
it really
pretty<00:03:12.829> much<00:03:13.010> like<00:03:13.250> you're<00:03:13.400> never<00:03:13.519> going<00:03:13.760> to

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
pretty much like you're never going to

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.399 
pretty much like you're never going to
get<00:03:13.939> the<00:03:14.030> opportunity<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.689> really<00:03:15.079> use<00:03:15.379> that

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
get the opportunity to really use that

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.229 
get the opportunity to really use that
power<00:03:15.860> on<00:03:16.219> the<00:03:16.370> street<00:03:16.730> that's<00:03:16.939> what<00:03:17.150> I'm

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
power on the street that's what I'm

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.690 
power on the street that's what I'm
meaning<00:03:17.829> perkier<00:03:18.829> now<00:03:18.920> let's<00:03:19.400> see<00:03:19.549> how<00:03:19.640> she

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
meaning perkier now let's see how she

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.540 
meaning perkier now let's see how she
handles<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:20.150> bends

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.740 

beautiful

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.140 

is<00:03:34.750> that<00:03:35.110> a<00:03:35.140> valid<00:03:35.440> enough<00:03:35.770> reason<00:03:36.250> like<00:03:36.430> to

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
is that a valid enough reason like to

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.339 
is that a valid enough reason like to
stay<00:03:37.450> out<00:03:37.599> of<00:03:37.629> 600<00:03:38.019> I<00:03:38.560> guess<00:03:39.160> maybe<00:03:39.540> but<00:03:40.540> it's

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
stay out of 600 I guess maybe but it's

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.339 
stay out of 600 I guess maybe but it's
not<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.650> valid<00:03:42.010> reason<00:03:42.390> not<00:03:43.390> to<00:03:43.599> get<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:43.900> leader

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
not a valid reason not to get a leader

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.740 
not a valid reason not to get a leader
by<00:03:44.590> it's<00:03:45.310> just<00:03:45.670> something<00:03:46.300> to<00:03:46.599> consider

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
by it's just something to consider

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.790 
by it's just something to consider
that's<00:03:47.290> all<00:03:47.470> one<00:03:48.459> thing<00:03:48.670> I<00:03:48.790> did<00:03:48.970> love<00:03:49.120> about<00:03:49.420> it

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
that's all one thing I did love about it

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.920 
that's all one thing I did love about it
it's<00:03:50.800> a<00:03:50.950> much<00:03:51.160> better<00:03:51.190> commuter<00:03:52.000> than<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.239> 600

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
it's a much better commuter than a 600

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.030 
it's a much better commuter than a 600
like<00:03:53.170> first<00:03:53.500> year<00:03:53.800> was<00:03:53.980> so<00:03:54.900> wide<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:56.319> open<00:03:56.590> and

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
like first year was so wide and open and

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.300 
like first year was so wide and open and
smooth<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:58.000> just<00:03:58.860> like<00:03:59.860> right<00:04:00.099> now<00:04:00.250> right

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
smooth and just like right now right

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.059 
smooth and just like right now right
first<00:04:00.760> gear<00:04:00.970> I'm<00:04:01.720> taking<00:04:02.110> off<00:04:02.230> you<00:04:02.440> know<00:04:02.590> basic

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
first gear I'm taking off you know basic

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.729 
first gear I'm taking off you know basic
steady<00:04:03.400> look<00:04:03.610> at<00:04:03.700> this<00:04:03.790> so<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.230> 60<00:04:05.230> kilometers

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
steady look at this so I 60 kilometers

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.740 
steady look at this so I 60 kilometers
an<00:04:05.830> hour<00:04:05.950> i'm<00:04:06.190> doing<00:04:06.430> 5,000<00:04:06.940> RPM<00:04:07.330> like<00:04:07.540> that's

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
an hour i'm doing 5,000 RPM like that's

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.410 
an hour i'm doing 5,000 RPM like that's
that's<00:04:08.200> speed<00:04:08.860> limit<00:04:09.160> in<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.459> suburbia<00:04:10.030> area

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
that's speed limit in a suburbia area

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.250 
that's speed limit in a suburbia area
you<00:04:11.019> know<00:04:11.459> how<00:04:12.459> easy<00:04:12.730> was<00:04:12.970> that<00:04:13.030> how<00:04:13.569> cruzi<00:04:14.110> was

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
you know how easy was that how cruzi was

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.160 
you know how easy was that how cruzi was
that

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.750 

my<00:04:19.770> by<00:04:19.950> phone<00:04:20.220> would<00:04:20.310> have<00:04:20.400> been<00:04:20.490> in<00:04:20.580> third

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
my by phone would have been in third

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.580 
my by phone would have been in third
gear<00:04:20.970> by<00:04:21.150> then<00:04:21.330> so<00:04:21.660> that's<00:04:21.990> something<00:04:22.320> which

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
gear by then so that's something which

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.560 
gear by then so that's something which
is<00:04:22.770> different<00:04:23.190> if<00:04:23.850> I<00:04:24.030> was<00:04:24.150> going<00:04:24.360> to<00:04:24.420> be

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
is different if I was going to be

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.680 
is different if I was going to be
freeway<00:04:25.320> riding<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:25.980> choose<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.550> leader<00:04:26.760> bike<00:04:27.030> if

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
freeway riding I choose a leader bike if

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.920 
freeway riding I choose a leader bike if
I<00:04:27.870> was<00:04:28.050> going<00:04:28.230> to<00:04:28.290> be<00:04:28.910> city<00:04:29.910> riding<00:04:30.270> start

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
I was going to be city riding start

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.200 
I was going to be city riding start
stopping<00:04:31.410> you<00:04:31.800> know<00:04:31.950> traffic<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:32.940> all<00:04:32.970> that

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
stopping you know traffic and all that

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.150 
stopping you know traffic and all that
I'd<00:04:33.330> still<00:04:33.480> choose<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.080> leader<00:04:34.320> bikers<00:04:34.830> first

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
I'd still choose the leader bikers first

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.010 
I'd still choose the leader bikers first
