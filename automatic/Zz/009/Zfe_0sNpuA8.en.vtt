well i like the anti fingerprint coating
and<00:06:33.750> it<00:06:33.810> really<00:06:34.050> doesn't<00:06:34.260> add<00:06:34.470> that<00:06:34.740> much<00:06:35.010> to

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:36.229 
and it really doesn't add that much to

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.170 
and it really doesn't add that much to
the<00:06:37.229> feel<00:06:37.530> to<00:06:37.770> it<00:06:37.800> or<00:06:38.099> doesn't<00:06:38.370> distract<00:06:38.880> from

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
the feel to it or doesn't distract from

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.190
