00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
surprisingly despite that I think he's a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.779 
surprisingly despite that I think he's a

that<00:03:07.920> was<00:03:08.250> fucking<00:03:08.670> stupid<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:09.330> admit<00:03:10.020> that<00:03:10.560> was

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
that was fucking stupid I admit that was

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.030 
that was fucking stupid I admit that was
not<00:03:11.100> smart<00:03:11.490> I<00:03:12.050> think<00:03:13.050> it<00:03:13.200> was<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.470> given<00:03:14.010> that

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
not smart I think it was a given that

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.880 
not smart I think it was a given that
she<00:03:14.850> would<00:03:15.060> have<00:03:15.270> left<00:03:15.630> for<00:03:16.050> Disney<00:03:16.410> anyway

she would have left for Disney anyway

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.220 
she would have left for Disney anyway
because<00:03:17.310> she<00:03:17.610> deserves<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.600> share<00:03:18.840> her<00:03:19.019> talent

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
because she deserves to share her talent

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.040 
because she deserves to share her talent
with<00:03:20.010> others<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.670> spread<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:21.450> on<00:03:21.570> to<00:03:21.870> other

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050

with others and spread it on to other
companies<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:23.010> guess<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:23.940> was<00:03:24.120> just<00:03:24.360> making<00:03:24.780> a

companies I guess I was just making a

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.440 
companies I guess I was just making a
stupid<00:03:25.260> jab<00:03:25.680> about<00:03:26.190> how<00:03:26.430> golden<00:03:26.790> Fox<00:03:27.060> fueled

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
the hate amy got and how coincidental it

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.530 
the hate amy got and how coincidental it
is<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:32.040> one<00:03:32.280> writer<00:03:32.610> who<00:03:32.910> seems<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.300> get

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
is that the one writer who seems to get

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.870 
is that the one writer who seems to get
a<00:03:33.570> lot<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:33.810> hate<00:03:34.110> mail<00:03:34.160> was<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.340> one<00:03:35.489> who<00:03:35.670> left

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
a lot of hate mail was the one who left

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.360 
a lot of hate mail was the one who left
the<00:03:36.000> writing<00:03:36.420> staff<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.110> let's<00:03:37.920> just<00:03:38.220> leave

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
it at that I also used Robins whining

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.210 
it at that I also used Robins whining

sound clip from dog walkers Batman and
Robin<00:03:44.519> video<00:03:44.820> that<00:03:45.269> was<00:03:45.810> most<00:03:46.170> likely<00:03:46.560> the

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
Robin video that was most likely the

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.479 
Robin video that was most likely the
most<00:03:48.480> offensive<00:03:49.440> part<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.860> this<00:03:50.010> rant

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
most offensive part of this rant

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.880 
most offensive part of this rant
and<00:03:50.640> I<00:03:51.090> think<00:03:51.330> I<00:03:51.450> should<00:03:51.660> have<00:03:51.810> used<00:03:52.080> a<00:03:52.380> less

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.800 
and I think I should have used a less
obnoxious<00:03:53.100> sound<00:03:53.700> effect<00:03:54.120> for<00:03:54.390> making<00:03:54.720> that

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
obnoxious sound effect for making that

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
obnoxious sound effect for making that
