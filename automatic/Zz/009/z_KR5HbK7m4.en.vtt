00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.750
 well everyone knows what 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.390
 is today we find ourselves on the 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.240
 game need for speed most wanted 2 that my 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.610
 friend of mine lent me 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.590
 so my for speed most wanted 2 is a 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.550
 developed game and 106 girls from 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.710
 critÃ©riums games 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.779
 I want to tell you that this game was 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.090
 for me the favorite at the level of 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.570
 car game so I immediately 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.400
 hooked to this active interface to 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.670
 this impressive graphic quality 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.720
 and on all his cards really huge 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.580
 I think that then what I 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.019
 wanted to destroy the car of the most 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.269
 wanted 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.210
 I do not think I spent twice 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.920
 same place on the map 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.250
 other than that what I loved about this game 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.030
 this tuning by rolling the improvements 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.449
 while shopping 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.379
 so I do not know if you already have 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.750
 played but where and at any time change 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.330
 the settings of your car you 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.260
 can change Township 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.670
 you changed 2 surface so if 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.600
 you are going to spend on the dull for 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.650
 exchange directly route us and if 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.760
 you want to change neither too much in full 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.760
 race you can do it 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.659
 so that's very good not bad 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.440
 especially that it 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.540
 it does not disturb the cause 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.380
 other than that I think I want to score but 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.680
 this game really has a great 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.780
 resemblance to burn out 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.750
 mainly by seven hectares 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.630
 they came to voted something developed by 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.090
 by Bernard who allows to destroy the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.560
 other cars and this win some 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:53.640
 points with that so I also think that 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.060
 game graphics this game 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.670
 report to many are really more 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.090
 developed there the cards are more 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.830
 active so I mean by that that one 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.360
 can go into the background is that the 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.320
 decor in itself is better done than 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.930
 that of band of paradise and apart from that 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.820
 I also find it a bit of a pity 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.489
 that they do not have the tricks as in 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.300
 the paradise but separately serious since 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:26.080
 the game is based more bubbles 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:28.120
 mainly on realism so 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.520
 the gameplay should soon touch his 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.100
 end me anyway I hope you 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.350
 have had great holidays that you 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.300
 will go to buy a video game for Christmas or 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.440
 I do not know yet what in any case 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.510
 I advise you if you can 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.640
 to choose a video game during I you 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.640
 advise on speed most wanted 2 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.540
 I think that in the week I 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.819
 will dive videos and you stay 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.630
 still a few days participating in a 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:59.440
 contest with given yak so happy birthday 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.040
 at all Christmas it's not crazy to 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.040
 summer to everyone 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.650
 you beat your first pilot 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.570
 most wanted but this is just the beginning 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.150
 to get him his car and his place 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.200
 in the list you have to chase it down and 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.200
 the order for good
