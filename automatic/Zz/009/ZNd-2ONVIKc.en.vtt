00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
 reichberger and that's what's going on 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:07.610
 with the happy news on monday 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.139
 Do you actually know all your facebook 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.759
 Friends sometimes sneaks up 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.590
 one or the other to be there with you 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.360
 should not be friends in reallife 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.119
 maybe not at all and exactly 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.490
 this task has now become one 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.670
 he wants all his 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.609
 facebook friends in real life meet 35 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.420
 years is micro mcloughlin old and he 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.250
 would like his 377 facebook friends 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.600
 meet in real life but how come 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.059
 Now on such an idea 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.550
 Mike has observed that several of his 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.809
 friends like your facebook list 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.579
 have tidied up a bit like that 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.070
 Maybe it's a spring cleanse 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.390
 I also want to sort premier 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.760
 no longer have on facebook 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.110
 he is great on facebook and michael 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.670
 he does exactly the opposite 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.949
 just wanted all his friends 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.110
 visit and that in real life and that's why 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.329
 he rented a car at the first 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.399
 april and now works his 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.170
 friends list from some of his facebook 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.090
 He has never seen contacts before 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.850
 because only a quarter of his facebook 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.250
 he also knows friends in reality 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.530
 and so he works his list now 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.390
 piece by piece and documented that 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.640
 whole in his blog julia franz raith 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.689

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.689
 he has friends list so far 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.570
 processed 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:27.049
 A homeless seasoning lottery winner

 and he does not have them there 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.409
 and hidden camera somehow made 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.270
 where he enters a homeless eric 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.070

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.630
 paid to eric the homeless on 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.060
 has been 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.770
 he was so excited that he did that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.619
 do not keep money for yourself 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.840
 but he wanted it with the bike world 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.789
 restlessly had wanted to share this 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.020
 cool gesture where you have no money 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.120
 the money with someone else 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.370
 wanted to share with youtube so 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.020
 crass through the ceiling the wheel itself 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.070
 Eric decided to get off the road 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.530
 be brought 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.810

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.860

 bank account for eric creates the first 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.070

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.370
 Of course, with camera and eric 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.450
 had good news 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.060
 he has a job now 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.130
 found in a seven eleven store and 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.300

 There was only a small excuse for him 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.210
 to go in his own house and then 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.860
 there was the big surprise it was 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.590

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.570

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.470
 youtube link to this below in the video 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.720

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.209
 hit cool thing so far should times 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.350
 come on TV 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.300
 You know that maybe you are packing yours 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.950
 chocolate or whatever 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.959
 the packaging is outside so 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.190
 transparent plastic film then there's 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.570
 re- packing the whole one 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.070
 to make some beautiful the printed 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.110
 then you do it on there's 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.060
 a box in there with styrofoam 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.830
 or something you take away and then 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.540
 is every single piece again 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.920
 packed up so much garbage 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.720
 that is not good for the environment and 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.250
 also annoying often in the summer want 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.940
 Two Berliners now the first 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.920
 open original unpacked supermarket 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.950
 that is a great lay without 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.870
 were with polluting once 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.640
 packaging manages customer can then 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.640
 bring your own packaging for 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.040
 for example, tupperware or preserving jars 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.750
 or just measuring cups or for the 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.060
 Spontaneous shopping is also available again 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.860
 usable packaging on site each 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.650
 year will be over four million tons 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.540
 Thrown away packaging in Germany 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.910
 And that does not just consume water 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.620
 but also oil and energy that 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.930
 Packaging free shopping is but 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.630
 not only good for the environment but the 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.850
 Customers can also buy exactly what 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.100
 he just needs that 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.000
 Filling in quantity what you just for 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.410
 Cooking needs the whole thing over 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.470
 crowdfunding work and everyone 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.360
 can be between 8 and 300 euros for this 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.670
 Currently, there is still no provision 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.710
 10,000 euros and a suitable location 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.690
 but if it works then it is a 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.920
 What might happen soon in the 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.800
 could prevail in the future 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.560
 Australian student gets 81,000 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.880
 dollar finder pay because he is so honest 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.220
 the honesty of the Australian 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.080
 students have a charming drama a single 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.450
 Now he has paid off 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.580
 Almost three years at the Australian tv 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.800
 sender channel nine as a cleaning man 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.410
 worked at his work in the 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.650
 He discovered 81,000 toilets 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.080
 Australian dollars in trash can that 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.000
 are equivalent to 55,000 euros at the end 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.800
 thought the whole thing was a joke though 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.750
 when he took the money in hand 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.669
 It really is real money though 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.410
 to keep it informed he informed his 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.510
 supervisor and who contacted the 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.610
 Police after the police investigator 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.650
 the owner of the money but not 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.750
 could determine and all now 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.530
 at least three years ago that is 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.750
 In the end, keep the money sincerity 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.820
 must be rewarded said the judge 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.160
 and the investigators also agreed 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.930
 The command as a student money 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.669
 urgently needed at the end would want a 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.140
 donate part of the money now and that 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.240
 to disabled and to one 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.150
 Buddhist temple near by 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.650
 melbourne 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.510
 which unfortunately seriously doing what you have 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.880
 already found and you have it 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.590
 That's the question today 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.870
 rather hard or but I think so 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.860
 a big buzz so $ 55,000 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.060
 and especially in one 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.740
 I would think that I have television broadcasts 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.030
 I will return too much 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.820
 that had the fear that the wrong 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.400
 belongs might and anyway me 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.150
 but then again I find so 10 euro 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.919
 you should know there 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.580
 I think back ten euros for 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.770
 behave you 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.840
 yes I'm already as that did not happen 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.620
