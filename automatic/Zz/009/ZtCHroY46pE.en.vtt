would<00:01:39.050> always<00:01:39.080> break<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.800> bottleneck<00:01:40.430> if<00:01:40.880> when

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
would always break a bottleneck if when

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.680 
would always break a bottleneck if when
he<00:01:41.240> didn't<00:01:41.479> use<00:01:41.690> his<00:01:41.830> pocketknife

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.930 
he would always file a little gray ring
around<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.960> bottleneck<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:48.979> he<00:01:49.460> just<00:01:49.729> give

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
around the bottleneck and he just give

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.580 
around the bottleneck and he just give
it<00:01:50.090> a<00:01:50.180> little<00:01:50.390> clink<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.080> it<00:01:51.200> would<00:01:51.350> break

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
it a little clink and it would break

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.190 
it a little clink and it would break
smooth<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.399> he<00:01:52.520> would<00:01:52.700> grind<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.720> off<00:01:53.869> the

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
smooth and he would grind it off the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.840 
smooth and he would grind it off the
very<00:01:54.500> wheels<00:01:54.770> had<00:01:55.250> no<00:01:55.490> sharp<00:01:56.450> edges<00:01:56.840> on<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.500> and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
very wheels had no sharp edges on it and

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.960 
very wheels had no sharp edges on it and
then<00:01:58.850> after<00:01:59.420> moving<00:01:59.899> to<00:01:59.960> Virginia<00:02:00.640> he<00:02:01.640> learned

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
then after moving to Virginia he learned

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.020 
then after moving to Virginia he learned
that<00:02:02.300> there<00:02:03.080> was<00:02:03.350> something<00:02:03.770> specially<00:02:04.729> for

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
that there was something specially for

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.870 
that there was something specially for
that<00:02:05.440> but<00:02:06.440> he<00:02:06.590> didn't<00:02:06.920> throw<00:02:07.100> his<00:02:07.340> bottleneck

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
that but he didn't throw his bottleneck

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.710 
that but he didn't throw his bottleneck
away<00:02:08.380> he<00:02:09.380> still<00:02:09.619> kept<00:02:09.979> it<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:11.239> was<00:02:11.450> the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
away he still kept it and that was the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.390 
away he still kept it and that was the
start<00:02:12.050> of<00:02:12.320> knowing<00:02:13.070> about<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.580> side<00:02:15.400> would

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
start of knowing about the side would

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.570 
start of knowing about the side would
