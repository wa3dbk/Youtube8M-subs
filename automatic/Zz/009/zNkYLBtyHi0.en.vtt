00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.930
 hello how about very good friends of avid and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.710
 point is and I look and I have point is let's 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.550
 see now a kitchen table a table 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.070
 he usually arrives even in the kitchen 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.129
 but you can quietly use it in a 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.870
 small dining room since the lines 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.110
 they are very straight and the terminations are 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.330
 very straight then it seems like a table 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.400
 kitchen design that quietly 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.000
 we have also sold it many times in 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.430
 the dining rooms but it's a kitchen table 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.680
 this time we are seeing it in 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.630
 black also have available in 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.500
 red and white 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.420
 and there are many things to highlight and a 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.400
 for example that the crystal is a crystal 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.400
 that is tempered 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.229
 it is a crystal that comes in what comes 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.799
 to make the supports live in cast without 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.750
 cold and the glass in case of break in 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.299
 case of a very strong blow we 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.030
 tip-shaped splinter since it is 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.729
 tempering is made dust is not done if 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.369
 you accept very little things and we do not 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.039
 harms people in case of breakage 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.200
 we know that a glass table is very 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:30.140
 hard but there is a possibility too 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.270
 in which in front of a very strong blow 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.079
 really spoil 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.310
 the paint is epoxy there are paintings that are 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.219
 cheaper than they are gray 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.469
 then there are the epoxy and then the mask 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.420
 of all are the appliances 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:48.770
 this is the epoxy paint a painting that 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.920
 is very robust we will remember the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:57.829
 steps of the legs are 56 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.590
 here we have 96 75 in height and what 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:04.070
 would be the height of this part of 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.250
 down here about 68 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.500
 68 centimeters then here we have 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.300
 because with a little tableware 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.970
 to see how it would look for four 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.270
 diners I'm going to borrow a 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.270
 chair 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.580
 to be seen as a person of a 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:30.400
 80 with 90 kilos as it would enter the table 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.950
 from this table that they can calmly 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.640
 eat four people without any 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.450
 problem 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.760
 5 or 6 depends on the needs of each 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.550
 one 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.440
 this is very good 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.000
 can be used logically in the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.140
 center but quietly you can 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.050
 use 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.540
 fuck the wall let's put four 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.810
 chairs so you can see what it's about 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.810
 the theme 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.849
 this is another possibility 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.159
 the truth that is very good is very 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.200
 very complete and the other also who 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.200
 has two stools or two days 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.940
 and two sidewalks 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.760
 it is used 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.379
 in this other way 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.269
 I would not have to do both sides 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:29.970
 tableware and this here put if you are here 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.860
 are you come here 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.190
 It is good here 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:41.550
 and up to here this is the other way of 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.550
 that the kitchens are used a lot 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.400
 good the construction part the 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.350
 true that I would like to make a small 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.760
 pause and show you how this table is coming 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.830
 constituted below 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.079
 good to give it true one of the tables 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.489
 we can appreciate how the 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:04.340
 definite construction is a whole hoop 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:07.190
 metallic that is in one piece 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:12.069
 with some plates that are very very 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:15.459
 thick where the two screws cross 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.040
 with two with four screws they take it 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.680
 what would be the crystal 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.920
 and the legs we're going to remove one so that 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.920
 be seen 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.470
 well here we can see by removing a 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.470
 paw 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.900
 we will appreciate that the screw very very 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.850
 thick that in the absence of one has two and 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.850
 that inside the square tube has some 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.210
 round very thick where here is the 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.210
 thread 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.449
 that finally the screw 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:55.439
 other karan is all this may seem 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:57.719
 a bit boring but it forms good 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:00.910
 construction of it and it's one thing 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:03.160
 that we have it that we have to say 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.680
 in once we have seen how it comes 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.050
 constituted 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.970
 and we have remembered the qualities as 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.800
 well the construction how is left with 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.039
 four chairs 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.440
 so remember that in case the 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.960
 buy online carriers 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.360
 they leave in the low or fabric will rise 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.389
 but it comes in a box that is a little 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.100
 larger than 110 x 70 will be 90 x 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:27.690
 80 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.940
 and it is very easy to upload in the 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.280
 elevator then you would have to ride it not 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.170
 has any complication we hope that 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.840
 dock we thank you for 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.090
 allow us to enter your home and good 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.070
 we want you to buy and repeat with 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.000
 habit and point is if I look and I have a point 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.000
 it's many thanks
