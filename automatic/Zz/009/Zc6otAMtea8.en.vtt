00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:12.080
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:14.630
 my youtube channel to another 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.040
 find over the dji phantom 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.480
 or the ttf 450 today would like 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.360
 I'm so small 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.290
 make comparative video and that first 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.849
 once a comparison video to NASA chip 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.070
 The gentleman is installed here in both 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:36.649
 We have here on phantom page 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:40.280
 once the nasa mv 1 and here on pages 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:43.550
 we already have the new df 450 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.220
 nasa mv 2 installed I would like to see you 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.430
 show where the differences are and how 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.550
 you relatively easy your phantom 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.390
 Quadrocopter so adjust a bit 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.850
 can you mind nasa v2 like her head 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.810
 can equip for the future 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.810
 some features in nasa v2 needs 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.630
 her compelling her to the new ones 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.659
 hardware stuff coming out of now 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.570
 you like the gÃ¼mbel then also on 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.760
 You can use phantom before I do that 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.250
 But still make my thanks to the company 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.760
 sander europe the kindly 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.740
 here the nasa mv two for this one 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.740
 comparison 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.400
 so have the two copter times now 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.710
 right next to each other 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.360
 on the one hand, the phantom on the other 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:46.210
 page with the nasa fauna sa nv 1 chip 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.350
 and here we have the f 450 playmobil 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.210
 with the orange bracelet nasa mv 2 chip 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.869
 you have seen the year from close up 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.420
 already during the installation video, the two chips 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.340
 are at least externally one sees of 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.729
 the red or orange color 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.039
 from completely identical that is to say they have 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.100
 the same connections here on both 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.330
 So first of all, it has to be there 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.360
 nothing changed 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.360
 a difference of all things 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.819
 the one who does not notice any 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.150
 bought phantom but the old one 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:27.610
 NASA MV 1 chip in your own copter 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:31.360
 have installed the gps at nasa v2 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.360
 is the gps always with it when nasa v1 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.700
 it was optional at the time you could do it 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.950
 buy it but it was standard 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:46.450
 not necessarily another one 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.790
 special feature in nasa v2 is this one 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.640
 chip this is the new pm 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:56.320
 that's a whole new component now 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:00.880
 in the nasa v2 is involved and yes 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.280
 a bit replaced what used to be the vhs 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.940
 gave in the old nose a so-called vu 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.769
 which is here in phantom built here for 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.780
 one on the side and the other here 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.220
 behind 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.280
 this woman had one of them 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.600
 status led in the other the 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.359
 power supply we have here now 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.060
 and that everything is in a chip with it 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.160
 then the nasa directly supplied that 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.489
 you see here at the phantom there it is 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.019
 all over here connected 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:32.700
 and here you have that removed now 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:35.319
 Now there is this new one 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.260
 unity and on the other there is that 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.110
 give back over out of here 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.620
 the status led that is now two 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:47.129
 become components of it and the giant 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.599
 difference is that just these pm now 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.750
 here is an additional connection 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.540
 has and this connection is thought 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.299
 for all the new things that are now 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.530
 come out like for example the new one 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.190
 gimbel 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.530
 that means when we have the phantom 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.489
 then we need to upgrade 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.819
 every case 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:14.940
 this new unit of nasa v2 the kib 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:17.220
 There will be or will be individual 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.739
 buy that means you do not need that 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.049
 complete set with gps and nasa chip and 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.970
 but to buy full time job but her 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:29.940
 can here these nasa pmv two separately 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.699
 buy individually and then here relatively 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.960
 just plug in the only thing here 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.520
 it's a bit tricky 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.680
 power supply sown that here 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.410
 this black and red cable the 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.199
 have to be soldered here firmly or 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.370
 moored that the pid must be with 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.470
 be supplied with electricity 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.960
 and if the pm clock is supplied with electricity 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.250
 then she can then the nasa 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.020
 supply power to the chip and 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.110
 at the same time the electricity continues 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.669
 distribute here on such extras as the 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.080
 gamble etc but to the installation of the powder 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.090
 I will certainly later also 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.620
 make a separate video about it 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.610
 if I then here someday 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.539
 should install so that's the big one 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.560
 difference to that again 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.990
 summarize 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.389
 this paged pm now here the 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.010
 significantly more powerful than that 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.979
 what has been installed here and also 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.440
 some new features about it 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:25.530
 There are also two others 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.080
 Special features the remote status led 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.510
 I had already mentioned and further 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.500
 is here in the orange nasa 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.820
 two mv also some newer sensors the 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.139
 i can show you bad here 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.699
 installed inside here 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.370
 but there was another one 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.860
 little something done then what the chip 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.050
 the actual nasa chip here the nasa 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.129
 I decided that a bit too 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.419
 powerful 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:53.809
 makes the nasa v1 as the standard chip 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.969
 chip basically to the software the 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:57.469
 it runs on the firmware has been 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.849
 nothing is changed in both 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:03.229
 stayed the same 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:06.169
 that means you will continue in the future 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.610
 firmware updates both on the old 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.769
 as well as the new chip on it 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.979
 can play and from the new ones 

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:15.649
 then the features of the firmware benefit 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.649
 at least as long as not separate 

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:18.800
 things like for example this demo 

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:21.949
 presuppose 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:27.379
 yes that's essentially the 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:30.580
 distinguished between the nasa mv 1 the 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:35.029
 old nasa and nasa the new nasa 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:37.459
 v2 as I said there will be one soon 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:38.300
 separate peru give the built-in here 

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:40.189
 can be 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.959
 this you have to head on course 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:44.949
 make a bit of solder but i think 

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:46.699
 that is all possible somewhere 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:48.529
 otherwise you can of course 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:50.599
 go and see the complete chip here 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:52.550
 replace it is stuck here only 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:54.439
 So you can turn it down 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.829
 unnatural if you also want to go against it 

00:06:54.439 --> 00:07:00.199
 a completely new nasa mv 2 chip 

00:06:57.829 --> 00:07:03.550
 exchange so absolutely necessary 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:06.649
 but not in my eyes 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.419
 yes that was it again from me 

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:11.809
 film this time a comparison film 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:13.309
 between the two controller chips i 

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:15.199
 Hope the movie you liked if 

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:17.149
 yes, of course I am happy about it 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:20.269
 a nice comment below 

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:22.129
 a positive rating recommends me 

00:07:20.269 --> 00:07:23.929
 continue and of course subscribe me 

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:26.139
 if you have not done it yet 

00:07:23.929 --> 00:07:26.139
 should
