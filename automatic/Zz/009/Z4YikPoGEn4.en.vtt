are free coins each so so let me do the

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.960 
are free coins each so so let me do the
quick<00:01:55.610> master<00:01:55.970> yuan<00:01:56.120> that<00:01:56.300> so<00:01:56.900> 3<00:01:57.680> times<00:01:58.100> 440

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
quick master yuan that so 3 times 440

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.130 
quick master yuan that so 3 times 440
that's<00:02:00.970> 1020<00:02:01.970> basically<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.480> think<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.750> prices

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
that's 1020 basically I think the prices

that's 1020 basically I think the prices
do<00:02:03.290> go<00:02:03.350> up<00:02:03.500> so<00:02:03.830> probably<00:02:04.220> be<00:02:04.280> more<00:02:04.460> like<00:02:04.640> 2<00:02:05.480> free

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
do go up so probably be more like 2 free

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
from a vendor I believe the thing is

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.270 
from a vendor I believe the thing is
there<00:02:32.360> at<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:33.020> moment<00:02:33.380> these<00:02:33.530> are<00:02:33.770> in<00:02:33.920> quite<00:02:34.220> a

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
there at the moment these are in quite a

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.070 
there at the moment these are in quite a
big<00:02:34.490> demand<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:35.209> I'd<00:02:35.330> probably<00:02:35.570> try<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:35.959> make

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
big demand so I'd probably try and make

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.720 
big demand so I'd probably try and make
this<00:02:36.170> quickly<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.860> reason<00:02:37.190> that<00:02:37.400> they're<00:02:37.640> in

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
this quickly the reason that they're in

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.750 
this quickly the reason that they're in
a<00:02:37.790> big<00:02:37.940> demand<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.390> cuz<00:02:38.630> lots<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:38.959> you're<00:02:39.110> doing

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
a big demand is cuz lots of you're doing

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.010 
a big demand is cuz lots of you're doing
monkey<00:02:40.760> madness<00:02:41.060> at<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.450> moment<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:41.930> they

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
monkey madness at the moment and they

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.600 
monkey madness at the moment and they
can't<00:02:42.290> afford<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.650> money<00:02:42.830> for<00:02:43.010> super<00:02:43.250> energy

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
can't afford the money for super energy

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.060 
can't afford the money for super energy
so<00:02:44.000> they<00:02:44.120> just<00:02:44.270> get<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.690> normal<00:02:45.620> energy<00:02:45.709> pots

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
so they just get the normal energy pots

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.729 
so they just get the normal energy pots

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
fungus at 550

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.770 
fungus at 550
and<00:03:45.330> these<00:03:46.159> sir<00:03:47.189> so<00:03:47.580> you<00:03:47.640> actually<00:03:48.030> pay<00:03:48.480> about

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
and these sir so you actually pay about

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.160 
and these sir so you actually pay about
32<00:03:49.620> million<00:03:49.890> for<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.730> parts<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.750> in<00:03:51.930> for<00:03:52.049> the

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
32 million for the parts I in for the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.050 
32 million for the parts I in for the
ingredients<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.799> make<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:53.159> but<00:03:53.610> you<00:03:53.700> only<00:03:53.819> make

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
ingredients to make it but you only make

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.330 
ingredients to make it but you only make
24<00:03:54.480> million<00:03:54.720> 24<00:03:55.500> million<00:03:55.829> off<00:03:56.129> these

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
24 million 24 million off these

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.690 
24 million 24 million off these
basically<00:03:56.790> so<00:03:57.920> these<00:03:58.920> means<00:03:59.159> is<00:03:59.400> you're<00:03:59.610> gonna

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
basically so these means is you're gonna

basically so these means is you're gonna
be<00:03:59.879> losing<00:04:00.390> quite<00:04:00.959> a<00:04:00.989> bit<00:04:01.140> of<00:04:01.200> money<00:04:01.319> so<00:04:01.680> you

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
be losing quite a bit of money so you

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.800 
be losing quite a bit of money so you
get<00:04:01.890> obviously<00:04:02.040> lose<00:04:02.519> 8<00:04:02.700> million<00:04:03.000> but<00:04:03.540> what

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
get obviously lose 8 million but what

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.740 
get obviously lose 8 million but what
you<00:04:03.930> can<00:04:04.140> do<00:04:04.349> is<00:04:04.769> instead<00:04:05.129> of<00:04:05.730> making<00:04:06.450> super

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
you can do is instead of making super

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.319 
you can do is instead of making super
energy<00:04:07.019> potions<00:04:07.409> which<00:04:07.620> are<00:04:07.829> quicker<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.879> can

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
energy potions which are quicker you can

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.839 
energy potions which are quicker you can
just<00:04:09.480> make<00:04:09.659> prayer<00:04:10.590> pots<00:04:10.829> which<00:04:11.430> will<00:04:11.609> make

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
about two hundred sixty five mil and I

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.460 
about two hundred sixty five mil and I
know<00:05:05.760> this<00:05:05.970> will<00:05:06.150> sound<00:05:06.360> like<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.810> lot<00:05:07.169> but<00:05:07.410> you

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
know this will sound like a lot but you

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.500 
know this will sound like a lot but you
can<00:05:07.620> actually<00:05:07.770> sell<00:05:08.130> them<00:05:08.610> for<00:05:08.849> six<00:05:09.030> K<00:05:09.210> each<00:05:09.360> at

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
can actually sell them for six K each at

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.060 
can actually sell them for six K each at
the<00:05:09.539> moment<00:05:09.840> I<00:05:09.930> think<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.320> price<00:05:10.590> will<00:05:11.039> be

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
the moment I think the price will be

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.350 
the moment I think the price will be
going<00:05:11.220> up<00:05:11.520> so<00:05:12.330> basically<00:05:13.130> you<00:05:14.130> make<00:05:14.400> 360<00:05:14.970> one

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
going up so basically you make 360 one

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.089 
going up so basically you make 360 one
bill<00:05:15.570> but<00:05:15.900> you<00:05:15.930> lose<00:05:16.169> two<00:05:16.620> hundred<00:05:17.010> and

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
bill but you lose two hundred and

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.820 
bill but you lose two hundred and
sixty-five<00:05:17.490> so<00:05:18.180> you<00:05:18.240> make<00:05:18.479> about<00:05:18.660> 96<00:05:19.440> milk

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
sixty-five so you make about 96 milk

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.250 
sixty-five so you make about 96 milk
profit<00:05:20.340> so<00:05:21.210> let<00:05:21.479> me<00:05:21.539> just<00:05:21.690> do<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:21.900> mass<00:05:22.080> for

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
profit so let me just do the mass for

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.460 
profit so let me just do the mass for
you<00:05:22.849> 96<00:05:23.849> mil<00:05:24.060> a<00:05:24.690> million<00:05:25.289> five<00:05:25.440> hundred

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
you 96 mil a million five hundred

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.969 
you 96 mil a million five hundred
thousand<00:05:26.099> because<00:05:26.160> you<00:05:26.400> lost<00:05:26.580> all<00:05:26.880> that<00:05:27.090> money

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
thousand because you lost all that money
