00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
one of them to go but and think we're

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.630 
one of them to go but and think we're
like<00:00:18.779> playing<00:00:19.260> best<00:00:19.470> better<00:00:19.949> stuff<00:00:20.220> than<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
like playing best better stuff than the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.800 
like playing best better stuff than the
were<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.090> beginning<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> season

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
were the beginning of the season

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.660 
were the beginning of the season
obviously<00:00:22.650> some<00:00:22.800> new<00:00:22.920> team<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.310> everything

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
obviously some new team and everything

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.810 
obviously some new team and everything
but<00:00:23.900> um<00:00:24.900> there<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:25.680> go<00:00:25.830> every<00:00:26.369> game<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.580> goes

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
but um there we go every game that goes

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.000 
but um there we go every game that goes
on<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.269> think<00:00:28.050> we're<00:00:28.170> actually<00:00:28.289> playing<00:00:28.619> better

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
on I think we're actually playing better

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.919 
on I think we're actually playing better
football<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.640> sticking<00:00:30.119> all<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.570> side<00:00:30.900> of

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
football and sticking all that side of

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.139 
football and sticking all that side of
the<00:00:31.109> city<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.740> know<00:00:32.040> letting<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> few<00:00:32.730> goals<00:00:32.969> in

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
the city you know letting a few goals in

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.000 
the city you know letting a few goals in
against<00:00:33.480> middlesbrough<00:00:33.989> yeah<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.770> think

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
against middlesbrough yeah but I think

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.190 
against middlesbrough yeah but I think
put<00:00:35.670> stuff<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.360> think<00:00:36.570> hopefully<00:00:36.750> we<00:00:37.050> can

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
put stuff and I think hopefully we can

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.889 
put stuff and I think hopefully we can
kick<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.590> line<00:00:37.800> get<00:00:38.670> some<00:00:38.820> cool<00:00:38.969> more<00:00:39.660> punch

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
kick on line get some cool more punch

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.569 
kick on line get some cool more punch
than<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.079> table<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.590> guess<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.250> big<00:00:41.399> step

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
than the table I guess it's a big step

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.010 
than the table I guess it's a big step
up<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.210> know<00:00:42.360> something<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.660> yourself

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
up that you know something like yourself

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.840
