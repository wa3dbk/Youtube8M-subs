hi this is sarah with sprint drinker and
today<00:00:07.300> i'm<00:00:07.540> going<00:00:07.720> to<00:00:07.810> demonstrate<00:00:07.870> how<00:00:08.530> to

show<00:00:10.780> you<00:00:10.839> all<00:00:11.079> the<00:00:11.259> benefits<00:00:11.410> of<00:00:11.769> using<00:00:11.950> it

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:12.249 
show you all the benefits of using it

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:14.699 
show you all the benefits of using it
let's<00:00:13.059> start<00:00:13.360> by<00:00:13.539> taking<00:00:13.749> a<00:00:13.929> closer<00:00:14.230> look<00:00:14.409> at

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:14.709 
let's start by taking a closer look at

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.770 
let's start by taking a closer look at
the<00:00:14.799> anchor<00:00:15.039> itself<00:00:15.159> you'll<00:00:16.090> notice<00:00:16.449> here

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 
the anchor itself you'll notice here

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.570 
the anchor itself you'll notice here
that<00:00:16.810> the<00:00:17.140> spring<00:00:17.410> breaker<00:00:17.770> was<00:00:17.920> designed<00:00:18.280> to

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
that the spring breaker was designed to

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.310 
that the spring breaker was designed to
accommodate<00:00:19.060> the<00:00:19.210> many<00:00:19.420> sprinklers<00:00:19.780> bikes<00:00:20.110> on

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
accommodate the many sprinklers bikes on

the market here are the most three
common<00:00:23.380> spikes<00:00:23.620> you'll<00:00:23.890> find<00:00:24.130> at<00:00:24.280> hardware

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
common spikes you'll find at hardware

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.800 
common spikes you'll find at hardware
stores<00:00:24.610> today<00:00:25.030> you<00:00:26.020> have<00:00:26.200> the<00:00:26.230> wing<00:00:26.500> spike<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
stores today you have the wing spike the

their own sprinkler spikes will tilt and
fall<00:00:51.160> over<00:00:51.489> because<00:00:52.239> of<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:52.690> way<00:00:52.780> the<00:00:52.960> typical
