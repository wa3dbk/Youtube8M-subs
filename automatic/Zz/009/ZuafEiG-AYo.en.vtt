00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
so to the figure now dark crumple zone

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.319 
so to the figure now dark crumple zone
is<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.159> much<00:01:41.460> better<00:01:43.729> figure<00:01:44.729> than<00:01:45.119> his

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
is a much better figure than his

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.450 
is a much better figure than his
original<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:46.020> mean<00:01:46.380> he's<00:01:46.530> only<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.770> repaint<00:01:47.189> but

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
original I mean he's only a repaint but

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.350 
original I mean he's only a repaint but
he's<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> better<00:01:48.860> reaping

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
he's a better reaping

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.920 
he's a better reaping
he<00:01:52.360> used<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.570> be<00:01:52.630> green<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:53.080> now<00:01:53.500> he's<00:01:54.930> blue

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
he used to be green and now he's blue

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.980 
he used to be green and now he's blue
yellow<00:01:56.470> orange<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:58.810> brown<00:02:00.720> he's<00:02:01.720> a<00:02:01.780> better

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
yellow orange little brown he's a better

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.770 
yellow orange little brown he's a better
color<00:02:02.229> this<00:02:02.470> way<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:04.060> that's<00:02:04.390> why<00:02:04.540> I<00:02:04.570> picked

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
color this way and that's why I picked

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.090 
color this way and that's why I picked
him<00:02:04.930> up<00:02:05.050> instead<00:02:05.350> of<00:02:05.470> getting<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.770> green<00:02:05.890> when

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
him up instead of getting the green when

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.290 
him up instead of getting the green when
I<00:02:06.159> didn't<00:02:06.369> like<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.490> green<00:02:06.760> one<00:02:06.910> really<00:02:07.240> owe

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
I didn't like the green one really owe

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:15.240 
I didn't like the green one really owe
that<00:02:07.479> much<00:02:07.660> I<00:02:07.900> like<00:02:08.170> this<00:02:08.289> one<00:02:08.350> better<00:02:09.149> um<00:02:14.250> yeah

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
that much I like this one better um yeah

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.580
