hi my name is Roderick this is my

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.020 
hi my name is Roderick this is my
electric<00:00:05.040> white<00:00:05.279> conversion<00:00:07.790> before<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:08.820> get

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
electric white conversion before I get

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.860 
electric white conversion before I get
to<00:00:09.179> right<00:00:09.330> let's<00:00:09.690> do<00:00:10.500> freak<00:00:10.800> look<00:00:11.599> what<00:00:12.599> is

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
to right let's do freak look what is

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.210 
to right let's do freak look what is
here<00:00:13.340> there<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.960> gearbox<00:00:15.960> which<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.920> made

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
here there is a gearbox which is made

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.490 
here there is a gearbox which is made
from<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.580> components<00:00:18.180> from<00:00:18.359> do<00:00:19.109> all<00:00:19.260> nine

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
from the components from do all nine

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.420 
from the components from do all nine
inches<00:00:19.680> grinder<00:00:20.539> there<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> case<00:00:22.529> box<00:00:22.830> there

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
inches grinder there is a case box there

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.700 
inches grinder there is a case box there
is<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.580> little<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.240> little<00:00:24.539> bit<00:00:24.810> thicker<00:00:25.289> here

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
is a little a little bit thicker here

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.060 
is a little a little bit thicker here
because<00:00:26.250> there<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.550> like<00:00:26.880> bearings<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.070> I

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
because there is like bearings and I

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.640 
because there is like bearings and I
need<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.640> keep<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.660> dimension<00:00:31.230> for<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
need to keep this dimension for the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.959 
need to keep this dimension for the
screw<00:00:31.920> which<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:33.469> mounting<00:00:34.469> my<00:00:34.969> Hawker

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
screw which is mounting my Hawker

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.080 
screw which is mounting my Hawker
brushless<00:00:36.360> motor<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:38.070> now<00:00:38.340> let's<00:00:38.730> take<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.969> look

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
brushless motor so now let's take a look

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.610 
brushless motor so now let's take a look
from<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.719> side<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:41.210> instead<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.450> Griner<00:00:43.079> disc

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
from this side so instead of Griner disc

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.930 
from this side so instead of Griner disc
is<00:00:44.100> Mount<00:00:44.789> pull<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:47.030> polishing<00:00:48.320> belt<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.940> here

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
is Mount pull a polishing belt and here

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.740 
is Mount pull a polishing belt and here
on<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> Central<00:00:51.480> log<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.969> together<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.390> this

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
on the Central log is together with this

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.450 
on the Central log is together with this
break<00:00:55.140> its<00:00:55.410> mount<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.520> mount<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:57.000> big<00:00:57.719> pull<00:00:57.960> a

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
break its mount this mount a big pull a

up<00:01:21.600> there<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:23.340> case<00:01:23.939> with<00:01:24.750> my<00:01:24.960> components

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
up there is a case with my components

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.070 
up there is a case with my components
there<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.189> fans<00:01:26.520> there's<00:01:27.299> only<00:01:27.540> one<00:01:27.659> pan

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
there is like fans there's only one pan

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.330 
there is like fans there's only one pan
which<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:29.570> pulling<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.110> hot<00:01:31.380> air<00:01:31.619> from

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
which is pulling out the hot air from

which is pulling out the hot air from
inside<00:01:32.430> from<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.270> controller<00:01:34.850> there<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
inside from the controller there is a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.880 
inside from the controller there is a
hot<00:01:36.570> meter<00:01:37.700> several<00:01:38.700> tester<00:01:39.240> which<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.200> which

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
hot meter several tester which is which

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.429 
hot meter several tester which is which
have<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> very<00:01:41.790> small<00:01:42.540> modification<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.409> just
