00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello to everything in this tutorial I'm going 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.390
 introduce you to the 3d gel technique 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.639
 many of you asked me for a 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.929
 video for that so that's my first 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:16.080
 mail art I made on my nails 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:18.630
 small Japanese flowers so here we go 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.490
 the ring that I breathe at first so 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.720
 I tried to copy a little bit 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.529
 style of this ring 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.570
 so I laid a base Morocco was so 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.130
 here is the gel three deaths a very gel 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.230
 very special do not believe it is 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.450
 catalyzed 1 it is really very pasty 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.790
 like that in the pot then you will have 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.670
 need alcohol actually cleaner and 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.440
 a brush for 3d gel so everything 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.440
 first we take a little bit of young people 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.570
 3d with the back timpul we drop the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.010
 quantity on the nail 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.960
 so we can do that very well on 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.760
 varnish of resin gel on everything 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.620
 that you want then we try the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.329
 brush in the cleaner is in the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.449
 work a little bit like it was from the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.690
 resin the cleaner replaces the monomer 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.550
 in fact and so we flatten the gel so 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.119
 which is not bad with the gel confirmed 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.979
 the resin is that we have all the time to 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:13.470
 work it since it only catalyzes 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.880
 under lamp so obviously if you have 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.189
 missed you'll just need data from 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.659
 to wipe it well after the inconvenience when 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.500
 we do it a little bit under the varnish 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.299
 is that in fact you see there my 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.770
 varnish becomes a little bit damaged it's 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.570
 because of the dissolving alcohol 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.970
 slightly polish after a while 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.790
 obviously it does not do that like that on 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.700
 wrong notes so here I took the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.950
 second loop of freezing and I'm doing my 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.079
 petals between each petal it takes 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.960
 channel about five seconds under 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.189
 uv lamp not to destroy the other 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.460
 when you are going to do the following well 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.460
 sure 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.280
 so here I did the first ma 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.270
 first flower I make the second one 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.880
 little bit smaller so after how 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.409
 it takes off the gel so the young do not leave 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.720
 not to be surprised that we lug a 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.610
 reside there it takes leem and so me 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.560
 what I did as it's nail polish 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.600
 underneath I removed my last audi 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.820
 sal ans and then it was just enough 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.560
 that I scrape the gel and I blew 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.420
 the flower is not at all damaged my 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.100
 nails and after if there were small 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.410
 residues will you take a lime and you 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.380
 lily but your rest of gel all 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.410
 just it really does not go so white 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.420
 it does not damage the nails at all and the 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.269
 flower that holds your nail polish very well 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.000
 go his notebooks well before the flower does not 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.560
 So take off after you and that jelle 3d 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.480
 it makes an effect anyway pretty vague 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.580
 we can not do a lot of relief 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.280
 with 3d gel unlike resin 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.780
 always this effect quite flat but the 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.519
 result is really different so 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.260
 I have no preference between resin 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.760
 and the gel I like both because 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.410
 it's like comparing watercolor 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.250
 and acrylic is not really 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.739
 all the same so after when I did 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.570
 my flowers I add the heart so for 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.400
 this I make a little ball in the middle 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.150
 then I take my brush well 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.100
 sharp game I tip in the ball and I 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.910
 turn back to create the heart of the 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.910
 flower crushing 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.680
 it's just when you do the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.260
 flowers on the nails well 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.420
 crush your petalas properly by 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.190
 speciation a little off after your 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.170
 hair will take two teeth and there 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.300
 it will tend to damage your 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.870
 flower since it will tear the petals 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.240
 they can break 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.680
 so here I create several flowers for 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.680
 try to imitate the ring 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.830
 then when the pattern is finished so 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.110
 one catalyst three minutes so that can 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.880
 to depend on the frost it is necessary to read on the pot 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.160
 game catalyzes the three minutes and 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.480
 then I clean all my flower no 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.490
 time to remove the little ones 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.290
 color residues that can be and who 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.110
 will come if we do not clean them 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.209
 then I use a matte varnished top coat 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.400
 that I'm going to put on the flowers we do not 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.930
 do not pose a shiny top coat that's fine 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.030
 mess up all the facts you can 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.859
 try but it will be too ugly I will 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.419
 advise either derrien m be put 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.769
 a top automata me I put interpreter 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.960
 my because otherwise the flowers to be 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.340
 dirty and dirt goes between 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.160
 petals and it's really not nice or 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.660
 so that can become so then I have 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.760
 laid a little comfortable top coat behind 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.390
 flowers and I apply mestras so that 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.390
 it's as usual 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.210
 then I added some sheets to 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.100
 the white acrylic paint and then 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.030
 in the golden acrylic I made the 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.030
 ribs of wildlife 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.199
 but 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:59.909
 and then post his finishing top 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:01.529
 around the flowers especially not on them 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.369
 you're opposed to the turn and I you 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:04.739
 advise to put it 

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:06.300
 after last year and not at the beginning 

00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:08.279
 because with the clean air I like you 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.719
 I said earlier sabine varnish 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:11.879
 and becomes a math 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:13.319
 here is I hope this video has you 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:15.949
 I'll see you soon for a 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.949
 next video
