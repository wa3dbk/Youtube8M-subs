just leave it to drape make sure that

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.000 
just leave it to drape make sure that
it's<00:04:06.270> a<00:04:06.570> little<00:04:06.600> bit<00:04:06.870> wet<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.530> you'll

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
it's a little bit wet and that you'll

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.750 
it's a little bit wet and that you'll
kind<00:04:08.370> like<00:04:08.550> attach<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.540> your<00:04:09.570> base<00:04:10.490> so<00:04:11.490> if

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
kind like attach it to your base so if

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.730 
kind like attach it to your base so if
your<00:04:11.970> standards<00:04:12.600> get<00:04:12.750> sticky<00:04:13.080> you<00:04:13.320> can<00:04:13.500> use

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
your standards get sticky you can use

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.490 
your standards get sticky you can use
this<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.880> just<00:04:15.240> pull<00:04:15.570> it<00:04:15.600> a<00:04:15.750> little<00:04:16.049> bit<00:04:16.290> and

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
this and just pull it a little bit and

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.070 
this and just pull it a little bit and
don't<00:04:16.920> try<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.549> manipulate<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.720> too<00:04:18.930> much

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
don't try to manipulate it too much

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.140 
don't try to manipulate it too much
because<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.620> fabric<00:04:20.040> will<00:04:20.250> just<00:04:20.549> follow<00:04:20.820> its

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
because the fabric will just follow its

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.680 
because the fabric will just follow its
natural<00:04:21.390> way<00:04:21.989> of<00:04:22.500> falling<00:04:22.980> down<00:04:23.660> sticky<00:04:24.660> a

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
natural way of falling down sticky a

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.550 
natural way of falling down sticky a
yeah<00:04:26.000> that's<00:04:27.000> what<00:04:27.240> we<00:04:27.360> need<00:04:28.610> but<00:04:29.610> it<00:04:30.030> works

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
yeah that's what we need but it works

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.860 
yeah that's what we need but it works
good<00:04:31.560> because<00:04:32.040> when<00:04:32.640> you<00:04:32.790> let<00:04:33.270> your<00:04:33.390> stand<00:04:33.720> to

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
good because when you let your stand to

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.409 
good because when you let your stand to
dry<00:04:34.050> on<00:04:34.290> the<00:04:34.410> table<00:04:34.830> it<00:04:35.580> won't<00:04:35.850> stick<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.390> it

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
dry on the table it won't stick to it

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.690 
dry on the table it won't stick to it
and<00:04:36.780> I'll<00:04:37.260> let<00:04:37.440> it<00:04:37.470> fall<00:04:37.919> and<00:04:38.190> then<00:04:38.430> make<00:04:38.669> sure

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
and I'll let it fall and then make sure

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.180 
and I'll let it fall and then make sure
that<00:04:38.970> there<00:04:39.390> are<00:04:39.600> about<00:04:39.720> five<00:04:40.169> six<00:04:40.500> layers<00:04:40.890> on

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
that there are about five six layers on

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.890 
that there are about five six layers on
this<00:04:41.370> one<00:04:41.640> that<00:04:41.910> go<00:04:42.120> on<00:04:42.300> top<00:04:42.540> of<00:04:42.690> one<00:04:42.870> another

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
this one that go on top of one another

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.920 
this one that go on top of one another
so<00:04:43.410> if<00:04:44.250> you<00:04:44.460> have<00:04:44.790> if<00:04:45.180> you've<00:04:45.419> turned<00:04:45.720> your

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
so if you have if you've turned your

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.409 
so if you have if you've turned your
statue<00:04:46.260> if<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:47.070> look<00:04:47.250> at<00:04:47.430> it<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:47.760> your<00:04:48.090> first

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
statue if you look at it and your first

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.480 
statue if you look at it and your first
layer<00:04:48.720> is<00:04:48.960> not<00:04:49.140> totally<00:04:49.620> what<00:04:49.770> you<00:04:49.890> want<00:04:50.100> you

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
layer is not totally what you want you

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.940 
layer is not totally what you want you
can<00:04:50.640> always<00:04:50.790> just<00:04:51.180> put<00:04:51.419> one<00:04:51.720> on<00:04:51.960> top<00:04:52.050> of<00:04:52.620> the

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
can always just put one on top of the

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.550 
can always just put one on top of the
other<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.460> it<00:04:54.180> will<00:04:54.270> cover<00:04:54.510> it<00:04:54.720> almost

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
other and it will cover it almost

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.159 
other and it will cover it almost
totally<00:04:56.070> so<00:04:56.490> don't<00:04:56.700> be<00:04:56.850> afraid<00:04:57.210> if<00:04:57.479> some<00:04:58.050> of

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
totally so don't be afraid if some of

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.340 
totally so don't be afraid if some of
the<00:04:58.260> folds<00:04:58.560> are<00:04:58.919> not<00:05:00.080> exactly<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.200> way<00:05:01.290> you

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
the folds are not exactly the way you

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.530 
the folds are not exactly the way you
want<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:01.860> because<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.520> next<00:05:02.790> layer<00:05:03.000> will<00:05:03.240> just

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
want it because the next layer will just

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.330 
want it because the next layer will just
go<00:05:03.720> over<00:05:04.050> it<00:05:04.169> and<00:05:04.350> you<00:05:04.470> drape<00:05:04.770> that<00:05:04.800> over<00:05:05.220> the

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
go over it and you drape that over the

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:15.070 
go over it and you drape that over the
other<00:05:05.460> one

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.510 

so<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.259> top<00:05:16.529> phone<00:05:17.689> you<00:05:18.689> are<00:05:19.399> starting<00:05:20.399> the

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
so the top phone you are starting the

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.760 
so the top phone you are starting the
last<00:05:20.729> layer<00:05:21.119> on<00:05:21.419> you're<00:05:21.599> not<00:05:21.959> you<00:05:22.199> can<00:05:22.469> then<00:05:22.740> I

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
last layer on you're not you can then I

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.339 
last layer on you're not you can then I
would<00:05:23.159> just<00:05:23.399> take<00:05:23.639> smaller<00:05:24.270> pieces<00:05:24.959> like<00:05:25.169> that

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
would just take smaller pieces like that

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.760 
would just take smaller pieces like that
yeah<00:05:25.919> and<00:05:26.069> then<00:05:26.839> the<00:05:27.839> workshop<00:05:28.259> takes<00:05:28.469> about

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
yeah and then the workshop takes about

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.909 
yeah and then the workshop takes about
four<00:05:29.580> sometimes<00:05:30.119> five<00:05:30.389> hours<00:05:30.959> to<00:05:31.139> complete<00:05:31.319> it

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
four sometimes five hours to complete it

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.529 
four sometimes five hours to complete it
depends<00:05:32.459> a<00:05:32.520> little<00:05:32.610> bit<00:05:32.729> on<00:05:32.819> the<00:05:33.029> sculpture

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
depends a little bit on the sculpture

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.730 
depends a little bit on the sculpture
that<00:05:33.719> is<00:05:33.869> made<00:05:34.080> the<00:05:35.039> between<00:05:35.490> shown<00:05:36.059> here<00:05:36.509> is

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
that is made the between shown here is

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.079 
that is made the between shown here is
popular<00:05:37.740> and<00:05:37.979> it<00:05:38.099> demonstrates<00:05:38.669> the

popular and it demonstrates the

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.999 
popular and it demonstrates the
versatility<00:05:39.509> of<00:05:39.719> the<00:05:39.959> fabric<00:05:40.409> harder<00:05:40.709> craft

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
versatility of the fabric harder craft

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:43.219 
versatility of the fabric harder craft
makes<00:05:41.939> you<00:05:42.089> feel<00:05:42.300> like<00:05:42.479> a<00:05:42.509> little<00:05:42.749> kid<00:05:42.869> doesn't
