you'll<00:02:03.830> have<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:04.220> tilt<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.610> machine<00:02:05.210> this<00:02:05.720> way

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
you'll have to tilt the machine this way

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.850 
you'll have to tilt the machine this way
so<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:07.400> have<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.640> tilt<00:02:07.910> it<00:02:08.060> don't<00:02:08.570> do<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:08.929> all

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
so you have to tilt it don't do it all

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.900 
so you have to tilt it don't do it all
right<00:02:10.190> okay<00:02:14.110> now<00:02:15.110> as<00:02:15.410> as<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.310> can<00:02:16.520> see<00:02:16.730> I'm

right okay now as as you can see I'm
hoping<00:02:17.390> that<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.630> can<00:02:17.720> see<00:02:18.200> this<00:02:18.380> hair<00:02:18.850> now<00:02:19.850> as

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
hoping that you can see this hair now as

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.820 
hoping that you can see this hair now as
you<00:02:20.420> can<00:02:20.570> see<00:02:20.630> I'll<00:02:21.260> just<00:02:23.080> find<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.380> spot<00:02:24.650> and

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
you can see I'll just find the spot and

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.850 
you can see I'll just find the spot and
