00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:11.070
 hi to all ragatzu al welcome in 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:13.110
 this video his pc intermezzo between the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.150
 fifth episode is the sixth then 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.660
 the episode 5.1 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.890
 as you know yesterday there was my video 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.779
 was loaded on the page and me 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.150
 always sorry for the last part of the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.640
 video in which unfortunately I could not hold the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.500
 comparison with more than but in the end 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.719
 the important thing was to make them understand more or less 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.600
 as was done with the best team that 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.520
 there was now on the game 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.460
 today instead we go to see mine 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.190
 hawk's eye that I have to try to 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.140
 leveling then developing skills not 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.789
 I'll wait and power hub of the skill because 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.289
 although there were three four days I 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.480
 I'm a person in unfortunately not 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.460
 can wait then let's go e 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.530
 maybe I can even kill him too 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.449
 normally not so much for fencing 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.980
 as much as the level that does not make it 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.020
 I'll do it now but maybe tomorrow 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.559
 the next day more important to go to 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.240
 see if I can drain or not 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.130
 from now on I give you access to these 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.780
 are my nioc that I took are one 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:16.710
 thirty new york up and down now 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.950
 so let's try to level the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.950
 skill 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.390
 then 5 10 15 20 25 30 I would say that I try 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.100
 to do it this way three at a time 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.090
 so at least I can make a dozen 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:41.299
 power we see how we are made 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:43.549
 attention nothing this has not had 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:55.490
 effects so let's go next here 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:57.170
 three now we ask for nothing either 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.539
 bring bad luck on this character is 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.459
 cow boy is back 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:12.849
 we see from the from the from from the from from 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:12.849
 come on or nothing again 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.650
 or 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:36.170
 or level 6 beda is good and right thing 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:45.350
 at least we take with these we put a 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:48.560
 little created so nothing we see how many 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:53.960
 there are still 15 15 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:59.740
 yes give us we can try to do 4 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.740
 let's see if something changes or attention 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.450
 that bad luck has sinned sin 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:20.590
 the important thing is to get closer to a max 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.590
 at least from others to mine at least 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.030
 give at least a lot of skill to the level 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:36.200
 7 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:38.920
 we got it we see this 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.920
 success 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:50.580
 oh oh my 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.010
 great grandiose 21 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.180
 he wanted us here if he gave me a style a 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.750
 level 10 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:02.840
 I am more than happy more than 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.840
 satisfied by the by the by the by the da 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:11.780
 and we are there and we are there 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:15.240
 great grandiose a goes so well 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.630
 also have it at level 10 to the next 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.209
 miur will carry it on 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.530
 and here it is in 23 turns so even though 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.410
 not having their own well or even two 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.800
 days less and already it is a lot but a lot but 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.440
 much easier to be able to do it with 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.780
 miur but really much simpler 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.990
 also because in any case up to 20 shifts 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.300
 Basically every sky character manages to 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.650
 bring because anyway if one wants 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.440
 advance well as we saw yesterday 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.600
 in new york if it stays for many shifts 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.760
 manages to make a quiet sanction 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.660
 to go on even for 45 days from 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.310
 those levels so still have three 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.520
 the saying comes back in a very short time 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.010
 lose a little more time but at least there 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.510
 we have been one thing we say that 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:05.160
 my base was to reach at least 12 13 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.560
 as a skill level but also ten 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.350
 I'm not complaining about you guys 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.870
 the video is finished thanks for being 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.180
 been with me in this mini coupe of mine 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.230
 precisely civic to those first but unfortunately 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.310
 sex like that 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:23.490
 and I tell you that to free him at level 10 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:27.450
 I put into it the beauty of 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:30.050
 60 miur then 60 falcon eyes in the 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:34.599
 first i took e 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.599
 I had apparently 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:42.500
 the bad luck we can say so 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.770
 in short, every sign a power is gone 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.439
 so 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.710
 we will wait for the next one that can in fact 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:47.710
 hello everyone guys
