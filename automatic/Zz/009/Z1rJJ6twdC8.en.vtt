hi this is Melissa with stitch Singh

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.529 
hi this is Melissa with stitch Singh
Kham<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.189> I'm<00:00:20.640> going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.849> demonstrate<00:00:21.000> how<00:00:21.510> to

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
Kham and I'm going to demonstrate how to

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.690 
Kham and I'm going to demonstrate how to
make<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.080> loop<00:00:22.260> stitch<00:00:22.590> it's<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.340> really

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
make the loop stitch it's a really

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.279 
make the loop stitch it's a really
simple<00:00:23.910> stitch<00:00:24.300> once<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.720> get<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> hang<00:00:24.990> of

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
simple stitch once you get the hang of

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.050 
simple stitch once you get the hang of
it<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:26.189> can<00:00:26.550> use<00:00:27.450> it<00:00:28.079> in<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.590> round<00:00:28.800> or<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.789> can

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
it you can use it in a round or you can

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.179 
it you can use it in a round or you can
use<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.270> work<00:00:30.599> back<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.050> forth<00:00:31.110> flat<00:00:31.650> it

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
use it work back and forth flat it

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.619 
use it work back and forth flat it
really<00:00:32.460> doesn't<00:00:32.760> matter<00:00:32.879> what<00:00:33.150> you<00:00:33.210> have<00:00:33.449> to

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
really doesn't matter what you have to

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.060 
really doesn't matter what you have to
remember<00:00:33.780> though<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.350> your<00:00:34.590> loops<00:00:34.830> are

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
remember though is that your loops are

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.310 
remember though is that your loops are
going<00:00:35.129> to<00:00:35.250> be<00:00:35.370> created<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.660> back<00:00:36.870> side<00:00:37.140> of

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
going to be created on the back side of

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.689 
going to be created on the back side of
your<00:00:37.440> work<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.890> want<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.220> keep<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.550> in

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
your work so you want to keep that in

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.290 
your work so you want to keep that in
mind<00:00:38.970> for<00:00:39.500> right<00:00:40.500> side<00:00:40.830> and<00:00:41.220> wrong<00:00:41.489> side<00:00:41.910> rows

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
mind for right side and wrong side rows

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.560 
mind for right side and wrong side rows
or<00:00:42.660> rounds<00:00:43.339> so<00:00:44.339> we<00:00:44.460> begin<00:00:44.850> by<00:00:44.910> having<00:00:45.269> our

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
or rounds so we begin by having our

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.990 
or rounds so we begin by having our
working<00:00:45.839> yarn<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:47.339> need<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.610> pick<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.910> up

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
working yarn and we need to pick it up

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.090 
working yarn and we need to pick it up
with<00:00:48.210> our<00:00:48.329> index<00:00:48.629> finger<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.260> think<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.920> is

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
with our index finger I think this is

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.860 
with our index finger I think this is
the<00:00:50.340> most<00:00:50.550> common<00:00:50.969> way<00:00:51.090> people<00:00:51.120> hold<00:00:51.660> their

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the most common way people hold their

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.939 
the most common way people hold their
yarn<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.260> if<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.530> not<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.870> necessary<00:00:54.949> to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
yarn but if it's not it is necessary to

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.310 
yarn but if it's not it is necessary to
do<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.280> stitch<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.020> so<00:00:58.020> you're<00:00:58.140> going<00:00:58.260> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
do this stitch and so you're going to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.840 
do this stitch and so you're going to
begin<00:00:58.590> by<00:00:58.739> inserting<00:00:59.129> your<00:00:59.280> hook<00:00:59.520> into<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
begin by inserting your hook into the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.799 
begin by inserting your hook into the
next<00:00:59.879> stitch<00:01:00.710> you're<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.890> go<00:01:01.980> behind

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
next stitch you're going to go behind

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.910 
next stitch you're going to go behind
yarn<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.110> you're<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.350> grab<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.770> yarn

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
yarn and you're going to grab the yarn

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.580 
yarn and you're going to grab the yarn
that<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.190> farthest<00:01:05.729> from<00:01:05.759> the<00:01:06.060> hook<00:01:06.560> pull<00:01:07.560> it

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
that is farthest from the hook pull it

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.650 
that is farthest from the hook pull it
through<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:11.060> work<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.450> single<00:01:12.630> crochet

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
through and work is for single crochet

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.480 
through and work is for single crochet
and<00:01:15.660> you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:16.320> see<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> loop<00:01:17.070> was<00:01:17.310> made

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
and you can see that the loop was made

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.550 
and you can see that the loop was made
on<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> back<00:01:17.910> side<00:01:18.210> now<00:01:18.720> these<00:01:18.960> loops<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.500> be

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
on the back side now these loops can be

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.260 
on the back side now these loops can be
cut<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.909> fringe<00:01:21.350> without<00:01:23.270> unraveling

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
cut to have fringe without unraveling

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.480 
cut to have fringe without unraveling
your<00:01:24.299> whole<00:01:24.659> entire<00:01:24.840> work<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:26.040> that's<00:01:26.159> really

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
your whole entire work so that's really

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.080 
your whole entire work so that's really
nice

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
nice

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.800 
nice
and<00:01:27.210> as<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:28.080> unique<00:01:28.740> textural<00:01:29.479> element<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.659> your

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and as a unique textural element to your

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.420 
and as a unique textural element to your
design<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.470> let's<00:01:31.650> try<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:31.920> again<00:01:32.070> let's

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
design so let's try it again let's

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.580 
design so let's try it again let's
insert<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> hook<00:01:33.060> into<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.360> stitch<00:01:33.590> we're

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
insert the hook into the stitch we're

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.260 
insert the hook into the stitch we're
going<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.829> go<00:01:34.950> behind<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.460> yarn<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.939> grab<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
going to go behind the yarn and grab the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.780 
going to go behind the yarn and grab the
yarn<00:01:36.420> farthest<00:01:37.170> from<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.950> hook<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.400> pull

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
yarn farthest from the hook and pull

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.929 
yarn farthest from the hook and pull
through<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:41.390> work<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.570> for<00:01:42.750> single<00:01:42.930> crochet

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
through and work is for single crochet

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.780 
through and work is for single crochet
and<00:01:44.939> again<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.390> second<00:01:45.780> loop<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.110> made<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:47.490> can

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and again a second loop is made you can

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.940 
and again a second loop is made you can
adjust<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.979> size<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.460> your<00:01:50.520> loops<00:01:51.829> and<00:01:52.829> I'll

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
adjust the size of your loops and I'll

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.310 
adjust the size of your loops and I'll
show<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.189> how<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.549> grab<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.329> working<00:01:55.290> yarn

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
show you how you grab that working yarn

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.800 
show you how you grab that working yarn
farthest<00:01:56.070> from<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.310> hoop<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.850> now<00:01:57.540> would<00:01:57.780> be

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
farthest from the hoop and now would be

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.450 
farthest from the hoop and now would be
the<00:01:57.930> time<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.290> adjust<00:01:58.860> if<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.100> want<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.369> make

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
the time to adjust if you want to make

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.010 
the time to adjust if you want to make
it<00:01:59.579> longer<00:01:59.820> you're<00:02:00.180> simply<00:02:00.479> going<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.659> pull

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
it longer you're simply going to pull

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.830 
it longer you're simply going to pull
your<00:02:01.229> finger<00:02:01.680> out<00:02:01.820> farther<00:02:02.820> away<00:02:03.180> from<00:02:03.390> your

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
your finger out farther away from your

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.630 
your finger out farther away from your
work<00:02:04.049> if<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.710> wanted<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.009> make<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.159> smaller

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
work if you wanted to make it smaller

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.660 
work if you wanted to make it smaller
you<00:02:05.850> would<00:02:06.149> simply<00:02:06.509> kind<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.780> pull<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.229> pull<00:02:07.670> it

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
you would simply kind of pull it pull it

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.460 
you would simply kind of pull it pull it
in<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.470> then<00:02:11.600> then<00:02:12.600> work<00:02:12.870> your<00:02:13.079> single

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
in and then then work your single

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.460 
in and then then work your single
crochet<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:15.209> have<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.510> smaller<00:02:15.870> size<00:02:16.170> loop

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470
