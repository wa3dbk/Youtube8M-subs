okay by zfy to mode there's a couple of

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.720 
okay by zfy to mode there's a couple of
switches<00:02:19.409> there's<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:19.769> small<00:02:20.040> switch<00:02:20.310> which<00:02:20.549> is

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
switches there's a small switch which is

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.420 
switches there's a small switch which is
the<00:02:20.909> tone<00:02:21.180> switch<00:02:21.480> for<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.049> sacrifice<00:02:22.650> add<00:02:23.370> a

the tone switch for the sacrifice add a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.699 
the tone switch for the sacrifice add a
big<00:02:23.670> switch<00:02:23.939> which<00:02:24.239> selects<00:02:24.810> super<00:02:25.140> fast<00:02:25.470> and

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
big switch which selects super fast and

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.830 
big switch which selects super fast and
well<00:02:25.799> companion<00:02:26.220> for<00:02:26.400> us<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.329> takes<00:02:27.540> any

well companion for us so it takes any
missing<00:02:28.409> fuzz

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.980 

got<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.480> much<00:02:33.640> richer<00:02:34.640> sounding<00:02:35.420> fast<00:02:35.720> there's

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
got a much richer sounding fast there's

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:54.320 
got a much richer sounding fast there's
a<00:02:36.050> lot<00:02:36.200> more<00:02:36.380> going<00:02:36.530> on<00:02:36.770> with<00:02:36.950> it

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.450 

and<00:02:55.330> as<00:02:55.599> to<00:02:56.080> controls<00:02:56.439> it's<00:02:56.590> got<00:02:56.769> volume

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
and as to controls it's got volume

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:06.090 
and as to controls it's got volume
just<00:02:59.180> shared<00:02:59.450> for<00:02:59.660> both<00:02:59.810> of<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.080> pedals<00:03:00.440> and

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.120 

expander<00:03:07.100> which<00:03:07.460> is<00:03:07.700> sort<00:03:08.450> of<00:03:08.570> like<00:03:08.810> fuzz<00:03:09.170> and

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
expander which is sort of like fuzz and

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.150 
expander which is sort of like fuzz and
then<00:03:10.790> it's<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.540> gets<00:03:11.720> thicker<00:03:12.290> as<00:03:12.650> you<00:03:12.800> turn<00:03:13.130> it

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
then it's it gets thicker as you turn it

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:39.320 
then it's it gets thicker as you turn it
up

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.940 

and<00:03:40.330> there's<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:40.960> few<00:03:41.140> sort<00:03:41.320> of<00:03:41.380> ring<00:03:41.650> Modi

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
and there's a few sort of ring Modi

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.800 
and there's a few sort of ring Modi
sounds<00:03:42.550> in<00:03:42.670> there<00:03:42.850> that<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:43.150> can<00:03:43.300> get<00:03:43.450> out<00:03:43.510> of

sounds in there that you can get out of

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.160 
sounds in there that you can get out of
it

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170
