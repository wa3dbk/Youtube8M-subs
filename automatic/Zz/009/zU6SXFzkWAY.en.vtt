 on the eve of the new season autoportal 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.550
 visited very gandhi where nokian company 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.560
 Tires presented to the journalists of the summer 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.230
 tires for crossovers and SUVs 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.390
 how to black is you with them from kabul 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.489
 in the autumn it is the newest summer tires 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.180
 designed specifically for cars 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.370
 suv class 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.129
 given the popularity of SUVs and 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.140
 crossovers in Ukraine are sure a lot 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.330
 it will be interesting and important to know what 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.680
 are new nokian tires 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.300
 hakka black a heavy 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.220
 are modern and in some 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.979
 sense of unique work 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.449
 from the tire concern nokian tires with 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.640
 the creation of these tires took into account the requirements 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.830
 SUV security owners 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.049
 extreme conditions of comfort and 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.110
 Blake Series tire strengths are designed 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.280
 for large SUVs size from 17 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.760
 up to 22 inches 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.220
 speed index 240 270 and even 300 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.500
 kilometers per hour as cable in i-7 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.950
 created for popular small and 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.369
 medium SUVs size from 15 to 18 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.290
 inches 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.380
 speed index 190 210 and 240 kilometers 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.380
 at one o'clock 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.170
 black azure 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.700
 ebla with julia have a distinctive icon on 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.950
 armor 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.320
 he talks about the use of aramid 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.570
 fibers that make the sidewall more 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.790
 reliable and resistant to sudden impact and 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.370
 cut look at this experiment 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.830
 on there is a curb on speed 60 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.900
 kilometers per hour while slowing down you can 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.430
 see how the tire behaves merit 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.270
 strength is in the rubber 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.400
 blends where aramid fibers are applied 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.410
 resistant to wear and cut of this 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.370
 Fiber is made not only airborne 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.250
 ring and bur 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.050
 but the entire tire sidewall to the word aramid 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:24.050
 used in aviation and military 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:26.090
 industry both tire models have 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.550
 feather grooves they are designed to enhance 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.250
 safety on particular wet roads 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.610
 these grooves cut through the ribs 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.350
 central zone 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.600
 effectively accumulate water and 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.670
 It sends it to its longitudinal grooves 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.890
 turn the expanding grooves not 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.450
 allow aquaplaning even on 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.060
 high speeds they literally 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.570
 pump out water like a pump and quickly and 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.250
 effectively removing from the contact patch 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.820
 Separately it is necessary to say about the grooves sun 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.130
 in group 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.650
 they resemble a hollow on the surface 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.959
 golf ball this innovation reduces 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.090
 interior noise level and ambient noise 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.340
 while driving and also reduces 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.800
 air resistance and contribute 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.230
 cooling the surface of the tire on ours 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.150
 Roads of course will be a little different but 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.890
 I can say that on the Finnish slopes with 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.650
 driving on a diesel Mercedes for speed 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.870
 80 kilometers per hour tires literally 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.940
 rustling had to open the windows 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.890
 to understand all the soundproofing matters 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.200
 car itself or really 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.360
 slow speeds when changing cars 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.550
 It turned out that the reason is in the tires 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.760
 lovers of fast and aggressive driving 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.100
 note that their akaba and hakka black 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.940
 applied rubber compound tread with 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.650
 using 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.350
 expanding molecular structure 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.910
 silica she allows tires to keep 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.500
 support rigidity 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.780
 reliable contact with the road 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.310
 even when driving at high speed and 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.440
 cornering 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.420
 Of course in extremely difficult to find tracks 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.640
 which allow you to test tires since 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.260
 Finns do it but with all 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.900
 responsibility, I can say that black 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.060
 the soup is very clear obedient tires 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.100
 the black series fits better and more 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.350
 heavy cars such as volkswagen 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.870
 touareg mersedesovsky cube and toyota 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.420
 land cruiser even such large cars 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.190
 black &amp; heavy gives sports 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.770
 character we have seen during 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.900
 Tuareg ride wide massive ribs 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.300
 tread make it less susceptible 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.910
 deformation and reduces the movement of drafts 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.380
 drawing during contact with the road 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.000
 allowing you to screw in a heavy crossover in 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.850
 turning with a minimum of effort 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.470
 blue series for smaller cars but this one 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.660
 the model also improves the car's response 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.700
 on the handling of the wheel on a wet surface 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.220
 in the corners of the track it became obvious that 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.840
 fucking able to resist 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.390
 unwanted drift and drift though 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.400
 drawing their purpose they are not so 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.919
 aimed sports style as black 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.510
 Syria but it is logical kind of one of 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.310
 The key virtues of my syria is 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.290
 excellent wet handling 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.169
 surfaces and this is true 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.970
 It is important to note the presence of lugs as 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.919
 showed honesty on the ground new 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.780
 tires give good acceleration and braking on 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.610
 sandy roads and soft roads 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.500
 coatings on the site 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.360
 rally race also dallas rate 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.400
 work remove or and stones main 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.560
 tread grooves they prevent 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.250
 hit of stones in the groove and checkers 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.050
 tread 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.330
 which in turn increases strength 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.310
 tires and what is really there to please others 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.770
 road users towards 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.720
 which do not fly these same stones from 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.490
 under the wheels due to the strength of the new 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.110
 summer tires are able to provide 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.870
 safety on the Ukrainian roads 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.480
 even if the car owner is not used to reduce 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.590
 speed before humps and holes 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.270
 Manageability is also at a high level 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.000
 which way can envy 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.790
 many hakka black ice competitors 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.680
 canceled 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.840
 not tires for sports porsche cayenne 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.270
 charged Mercedes and other expensive 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.700
 Cars for Nissan Juke and Renault Duster 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:43.160
 for example given the characteristics of a budget 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.160
 purchases better fit as cable is yuri
