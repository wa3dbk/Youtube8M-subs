00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.850 
sound quality is more important to the
looks<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.899> must<00:01:52.110> say<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.350> appearance<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
looks I must say the appearance of the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.800 
looks I must say the appearance of the
guitar<00:01:53.130> was<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.340> higher<00:01:53.490> priority<00:01:53.759> as<00:01:54.060> well<00:01:54.329> but

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
guitar was a higher priority as well but

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.560 
guitar was a higher priority as well but
this<00:01:55.350> guitar<00:01:55.740> sounds<00:01:56.130> great<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:57.210> know<00:01:57.299> for

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
this guitar sounds great you know for

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.330 
this guitar sounds great you know for
for<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> cheaper<00:01:58.320> guitar<00:01:58.680> became<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.130> case

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
for a cheaper guitar became the case

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.370 
for a cheaper guitar became the case
this<00:01:59.610> guitar<00:02:00.030> was<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.329> really<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> pleasant

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
this guitar was a really a pleasant

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.280 
this guitar was a really a pleasant
surprise<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:03.030> case<00:02:03.240> was<00:02:03.390> great<00:02:03.659> with<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> clean

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
surprise the case was great with a clean

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.800 
surprise the case was great with a clean
body<00:02:04.500> good<00:02:04.950> finish<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.610> only<00:02:06.060> travel<00:02:06.299> was<00:02:06.630> when

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
body good finish I only travel was when

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.330 
body good finish I only travel was when
I<00:02:06.840> was<00:02:07.079> changing<00:02:07.320> strings<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.039> seemed<00:02:08.250> a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
I was changing strings it seemed a

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.609 
I was changing strings it seemed a
little<00:02:08.459> bit<00:02:08.610> difficult<00:02:08.929> but<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.989> guess<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.440> part

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
little bit difficult but I guess a part

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.030 
little bit difficult but I guess a part
is<00:02:10.860> probably<00:02:11.009> operator<00:02:11.550> error

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
is probably operator error

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.530 
is probably operator error
that<00:02:12.159> never<00:02:12.340> really<00:02:12.519> changed<00:02:12.969> guitar<00:02:13.239> strings

really<00:02:17.859> does<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.159> trick<00:02:18.189> and<00:02:18.549> I<00:02:18.609> just<00:02:18.640> can't

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:18.969 
really does the trick and I just can't

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.449 
really does the trick and I just can't

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
of the lower quality guitars do you know

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:18.809 
of the lower quality guitars do you know
I<00:03:17.440> think<00:03:17.500> this<00:03:17.739> guitar<00:03:18.069> list<00:03:18.310> stands<00:03:18.549> out

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
I think this guitar list stands out

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.229 
I think this guitar list stands out
among<00:03:19.329> any<00:03:20.019> entry<00:03:20.680> level<00:03:20.709> guitar<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.579> it

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
among any entry level guitar and it

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.849 
among any entry level guitar and it
would<00:03:22.329> probably<00:03:22.540> probably<00:03:23.139> stand<00:03:23.470> up<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.829> a

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
would probably probably stand up to a

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.860 
would probably probably stand up to a
lot<00:03:24.069> of<00:03:24.099> considerably<00:03:24.940> more<00:03:25.090> expensive<00:03:25.150> you

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
lot of considerably more expensive you

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.199 
lot of considerably more expensive you
know<00:03:25.989> instruments<00:03:26.590> so<00:03:27.040> this<00:03:27.940> is<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.090> good

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
know instruments so this is a good

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.610 
know instruments so this is a good
guitar<00:03:28.329> and<00:03:28.810> should<00:03:28.930> last<00:03:28.959> me<00:03:29.199> for<00:03:29.440> many<00:03:29.560> years

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
guitar and should last me for many years

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.110 
guitar and should last me for many years
