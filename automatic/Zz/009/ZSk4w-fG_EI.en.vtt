 damping piloted test this is it 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.009
 system that we find yet on

 many models of the group arrives 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.970
 for the first time at skoda 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:11.680
 with laws specific to philosophy 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.380
 brand ie type and 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.630
 flexibility the three amortization laws 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.370
 normal comfort and sport are here 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.200

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.720
 enough differences to be 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.940
 fully appreciate even the sport mode 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.890
 stays comfortable with a suspension 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.260
 firm up just enough for 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.549
 limit vertical deflections and 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.290
 stop the road starts from 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.790
 120 kilometers per hour is collected 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.260
 however, some aerodynamic noises 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.030
 and rolling 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.420
 knowing that our test models was 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.340
 equipped with optional wheels of 18 inches 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.890
 in diesel we tried version 2 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.140
 tdi liters of 190 hp with box 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.910
 six-speed manual that provides 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.549
 level of performance particularly 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.530
 appreciable the 0 to 100 km time is 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.660
 so shot down eight seconds and his 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.570
 average consumption is reasonable 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.340
 with 7 liters per 100 km we note 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.040
 however a slight dip before the arrival 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.470
 of peak torque at 1,750 rpm 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.680
 which often requires downgrading 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.840
 or to remain patient in the end knowing 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.870
 that a box again passade starts at 28000 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.630
 720 euros with the same engine and 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.019
 that a Peugeot 508 goals to 27 1700 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.390
 euros with a liter 6 hdi 120 equivalent 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.560
 the superb has all the cards in hand 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.560
 to shake up the market
