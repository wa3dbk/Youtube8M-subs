question about nutrition I'm concerned

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.249 
question about nutrition I'm concerned
that<00:00:10.910> I'm<00:00:10.999> not<00:00:11.209> getting<00:00:11.539> enough<00:00:11.780> protein<00:00:11.959> for

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
that I'm not getting enough protein for

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.319 
that I'm not getting enough protein for
the<00:00:12.530> amount<00:00:12.679> of<00:00:12.799> work<00:00:12.950> i'm<00:00:13.190> putting<00:00:13.490> in<00:00:13.579> i<00:00:13.820> take

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:14.329 
the amount of work i'm putting in i take

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.150 
the amount of work i'm putting in i take
protein<00:00:14.659> drink<00:00:14.900> every<00:00:15.169> day<00:00:15.320> from<00:00:15.740> the<00:00:15.860> protein

powder mix the milk on the hardest
workout<00:00:18.260> days<00:00:18.500> i<00:00:18.710> will<00:00:18.800> do<00:00:18.980> two<00:00:19.250> protein

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
workout days i will do two protein

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.700 
workout days i will do two protein
drinks<00:00:19.970> it's<00:00:20.420> okay<00:00:20.750> or<00:00:21.080> should<00:00:21.110> i<00:00:21.320> add<00:00:21.440> more

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
drinks it's okay or should i add more

Thank<00:00:24.200> You<00:00:24.320> Derek<00:00:24.680> so<00:00:27.970> the<00:00:28.970> question<00:00:29.180> of<00:00:29.570> how

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
Thank You Derek so the question of how

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.250 
Thank You Derek so the question of how
much<00:00:30.050> protein<00:00:30.560> you<00:00:31.100> actually<00:00:31.850> need<00:00:32.240> to<00:00:32.599> take

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
much protein you actually need to take

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.450 
much protein you actually need to take
is<00:00:33.640> a<00:00:34.840> little<00:00:35.840> more<00:00:36.020> complex<00:00:36.680> than<00:00:37.040> what<00:00:37.280> most

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
is a little more complex than what most

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.420 
is a little more complex than what most
people<00:00:37.910> would<00:00:38.060> say<00:00:38.329> and<00:00:38.540> here's<00:00:39.110> why<00:00:39.340> you<00:00:40.340> know

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
people would say and here's why you know

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.670 
people would say and here's why you know
if<00:00:40.610> you're<00:00:40.790> really<00:00:41.210> going<00:00:41.480> to<00:00:41.570> make<00:00:41.810> you<00:00:42.590> know

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
if you're really going to make you know

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.810 
if you're really going to make you know
if<00:00:42.770> we<00:00:42.860> were<00:00:42.950> really<00:00:43.190> going<00:00:43.400> to<00:00:43.489> make<00:00:43.670> an

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
if we were really going to make an

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.880 
if we were really going to make an
estimate<00:00:44.060> on<00:00:44.570> how<00:00:44.630> much<00:00:44.840> protein<00:00:45.200> you<00:00:45.530> need<00:00:45.710> it

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
estimate on how much protein you need it

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.670 
estimate on how much protein you need it
we<00:00:46.550> need<00:00:46.579> to<00:00:46.910> know<00:00:47.060> first<00:00:47.360> of<00:00:47.570> all<00:00:47.750> your<00:00:48.260> lean

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
we need to know first of all your lean

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.960 
we need to know first of all your lean
muscle<00:00:49.100> mass<00:00:50.020> because<00:00:51.020> I<00:00:51.320> mean<00:00:51.940> for<00:00:52.940> example

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
muscle mass because I mean for example

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.330 
muscle mass because I mean for example
you<00:00:53.300> if<00:00:53.570> you<00:00:53.720> try<00:00:54.020> to<00:00:54.050> prescribe<00:00:54.739> someone<00:00:55.250> how

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
you if you try to prescribe someone how

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.680 
you if you try to prescribe someone how
much<00:00:55.399> protein<00:00:55.700> they<00:00:55.970> need<00:00:56.120> to<00:00:56.210> buy<00:00:56.329> this<00:00:56.390> body

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
much protein they need to buy this body

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.930 
much protein they need to buy this body
weight<00:00:56.960> a<00:00:57.140> lot<00:00:57.649> of<00:00:57.770> that<00:00:57.860> might<00:00:58.010> be<00:00:58.130> fat<00:00:58.370> a<00:00:58.640> lot

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
weight a lot of that might be fat a lot

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.420 
weight a lot of that might be fat a lot
of<00:00:58.969> that<00:00:59.120> might<00:00:59.300> be<00:00:59.450> bone<00:00:59.690> density<00:01:00.200> so<00:01:00.469> lean

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
of that might be bone density so lean

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.130 
of that might be bone density so lean
muscle<00:01:01.790> mass<00:01:01.820> is<00:01:02.210> basically<00:01:02.750> what's<00:01:02.899> going<00:01:03.079> to

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
muscle mass is basically what's going to

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.439 
muscle mass is basically what's going to
be<00:01:03.230> consuming<00:01:03.770> the<00:01:03.860> protein<00:01:04.280> or<00:01:04.460> would<00:01:05.180> need

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
be consuming the protein or would need

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.570 
be consuming the protein or would need
to<00:01:05.720> consume<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:06.290> protein<00:01:06.680> I<00:01:06.860> mean<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:07.400> that's

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
to consume the protein I mean so that's

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.670 
to consume the protein I mean so that's
one<00:01:07.790> thing<00:01:08.030> that<00:01:08.540> that<00:01:09.229> you<00:01:09.350> would<00:01:09.470> want<00:01:09.560> to

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
one thing that that you would want to

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.710 
one thing that that you would want to
know<00:01:09.880> another<00:01:10.880> thing<00:01:11.000> that<00:01:11.299> you<00:01:11.330> would<00:01:11.510> want

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
know another thing that you would want

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.660 
know another thing that you would want
to<00:01:11.780> know<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.500> by<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:12.740> way<00:01:12.979> i'm<00:01:13.130> going<00:01:13.370> to<00:01:13.520> give

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
to know and by the way i'm going to give

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.310 
to know and by the way i'm going to give
you<00:01:13.700> another<00:01:13.909> answer<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:14.690> don't<00:01:14.840> have<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.200> go

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
you another answer you don't have to go

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.620 
you another answer you don't have to go
do<00:01:15.530> all<00:01:15.680> this<00:01:15.860> stuff<00:01:16.060> so<00:01:17.060> another<00:01:17.299> thing<00:01:17.420> you

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
do all this stuff so another thing you

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.210 
do all this stuff so another thing you
wouldn't<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:18.440> would<00:01:18.560> want<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:18.799> know<00:01:18.890> is<00:01:19.040> what

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
wouldn't you would want to know is what

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.590 
wouldn't you would want to know is what
your<00:01:19.369> metabolic<00:01:19.670> rate<00:01:20.000> your<00:01:20.360> metabolic

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
your metabolic rate your metabolic

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.200 
your metabolic rate your metabolic
expenditure<00:01:21.409> is<00:01:21.560> you<00:01:22.159> know<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.610> how<00:01:22.700> busy<00:01:23.119> you

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
expenditure is you know and how busy you

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.670 
expenditure is you know and how busy you
are<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:23.420> how<00:01:23.659> much<00:01:23.720> you're<00:01:24.080> working<00:01:24.440> other

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
are and how much you're working other

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.180 
are and how much you're working other
than<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.100> workout<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:26.710> another<00:01:27.710> thing<00:01:27.830> is

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
than the workout and another thing is

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.230 
than the workout and another thing is
not<00:01:28.880> everyone<00:01:29.390> absorbs<00:01:30.490> equally<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.760> protein

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
not everyone absorbs equally the protein

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.039 
not everyone absorbs equally the protein
they<00:01:32.450> do<00:01:32.510> eat<00:01:32.840> or<00:01:33.740> drink<00:01:34.270> so<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.299> mean<00:01:35.510> some<00:01:35.750> some

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
they do eat or drink so I mean some some

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.260 
they do eat or drink so I mean some some
people<00:01:36.380> might<00:01:36.979> take<00:01:37.250> protein<00:01:37.670> and<00:01:37.970> they<00:01:38.060> might

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
people might take protein and they might

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.179 
people might take protein and they might
just<00:01:38.420> pass<00:01:38.750> it<00:01:39.020> on<00:01:39.140> through<00:01:39.439> peepee<00:01:39.979> poo-poo

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
just pass it on through peepee poo-poo

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.410 
just pass it on through peepee poo-poo
right<00:01:40.670> on<00:01:40.850> through<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:41.330> so<00:01:42.340> that<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:44.090> also

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
right on through and so that that also

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.980 
right on through and so that that also
happens<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.280> what<00:01:46.280> I<00:01:46.330> my<00:01:47.330> philosophy<00:01:47.960> on

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
happens so what I my philosophy on

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.350 
happens so what I my philosophy on
protein<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.740> mean<00:01:48.979> for<00:01:49.220> people<00:01:49.670> who<00:01:50.000> say<00:01:50.180> they

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
protein I mean for people who say they

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.300 
protein I mean for people who say they
have<00:01:50.509> an<00:01:50.900> exact<00:01:51.320> science<00:01:51.560> of<00:01:51.950> how<00:01:52.130> much

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
have an exact science of how much

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.160 
have an exact science of how much
protein<00:01:52.520> they<00:01:53.000> say<00:01:53.180> oh<00:01:53.210> you<00:01:53.330> weigh<00:01:53.600> 150<00:01:54.140> pounds

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.770 
protein they say oh you weigh 150 pounds
we<00:01:54.619> need<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.890> get<00:01:55.070> you<00:01:55.340> know<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.240> much<00:01:56.390> per<00:01:56.600> body

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
we need to get you know so much per body

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.710 
we need to get you know so much per body
weight<00:01:57.020> whatever<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:58.340> know<00:01:58.400> that<00:01:59.299> that<00:01:59.570> might

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
weight whatever you know that that might

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.630 
weight whatever you know that that might
be<00:01:59.900> a<00:01:59.930> good<00:02:00.200> guideline<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:01.250> that's<00:02:01.430> something

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
be a good guideline and that's something

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.370 
be a good guideline and that's something
that<00:02:01.759> we<00:02:02.000> give<00:02:02.210> as<00:02:02.420> well<00:02:02.450> some<00:02:03.079> people<00:02:03.290> say

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
that we give as well some people say

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.969 
that we give as well some people say
well<00:02:03.530> that's<00:02:03.650> too<00:02:03.799> much<00:02:04.040> or<00:02:04.390> whatever<00:02:05.390> but

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
well that's too much or whatever but

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.490 
well that's too much or whatever but
it's<00:02:06.979> better<00:02:07.430> to<00:02:07.759> err<00:02:07.970> on<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.450> side<00:02:08.869> of<00:02:08.929> too

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
it's better to err on the side of too

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.910 
it's better to err on the side of too
much<00:02:09.679> protein<00:02:10.069> than<00:02:10.970> too<00:02:11.239> little<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.709> know

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
much protein than too little so you know

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.550 
much protein than too little so you know
we're<00:02:13.130> telling

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
we're telling

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.860 
we're telling
people<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.130> they<00:02:14.250> should<00:02:14.280> get<00:02:14.640> about<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.330> gram

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870

lean<00:02:29.700> body<00:02:29.730> mass<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.599> we<00:02:30.690> can<00:02:30.810> get<00:02:30.959> even

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
lean body mass is so we can get even

lean body mass is so we can get even
closer<00:02:32.150> it's<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.300> good<00:02:33.510> guideline<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.349> go<00:02:34.440> by

excess<00:02:35.849> protein<00:02:36.620> is<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:38.160> going<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.340> be

excess protein is just going to be

excess protein is just going to be
passed<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.269> I<00:02:39.300> mean<00:02:39.540> you're<00:02:39.870> just<00:02:40.380> going<00:02:40.590> to

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.370 
pass it the body is going to pass it on
now<00:02:43.319> so<00:02:44.090> it's<00:02:45.090> better<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.690> get<00:02:45.840> too<00:02:46.140> much

now so it's better to get too much

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.840 
protein than too little and I'm not and
then<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.739> know<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:49.920> can<00:02:50.130> err<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.519> side<00:02:50.790> of

then you know you can err on the side of

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.030 
then you know you can err on the side of
insanely<00:02:51.480> too<00:02:51.900> much<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.709> know<00:02:52.799> maybe

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
insanely too much and you know maybe

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.759 
insanely too much and you know maybe
then<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.880> could<00:02:53.910> be<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.900> could<00:02:54.930> be<00:02:55.200> taxing

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
then you could be you could be taxing

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.100 
then you could be you could be taxing
your<00:02:56.010> your<00:02:56.760> body<00:02:57.030> in<00:02:57.269> some<00:02:57.750> way<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.049> I

these guys are taken that that's it's a

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.509 
these guys are taken that that's it's a
whole<00:03:29.700> new<00:03:29.819> level<00:03:30.030> so<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:32.190> know<00:03:32.280> when<00:03:32.430> you

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
whole new level so you know when you

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.449 
whole new level so you know when you
said<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:32.850> were<00:03:32.940> taking<00:03:33.060> two<00:03:33.329> protein<00:03:33.750> shakes

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459

said you were taking two protein shakes
Darren<00:03:35.459> what<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:35.670> would<00:03:35.910> recommend<00:03:36.030> is<00:03:36.510> how

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
Darren what I would recommend is how

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.530 
Darren what I would recommend is how
much<00:03:37.680> is<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:38.160> each<00:03:38.310> protein<00:03:38.760> shake<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.239> also

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
much is in each protein shake and also

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.780 
much is in each protein shake and also
to<00:03:39.620> throughout<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.829> day<00:03:40.980> try<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.609> get

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
to throughout the day try and get

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.789 
to throughout the day try and get
protein<00:03:42.480> every<00:03:42.780> three<00:03:43.049> hours<00:03:43.079> try<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.650> get

your body protein every three hours and
obviously<00:03:45.780> at<00:03:46.079> night<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.920> can't<00:03:47.160> eat<00:03:47.459> some

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
obviously at night you can't eat some

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.059 
obviously at night you can't eat some
people<00:03:48.630> are<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:48.930> into<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.350> they<00:03:49.680> need<00:03:49.859> to

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
people are so into it that they need to

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.680 
people are so into it that they need to
you<00:03:50.250> know<00:03:50.340> they<00:03:50.459> think<00:03:50.700> need<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.239> wake<00:03:51.389> up<00:03:51.420> in

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
you know they think need to wake up in

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.020 
you know they think need to wake up in
the<00:03:51.750> middle<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.959> night<00:03:52.079> take<00:03:52.290> protein<00:03:52.680> well

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
the middle of night take protein well

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.099 
the middle of night take protein well
even<00:03:54.030> for<00:03:54.269> people<00:03:54.359> doing<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.750> jump<00:03:54.930> manual

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
even for people doing the jump manual

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.210 
even for people doing the jump manual
your<00:03:56.010> protein<00:03:56.430> intake<00:03:56.459> may<00:03:57.269> be<00:03:57.329> sufficient<00:03:58.220> so

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
your protein intake may be sufficient so

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.240 
your protein intake may be sufficient so
unless<00:03:59.489> you're<00:03:59.790> really<00:04:00.299> attacking<00:04:00.750> your<00:04:00.930> body

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
unless you're really attacking your body

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.199 
unless you're really attacking your body
you<00:04:02.250> may<00:04:02.370> not<00:04:02.459> need<00:04:02.579> to<00:04:02.700> do<00:04:02.819> something<00:04:03.090> like

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
you may not need to do something like

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.979 
you may not need to do something like
that<00:04:03.510> but<00:04:04.019> you<00:04:04.170> could<00:04:04.350> take<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.709> casein<00:04:05.310> protein

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
that but you could take a casein protein

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.170 
that but you could take a casein protein
which<00:04:06.989> is<00:04:07.319> slower<00:04:08.160> releasing<00:04:08.880> slower

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
which is slower releasing slower

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.360 
which is slower releasing slower
absorbing<00:04:09.750> in<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.930> body<00:04:10.139> so<00:04:10.769> at<00:04:10.920> night<00:04:11.160> you

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
absorbing in the body so at night you

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.210 
absorbing in the body so at night you
could<00:04:11.519> take<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.760> casein<00:04:12.389> protein<00:04:12.870> or<00:04:13.500> milk

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
could take a casein protein or milk

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.490 
could take a casein protein or milk
protein<00:04:14.670> which<00:04:15.299> will<00:04:15.510> absorb<00:04:15.840> during<00:04:16.380> the

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
protein which will absorb during the

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.979 
protein which will absorb during the
night<00:04:16.709> so<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:17.459> don't<00:04:17.760> feel<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.389> need<00:04:18.419> to<00:04:18.810> wake

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
night so you don't feel the need to wake

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.379 
night so you don't feel the need to wake
up<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.560> do<00:04:19.889> the<00:04:19.979> protein<00:04:20.340> so<00:04:20.579> to<00:04:21.150> answer<00:04:21.209> your

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
up and do the protein so to answer your

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.529 
up and do the protein so to answer your
question<00:04:21.510> I<00:04:22.610> you<00:04:23.610> use<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.030> guidelines<00:04:24.419> that

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
question I you use the guidelines that

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.720 
question I you use the guidelines that
we<00:04:24.720> give<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.050> in<00:04:25.229> the<00:04:25.409> jump<00:04:25.650> manual<00:04:25.770> and

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
we give you in the jump manual and

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.800 
we give you in the jump manual and
protein<00:04:27.300> throughout<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.990> day<00:04:28.250> if<00:04:29.250> you<00:04:29.520> know

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
protein throughout the day if you know

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.750 
protein throughout the day if you know
150<00:04:30.810> grams<00:04:31.200> of<00:04:31.410> protein<00:04:31.620> is<00:04:32.070> going<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.610> be

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
150 grams of protein is going to be

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.870 
150 grams of protein is going to be
better<00:04:33.120> taken<00:04:34.130> little<00:04:35.130> by<00:04:35.250> little<00:04:35.280> throughout

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
better taken little by little throughout

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.210 
better taken little by little throughout
the<00:04:36.030> day<00:04:36.180> than<00:04:36.540> if<00:04:36.660> you<00:04:36.780> just<00:04:36.810> drank<00:04:37.680> one<00:04:37.980> big

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
the day than if you just drank one big

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.040 
the day than if you just drank one big
hunter<00:04:38.550> 50<00:04:38.850> gram<00:04:39.030> protein<00:04:39.240> shake<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:39.930> then

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
hunter 50 gram protein shake and then

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.750 
hunter 50 gram protein shake and then
didn't<00:04:40.470> have<00:04:40.590> any<00:04:40.740> more<00:04:40.890> protein<00:04:41.310> through

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
didn't have any more protein through

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.310 
didn't have any more protein through
throughout<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.270> day<00:04:42.420> so<00:04:43.020> I<00:04:43.050> hope<00:04:43.230> that

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
throughout the day so I hope that

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.510 
throughout the day so I hope that
answers<00:04:43.440> your<00:04:43.740> question<00:04:43.830> and<00:04:44.310> shed<00:04:44.490> some

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
answers your question and shed some

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.490 
answers your question and shed some
light<00:04:44.880> onto<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:46.520> protein<00:04:47.520> diet<00:04:48.270> scene<00:04:48.900> which

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
light onto the protein diet scene which

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.330 
light onto the protein diet scene which
I<00:04:49.860> mean<00:04:50.310> I<00:04:50.690> believe<00:04:51.690> in<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.860> not<00:04:53.040> so<00:04:53.310> distant

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
I mean I believe in the not so distant

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.130 
I mean I believe in the not so distant
future<00:04:53.730> we're<00:04:54.360> going<00:04:54.480> to<00:04:54.540> be<00:04:54.690> able<00:04:54.780> to<00:04:54.930> know

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
future we're going to be able to know

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.590 
future we're going to be able to know
how<00:04:55.860> much<00:04:56.100> protein<00:04:56.370> your<00:04:56.700> bodies<00:04:56.970> using<00:04:57.180> how

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
how much protein your bodies using how

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.540 
how much protein your bodies using how
much<00:04:57.840> your<00:04:58.050> muscles<00:04:58.440> require<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:59.160> all<00:04:59.340> that

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
much your muscles require and all that

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.160 
much your muscles require and all that
kind<00:04:59.760> of<00:04:59.790> stuff<00:04:59.850> so<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.270> can<00:05:00.540> get<00:05:00.780> more

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
kind of stuff so you can get more

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.030 
kind of stuff so you can get more
precise<00:05:01.850> but<00:05:02.850> until<00:05:03.000> then<00:05:03.330> we<00:05:03.600> do<00:05:04.470> have<00:05:04.800> to

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
precise but until then we do have to

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.810 
precise but until then we do have to
take<00:05:05.280> an<00:05:05.520> educated<00:05:05.880> guess<00:05:06.570> and<00:05:07.580> one<00:05:08.580> way<00:05:08.760> to

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
take an educated guess and one way to

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.240 
take an educated guess and one way to
gauge<00:05:09.150> if<00:05:09.360> that's<00:05:09.570> working<00:05:09.840> is<00:05:10.320> if<00:05:10.890> you're

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
gauge if that's working is if you're

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.620 
gauge if that's working is if you're
gaining<00:05:11.640> muscle<00:05:12.590> quickly<00:05:13.590> enough<00:05:13.830> so<00:05:14.630> the

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
gaining muscle quickly enough so the

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.300 
gaining muscle quickly enough so the
only<00:05:15.750> way<00:05:15.870> you<00:05:15.930> can<00:05:16.110> really<00:05:16.320> know<00:05:16.590> that<00:05:16.800> is<00:05:17.100> by

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
only way you can really know that is by

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.250 
only way you can really know that is by
tracking<00:05:17.700> your<00:05:17.940> workouts<00:05:18.360> which<00:05:18.720> we<00:05:18.900> really

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
tracking your workouts which we really

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.860 
tracking your workouts which we really
emphasize<00:05:19.320> so<00:05:19.860> anyways<00:05:20.340> hope<00:05:21.300> that<00:05:21.480> helps<00:05:21.720> if

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
emphasize so anyways hope that helps if

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:30.940 
emphasize so anyways hope that helps if
you<00:05:21.960> have<00:05:22.020> questions<00:05:22.440> let<00:05:22.650> me<00:05:22.710> know<00:05:22.800> but<00:05:23.220> life

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.010
