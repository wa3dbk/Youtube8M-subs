00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:07.919
 you can evenings we are located 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:13.379
 in the tower estate very close to the capital 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.379
 and we here in this farm of 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.450
 overcoming with multi mineralized salts 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.480
 salt that we have been working with them 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.790
 two years and previously, because you work 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.970
 with another type of salts but it 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.130
 had some drawbacks and already 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.860
 after that they saw that those 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.200
 something that looked at the needs and 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.560
 requirements that life 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.490
 I needed the product so we decided 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.210
 with our brand to this life 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.250
 basically we are 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.460
 implementing what is the part of 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.320
 minerals with a percentage only 8% 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.800
 what we have seen 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.620
 from that time of that time to here 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.050
 well-known improvements in what is 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.350
 in the part of production and reproduction 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.619
 previously we handled or handled what 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.570
 that was in the productive part and more or 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:14.730
 less 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:18.650
 14 and 16 liters of milk per animal 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.650
 we are driving 25 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.320
 or what does it have to do with the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:29.899
 reproductive part and we have managed or 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:33.950
 we have decreased what is the part of 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.600
 silent jealousy and distributes 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.039
 also what is the part of the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.899
 empty bellies we have also avoided the 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.149
 prolongation of those of the open days 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.329
 and we have improved a little bit what is the 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.060
 synchronization part of the semester and 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.490
 of the ovulation population that in 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.319
 how much about the part 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.330
 reproductive we know that those are 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.509
 important factors when you want 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.880
 have a good improvement program 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.060
 genetic or a reproductive program 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.939
 we here are driving two 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.590
 the types of salts handle bulk or 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.870
 the block block 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:17.040
 as I said earlier a block 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.409
 10 kilos to 8% of these blocks come 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.180
 with all the minerals that are required 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.920
 for the organism of an animal and 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.799
 additionally we are adding them 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.220
 molasses that gives them palatability and 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:32.220
 brings energy to those blocks 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.560
 we have presentations of 4 kilos of 10 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.930
 kilos of 20 kilos that depends on the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.450
 Producer of no inconvenience 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.730
 you can give me the block that 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.829
 want if you want one of 4 kilos per 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.799
 animal is fine if you want one of 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:51.030
 10 kilos that is more or less they are 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.400
 using for about 7 or 8 or 9 animals 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.440
 and the largest one of 20 kilos for the 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.390
 elche we are not 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.690
 we are leaving it to a more quantity 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.569
 or less than between 15 and 20 animals are 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.670
 easy handling blocks is like you 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.159
 can see can be moved can be 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.440
 remove you can take a power to another 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:13.440
 of a salting 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.440
 slopes 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.720
 Multicines is a company that has 25 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.500
 years producing and marketing those 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.620
 blocks where they have given us very good 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.530
 results by dairies 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.710
 here in the savanna and in the breeding part 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:39.120
 of beef cattle in the savannah and 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:39.120
 level these blocks before then 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.019
 the companies where you did not see the 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.120
 Monetize result reaches all 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.720
 requirements that you that an animal 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.489
 have or need in your body 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.970
 placing new adding all the 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.510
 minerals that are needed and we 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.510
 your costs 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.590
 are costs that are accessible to 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.049
 any breeder and also because the 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.750
 savings and waste of these blocks 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.299
 as you can see those blocks that 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.329
 that are not going to be wasted like salt 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:21.350
 in bulk the animal the amb and the friend that 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.669
 needs and withdraws back and after 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.800
 a time goes back to the block and 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.270
 come back to have these are blocks that 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.240
 Well, as you can see what 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:34.419
 they need much more of their waste 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:37.100
 Well, it's not totally null 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:45.070
 suitable for some words are 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.070
 where they are or what with farms and 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.080
 locked up then they are suitable 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.580
 so then we can see that as soon as 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.580
 to the subscription are very important
