great way to hide artifacts as well for
instance<00:00:20.070> if<00:00:20.490> someone's<00:00:20.970> skin<00:00:21.270> needs<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.630> lot

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
instance if someone's skin needs a lot

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.630 
instance if someone's skin needs a lot
of<00:00:21.779> retouching<00:00:22.170> or<00:00:22.619> there's<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.160> lot<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.430> noise

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
of retouching or there's a lot of noise

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.670 
of retouching or there's a lot of noise
in<00:00:23.670> an<00:00:24.029> image<00:00:24.269> simply<00:00:24.930> converting<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.590> to

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
in an image simply converting it to

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.800 
in an image simply converting it to
black<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.070> white<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:26.820> turn<00:00:27.029> those<00:00:27.150> artifacts

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
black and white can turn those artifacts

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.290 
black and white can turn those artifacts
into<00:00:28.650> grain<00:00:29.039> they<00:00:29.490> don't<00:00:29.670> really<00:00:29.789> matter<00:00:30.060> as

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
into grain they don't really matter as

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.640 
into grain they don't really matter as
much<00:00:30.510> when<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> image<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.140> black<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.560> white

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
much when the image is black and white

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.680 
much when the image is black and white
now<00:00:32.309> there<00:00:32.700> are<00:00:32.790> tons<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.210> different<00:00:33.270> ways<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
now there are tons of different ways to

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.450 
now there are tons of different ways to
convert<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.230> black<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.590> white<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.980> want<00:00:35.340> to

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460

Camera Raw let's take a look so here we

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.660 
Camera Raw let's take a look so here we
are<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.750> Photoshop<00:00:43.200> with<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> nice<00:00:43.860> color<00:00:44.250> image

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
are in Photoshop with a nice color image

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.100 
are in Photoshop with a nice color image
but<00:00:44.879> let<00:00:45.000> me<00:00:45.090> quickly<00:00:45.329> show<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.809> how<00:00:45.960> to

but let me quickly show you how to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.139 
but let me quickly show you how to
convert<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.860> black<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.280> white<00:00:47.430> I'm

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
convert this to black and white I'm

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.459 
convert this to black and white I'm
going<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.329> come<00:00:48.450> over<00:00:48.480> here<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.870> my<00:00:48.960> adjustment

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
going to come over here to my adjustment

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.590 
going to come over here to my adjustment
panel<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.920> click<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.730> black-and-white<00:00:51.329> and

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
panel and click on black-and-white and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.569 
panel and click on black-and-white and
immediately<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:52.949> see<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.370> there's<00:00:53.520> a

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
immediately you can see that there's a

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.910 
immediately you can see that there's a
little<00:00:53.820> zigzag<00:00:54.360> between<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.260> color<00:00:55.469> channels

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
little zigzag between the color channels

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.740 
little zigzag between the color channels
and<00:00:56.100> what<00:00:56.489> those<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.820> done<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.270> they've

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
and what those have done is they've

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.660 
and what those have done is they've
introduced<00:00:58.199> contrast<00:00:58.890> between<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
introduced contrast between the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.040 
introduced contrast between the
different<00:00:59.969> color<00:01:00.149> channels<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.750> each

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
different color channels so that each

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.759 
different color channels so that each
color<00:01:01.620> pops<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:03.359> could<00:01:03.629> come<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.199> move

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
color pops and I could come in and move

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.920 
color pops and I could come in and move
these<00:01:05.010> individually<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.180> what<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.390> prefer<00:01:06.630> to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
these individually but what I prefer to

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.890 
these individually but what I prefer to
that<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.350> using<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.340> really<00:01:08.820> cool<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.299> image

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
that is using this really cool on image

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.649 
that is using this really cool on image

lighter and I don't need to remember
that<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:20.850> cyan<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.439> put<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.920> the

that this was cyan if I put it on the

don't need to remember that that was the
yellow<00:01:28.320> area<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.189> image<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.939> just

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
yellow area of the image it's just

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.840 
yellow area of the image it's just
mapping<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> corresponding<00:01:31.890> slider<00:01:32.220> this

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
mapping to the corresponding slider this

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.210 
mapping to the corresponding slider this
is<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> really<00:01:33.540> nice<00:01:33.750> way<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.189> fine-tune<00:01:35.189> my

the<00:01:46.979> image<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.210> we<00:01:48.390> want<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.350> warmer

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
the image with so if we want a warmer

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.789 
the image with so if we want a warmer
tone<00:01:50.009> we'll<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:51.000> pick<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.720> click<00:01:52.409> OK

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
tone we'll just pick that and click OK

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.710 
tone we'll just pick that and click OK
and<00:01:52.829> we've<00:01:53.009> got<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> nice<00:01:53.460> tinted<00:01:54.270> image<00:01:54.509> if<00:01:54.630> we

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
and we've got a nice tinted image if we

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.080 
and we've got a nice tinted image if we
want<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.079> less<00:01:55.290> saturated<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.640> click<00:01:56.880> a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
want that less saturated we just click a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.200 
want that less saturated we just click a
little<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> left<00:01:57.930> there<00:01:58.790> okay<00:01:59.790> so<00:01:59.850> that's

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
little to the left there okay so that's

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.789 
little to the left there okay so that's
a<00:02:00.450> really<00:02:00.869> quick<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.200> easy<00:02:01.350> way<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.619> do<00:02:01.770> that

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
a really quick and easy way to do that

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.280 
a really quick and easy way to do that
in<00:02:02.009> Photoshop<00:02:02.159> it's<00:02:03.000> an<00:02:03.240> adjustment<00:02:03.659> layer<00:02:03.960> so

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
in Photoshop it's an adjustment layer so

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.230 
in Photoshop it's an adjustment layer so
it<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.439> be<00:02:04.530> turned<00:02:04.710> off<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.189> on<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.579> can<00:02:06.060> play

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
it can be turned off and on I can play

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.359 
it can be turned off and on I can play
around<00:02:06.360> with<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.719> opacity<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.920> blending

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
around with the opacity and the blending

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.400 
around with the opacity and the blending
mode<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.360> lot<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.569> control<00:02:10.020> over<00:02:10.050> it

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
mode I have a lot of control over it

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.710 
mode I have a lot of control over it
okay<00:02:11.099> so<00:02:11.160> that's<00:02:11.400> Photoshop<00:02:11.910> let's<00:02:12.270> go<00:02:12.540> over

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
okay so that's Photoshop let's go over

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.820 
okay so that's Photoshop let's go over
to<00:02:12.750> bridge

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
to bridge

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.740

black and white effect in Camera Raw now
I<00:02:18.510> have<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> raw<00:02:19.110> file<00:02:19.380> in<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.650> middle<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.130> but

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
I have a raw file in the middle here but

I have a raw file in the middle here but
I've<00:02:20.670> also<00:02:20.940> added<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.450> JPEG<00:02:21.990> file<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.620> same

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
I've also added a JPEG file of the same

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.080 
I've also added a JPEG file of the same
image<00:02:23.130> because<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.430> want<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.640> show<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.850> how<00:02:24.060> to

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
a really powerful and easy place to move

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.540 
a really powerful and easy place to move
into<00:02:30.000> Photoshop<00:02:30.600> so<00:02:31.260> one<00:02:31.830> way<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.010> love<00:02:32.340> in

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
into Photoshop so one way I love in

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.520 
into Photoshop so one way I love in
bridge<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.300> just<00:02:33.510> select<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.990> JPEG<00:02:34.140> and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
bridge is to just select the JPEG and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.340 
bridge is to just select the JPEG and
hit<00:02:35.100> command<00:02:35.730> R<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.630> will<00:02:36.750> pop<00:02:36.990> me<00:02:37.140> into

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
hit command R and that will pop me into

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.160 
hit command R and that will pop me into
Camera<00:02:37.680> Raw<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:39.570> things<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:40.020> make<00:02:40.140> a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
Camera Raw and the things that make a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.440 
Camera Raw and the things that make a
good<00:02:40.440> color<00:02:40.710> image<00:02:41.070> also<00:02:41.580> make<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> good<00:02:42.000> black

and white image and in order to get a
good<00:02:44.310> black<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.730> white<00:02:44.880> image<00:02:45.270> I<00:02:45.450> need<00:02:45.780> to

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
good black and white image I need to

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.260 
good black and white image I need to
have<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.990> good<00:02:46.200> balanced<00:02:46.770> exposure<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:48.000> I'm

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
have a good balanced exposure so I'm

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.150 
have a good balanced exposure so I'm
going<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.510> back<00:02:48.960> down<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.410> exposure<00:02:49.770> a<00:02:49.890> little

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
going to back down the exposure a little

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.400 
going to back down the exposure a little
bit<00:02:50.340> I'm<00:02:51.090> going<00:02:51.210> to<00:02:51.270> pull<00:02:51.480> my<00:02:51.630> highlights<00:02:52.170> in<00:02:52.380> a

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
bit I'm going to pull my highlights in a

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.370 
bit I'm going to pull my highlights in a
little<00:02:53.150> I'm<00:02:54.150> going<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.480> increase<00:02:54.750> my<00:02:54.959> clarity

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
little I'm going to increase my clarity

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.290 
little I'm going to increase my clarity
just<00:02:55.740> a<00:02:55.830> little<00:02:56.040> bit<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.940> image<00:02:57.120> looks

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
just a little bit and the image looks

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.630 
just a little bit and the image looks
pretty<00:02:57.540> good<00:02:57.720> now<00:02:58.500> what<00:02:58.650> I'm<00:02:58.709> going<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:58.890> do<00:02:59.010> is

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
pretty good now what I'm going to do is

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.699 
pretty good now what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:59.790> just<00:02:59.820> going<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.150> move<00:03:00.330> over<00:03:00.510> here<00:03:01.020> to

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
I'm just going to move over here to

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.340 
I'm just going to move over here to
grayscale<00:03:02.670> or<00:03:02.850> black<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.420> white<00:03:03.570> when<00:03:04.320> I

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
grayscale or black and white when I

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.080 
grayscale or black and white when I
click<00:03:04.680> on<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:04.830> I'll<00:03:05.190> see<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.790> same

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
click on that I'll see the same

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.750 
click on that I'll see the same
separation<00:03:06.720> between<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.350> channels<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:07.950> if<00:03:08.610> I

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
separation between the channels and if I

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.490 
separation between the channels and if I
want<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.270> interact<00:03:09.540> with<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.959> image<00:03:10.200> like<00:03:10.380> I

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
want to interact with the image like I

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.470 
want to interact with the image like I
did<00:03:10.650> before<00:03:10.800> I'm<00:03:11.550> just<00:03:11.610> going<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.030> choose<00:03:12.270> the

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
did before I'm just going to choose the

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.510 
did before I'm just going to choose the
targeted<00:03:12.959> adjustment<00:03:13.470> tool<00:03:13.650> it's<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.280> same

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
targeted adjustment tool it's the same

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.120 
targeted adjustment tool it's the same
idea<00:03:14.730> if<00:03:15.330> I<00:03:15.420> click<00:03:15.660> on<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.900> foreground<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.650> I

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
idea if I click on the foreground and I

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.120 
idea if I click on the foreground and I
move<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.610> left<00:03:18.019> I'll<00:03:19.019> notice<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.980> I'm

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
move to the left I'll notice that I'm

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.490 
move to the left I'll notice that I'm
making<00:03:20.430> this<00:03:20.550> brighter<00:03:21.209> or<00:03:21.420> darker<00:03:21.570> now<00:03:22.170> one

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
making this brighter or darker now one

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.690 
making this brighter or darker now one
thing<00:03:22.769> that<00:03:22.830> works<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.280> little<00:03:23.310> bit

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
thing that works a little bit

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.790 
thing that works a little bit
differently<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.450> think<00:03:24.480> better<00:03:25.050> in<00:03:25.290> Camera<00:03:25.769> Raw

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
differently I think better in Camera Raw

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.949 
differently I think better in Camera Raw
is<00:03:26.220> you'll<00:03:26.730> notice<00:03:26.970> that<00:03:27.630> I'm<00:03:27.750> moving

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
is you'll notice that I'm moving

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.740 
is you'll notice that I'm moving
multiple<00:03:28.650> sliders<00:03:29.100> at<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.459> same<00:03:29.670> time<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:30.600> by

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
multiple sliders at the same time so by

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.630 
multiple sliders at the same time so by
using<00:03:30.930> this<00:03:31.230> targeted<00:03:31.620> adjustment<00:03:32.130> tool<00:03:32.280> I'm

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
using this targeted adjustment tool I'm

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.910 
using this targeted adjustment tool I'm
actually<00:03:32.940> doing<00:03:33.209> something<00:03:33.330> I<00:03:33.720> couldn't<00:03:34.080> do

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
actually doing something I couldn't do

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.040 
actually doing something I couldn't do
back<00:03:35.340> in<00:03:35.519> Photoshop<00:03:35.940> I'm<00:03:36.150> moving<00:03:36.480> two<00:03:36.720> sliders

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
back in Photoshop I'm moving two sliders

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.410 
back in Photoshop I'm moving two sliders
at<00:03:37.380> two<00:03:37.830> different<00:03:38.130> rates<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.670> get<00:03:39.269> this

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
at two different rates I get this

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.000 
at two different rates I get this
looking<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.840> way<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:39.989> want<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:40.560> then<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:40.769> move

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
looking the way I want and then I move

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.430 
looking the way I want and then I move
over<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.610> split<00:03:41.970> toning<00:03:42.209> and<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:43.050> way<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.350> it

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
over to split toning and the way that it

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.470 
over to split toning and the way that it
works<00:03:43.620> in<00:03:43.800> split<00:03:44.070> toning<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.580> could<00:03:45.209> guess<00:03:45.450> it

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
works in split toning I could guess it

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.410 
works in split toning I could guess it
my<00:03:45.810> hue<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.500> then<00:03:47.040> build<00:03:47.340> my<00:03:47.489> saturation<00:03:48.269> up

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
my hue and then build my saturation up

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.020 
my hue and then build my saturation up
but<00:03:49.200> here's<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.739> really<00:03:50.010> great<00:03:50.220> trick<00:03:50.519> hold

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
but here's a really great trick hold

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.780 
but here's a really great trick hold
down<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.330> option<00:03:51.360> or<00:03:51.989> Alt<00:03:52.050> key<00:03:52.440> while<00:03:53.340> pulling

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
down the option or Alt key while pulling

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.400 
down the option or Alt key while pulling
the<00:03:53.880> hue<00:03:54.120> slider<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.750> you'll<00:03:55.230> get<00:03:55.350> a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
the hue slider and you'll get a

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.720 
the hue slider and you'll get a
temporary<00:03:56.390> 100%<00:03:57.390> preview<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:58.080> that<00:03:58.500> color<00:03:58.860> so

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
temporary 100% preview of that color so

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.000 
temporary 100% preview of that color so
I<00:03:59.760> can<00:04:00.060> say<00:04:00.330> okay<00:04:00.959> that's<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.410> color<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:01.680> want

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
I can say okay that's the color I want

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.880 
I can say okay that's the color I want
then<00:04:02.580> I<00:04:02.610> release<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.360> slowly<00:04:04.200> build<00:04:04.530> up<00:04:04.709> the

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
then I release and slowly build up the

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.970 
then I release and slowly build up the
saturation<00:04:05.480> when<00:04:06.480> I'm<00:04:06.570> done<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:07.050> just<00:04:07.560> click<00:04:07.830> on

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
saturation when I'm done I just click on

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.460 
saturation when I'm done I just click on
done<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:09.239> change<00:04:09.570> will<00:04:09.750> be<00:04:09.870> reflected

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
done and the change will be reflected

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.949 
done and the change will be reflected
back<00:04:10.860> in<00:04:11.100> Camera<00:04:11.489> Raw<00:04:11.670> had<00:04:12.209> I<00:04:12.239> said<00:04:12.510> open<00:04:12.630> it

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
back in Camera Raw had I said open it

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.930 
back in Camera Raw had I said open it
would<00:04:13.290> have<00:04:13.380> opened<00:04:13.560> into<00:04:13.890> Photoshop<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:14.880> two

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
would have opened into Photoshop so two

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.759 
would have opened into Photoshop so two
different<00:04:15.540> ways<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.720> make<00:04:16.140> great<00:04:16.470> black<00:04:16.739> and

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
different ways to make great black and

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.820 
different ways to make great black and
white<00:04:17.100> images<00:04:17.489> tinted<00:04:18.299> in<00:04:18.419> both<00:04:18.600> cases<00:04:18.870> really

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
white images tinted in both cases really

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:30.719 
white images tinted in both cases really
easy<00:04:20.040> really<00:04:20.850> fast<00:04:21.109> hope<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.289> helps<00:04:22.530> you<00:04:22.590> out

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.789
