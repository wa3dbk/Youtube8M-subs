00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
first time I really like it so I'm

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.370 
first time I really like it so I'm
really<00:01:44.270> looking<00:01:44.689> forward<00:01:44.719> for<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:45.350> next

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
really looking forward for the next

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.770 
really looking forward for the next
races<00:01:45.920> how<00:01:46.369> important<00:01:46.820> is<00:01:46.880> it<00:01:46.939> matter<00:01:47.450> for<00:01:47.689> you

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
races how important is it matter for you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.260 
races how important is it matter for you
it's<00:01:48.469> really<00:01:49.399> important<00:01:49.939> because<00:01:50.090> super-g

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
it's really important because super-g

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.630 
it's really important because super-g
it's<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.509> most<00:01:53.719> it's<00:01:54.170> hard<00:01:54.679> discipline<00:01:55.310> I

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
it's the most it's hard discipline I

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.510 
it's the most it's hard discipline I
mean<00:01:55.909> without<00:01:56.780> enough<00:01:57.649> training<00:01:57.979> it's<00:01:58.310> hard

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
mean without enough training it's hard

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.419 
mean without enough training it's hard
to<00:01:58.670> get<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:58.969> right<00:01:58.999> timing<00:01:59.420> but<00:02:00.130> these<00:02:01.130> last

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
to get the right timing but these last

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.380 
to get the right timing but these last
days<00:02:01.759> I<00:02:02.149> had<00:02:02.509> some<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:03.200> training<00:02:04.009> and<00:02:04.159> I

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
days I had some so training and I

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.270 
days I had some so training and I
understood<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.450> timing<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.229> Super<00:02:06.679> G<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.069> it

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
understood the timing of Super G and it

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.090 
understood the timing of Super G and it
was<00:02:07.490> really<00:02:07.729> important<00:02:08.240> to<00:02:08.360> do<00:02:08.479> that<00:02:08.979> then<00:02:09.979> I

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
was really important to do that then I

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.830 
was really important to do that then I
can<00:02:10.280> bring<00:02:10.460> down<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:10.729> kind<00:02:11.240> of<00:02:11.330> run<00:02:11.540> that<00:02:11.720> I

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
can bring down that kind of run that I

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.750 
can bring down that kind of run that I

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
was such a difficult super-g um it was a

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.460 
was such a difficult super-g um it was a
pretty<00:03:26.519> normal<00:03:26.760> set<00:03:27.569> for<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:27.989> hill<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.440> know

pretty normal set for this hill you know
it's<00:03:29.069> difficult<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.760> set<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.030> any<00:03:30.180> other<00:03:30.239> way

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
it's difficult to set it any other way

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.930 
it's difficult to set it any other way
because<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.169> hill<00:03:31.349> oh<00:03:31.379> so<00:03:31.650> narrow<00:03:31.889> and<00:03:31.980> it

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940
