00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.330
 hello friends how are we a station 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.460
 we follow that the reviewed that has 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.160
 sent the company you see and caisses and 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.250
 Well this is an iPhone case 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.250
 5 and 5 s tells us it's a cover 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.550
 Slender and protective with a look 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.239
 elegant out protection against knocks 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.780
 that brings a two-piece slide access to 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.000
 the buttons and a wide camera good a 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.739
 space for the camera that as I told you 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.620
 the last time in this unfortunately the 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:46.010
 parcel already gave me this covers with 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.219
 the boxes very battered but so super 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.930
 super battered but well let's hope 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.719
 that the covers come in correct condition 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.120
 the ipad you already showed them without 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.420
 problems and ready 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.660
 here nothing we have absolutely nothing 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.750
 It would be very good to add us a 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.240
 mika not a protective dynamic but 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.270
 well here I do not know if you can see it 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.880
 has as the basic logo there are 6 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.130
 not plush feels very good to the touch 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.810
 very soft and this material also 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.729
 love I always told you what happens 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.939
 same as with the always with the covers 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.610
 of pro porta from the back is a 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.549
 very soft to the touch but at the same time it is very 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.850
 hard will protect you from the blows but 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.920
 to the touch is super soft is very I do not know is 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.600
 very very very very soft salts we are going to 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.150
 put the cakes 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.500
 it's ready 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.930
 I already found problems, it's going to raise me 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.510
 the mica 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.280
 The more pressure I make 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:57.560
 more I get up here problems 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.860
 mind tablet mind ok here 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.700
 I think it's causing me a little bit of 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:08.929
 conflict the fact that I have the skin 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.140
 green but see well I already get up here 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:16.819
 the mica that is something lousy at least 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.590
 I do not like it because because I am 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.750
 a person that I like to take care of my 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.209
 things do not see on the bottom like 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.670
 is already getting up I like to take care 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.960
 my things i like to have my iphone with 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.420
 his protective mica 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.580
 if I did not have my protective cas 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.950
 I assure you that my phone would be more 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.470
 that scratched what follows it from scratched 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.550
 literally but good here I leave you 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.770
 this is going to see the access to the buttons 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.170
 without any problem work 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.730
 here the power feels good we do not have 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.269
 no problem 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.670
 vibrator button without any problem and 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.370
 on the bottom part we find a 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.920
 unique cut for what is our 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.080
 horn our dock our microphone and 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.420
 our 3.5 jack 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.280
 on the back a large hole 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.330
 for the camera, it does not have to 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.720
 hinder when making a 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.510
 today he played the battery one as it is called 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:21.210
 a photograph with flash here we are going to 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.210
 see if we're going to put this here 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.640
 does not influence absolutely nothing you see 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.970
 very well 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.740
 does not influence anything very good boys 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.140
 the cover I really like the touch 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.720
 feels quite father the only thing that I 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.030
 I give the point ultra ultra mega bad is 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.010
 this look with the bottom part is 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.750
 miles are getting up if you like 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:52.080
 take care of your devices like me 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:55.500
 abstente comes out like that so literally better 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.450
 there are many more options that allow you 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.220
 have a case with your protector 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.379
 screen at least for me that's very 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.269
 important but good everyone their 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.640
 I'm giving my opinion if the 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.160
 you want to take into account truth 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.870
 good but if not also it is not not happening 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.209
 absolutely nothing comes out too 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.760
 we found a relief on the table 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.169
 the best for that reason they do it assuming that 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.750
 the relief on the table can help you 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.609
 to not scratch your screen but to 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.290
 moment you put on that you put your 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.470
 cellular in your bag that you put it in 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.200
 your portfolio in case of women in your 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.810
 hand bag is not in contact with 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.090
 keys with coins with dust 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.770
 pebbles and others and they can scratch your 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.500
 phone but good friends not in 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.910

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.200

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.610
