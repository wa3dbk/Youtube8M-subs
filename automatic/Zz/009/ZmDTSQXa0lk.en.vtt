00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:10.400
 Chess Weaknesses weaken the 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.559
 king's position as we have seen is very 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.320
 important to put in, but of course this 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.880
 do not leave your threat regime 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.460
 especially the pedestrians who covers rock 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.500
 disappear and the opponent pieces 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.500
 control the king's escape houses 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:29.089
 experienced player to realize some 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.220
 signs of when the threats 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:35.930
 of the king's open position are imminent 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.580
 in the position beside it in particular the 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.920
 gender has no movement option 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.920
 for g8 that is protected by the bishop 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:53.630
 at the same time the f4 horse threatens 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:57.370
 house of 6 while 14 and 3 can 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.370
 easily these places pay 3 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:07.000
 in contrast it has only one 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.170
 damen g7 defender pot 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.890
 This is the time to prepare a 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.929
 trap against the black river 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:22.219
 the bid that follows is not very intuitive 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:25.249
 however very strong the white b2 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:28.270
 identified diagonally at 1:18 as a 

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:28.270
 black weakness 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:41.259
 apparently they moved on a white 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:45.399
 but can also prepare 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:48.700
 an attack says robert black follow with 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.670
 276 there is no good move to 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.100
 black aggravated account due to the position 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.439
 the black king bad what black searched 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:03.070
 do with this bid is to free up space 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:06.190
 for the king in g 7 if he had played for 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.929
 example horses and 4 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:20.080
 we would have the following sequence the couple 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:21.940
 thomas g 6 with motogp check 6 804 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.250
 with the attack discovered 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:32.670
 white adamo on the king for a walk 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:37.420
 g7 to cover the check g7 kills 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:40.239
 take up g 7 to 4 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.910
 taking an attack position to this day and 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:48.780
 placing her as an attacking bishop of 3 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.780
 defend bishop 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.070
 Then it takes 7 by check 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.269
 note that whites earned 2 billion 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.269
 getting clear advantage 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.670
 returning a little of this same variant 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.530
 if blacks had captured with the pawn 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.359
 dh instead of capturing with the lady for 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:14.130
 through agate g6 that answer told 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.130
 h3 immediate combat 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.700
 note that the lady in g 7 can not 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.700
 move due to dug 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:36.550
 after mf 63 continued with his attack 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.130
 horse size g 6 check now even 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.100
 are forced to recapture horse what 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:47.860
 will leave either the column h or the 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:50.370
 diagonal at 1h 18 blacks return to 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.780
 capture champion dh the cat plus 16 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.069
 capturing with adamo would lead to defeat 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:00.670
 faster capture with the lady would take 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.989
 mars of the following form of the forest 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.190
 mg six g 3 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:11.530
 they are now forced to defend the 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:14.489
 ami b2 discovery check and takes the 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.489
 mate the following year 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:25.229
 otherwise it is resolved 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:29.380
 simply wrapped king for g7 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:33.130
 white horse would f4 now white horse 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.620
 has one more and the tower in g 3 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.880
 would be a strong threat taking advantage of the 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.880
 weakened position of the king 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.000
 after the capture the black dh champion 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.639
 left this column unprotected what 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.090
 allows white to play load three with 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.090
 check 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.770
 note how in all continuations 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.120
 the chef discovered through the dance 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:09.480
 located in and two always a theme o 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.130
 remove protect yourself 7 defending the lady and 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.690
 now banks use tactical deviation 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.630
 on the black king by means of the 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:22.820
 believed and this will allow white 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.820
 to win a lady in exchange for an engine and 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:29.700
 blacks are forced to capture the tower 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:33.210
 takes back gasset and white earned lady 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.400
 lady took six brands earn material 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.010
 besides having a strong attack on 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.900
 progress with the advantage of 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.900
 have a past located in 5 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.790
 this was an example of sensitivity to 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.640
 vulnerable positions against the opponent 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:53.039
 when the position of the opposing king is 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.200
 lack of space and under attack by 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:58.520
 some of your pieces is the right time 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.520
 and look for combinations
