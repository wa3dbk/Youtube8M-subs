hi everyone welcome back date number 15
is<00:00:21.690> draping<00:00:22.690> that's<00:00:23.170> the<00:00:23.380> technique<00:00:23.740> that<00:00:23.770> I'm

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
is draping that's the technique that I'm

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
continue to do I'll do a few more of

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.140 
continue to do I'll do a few more of
these<00:00:31.720> for<00:00:32.050> the<00:00:32.200> the<00:00:32.890> glazing<00:00:33.730> techniques

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
these for the the glazing techniques

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.600 

I<00:04:05.599> just<00:04:06.200> grabbed<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.620> random<00:04:07.040> leave<00:04:07.250> this<00:04:07.430> piece

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
quickly and certain parts started to

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.480 
quickly and certain parts started to
crack<00:05:31.050> and<00:05:31.260> I<00:05:31.290> went<00:05:31.440> no<00:05:31.620> I<00:05:31.650> wanted<00:05:32.010> to<00:05:32.070> alter<00:05:32.370> it
