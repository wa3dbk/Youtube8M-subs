ups<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.560> car<00:01:19.770> pretty<00:01:20.040> good<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:21.289> think<00:01:22.289> it<00:01:22.410> was

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
ups the car pretty good I think it was

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.160 
ups the car pretty good I think it was
about<00:01:22.740> 30<00:01:23.280> or<00:01:23.520> 40<00:01:23.970> bucks<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.450> wasn't<00:01:24.810> much<00:01:24.960> at

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
about 30 or 40 bucks it wasn't much at

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.090 
about 30 or 40 bucks it wasn't much at
all<00:01:26.119> yet<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.509> get<00:01:27.690> a<00:01:27.750> lot<00:01:27.990> of

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.040 

it's<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.760> lot<00:01:31.940> cheaper<00:01:31.970> than<00:01:32.390> trying<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:32.870> wrap

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
it's a lot cheaper than trying to wrap

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.220 
it's a lot cheaper than trying to wrap
it<00:01:33.230> with<00:01:33.380> paper<00:01:34.150> but<00:01:35.150> I<00:01:35.180> guess<00:01:35.480> I'm<00:01:36.050> not<00:01:36.170> a

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
it with paper but I guess I'm not a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.149 
it with paper but I guess I'm not a
painter<00:01:36.680> but

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.890 

when<00:01:39.880> you're<00:01:40.030> painting<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.360> car<00:01:40.540> you<00:01:40.720> want

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
when you're painting the car you want

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.280 
when you're painting the car you want
you<00:01:41.170> want<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.820> want<00:01:42.820> to<00:01:43.000> but<00:01:43.210> your<00:01:43.390> paint<00:01:44.080> line

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
you want to want to but your paint line

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.320 
you want to want to but your paint line
up<00:01:44.500> with<00:01:44.680> paper<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:46.450> plastic<00:01:47.049> tends<00:01:47.409> to

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
up with paper this plastic tends to

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.990 
up with paper this plastic tends to
collect<00:01:49.330> dust<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:49.900> it'll<00:01:50.369> flake<00:01:51.369> off<00:01:51.580> in<00:01:51.850> your

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
collect dust and it'll flake off in your

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.070 
collect dust and it'll flake off in your
paint<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.780> think<00:01:53.140> that's<00:01:53.560> what<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.950> reason<00:01:54.220> is

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
paint I think that's what the reason is

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.450 
paint I think that's what the reason is
it's<00:01:56.080> not<00:01:56.320> I'm<00:01:56.470> sure<00:01:56.649> one<00:01:56.830> of<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:57.009> guys<00:01:57.220> will

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
it's not I'm sure one of the guys will

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.350 
it's not I'm sure one of the guys will
correct<00:01:57.759> me

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.950 

but<00:02:00.930> yeah<00:02:01.410> it's<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:01.830> it's<00:02:02.430> good<00:02:03.120> for<00:02:03.450> for

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
but yeah it's it's it's good for for

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.850 
but yeah it's it's it's good for for
wrapping<00:02:04.350> stuff<00:02:04.590> up<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:06.470> pretty<00:02:07.470> easy<00:02:07.710> to

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
wrapping stuff up and pretty easy to

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.690 
wrapping stuff up and pretty easy to
work<00:02:07.980> with<00:02:08.040> so<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:10.130> didn't<00:02:11.130> use<00:02:11.160> paper<00:02:11.460> at<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
work with so I didn't use paper at the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.090 
work with so I didn't use paper at the
bottom<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:12.090> mine<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.690> mean<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.440> doesn't<00:02:13.890> matter

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
bottom of mine I mean it doesn't matter

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.860 
bottom of mine I mean it doesn't matter
if<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.370> get<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.550> little<00:02:14.700> bit<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:15.000> dirt<00:02:15.240> or<00:02:15.360> crap<00:02:15.630> in

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
if I get a little bit of dirt or crap in

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.930 
if I get a little bit of dirt or crap in
my<00:02:15.900> undercoating<00:02:16.620> it's<00:02:16.800> it's<00:02:17.550> really<00:02:17.700> not

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
my undercoating it's it's really not

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.060 
my undercoating it's it's really not
going<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.210> be<00:02:18.300> seen<00:02:18.570> in<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:19.250> but<00:02:20.250> when<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:20.910> do

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
going to be seen in this but when I do

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.980 
going to be seen in this but when I do
jam<00:02:23.070> panning<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.610> stuff<00:02:23.820> I'll<00:02:24.060> use<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.750> paper

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
jam panning and stuff I'll use the paper

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.620 
jam panning and stuff I'll use the paper
for<00:02:25.320> sure<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:26.430> then<00:02:26.550> I'll<00:02:26.670> be<00:02:26.760> using<00:02:26.970> plastic

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
for sure and then I'll be using plastic

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.930 
for sure and then I'll be using plastic
further<00:02:28.260> away<00:02:28.560> from

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.690
