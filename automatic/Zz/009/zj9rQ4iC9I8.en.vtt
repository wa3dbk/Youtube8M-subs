00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.080
 painting with basic enamel technique 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.940
 smooth transition today big 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.559
 so-called popular 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.460
 dual system basecoat 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.800
 under the lacquer 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.410
 The first layer is the base color malt 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.939
 I have with simple colored pigments or 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.400
 effective colors with added 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.289
 metallica pigments and mother of pearl second 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.330
 colorless varnish is applied with a layer 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.760
 protects the base enamel from mechanical 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.640
 impacts of aggressive environment 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.590
 and sunlight before carrying 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.180
 painting works you can proceed to 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.190
 masking that car surface 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.079
 which will not be involved in 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.969
 repair paint as 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.190
 masking materials recommended 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.420
 use a covering paper cover 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.420
 No film and masking tape 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:14.760
 our car is packed and ready to paint 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.010
 proceed to diluting the paint and to 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.870
 Prepare the base enamel 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.819
 which we previously picked up at 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.010
 mobihel enamel selection system 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.680
 the working mixture is prepared by adding 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.170
 thick moths up to 60 percent thinner 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.000
 if you apply a base mobihel bo 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.920
 cooked in the laboratory selection 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.410
 mobihel you need for dilution 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.500
 use mobihel thinner 3100 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.470
 summer version of mobihel thinner 3300 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.160
 working viscosity of the mixture should be 20 22 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.410
 seconds 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.239
 if you use mobihel base enamel 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.890
 metallic finished color then in 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.930
 as a thinner should be taken 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.910
 summer mobihel metalik thinner 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.340
 version of mobihel metalik thinner 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.450
 long working viscosity of the mixture should 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.250
 be 15 seconds before applying 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.170
 the surface should be degreased when 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.920
 Aid Mobihel Silicone Amp 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.920
 cleaning agent 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.770
 after this clean dry cloth we 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.430
 must wipe off leftovers and silicone with 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.430
 surface 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.319
 in order to check and match 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.359
 cooked on selection colors with 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.250
 repaired car 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.230
 you need to make and test the map 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.750
 Vykrasku ready mom during manufacturing 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.239
 such painter painter explain for myself 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.310
 paint coverage method of its application 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.750
 in other words how many layers of this 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.579
 paint he needs to apply 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.010
 and how to set up your gun for 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:01.370
 specific color base enamel need 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.220
 look under the varnish test vykrasku 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.040
 we do immediately before painting 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.530
 if everything suits us in color then we 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.030
 proceed to painting 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.950
 transition painting technique is applied in 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.019
 case of partial repair hiding 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.970
 slight difference in the color of the old and 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.250
 fresh painted coating as well 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.380
 prevents the transition to occur 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.360
 a halo of effective pigments she 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.669
 applied to mobihel base moth 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.139

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.340
 when painting transition part of the new

 colorless base is ready for application 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.610
 that is, it does not need to be diluted 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:02.380
 applied on the same gun as 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.380
 base enamel on the border

 The first layer of basic enamel is applied to
