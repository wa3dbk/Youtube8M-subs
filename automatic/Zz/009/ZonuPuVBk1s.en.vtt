a<00:01:05.510> lived-in<00:01:06.320> room<00:01:06.680> I<00:01:06.920> guess<00:01:07.130> it's<00:01:07.430> kind<00:01:07.610> of

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
a lived-in room I guess it's kind of

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.210 
a lived-in room I guess it's kind of
very<00:01:07.850> plain<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:08.570> it's<00:01:09.380> not<00:01:09.530> very<00:01:09.710> good<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.190> I

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
very plain and it's not very good so I

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.550 
very plain and it's not very good so I
thought<00:01:10.549> I<00:01:10.580> would<00:01:10.909> take<00:01:11.659> it<00:01:11.840> up<00:01:11.930> a<00:01:12.020> notch<00:01:12.049> I

thought I would take it up a notch I

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.370 
thought I would take it up a notch I

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
another thing to talk about is the

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.440 
another thing to talk about is the
internet<00:04:58.380> it<00:04:59.380> uses<00:04:59.920> an<00:05:00.070> internet<00:05:00.550> cable<00:05:00.730> but

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
internet it uses an internet cable but

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.910 
internet it uses an internet cable but
it's<00:05:01.570> actually<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.110> fastest<00:05:02.470> internet<00:05:02.620> on

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
it's actually the fastest internet on

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.270 
it's actually the fastest internet on
campus<00:05:04.050> talking<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.110> other<00:05:05.290> people<00:05:05.620> who<00:05:06.250> are

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
campus talking to other people who are

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.000 
campus talking to other people who are
at<00:05:06.610> like<00:05:06.880> carpenter<00:05:07.480> or<00:05:07.690> other<00:05:08.470> places<00:05:08.800> on

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
at like carpenter or other places on

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.890 
at like carpenter or other places on
campus<00:05:09.430> they<00:05:09.910> use<00:05:10.090> wireless<00:05:10.390> you<00:05:10.690> think

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
campus they use wireless you think

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.650 
campus they use wireless you think
that's<00:05:11.020> great<00:05:11.260> but<00:05:12.010> it's<00:05:12.610> tends<00:05:13.150> to<00:05:13.240> be<00:05:13.360> slower

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
that's great but it's tends to be slower

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.810 
that's great but it's tends to be slower
so<00:05:13.810> the<00:05:14.290> actually<00:05:14.710> that<00:05:14.740> that's<00:05:15.160> an<00:05:15.400> that<00:05:15.430> is<00:05:15.790> a

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
so the actually that that's an that is a

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.200 
so the actually that that's an that is a
lot<00:05:16.030> faster<00:05:16.240> um<00:05:17.020> for<00:05:18.010> all<00:05:18.070> y'all<00:05:18.310> you<00:05:19.060> got<00:05:19.150> a

lot faster um for all y'all you got a

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.300 
lot faster um for all y'all you got a
