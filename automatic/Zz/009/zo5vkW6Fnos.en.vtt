demo<00:00:22.050> comes<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.920> bag<00:00:23.300> like<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.810> it's

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
demo comes in a bag like this and it's

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.990 
demo comes in a bag like this and it's
it's<00:00:25.650> an<00:00:25.800> interesting<00:00:26.099> game<00:00:26.519> because<00:00:26.880> it's

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
it's an interesting game because it's

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.689 
it's an interesting game because it's
using<00:00:27.330> three-dimensional<00:00:27.689> pieces<00:00:28.699> most

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
using three-dimensional pieces most

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.070 
using three-dimensional pieces most
games<00:00:29.820> used<00:00:30.090> three-dimensional<00:00:30.660> pieces<00:00:30.960> but

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
games used three-dimensional pieces but

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.540 
games used three-dimensional pieces but
11<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.560> port<00:00:31.920> here<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.189> three-dimensional

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
11 is the port here is three-dimensional

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.299 
11 is the port here is three-dimensional
I<00:00:33.090> played<00:00:33.780> games<00:00:34.110> such<00:00:34.410> as<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.710> before<00:00:35.100> where

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
I played games such as this before where

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.950 
I played games such as this before where
you're<00:00:35.430> trying<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.700> get<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.969> same<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.719> try<00:00:36.899> to

you're trying to get the same you try to

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.170 
you're trying to get the same you try to
put<00:00:37.170> pieces<00:00:37.440> down<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.370> score<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.969> most

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
put pieces down to score you the most

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.180 
put pieces down to score you the most
points<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.660> any<00:00:39.780> point<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.170> time<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.010> has

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
points in any point in time but this has

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.900 
points in any point in time but this has
you<00:00:41.340> building<00:00:41.550> little<00:00:41.910> totem<00:00:42.300> poles<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.809> the

you building little totem poles and the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.740 
you building little totem poles and the
three-dimensional<00:00:44.910> aspect<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.660> is

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
three-dimensional aspect of it is

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.139 
three-dimensional aspect of it is
certainly<00:00:46.590> interesting<00:00:46.800> let's<00:00:47.789> take<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.940> look

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
certainly interesting let's take a look

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.340 
certainly interesting let's take a look
at<00:00:48.239> what's<00:00:48.390> inside<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.809> bag<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.170> how<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
at what's inside the bag and how the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:02.150 
at what's inside the bag and how the
game<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.739> played

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.979 

here's<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.970> cloth<00:01:03.239> board<00:01:03.540> which<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.810> a<00:01:03.870> pretty

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
here's the cloth board which is a pretty

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.440 
here's the cloth board which is a pretty
big<00:01:04.260> board<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.580> mostly<00:01:05.940> just<00:01:06.030> there<00:01:06.420> for

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
big board but it's mostly just there for

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.310 
big board but it's mostly just there for
scoring<00:01:07.050> purposes<00:01:07.530> fact<00:01:07.890> players<00:01:08.610> will<00:01:08.880> have

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
scoring purposes fact players will have

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.780 
scoring purposes fact players will have
multiple<00:01:10.320> scoring<00:01:10.740> tokens<00:01:11.130> they'll<00:01:11.370> have<00:01:11.550> one

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
multiple scoring tokens they'll have one

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.790 
multiple scoring tokens they'll have one
that's<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.690> go<00:01:12.780> around<00:01:12.870> a<00:01:13.200> 30-point

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
that's going to go around a 30-point

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.130 
that's going to go around a 30-point
track<00:01:14.160> then<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.300> here<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.720> once<00:01:15.870> they<00:01:15.990> go<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
track then one here so once they go to

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.160 
track then one here so once they go to
30<00:01:16.470> they<00:01:16.710> move<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.190> and<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.790> forth<00:01:18.120> in<00:01:18.300> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
30 they move it on and so forth in the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.980 
30 they move it on and so forth in the
middle<00:01:19.470> here<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.860> placed<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.600> board<00:01:21.869> itself

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
middle here is placed the board itself

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.800 
middle here is placed the board itself
and<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> middle<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> board<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.810> placed

a<00:01:24.930> blog<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.619> an<00:01:25.890> example<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
a blog now this is an example of the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.910 
a blog now this is an example of the
blocks<00:01:26.760> in<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> game<00:01:27.410> there<00:01:28.410> are<00:01:28.500> blocks<00:01:28.680> with

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
blocks in the game there are blocks with

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.290 
blocks in the game there are blocks with
a<00:01:28.979> member<00:01:29.160> on<00:01:29.340> i'm<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:29.550> a<00:01:29.580> color<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.060> one's

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
a member on i'm at a color this one's

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.170 
a member on i'm at a color this one's
wild<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> pin<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> bottom<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.150> you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
wild and then a pin in the bottom so you

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.120 
wild and then a pin in the bottom so you
can<00:01:33.330> stick<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.690> into<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:35.930> board<00:01:36.930> players<00:01:37.860> will

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
can stick it into the board players will

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.760 
can stick it into the board players will
get<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> handful<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.880> three<00:01:39.270> tiles<00:01:39.770> again

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
get a handful of three tiles again

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.680 
get a handful of three tiles again
they're<00:01:41.310> all<00:01:41.460> different<00:01:41.670> colors<00:01:42.149> now<00:01:42.509> there

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
they're all different colors now there

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.050 
they're all different colors now there
are<00:01:42.810> some<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.259> them<00:01:43.460> which<00:01:44.460> are<00:01:44.759> called

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
are some of them which are called

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.940 
are some of them which are called
toppers<00:01:45.660> which<00:01:46.530> means<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:48.450> can't<00:01:48.950> stick

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
toppers which means you can't stick

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.380 
toppers which means you can't stick
something<00:01:50.160> in<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.520> top<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.940> if<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.119> try

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
something in to the top of it if you try

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.540 
something in to the top of it if you try
it<00:01:51.780> won't<00:01:52.020> fit<00:01:52.289> now<00:01:52.920> there's<00:01:53.130> still<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> hole

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
it won't fit now there's still a hole

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.529 
it won't fit now there's still a hole
there<00:01:53.759> that's<00:01:53.940> so<00:01:54.060> when<00:01:54.180> you're<00:01:54.300> pulling<00:01:54.450> them

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
there that's so when you're pulling them

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.570 
there that's so when you're pulling them
out<00:01:54.660> of<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.869> bag<00:01:55.050> you<00:01:55.710> can't<00:01:55.979> feel<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.460> see

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
out of the bag you can't feel and see

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.180 
out of the bag you can't feel and see
which<00:01:56.759> ones<00:01:57.000> are<00:01:57.149> toppers<00:01:57.800> all<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:58.979> players

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
which ones are toppers all the players

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.249 
which ones are toppers all the players
turn<00:01:59.490> they<00:01:59.670> simply<00:02:00.000> put<00:02:00.240> down<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:01.080> of<00:02:01.170> these

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
turn they simply put down one of these

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.740 
turn they simply put down one of these
blocks<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.950> board<00:02:02.220> now<00:02:02.430> there's<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.479> color

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
blocks on the board now there's a color

you can see there will come points where

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.380 
you can see there will come points where

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
certain situations because it can't

there are a few more wild blocks in the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.130 
there are a few more wild blocks in the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
obviously once there's a topper on top

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.670 
obviously once there's a topper on top
of<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.870> stack<00:02:52.110> then<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:53.099> can<00:02:53.280> no<00:02:53.430> longer<00:02:54.680> have

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
of a stack then it can no longer have

of a stack then it can no longer have
things<00:02:55.980> placed<00:02:56.340> upon<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:57.080> but<00:02:58.080> five<00:02:58.349> high<00:02:58.560> is

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
things placed upon it but five high is

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.400 
things placed upon it but five high is
the<00:02:58.860> maximum<00:02:59.310> when<00:02:59.670> you<00:02:59.790> place<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.120> block<00:03:00.480> let's

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
the maximum when you place a block let's

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.589 
the maximum when you place a block let's
focus<00:03:01.739> up<00:03:01.830> on<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.010> board<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.280> bit<00:03:02.459> when<00:03:03.450> you

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
focus up on the board a bit when you

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.960 
focus up on the board a bit when you
place<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.840> block<00:03:04.110> let's<00:03:04.379> say<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.620> place<00:03:04.970> this

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
place a block let's say it place this

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.210 
place a block let's say it place this
block<00:03:06.330> here<00:03:06.629> which<00:03:07.379> is<00:03:07.530> next<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.830> blue<00:03:08.040> and

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
block here which is next to blue and

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.460 
block here which is next to blue and
green<00:03:08.370> that's<00:03:08.610> legal<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.200> scores<00:03:10.200> one<00:03:10.440> point

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
green that's legal it scores one point

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.160 
green that's legal it scores one point
plus<00:03:11.070> one<00:03:11.340> for<00:03:11.550> touching<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.910> blue<00:03:12.120> plus<00:03:12.990> two

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
plus one for touching the blue plus two

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.090 
plus one for touching the blue plus two
for<00:03:13.200> touching<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:13.890> green

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
for touching this green

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.730 
for touching this green
so<00:03:15.250> that's<00:03:15.460> a<00:03:15.730> two<00:03:16.390> three<00:03:16.690> four<00:03:16.960> point<00:03:17.350> scoring

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
so that's a two three four point scoring

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.920 
so that's a two three four point scoring
and<00:03:18.100> I<00:03:18.610> would<00:03:18.760> move<00:03:18.910> my<00:03:19.030> scoring<00:03:19.450> tile<00:03:19.720> around

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
and I would move my scoring tile around

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.900 
and I would move my scoring tile around
the<00:03:20.230> board<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.800> that's<00:03:21.460> basically<00:03:21.670> the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
the board and that's basically the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.790

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
tiles with numbers on them the numbers

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.820 
tiles with numbers on them the numbers

look<00:03:54.160> like<00:03:54.340> totem<00:03:54.670> poles<00:03:54.880> as<00:03:55.090> you<00:03:55.210> stack<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:55.480> up

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
look like totem poles as you stack it up

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.020 
look like totem poles as you stack it up
yeah<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:55.930> does<00:03:56.110> but<00:03:56.830> it's<00:03:57.580> basically<00:03:57.940> just

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
yeah it does but it's basically just

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.870 
yeah it does but it's basically just
trying<00:03:58.390> to<00:03:58.630> maximize<00:03:59.200> how<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.100> put<00:04:00.400> pieces<00:04:00.610> on

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
trying to maximize how you put pieces on

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.990 
trying to maximize how you put pieces on
the<00:04:01.000> board<00:04:01.650> well<00:04:02.650> there's<00:04:02.830> that<00:04:02.890> that's<00:04:03.640> it's

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
the board well there's that that's it's

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.450 
the board well there's that that's it's
a<00:04:04.180> game<00:04:04.630> about<00:04:04.660> building<00:04:05.380> totem<00:04:05.770> poles<00:04:06.040> I

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
a game about building totem poles I

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.750 
a game about building totem poles I
guess<00:04:06.880> I<00:04:07.180> mean<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.480> rulebook<00:04:08.140> even<00:04:08.410> has<00:04:08.590> some

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
guess I mean the rulebook even has some

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.190 
guess I mean the rulebook even has some
mumbo<00:04:09.760> jumbo<00:04:10.090> about<00:04:10.120> what<00:04:10.510> each<00:04:10.660> one<00:04:10.900> stands

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
mumbo jumbo about what each one stands

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.840 
mumbo jumbo about what each one stands
for<00:04:11.530> no<00:04:12.070> one's<00:04:12.250> going<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.430> care<00:04:12.550> about<00:04:12.670> that

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
for no one's going to care about that

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.630 
for no one's going to care about that
one<00:04:13.030> playing<00:04:13.300> it<00:04:14.110> reminds<00:04:14.560> me<00:04:14.620> of<00:04:14.740> other<00:04:15.280> some

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
one playing it reminds me of other some

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.990 
one playing it reminds me of other some
more<00:04:15.850> placing<00:04:16.450> Blanc<00:04:16.810> games<00:04:17.790> putting<00:04:18.790> down

the<00:04:22.750> idea<00:04:23.020> is<00:04:23.080> pretty<00:04:23.290> cool<00:04:24.540> sometimes<00:04:25.540> you

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
the idea is pretty cool sometimes you

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.030 
the idea is pretty cool sometimes you
get<00:04:25.810> messed<00:04:26.050> over<00:04:26.200> because<00:04:26.620> it<00:04:26.740> seems<00:04:26.950> like

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
get messed over because it seems like

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.430 
get messed over because it seems like
the<00:04:27.730> once<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.210> pull<00:04:28.510> aren't<00:04:29.110> going<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:29.320> match

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
the once you pull aren't going to match

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.110 
the once you pull aren't going to match
anything<00:04:29.770> but<00:04:30.070> you<00:04:30.250> can<00:04:30.400> discard<00:04:30.760> them<00:04:31.000> and

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
anything but you can discard them and

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.420 
anything but you can discard them and
draw<00:04:31.300> three<00:04:31.600> new<00:04:31.630> ones<00:04:31.930> I<00:04:32.200> like<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:32.860> game<00:04:33.160> I

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
draw three new ones I like the game I

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.790 
draw three new ones I like the game I
don't<00:04:34.000> love<00:04:34.540> it<00:04:34.600> because<00:04:35.140> it<00:04:35.320> doesn't<00:04:35.650> seem

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
don't love it because it doesn't seem

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.470 
don't love it because it doesn't seem
like<00:04:35.830> there's<00:04:36.160> any<00:04:36.220> long-term<00:04:36.550> strategy<00:04:37.360> in

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
like there's any long-term strategy in

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.300 
like there's any long-term strategy in
it<00:04:37.600> it<00:04:37.990> seems<00:04:38.260> like<00:04:38.440> you<00:04:38.560> just<00:04:38.590> deal<00:04:39.010> with<00:04:39.220> the

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
it it seems like you just deal with the

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.650 
it it seems like you just deal with the
best<00:04:39.460> move<00:04:39.730> that<00:04:39.760> you<00:04:39.970> have<00:04:40.120> at<00:04:40.210> any<00:04:40.300> point<00:04:40.570> in

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
best move that you have at any point in

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.690 
best move that you have at any point in
time<00:04:40.720> and<00:04:41.170> off<00:04:41.680> times<00:04:41.980> that<00:04:42.190> moves<00:04:42.400> really

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
time and off times that moves really

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.520 
time and off times that moves really
obvious<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.690> could<00:04:43.840> say<00:04:43.960> well<00:04:44.110> I<00:04:44.140> put<00:04:44.350> one

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
obvious you could say well I put one

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.800 
obvious you could say well I put one
here<00:04:44.950> so<00:04:45.340> that<00:04:45.550> you<00:04:46.300> know<00:04:46.390> I<00:04:46.420> can<00:04:46.630> set

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
here so that you know I can set

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.120 
here so that you know I can set
something<00:04:46.990> up<00:04:47.110> next<00:04:47.470> term<00:04:47.620> but<00:04:47.830> if<00:04:47.890> you<00:04:47.980> play

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
something up next term but if you play

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.010 
something up next term but if you play
with<00:04:48.310> more<00:04:48.460> than<00:04:48.580> two<00:04:48.760> players<00:04:49.090> there's<00:04:49.840> not
