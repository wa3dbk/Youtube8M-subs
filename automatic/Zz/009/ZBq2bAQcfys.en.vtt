00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.870 
incorrect locations like I'm going to do
right<00:01:37.570> now<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:38.619> need<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:38.920> dislodge<00:01:39.580> it<00:01:39.610> by

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
right now you need to dislodge it by

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.399 
right now you need to dislodge it by
using<00:01:40.119> one<00:01:40.360> of<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.540> sticky<00:01:40.840> bombs<00:01:41.049> so<00:01:41.260> if<00:01:41.320> you

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
using one of the sticky bombs so if you

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.710 
using one of the sticky bombs so if you
accidentally<00:01:42.010> put<00:01:42.880> this<00:01:43.060> up<00:01:43.360> in<00:01:43.570> this

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
accidentally put this up in this

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.660 
accidentally put this up in this
location<00:01:44.110> right<00:01:44.440> here<00:01:44.500> when<00:01:45.070> you<00:01:45.189> first<00:01:45.460> get

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
location right here when you first get

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.780 
location right here when you first get
it<00:01:45.850> this<00:01:45.970> is<00:01:46.119> actually<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:47.020> wrong<00:01:47.200> place<00:01:47.790> go

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
it this is actually the wrong place go

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.149 
it this is actually the wrong place go
ahead<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:49.180> grab<00:01:49.330> yourself<00:01:49.450> a<00:01:49.720> sticky<00:01:50.020> bomb<00:01:50.229> so

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
ahead and grab yourself a sticky bomb so

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.410 
ahead and grab yourself a sticky bomb so
that<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.430> could<00:01:51.580> dislodge<00:01:51.939> that<00:01:52.000> and

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
that you could dislodge that and

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.910 
that you could dislodge that and
remember<00:01:52.689> that<00:01:52.960> in<00:01:53.049> the<00:01:53.140> future<00:01:53.380> in<00:01:53.619> case<00:01:53.770> you

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
remember that in the future in case you

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.399 
remember that in the future in case you
ever<00:01:54.010> make<00:01:54.250> any<00:01:54.460> any<00:01:54.850> errors<00:01:55.390> but<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.140> place

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
ever make any any errors but the place

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.219 
ever make any any errors but the place
that<00:01:56.650> we<00:01:56.740> need<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:57.070> move<00:01:57.250> this<00:01:57.580> all<00:01:57.820> is<00:01:58.240> in<00:01:59.080> a

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
that we need to move this all is in a

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.280 
that we need to move this all is in a
socket<00:01:59.619> that's<00:02:00.070> in<00:02:00.310> front<00:02:00.610> of<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.030> gate<00:02:01.330> where

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
socket that's in front of the gate where

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.390 
socket that's in front of the gate where
the<00:02:02.409> other<00:02:02.619> are<00:02:02.979> bizarre

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
the other are bizarre

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.060 
the other are bizarre
so<00:02:04.299> that<00:02:04.570> gate<00:02:04.780> can<00:02:04.960> lower<00:02:05.170> and<00:02:05.500> we<00:02:05.770> can<00:02:05.920> get

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
so that gate can lower and we can get

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.570 
so that gate can lower and we can get
this<00:02:06.250> up<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:07.630> go<00:02:07.840> ahead<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.379> push<00:02:09.189> this<00:02:09.399> out

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
this up so go ahead and push this out

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.659 
this up so go ahead and push this out
and<00:02:10.469> put<00:02:11.469> this<00:02:11.590> into<00:02:11.799> one<00:02:12.069> of<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.639> other

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:12.669 
and put this into one of the other

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.059 
and put this into one of the other
sockets<00:02:13.269> that's<00:02:13.719> located<00:02:14.200> near<00:02:14.409> this<00:02:14.650> region

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
sockets that's located near this region

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.100 
sockets that's located near this region
right<00:02:15.189> here

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
right here

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.780 
right here
then<00:02:17.110> go<00:02:17.440> back<00:02:17.680> grab<00:02:18.160> yourself<00:02:18.550> another

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
then go back grab yourself another

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.509 
then go back grab yourself another
sticky<00:02:19.209> bomb<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:20.349> dislodge<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:21.040> other<00:02:21.220> off

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
sticky bomb to dislodge the other off

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.059 
sticky bomb to dislodge the other off
and<00:02:22.060> move<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.840> into<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.140> other<00:02:23.319> socket<00:02:23.860> and

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
and move it into the other socket and

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.009 
and move it into the other socket and
that's<00:02:24.610> pretty<00:02:24.760> much<00:02:24.879> that<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.510> like<00:02:25.690> I<00:02:25.840> said

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
that's pretty much that so like I said

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.479 
that's pretty much that so like I said
this<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.319> pretty<00:02:26.590> straightforward<00:02:26.890> puzzle

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
this is a pretty straightforward puzzle

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.570 
this is a pretty straightforward puzzle
I<00:02:27.700> thought<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.540> was<00:02:28.720> but<00:02:29.010> as<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.190> mentioned<00:02:30.250> I

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
some of these puzzles or puzzles I won't

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.500 
some of these puzzles or puzzles I won't
be<00:02:47.530> doing<00:02:47.680> them<00:02:47.980> all<00:02:48.160> but<00:02:48.640> I'll<00:02:48.760> be<00:02:48.940> doing<00:02:49.209> some

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
be doing them all but I'll be doing some

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.900 
be doing them all but I'll be doing some
of<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.780> ones<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.890> figured<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.430> maybe<00:02:51.670> folks

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
of the ones I figured that maybe folks

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.750 
of the ones I figured that maybe folks
get<00:02:52.480> stuck<00:02:52.780> at<00:02:52.959> or<00:02:53.110> whatever<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.310> get<00:02:54.549> that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
get stuck at or whatever so you get that

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.430 
get stuck at or whatever so you get that
key<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.269> then<00:02:55.510> head<00:02:55.780> about<00:02:55.989> your<00:02:56.170> business

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
key and then head about your business

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.780 
key and then head about your business
and<00:02:56.620> that's<00:02:56.680> pretty<00:02:56.890> much<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:57.549> in<00:02:57.670> this

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
and that's pretty much that so in this

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.180 
and that's pretty much that so in this
video<00:02:58.420> here<00:02:58.810> we<00:02:58.930> completed<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.530> all<00:02:59.709> puzzle

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
video here we completed the all puzzle

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.699 
video here we completed the all puzzle
and<00:03:00.370> this<00:03:00.549> is<00:03:00.700> in<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.209> cauldron<00:03:01.870> chamber<00:03:02.560> and

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
and this is in the cauldron chamber and

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:03.960 
and this is in the cauldron chamber and
I<00:03:02.769> guess<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.040> could<00:03:03.160> say<00:03:03.310> this<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.519> like<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
I guess you could say this is like the

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.259 
I guess you could say this is like the
western<00:03:04.690> side<00:03:04.900> west<00:03:05.380> balcony<00:03:05.910> also<00:03:06.910> we<00:03:07.090> got<00:03:07.239> a

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
western side west balcony also we got a

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.509 
western side west balcony also we got a
page<00:03:07.569> of<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:07.930> book<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.349> the<00:03:08.470> Dead<00:03:08.739> do<00:03:09.069> note<00:03:09.340> I

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
page of the book of the Dead do note I

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.940 
page of the book of the Dead do note I
will<00:03:09.610> be<00:03:09.849> doing<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.269> separate<00:03:10.720> videos<00:03:11.170> on<00:03:11.530> those

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
will be doing a separate videos on those

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.160 
will be doing a separate videos on those
pages<00:03:12.220> locations<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.239> they're<00:03:13.360> part<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.870> a

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
pages locations and they're part of a

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.559
