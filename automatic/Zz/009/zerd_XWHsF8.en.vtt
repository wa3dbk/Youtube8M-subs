00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.000 
got his ears cropped and ear cropping is
just<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.730> just<00:00:17.789> helps<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.420> ear<00:00:18.710> ventilate<00:00:19.710> and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
just it just helps the ear ventilate and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.490 
just it just helps the ear ventilate and
prevents<00:00:20.880> infections<00:00:21.859> and<00:00:23.090> he<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.570> 13<00:00:25.289> weeks

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
prevents infections and he is 13 weeks

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.029 
prevents infections and he is 13 weeks
like<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.859> said<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.960> procedure<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.320> between

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
like I said and the procedure is between

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.150 
like I said and the procedure is between
eight<00:00:29.310> weeks<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.900> twelve<00:00:30.900> weeks

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
eight weeks and twelve weeks

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.880 
eight weeks and twelve weeks
I<00:00:32.219> think<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.120> should<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.600> when<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.649> dog<00:00:34.860> is

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
I think you should do it when the dog is

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.810 
I think you should do it when the dog is
really<00:00:35.130> young<00:00:35.489> because<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.670> it's<00:00:38.670> just

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
really young because it just it's just

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.619 
really young because it just it's just
better<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.510> him<00:00:39.719> because<00:00:40.489> some<00:00:41.489> dogs<00:00:42.300> are

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
better for him because some dogs are

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.630 
better for him because some dogs are
really<00:00:43.079> strong<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.829> they<00:00:43.950> can<00:00:44.100> take<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> cone

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
really strong and they can take the cone

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.670 
really strong and they can take the cone
off<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.120> other<00:00:45.899> dogs<00:00:46.200> are<00:00:47.090> just<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.329> his<00:00:48.989> age

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
off and other dogs are just like his age

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.040 
off and other dogs are just like his age
and<00:00:50.010> they<00:00:50.640> don't<00:00:50.850> feel<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> lot<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.300> pain<00:00:51.600> like

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
and they don't feel a lot of pain like

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.840 
and they don't feel a lot of pain like
other<00:00:52.260> dogs<00:00:52.500> do<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.100> they<00:00:53.520> don't<00:00:53.699> remember

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
other dogs do and they don't remember

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.590 
other dogs do and they don't remember
anything<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.660> other<00:00:54.870> dogs<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:57.360> cost

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
anything like other dogs do and the cost

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.450 
anything like other dogs do and the cost
is<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:57.960> between<00:00:58.350> two<00:00:58.710> hundred<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.280> six

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
is in between two hundred and six

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.639 
is in between two hundred and six
hundred<00:00:59.730> dollars<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.140> depends<00:01:01.559> on

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
hundred dollars and it just depends on

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.910 
hundred dollars and it just depends on
your<00:01:01.739> state<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:03.290> you<00:01:04.290> better<00:01:04.530> check<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
your state and you better check the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.679 
your state and you better check the
reviews<00:01:05.070> because<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.150> don't<00:01:06.330> check<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
reviews because if you don't check the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.820 
reviews because if you don't check the
reviews<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.290> don't<00:01:07.500> know<00:01:07.619> where

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
reviews and you don't know where

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.370 
reviews and you don't know where
Hospital<00:01:08.700> you're<00:01:08.850> going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.330> then<00:01:09.930> that's<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
Hospital you're going to then that's a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.560 
Hospital you're going to then that's a
bad<00:01:10.530> thing<00:01:10.799> because<00:01:11.010> some<00:01:11.400> doctors<00:01:11.640> aren't

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
bad thing because some doctors aren't

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.140 
bad thing because some doctors aren't
that<00:01:12.930> focus<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:13.680> other<00:01:13.920> doctors<00:01:14.460> into<00:01:14.760> ear

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
that focus as other doctors into ear

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.649 
that focus as other doctors into ear
propping<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.700> turns<00:01:18.000> out<00:01:18.150> better<00:01:18.479> if

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
propping and it just turns out better if

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.960 
propping and it just turns out better if
you<00:01:18.840> look<00:01:19.290> at<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.770> reviews<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.369> know<00:01:20.490> what

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
takes about one to three hours for the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.940 
takes about one to three hours for the
surgery<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.900> end<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:34.170> better<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.920> a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
surgery to end and you better have a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.429 
surgery to end and you better have a
check-in<00:01:35.640> before<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.750> bloodwork<00:01:37.020> and

type of ear you want like the style and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.420 
type of ear you want like the style and
the<00:01:47.340> doctor<00:01:48.119> doesn't<00:01:48.299> know<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.810> then

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the doctor doesn't know and then

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.210 
the doctor doesn't know and then
you<00:01:51.430> know<00:01:51.630> turns<00:01:52.630> out<00:01:52.810> bad<00:01:52.990> so<00:01:53.590> you<00:01:53.710> have<00:01:54.010> to<00:01:54.100> do
