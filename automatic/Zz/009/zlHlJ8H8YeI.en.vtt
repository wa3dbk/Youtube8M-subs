figured virus is good the game takes
place<00:01:04.640> actually<00:01:05.000> in<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.449> Grand<00:01:05.659> Canyon<00:01:05.720> and

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
place actually in the Grand Canyon and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.180 
place actually in the Grand Canyon and
we<00:01:06.320> created<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:06.710> world<00:01:06.890> using<00:01:07.130> a

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
we created the world using a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.100 
we created the world using a
topographical<00:01:07.730> map<00:01:07.760> of<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.270> Grand<00:01:08.480> Canyon<00:01:08.660> so

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
topographical map of the Grand Canyon so

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.330 
topographical map of the Grand Canyon so
you<00:01:09.170> could<00:01:09.320> actually<00:01:09.470> go<00:01:09.710> into<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:09.950> if<00:01:10.220> you

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
the section were looking at now since we

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.690 
the section were looking at now since we
figured<00:01:21.680> we'll<00:01:22.190> start<00:01:22.430> with<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:22.610> beginning

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
figured we'll start with the beginning

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.510

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
process you don't make mechanical

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.770 
process you don't make mechanical
decisions<00:01:31.850> about<00:01:31.970> your<00:01:32.150> character<00:01:32.480> such<00:01:32.660> as

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
race class skills things of that nature

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.550 
race class skills things of that nature
until<00:01:35.570> you've<00:01:35.750> actually<00:01:35.840> played<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.410> game

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
for a while we don't want people to make

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.800 
for a while we don't want people to make
a<00:01:39.020> choice<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:40.040> then<00:01:40.550> think<00:01:41.000> oh<00:01:41.150> if<00:01:41.540> I'd<00:01:41.660> known

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
a choice and then think oh if I'd known

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.450 
a choice and then think oh if I'd known
how<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:41.990> game<00:01:42.200> actually<00:01:42.440> played<00:01:42.980> I<00:01:43.220> would

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
how the game actually played I would

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.400 
how the game actually played I would
have<00:01:43.550> never<00:01:43.640> made<00:01:43.940> that<00:01:44.000> choice<00:01:44.360> I<00:01:44.660> want

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
have never made that choice I want

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
have never made that choice I want
people<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:45.650> basically<00:01:45.950> make<00:01:46.130> informed

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
people to basically make informed

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.650 
people to basically make informed
decisions<00:01:46.580> on<00:01:47.030> how<00:01:47.120> they<00:01:47.240> want<00:01:47.300> to<00:01:47.390> play<00:01:47.480> their

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.080 
tutorial takes place inside hoover dam
in<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.290> collapse<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.340> civilization<00:03:28.610> hoover

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
in the collapse of civilization hoover

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.400 
in the collapse of civilization hoover
dam<00:03:29.239> was<00:03:29.390> one<00:03:29.510> of<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.630> last<00:03:29.750> places<00:03:29.959> to

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
dam was one of the last places to

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.080 
dam was one of the last places to
survive<00:03:30.769> after<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.280> fall<00:03:31.459> of<00:03:31.489> civilization

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
survive after the fall of civilization

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.030 
survive after the fall of civilization
because<00:03:32.570> it<00:03:32.750> can<00:03:32.870> generate<00:03:32.959> power<00:03:33.320> for<00:03:33.680> years

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
because it can generate power for years

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.900 
because it can generate power for years
without<00:03:34.400> any<00:03:34.730> fuel<00:03:35.090> or<00:03:35.180> other<00:03:35.780> because<00:03:36.739> it's

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
without any fuel or other because it's

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.800 
without any fuel or other because it's
even<00:03:37.910> if<00:03:37.970> there<00:03:38.090> was<00:03:38.180> no<00:03:38.269> one<00:03:38.420> there<00:03:38.450> it<00:03:38.720> could

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
even if there was no one there it could

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.120 
even if there was no one there it could
run<00:03:38.989> for<00:03:39.200> I<00:03:39.230> think<00:03:39.320> three<00:03:39.650> or<00:03:39.680> four<00:03:39.920> years

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
run for I think three or four years

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.770 
run for I think three or four years
without<00:03:40.400> breaking<00:03:40.850> down<00:03:40.880> it's<00:03:41.329> really<00:03:41.660> quite

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
without breaking down it's really quite

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.180 
without breaking down it's really quite
impressive<00:03:42.019> so<00:03:42.440> it's<00:03:42.620> basically<00:03:42.829> the<00:03:42.980> last

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
impressive so it's basically the last

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.770 
impressive so it's basically the last
source<00:03:43.640> of<00:03:43.880> large-scale<00:03:44.180> electrical<00:03:44.600> power

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
source of large-scale electrical power

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.140 
source of large-scale electrical power
in<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.049> world<00:03:45.489> so<00:03:46.489> it<00:03:46.579> becomes<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.970> last

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
in the world so it becomes the last

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.970 
in the world so it becomes the last
bastion<00:03:47.360> of<00:03:47.540> humanity<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.200> last<00:03:48.709> for<00:03:48.829> about<00:03:48.890> a

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
bastion of humanity and last for about a

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.250 
bastion of humanity and last for about a
hundred<00:03:49.100> years<00:03:49.430> until<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:50.209> real<00:03:50.660> despot<00:03:51.079> gets

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
hundred years until a real despot gets

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.569 
hundred years until a real despot gets
to<00:03:51.350> be<00:03:51.410> put<00:03:51.590> in<00:03:51.680> charge<00:03:51.860> all<00:03:52.280> these<00:03:52.400> different

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
to be put in charge all these different

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.400 
to be put in charge all these different
factions<00:03:53.000> get<00:03:53.209> pissed<00:03:53.420> off<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:53.900> you<00:03:54.230> have<00:03:54.380> a

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
factions get pissed off and you have a

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.990 
factions get pissed off and you have a
revolt<00:03:54.799> so<00:03:55.280> you're<00:03:55.400> basically<00:03:55.489> stuck<00:03:55.790> in<00:03:55.940> the

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
revolt so you're basically stuck in the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.160 
revolt so you're basically stuck in the
middle<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:56.239> this<00:03:56.390> revolt<00:03:56.780> through<00:03:57.079> the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
middle of this revolt through the

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.990 
middle of this revolt through the
through<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.650> remains<00:03:57.890> of<00:03:57.980> hoover<00:03:58.220> dam<00:03:58.370> trying

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
through the remains of hoover dam trying

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.340 
through the remains of hoover dam trying
to<00:03:59.090> get<00:03:59.180> out<00:03:59.299> before<00:03:59.450> you<00:03:59.720> get<00:03:59.840> killed<00:04:00.019> and

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
to get out before you get killed and

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.890 
to get out before you get killed and
figure<00:04:01.040> out<00:04:01.100> what's<00:04:01.340> going<00:04:01.400> on<00:04:01.730> we<00:04:02.720> basically

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
figure out what's going on we basically

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.650 
figure out what's going on we basically
assume<00:04:03.500> that<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.519> player<00:04:04.850> has<00:04:05.150> not<00:04:05.329> read<00:04:05.480> any

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
assume that the player has not read any

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.880 
assume that the player has not read any
of<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:05.780> background<00:04:06.140> for<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:06.320> game<00:04:06.530> has<00:04:06.739> not

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
of the background for a game has not

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.190 
of the background for a game has not
read<00:04:07.100> any<00:04:07.700> of<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:08.060> law<00:04:08.360> or<00:04:08.720> anything<00:04:09.110> we

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
read any of the law or anything we

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.809 
read any of the law or anything we
assume<00:04:09.470> they<00:04:09.590> know<00:04:09.620> nothing<00:04:09.920> and<00:04:10.310> so<00:04:10.640> their

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
assume they know nothing and so their

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.490 
assume they know nothing and so their
character<00:04:11.209> knows<00:04:11.360> nothing<00:04:11.780> because<00:04:12.290> most

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
character knows nothing because most

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.600 
character knows nothing because most
players<00:04:12.680> they'll<00:04:12.950> put<00:04:13.099> up<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.280> game<00:04:13.430> they

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
players they'll put up the game they

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.559 
players they'll put up the game they
don't<00:04:13.700> read<00:04:13.879> the<00:04:13.970> manual<00:04:14.330> they

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
don't read the manual they

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.240 
don't read the manual they
go<00:04:14.840> in<00:04:15.019> jump<00:04:15.319> play<00:04:15.590> so<00:04:15.650> we<00:04:15.890> try<00:04:16.070> and<00:04:16.130> educate

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
go in jump play so we try and educate

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.909 
go in jump play so we try and educate
the<00:04:16.639> player<00:04:16.820> from<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.120> ground<00:04:17.449> up<00:04:17.720> as<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.650> what

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
the player from the ground up as to what

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.310 
the player from the ground up as to what
the<00:04:19.009> game<00:04:19.190> is<00:04:19.220> about<00:04:19.570> food<00:04:20.570> tutorial<00:04:21.019> they<00:04:21.169> get

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
the game is about food tutorial they get

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.900 
the game is about food tutorial they get
involved<00:04:21.739> with<00:04:21.829> a<00:04:21.889> lot<00:04:22.009> of<00:04:22.039> the<00:04:22.160> background<00:04:22.580> a

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
involved with a lot of the background a

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.580 
involved with a lot of the background a
lot<00:04:23.060> of<00:04:23.150> different<00:04:23.180> factions<00:04:23.870> so<00:04:24.199> they<00:04:24.320> really

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
lot of different factions so they really

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.409 
lot of different factions so they really
can<00:04:25.160> figure<00:04:25.370> out<00:04:25.460> everything<00:04:25.639> as<00:04:25.970> they<00:04:26.150> go<00:04:26.300> as

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
can figure out everything as they go as

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.650 
can figure out everything as they go as
opposed<00:04:26.660> to<00:04:26.720> having<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:26.960> stop<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.139> read<00:04:27.410> stuff
