00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello youtube friends 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.799
 welcome to a new gameplay in this 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.010
 case as I said in the previous gameplay 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.690
 we are going to treat the processions like this in 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.490
 study mode a little general 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.460
 you do not have to heat up much 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.170
 head ok say it first as opinion 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.600
 staff that I think should be used 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.270
 in the teka frost 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.540
 of the profane or blood of what 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.540
 want 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.520
 the branch in blood this talent put together a 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.620
 singer that is pretty good no no 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.120
 It works not going 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.120
 we are talking only about 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.190
 frost and good to say that I use 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.930
 jewelry blacksmithing because there are people who 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.410
 prefer to use engineering for 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:52.400
 gloves and tailoring for the coat but 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:56.110
 the advantage that you have with engineering and 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.989
 jewelry is that we maintain our strength 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.090
 basically during the whole fight all 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.610
 the combat is what allows us 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.150
 maintain a more stable tps while 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.700
 with tailoring this embroidery this that 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.369
 we put here will jump every one minute I think 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.270
 and in the gloves we have a minute of 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.520
 cool down too 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.280
 it is on this side what this state is already and 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.940
 it is more profitable in compass of the long 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.180
 and half-length almost short 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.730
 use the risk and since the balance 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.130
 between celerity 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:36.340
 and force remains very stable 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.950
 there are no bps spikes and then suddenly 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.350
 low 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.350
 it's very stable and that's why you have to 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.940
 use it basically good we're going to 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.800
 talk now about enchantments 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.990
 Well the typical ones you can 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.700
 find in any written guide and 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.700
 missing some things here 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:06.230
 and nothing is that 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:10.619
 use the arcane of torment that what 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:13.129
 you can find in 500 I think I do not know 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.550
 this one has no enchantment 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:19.250
 this is from clinton 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.130
 use smithy and jewelry then here 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.770
 we have to get into having 23 of 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.960
 outer index 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.960
 in the chest the typical Maria in all the 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.900
 statistics 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.900
 achievement soles 50 attack power 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.240
 in the gloves and we do not have engineering 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.840
 because we have a shredder that 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.560
 what is more 44 of attack plan 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.069
 the belt always put the buckle 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.069
 that one to lie to you a pragmatic 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:54.510
 always or always 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:57.050
 the pants as the patch and I know 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.610
 of leatherwork I think I do not know 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.740
 35 attack sports and 25 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.690
 critical as I say all this I'm going 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.700
 naming well above you can 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.870
 find in any guide without any 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.730
 kind of problem the name its 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.730
 location what is worth 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.780
 and in the boots that he wants comes what 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.970
 interesting of enchantment and is that if 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.230
 the forests are static 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.940
 that is, they do not move much 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.400
 Well, we can use this that we 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.890
 increases the dps a bit but increases 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.930
 and if the voice is more dynamic to move 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.019
 of having to be mediating that from here 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.530
 and there the pj has to be like that 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.560
 the marrow or without dragon 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.150
 king exÃ¡nime then here we will put a 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.450
 enchantment that increase speed 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:50.450
 of the career increase forgiveness increase 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.010
 the speed of career minimally bone 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.819
 running increases the speed a 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.010
 bit 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.770
 and I think it gives us 8% plus 8 index of 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.380
 critical blow or 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.010
 it's little but good 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.010
 to 33 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.020
 is that 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.630
 I sincerely, because 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.080
 by simple laziness and vagrancy 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.080
 directly 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.450
 I do not change the enchantment I leave it here 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.620
 in more 32 of power that that basically 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:29.449
 why 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.100
 I have already done many times 25 normal 25 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.740
 logical and I already have the experience 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.680
 enough to almost not die for 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.139
 not say no voices die in 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.900
 at least three first or I would even say 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.900
 even teacher without drinks to 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.570
 they are not complicated poses of guides 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.639
 how to do them if the 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.960
 opportunity for the brotherhood then 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.600
 we can get there 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.960
 asintra gossa because right now we are 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.330
 doing a compilation of objects or 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.940
 be a far middle of life for 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.490
 catch some equipment and upload 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.319
 quickly to higher voices I already 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.500
 I'm a well-equipped team, I would say 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:13.910
 even that with six faces of gs 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.190
 if you know how to handle a pj you can 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.350
 do without problem some 25 logics and without 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.590
 no type 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.750
 the enchantment of weapons because the 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.300
 always dilemma where I put 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.690
 blade where I put crossed 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:34.220
 let's see do it the way I want 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:37.520
 basically by conventionality because 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.230
 because I know that by the agreement 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.470
 people always carry it the main one 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.850
 but given and on the other blade but that 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.400
 without problem we can put it in 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.990
 blades and in crusaders there is no longer 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.810
 study that has left fiori 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:54.770
 crafting in which they tell me that this one 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:57.729
 jump before that although it jumps dgt 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.580
 and vice versa does not matter 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:03.520
 there is no study of said said 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.219
 enchantment from his position in that 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.069
 hand must be and as it does not say 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:12.219
 well, it's not even known that when I 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:14.499
 I give the doll, basically, this is 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:18.009
 cumulative each hit that hits 

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:21.830
 is going to increase and this then 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:25.050
 usually jump with some speed 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.740
 it does not matter what you put here or here 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:31.919
 good guys this has been the guide 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:34.139
 I promised the professions like that over and 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.909
 the enchantments as good has no 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:37.540
 It has a lot of history, it does not have much 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:39.640
 science 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.670
 and in the next game play then we're going to 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:46.790
 see where we should place our 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:51.390
 gems to optimize the 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:54.340
 the slot bonus depending on 68 or yes 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:56.240
 4 or if it is 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.030
 6 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.990
 according to guys we see in the 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.530
 following 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.530
 see you later
