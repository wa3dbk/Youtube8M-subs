and might be another name for it but I'm

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.759 
and might be another name for it but I'm
just<00:00:08.309> haven't<00:00:08.610> seen<00:00:08.790> it<00:00:09.019> and<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.740> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
just haven't seen it and this is the

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:21.440 
just haven't seen it and this is the
general<00:00:10.980> gist<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.790> what<00:00:11.910> we're<00:00:12.059> doing

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.450 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:36.250 

so<00:00:22.280> first<00:00:23.280> thing<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.490> want<00:00:23.520> to<00:00:23.730> say

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.560 

if<00:00:37.260> your<00:00:37.470> hoop<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:38.220> bigger<00:00:38.850> than<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.270> it's

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
if your hoop is bigger than this it's

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.940 
if your hoop is bigger than this it's
just<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.200> be<00:00:40.320> hard<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:40.800> this

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
just it's going to be hard to do this

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.790 
just it's going to be hard to do this
move<00:00:41.220> because<00:00:41.780> you<00:00:42.780> know<00:00:42.900> it's<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.470> gonna<00:00:43.620> be

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
move because you know it's it's gonna be

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.549 
move because you know it's it's gonna be
too<00:00:44.010> hard<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.640> able<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> pull<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.210> across<00:00:45.559> so

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
too hard to be able to pull it across so

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.229 
too hard to be able to pull it across so
a<00:00:46.949> little<00:00:47.340> bit<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.550> smaller<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.090> would<00:00:48.180> be

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
a little bit of a smaller it would be

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.799 
a little bit of a smaller it would be
better<00:00:48.449> for<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:49.220> so<00:00:50.420> let's<00:00:51.420> start<00:00:51.690> right

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
better for this so let's start right

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.200 
better for this so let's start right
into<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.460> you're<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.519> to<00:00:53.730> start<00:00:53.970> with<00:00:54.120> your

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
into it you're going to start with your

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.750 
into it you're going to start with your
hands<00:00:54.690> right<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.470> then<00:00:55.739> though<00:00:55.890> okay<00:00:56.460> you

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
hands right here then though okay you

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.460 
hands right here then though okay you
get<00:00:56.850> your<00:00:57.000> waist<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.600> can<00:00:57.720> be<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.199> at<00:00:58.320> your

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
get your waist it can be here at your

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.930 
get your waist it can be here at your
head<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:59.250> doesn't<00:00:59.339> matter

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
head that doesn't matter

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.049 
head that doesn't matter
and<00:01:00.750> basically<00:01:01.050> we're<00:01:01.589> going<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.860> mimic<00:01:02.519> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
and basically we're going to mimic the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.340 
and basically we're going to mimic the
to<00:01:03.360> be<00:01:03.600> tweaked<00:01:03.870> okay<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:07.050> do<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
to be tweaked okay so if you can do the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.779 
to be tweaked okay so if you can do the
2p<00:01:09.800> that's<00:01:10.800> all<00:01:10.950> we're<00:01:11.100> doing<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.460> actually

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
2p that's all we're doing we actually

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.870 
2p that's all we're doing we actually
don't<00:01:12.030> change<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.840> hand<00:01:13.520> keeps<00:01:14.520> doing

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
don't change that this hand keeps doing

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.520 
don't change that this hand keeps doing
that<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> whole<00:01:15.390> time<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.930> still<00:01:16.200> does<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
that the whole time it still does the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.980 
that the whole time it still does the
2v2<00:01:16.710> leave<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.340> hand<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.539> gonna<00:01:18.660> slide

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990

to turn it and put it notice that this

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.910 
to turn it and put it notice that this
hand<00:01:27.740> my<00:01:28.740> left<00:01:29.130> hand<00:01:29.399> is<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.119> top<00:01:30.300> right<00:01:30.600> now

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
hand my left hand is on top right now

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.290 
hand my left hand is on top right now
and<00:01:31.920> I'm<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.220> take<00:01:32.429> my<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.670> hand<00:01:33.060> and

I'm going to continue

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.499 
I'm going to continue
now<00:01:36.119> my<00:01:36.330> right<00:01:36.689> hand<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.290> top<00:01:38.150> so<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.210> can

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
now my right hand is on top so you can

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.780 
now my right hand is on top so you can
do<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:40.280> your<00:01:41.280> hands<00:01:41.720> never<00:01:42.720> cross<00:01:43.790> they're

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
do this your hands never cross they're

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.570 
do this your hands never cross they're
always<00:01:45.060> open

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.300 

so<00:01:50.150> when<00:01:50.960> you're<00:01:51.080> here<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:51.530> could<00:01:51.710> also<00:01:51.890> turn

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
so when you're here you could also turn

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.900 
so when you're here you could also turn
that<00:01:52.550> right<00:01:52.790> back<00:01:53.030> in<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.380> reverse<00:01:54.910> okay

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
that right back in to the reverse okay

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.370 
that right back in to the reverse okay
so<00:01:56.090> if<00:01:56.390> you<00:01:56.510> don't<00:01:56.660> know<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.810> reverse<00:01:57.110> review

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
so if you don't know the reverse review

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.980 
so if you don't know the reverse review
just<00:01:57.500> taking<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:58.010> behind<00:01:58.730> you<00:01:59.000> so<00:01:59.600> since<00:01:59.840> this

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
just taking it behind you so since this

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.230 
just taking it behind you so since this
hand<00:02:00.260> is<00:02:00.410> on<00:02:00.530> top<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:01.670> next<00:02:01.700> hand<00:02:02.150> that's

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
hand is on top the next hand that's

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.660 
hand is on top the next hand that's
going<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.480> become<00:02:02.570> top<00:02:02.930> is<00:02:03.200> my<00:02:03.440> left<00:02:03.680> hand<00:02:03.950> so

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
going to become top is my left hand so

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.510 
going to become top is my left hand so
I'm<00:02:04.760> taking<00:02:04.940> it<00:02:05.270> down<00:02:05.620> as<00:02:06.620> you<00:02:06.800> can<00:02:06.950> see<00:02:07.190> I'm
