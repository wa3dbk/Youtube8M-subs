video to illustrate some of the muscles
that<00:00:56.910> will<00:00:57.239> be<00:00:57.420> worked<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.110> have<00:00:58.590> good

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
that will be worked on to have good

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.950 
that will be worked on to have good
defined<00:00:59.340> back<00:00:59.640> muscles<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.780> do

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
defined back muscles you have to do

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.439 
defined back muscles you have to do
different<00:01:01.580> exercises<00:01:02.580> to<00:01:02.820> target<00:01:03.420> different

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
different exercises to target different

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.170 
different exercises to target different
muscle<00:01:03.870> fibers<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.610> why<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:06.030> this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180

a bit higher and if I don't use the pad
I<00:03:38.040> find<00:03:38.550> myself<00:03:38.760> moving<00:03:39.270> too<00:03:39.630> much<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:40.050> I

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
ball is centered the way you hold it

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.080

again<00:05:27.319> still<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:27.830> same<00:05:28.039> movement<00:05:28.550> it's<00:05:28.849> just

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
again still the same movement it's just

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.309 
again still the same movement it's just
the<00:05:29.330> location<00:05:29.750> of<00:05:29.870> my<00:05:30.050> arm<00:05:30.289> my<00:05:31.189> hand<00:05:31.490> and<00:05:32.319> and

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 
the location of my arm my hand and and

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:37.450 
the location of my arm my hand and and
you<00:05:33.529> can<00:05:33.710> see<00:05:33.860> all<00:05:34.039> the<00:05:34.370> my<00:05:35.270> trap<00:05:35.710> my<00:05:36.710> lat<00:05:37.069> all

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
you can see all the my trap my lat all

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.959 
you can see all the my trap my lat all
the<00:05:37.699> muscles<00:05:37.879> that's<00:05:38.300> being<00:05:38.539> used<00:05:38.870> to<00:05:39.969> being

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:40.969 
the muscles that's being used to being

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:43.869 
the muscles that's being used to being
used<00:05:41.210> so<00:05:41.990> now<00:05:42.139> I<00:05:42.169> changed<00:05:42.740> the<00:05:42.830> position<00:05:43.340> of<00:05:43.520> my

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:43.879 
used so now I changed the position of my

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:46.990 
used so now I changed the position of my
hand<00:05:43.909> again<00:05:44.689> I'm<00:05:44.930> doing<00:05:45.229> underhand<00:05:45.860> this<00:05:46.849> is

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
hand again I'm doing underhand this is

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.939 
hand again I'm doing underhand this is
why<00:05:47.120> this<00:05:47.180> one's<00:05:47.659> a<00:05:47.810> bit<00:05:47.990> more<00:05:48.229> flexible<00:05:48.770> than

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
why this one's a bit more flexible than

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:53.230 
why this one's a bit more flexible than
the<00:05:49.159> one<00:05:49.550> I<00:05:49.580> did<00:05:49.969> before<00:05:50.000> I<00:05:51.669> guess<00:05:52.669> I<00:05:52.819> could<00:05:53.060> do

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
the one I did before I guess I could do

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.360 
the one I did before I guess I could do
it<00:05:53.330> but<00:05:53.509> I<00:05:53.689> think<00:05:53.930> I<00:05:54.020> did<00:05:54.229> try<00:05:54.439> it<00:05:54.500> once<00:05:54.860> on<00:05:55.159> the

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
it but I think I did try it once on the

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.230 
it but I think I did try it once on the
other<00:05:55.550> machine<00:05:55.759> it<00:05:56.240> just<00:05:56.479> felt<00:05:56.779> a<00:05:57.969> little<00:05:58.969> bit

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
other machine it just felt a little bit

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.480 
other machine it just felt a little bit
uncomfortable<00:05:59.389> because<00:06:00.199> the<00:06:00.620> machine<00:06:01.009> is<00:06:01.219> so

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
uncomfortable because the machine is so

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.089 
uncomfortable because the machine is so
fixed<00:06:02.120> that<00:06:02.599> I<00:06:02.870> can't<00:06:03.139> really<00:06:03.319> do<00:06:03.589> all<00:06:03.800> the

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:04.099 
fixed that I can't really do all the

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:05.800 
fixed that I can't really do all the
different<00:06:04.729> things<00:06:05.029> that<00:06:05.120> I'm<00:06:05.360> doing<00:06:05.659> right

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
different things that I'm doing right

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.540 
different things that I'm doing right
now<00:06:05.870> with<00:06:06.259> this<00:06:06.520> with<00:06:07.520> the<00:06:07.699> cable<00:06:08.089> so<00:06:09.400> you<00:06:10.400> know

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
now with this with the cable so you know

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.860 
now with this with the cable so you know
sometimes<00:06:11.060> you<00:06:11.180> just<00:06:11.210> have<00:06:11.419> to<00:06:11.659> play<00:06:11.839> with

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
sometimes you just have to play with

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.379 
sometimes you just have to play with
this<00:06:12.139> stuff<00:06:12.469> the<00:06:13.339> machines<00:06:13.699> and<00:06:14.029> see<00:06:14.210> what's

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389 
this stuff the machines and see what's

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.140 
this stuff the machines and see what's
the<00:06:14.449> best<00:06:14.479> what<00:06:15.139> works<00:06:15.349> best<00:06:15.860> for<00:06:16.009> you<00:06:16.219> so

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
the best what works best for you so

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.089 
the best what works best for you so
pretty<00:06:17.779> much<00:06:17.960> all<00:06:18.139> I'm<00:06:18.319> doing<00:06:18.589> is<00:06:18.680> showing<00:06:18.919> you

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
pretty much all I'm doing is showing you

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.309 
pretty much all I'm doing is showing you
different<00:06:19.279> ways<00:06:19.669> you<00:06:19.849> could<00:06:20.060> use<00:06:20.509> it<00:06:20.750> and<00:06:21.080> I

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:21.319 
different ways you could use it and I

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.200 
different ways you could use it and I
didn't<00:06:21.560> put<00:06:21.770> a<00:06:22.159> heavy<00:06:22.490> weight<00:06:22.759> because<00:06:23.029> I<00:06:23.150> know

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
didn't put a heavy weight because I know

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.249 
didn't put a heavy weight because I know
I<00:06:23.330> was<00:06:23.449> going<00:06:23.629> to<00:06:23.719> be<00:06:23.779> doing<00:06:23.930> a<00:06:24.080> lot<00:06:24.229> of

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:24.259 
I was going to be doing a lot of

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:27.279 
I was going to be doing a lot of
repetitions<00:06:25.039> and<00:06:26.000> I<00:06:26.120> took<00:06:26.180> a<00:06:26.419> little<00:06:26.569> break

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:27.289 
repetitions and I took a little break

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.730 
repetitions and I took a little break
and<00:06:27.620> now<00:06:28.339> I<00:06:28.370> sit<00:06:28.759> back<00:06:28.909> down<00:06:29.150> like<00:06:29.779> myself<00:06:30.080> I'm

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
and now I sit back down like myself I'm

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.700 
and now I sit back down like myself I'm
using<00:06:31.009> another<00:06:31.430> like<00:06:31.729> grip<00:06:32.509> but<00:06:33.050> this<00:06:33.289> time<00:06:33.500> I

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
using another like grip but this time I

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.899 
using another like grip but this time I
am<00:06:33.919> go<00:06:34.129> my<00:06:34.310> body<00:06:35.110> about<00:06:36.110> I<00:06:36.169> guess<00:06:36.740> 130<00:06:37.430> degrees

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:37.909 
am go my body about I guess 130 degrees

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.990 
am go my body about I guess 130 degrees
and<00:06:38.270> I<00:06:39.050> start<00:06:39.379> doing<00:06:39.439> the<00:06:39.740> same<00:06:39.979> movement<00:06:40.370> but

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
and I start doing the same movement but

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.379 
and I start doing the same movement but
different<00:06:41.689> angle<00:06:42.469> so<00:06:43.099> all<00:06:43.729> this<00:06:44.060> is<00:06:44.360> just

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:44.389 
different angle so all this is just

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:46.779 
different angle so all this is just
being<00:06:45.050> targeted<00:06:45.319> different<00:06:45.889> muscle<00:06:46.370> fibers

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:46.789 
being targeted different muscle fibers
