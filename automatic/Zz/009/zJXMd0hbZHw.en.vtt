so<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:01.950> a<00:01:02.100> mascara<00:01:02.399> obviously

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
so what is it it's a mascara obviously

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.290 
so what is it it's a mascara obviously
but<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.239> may<00:01:03.360> notice<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.409> huge<00:01:05.030> it's<00:01:06.030> much

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
but you may notice it is huge it's much

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.990 
but you may notice it is huge it's much
bigger<00:01:06.479> than<00:01:06.630> any<00:01:06.870> other<00:01:07.050> mascaras<00:01:07.620> I've<00:01:07.770> ever

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.280 
bigger than any other mascaras I've ever
bought<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> reason<00:01:09.720> being<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.110> because

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
bought and the reason being is because

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.260 
bought and the reason being is because
it's<00:01:10.560> got<00:01:10.710> two<00:01:11.010> different<00:01:11.400> ends<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.060> two

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it's got two different ends of two

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.660 
it's got two different ends of two
different<00:01:12.479> ones<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:13.800> first<00:01:14.070> side<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.340> for

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
different ones the first side is for

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.880 
different ones the first side is for
volume<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.869> brush<00:01:16.080> looks<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.470> lot<00:01:16.680> like

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
volume and the brush looks a lot like

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.280 
volume and the brush looks a lot like
the<00:01:17.250> brush<00:01:17.550> that<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.759> recently<00:01:18.210> showed<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.020> for

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the brush that I recently showed you for

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.170 
the brush that I recently showed you for
Maybelline<00:01:20.009> rocket<00:01:20.310> mascara<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.940> it's<00:01:21.060> got

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
Maybelline rocket mascara so it's got

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.270 
Maybelline rocket mascara so it's got
quite<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.450> thick<00:01:21.750> barrel<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.650> little<00:01:23.009> tiny

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
quite a thick barrel with little tiny

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.920 
quite a thick barrel with little tiny
little<00:01:23.490> bristles<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.600> idea<00:01:24.720> of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
little bristles on it and the idea of

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.210 
little bristles on it and the idea of
that<00:01:25.140> end<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.740> gives<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> lot<00:01:26.190> of

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
that end is that it gives you a lot of

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.640 
that end is that it gives you a lot of
volume<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.910> then<00:01:27.450> after<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.470> we're

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
volume and then after that we're

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.070 
volume and then after that we're
supposed<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.100> use<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.640> other<00:01:29.820> side<00:01:30.180> which<00:01:30.810> is

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
supposed to use the other side which is

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.230 
supposed to use the other side which is
called<00:01:31.409> darker<00:01:31.890> lacquer<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.940> has<00:01:33.090> got

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
called darker lacquer and this has got

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.010 
called darker lacquer and this has got
the<00:01:33.360> more<00:01:33.509> traditional<00:01:34.050> type<00:01:34.289> of<00:01:34.369> brush<00:01:36.020> which

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.540 
the more traditional type of brush which
is<00:01:37.050> just<00:01:37.350> basically<00:01:37.470> sort<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.100> more<00:01:38.280> soft

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
is just basically sort of more soft

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.340 
is just basically sort of more soft
bristles<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.600> idea<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.050> is<00:01:40.200> it's

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
bristles and the idea of that is it's

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.219 
bristles and the idea of that is it's
meant<00:01:40.440> to<00:01:40.530> give<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.860> really<00:01:41.250> dramatic<00:01:41.700> color

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
meant to give you really dramatic color

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.810 
meant to give you really dramatic color
so<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.259> decided<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.220> was<00:01:44.340> going<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.580> review<00:01:44.759> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
so I decided if I was going to review a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.639 
so I decided if I was going to review a
product<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.300> had<00:01:45.479> better<00:01:45.690> use<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.080> properly<00:01:46.410> so

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
product I had better use it properly so

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.410 
product I had better use it properly so
I<00:01:46.680> went<00:01:46.860> onto<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.130> Max<00:01:47.340> Factor<00:01:47.460> website<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.360> I

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
I went onto the Max Factor website and I

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.240 
I went onto the Max Factor website and I
actually<00:01:48.600> read<00:01:49.020> how<00:01:49.259> they<00:01:49.440> suggest<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.220> use

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
actually read how they suggest you use

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.820 
actually read how they suggest you use
the<00:01:50.550> product<00:01:50.940> so<00:01:51.810> what<00:01:52.020> they<00:01:52.170> suggest<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.649> do

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
the product so what they suggest you do

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.580 
the product so what they suggest you do
is<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.399> use<00:01:53.700> side<00:01:53.970> one<00:01:54.300> three<00:01:55.020> times<00:01:55.320> so

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
is that you use side one three times so

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.560 
is that you use side one three times so
they<00:01:55.679> put<00:01:55.860> three<00:01:56.100> coats<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.580> side<00:01:56.820> one<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.270> both

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
they put three coats of side one on both

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.810 
they put three coats of side one on both
sets<00:01:57.929> of<00:01:58.050> your<00:01:58.170> lashes<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.710> then<00:01:59.160> two<00:01:59.460> coats

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
sets of your lashes and then two coats

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.090 
sets of your lashes and then two coats
of<00:02:00.030> side<00:02:00.270> two<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:01.050> get<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.350> desired<00:02:01.679> effect

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
of side two to get this desired effect

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.740 
of side two to get this desired effect
so<00:02:02.700> that's<00:02:02.880> exactly<00:02:03.119> what<00:02:03.300> I<00:02:03.420> did

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.499 

so<00:02:06.650> what<00:02:06.920> did<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:07.310> love<00:02:07.490> about<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:07.970> what<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.149> did

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
so what did I love about it what I did

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.210 
so what did I love about it what I did
love<00:02:08.660> about<00:02:08.930> it<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.200> when<00:02:09.380> you<00:02:09.410> use<00:02:09.530> slide<00:02:09.950> 1

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
love about it is when you use slide 1

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.340 
love about it is when you use slide 1
the<00:02:10.490> extreme<00:02:10.820> volume<00:02:11.120> side<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.870> do<00:02:12.080> get

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
the extreme volume side you do get

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.230 
the extreme volume side you do get
extreme<00:02:12.860> volume<00:02:13.220> in<00:02:13.400> my<00:02:13.640> opinion<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.060> do

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
extreme volume in my opinion you do

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.750 
extreme volume in my opinion you do
anyway<00:02:14.600> even<00:02:15.230> with<00:02:15.530> using<00:02:15.860> 3<00:02:16.070> codes<00:02:16.310> I<00:02:16.490> found

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
anyway even with using 3 codes I found

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.520 
anyway even with using 3 codes I found
that<00:02:16.820> didn't<00:02:17.060> really<00:02:17.270> get<00:02:17.390> any<00:02:17.570> company<00:02:18.050> so

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
that didn't really get any company so

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.470 
that didn't really get any company so
that<00:02:18.740> was<00:02:19.460> what<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:19.850> loved

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
that was what I loved

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.010 
that was what I loved
what<00:02:21.380> else<00:02:21.530> did<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.740> love<00:02:21.860> about<00:02:22.100> it<00:02:22.400> not<00:02:23.030> much

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
what else did I love about it not much

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.500 
what else did I love about it not much
so<00:02:25.890> what<00:02:26.100> were<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.310> downsides<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:26.940> my<00:02:27.060> opinion

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
so what were the downsides in my opinion

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.030 
so what were the downsides in my opinion
well<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:28.110> was<00:02:28.200> difficult<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.740> apply<00:02:28.890> it

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
well it was difficult to apply it

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.650 
well it was difficult to apply it
because<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.640> shape<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.270> actual

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
because of the shape of the actual

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.650 
because of the shape of the actual
handle<00:02:31.260> when<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:31.830> take<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.220> brush<00:02:32.370> out<00:02:32.660> you

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
handle when you take the brush out you

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.990 
handle when you take the brush out you
have<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.960> use<00:02:34.110> this<00:02:34.320> side<00:02:34.590> or<00:02:34.980> even<00:02:35.340> just<00:02:35.820> this

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
have to use this side or even just this

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.850 
have to use this side or even just this
middle<00:02:36.270> bit<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.840> actually<00:02:37.170> apply<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.710> it's

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
middle bit to actually apply it and it's

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.280 
middle bit to actually apply it and it's
really<00:02:38.100> chunky<00:02:38.930> especially<00:02:39.930> if<00:02:40.020> you're<00:02:40.170> new

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
really chunky especially if you're new

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.930 
really chunky especially if you're new
to<00:02:40.320> using<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.740> sky<00:02:41.070> it's<00:02:41.370> going<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.550> be<00:02:41.700> really

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
to using the sky it's going to be really

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.970 
to using the sky it's going to be really
difficult<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.480> get<00:02:43.200> used<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.800> even

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
difficult to get used to that and even

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.980 
difficult to get used to that and even
if<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.490> use<00:02:44.670> mascara<00:02:45.120> all<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.390> time<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.870> is

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
if you use mascara all the time it is

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.050 
if you use mascara all the time it is
not<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.620> best<00:02:46.740> design<00:02:47.070> to<00:02:47.370> actually<00:02:47.520> apply<00:02:47.940> it

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
not the best design to actually apply it

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.580 
not the best design to actually apply it
with<00:02:48.270> in<00:02:48.390> terms<00:02:48.600> of<00:02:48.690> holding<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.050> handle

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
with in terms of holding the handle

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.280 
with in terms of holding the handle
I<00:02:49.620> suppose<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.550> isn't<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.000> deal-breaker<00:02:51.630> that

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
I suppose that isn't a deal-breaker that

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.040 
I suppose that isn't a deal-breaker that
I<00:02:52.320> could<00:02:52.710> get<00:02:53.100> over<00:02:53.160> but<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.510> other<00:02:54.750> downside

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
I could get over but the other downside

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.380 
I could get over but the other downside
of<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.860> deal-breaker<00:02:56.280> for<00:02:56.670> me<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.120> have

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
of it is a deal-breaker for me I have

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.700 
of it is a deal-breaker for me I have
been<00:02:57.540> using<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.990> for<00:02:58.020> two<00:02:58.380> or<00:02:58.410> three<00:02:58.680> weeks

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
been using it for two or three weeks

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.850 
been using it for two or three weeks
almost<00:02:59.640> every<00:03:00.120> day<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.320> have<00:03:01.440> not<00:03:01.710> been

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
almost every day and I have not been

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.410 
almost every day and I have not been
able<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.250> apply<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.580> without<00:03:03.030> getting

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
able to apply it without getting

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.290 
able to apply it without getting
smudging<00:03:04.490> what<00:03:05.490> is<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.700> point<00:03:05.850> in<00:03:06.030> having<00:03:06.120> a

smudging what is the point in having a

smudging what is the point in having a
mascara<00:03:06.920> especially<00:03:07.920> if<00:03:08.010> you've<00:03:08.130> got<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.580> heavy

eye makeup on mascara is always the last

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.680 
eye makeup on mascara is always the last

there<00:03:16.830> steps<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:17.310> how<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.460> use<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:18.120> final<00:03:18.900> step

there steps of how to use a final step

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.320 
there steps of how to use a final step
is<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.590> use<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.800> q-tip<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.520> some<00:03:20.790> eye<00:03:20.940> makeup

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
is to use a q-tip and some eye makeup

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.570 
is to use a q-tip and some eye makeup
remover<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.930> remove<00:03:22.230> any<00:03:22.620> smudges<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:23.550> I

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
remover to remove any smudges so I

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.830 
remover to remove any smudges so I
thought<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:23.970> was<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.120> bit<00:03:24.240> strange<00:03:24.510> because

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
thought that was a bit strange because

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.500 
thought that was a bit strange because
as<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.920> company<00:03:26.550> they<00:03:26.670> clearly<00:03:26.970> realize<00:03:27.300> that

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
as the company they clearly realize that

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.760 
as the company they clearly realize that
their<00:03:27.660> product<00:03:27.960> is<00:03:28.080> prone<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.560> bit<00:03:28.680> of

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
their product is prone to a bit of

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.330 
their product is prone to a bit of
smudging

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
smudging

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.070 
smudging
so<00:03:29.700> rather<00:03:29.880> than<00:03:30.000> fix<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.450> problem<00:03:30.840> they've

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
so rather than fix the problem they've

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.990 
so rather than fix the problem they've
just<00:03:31.350> added<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.890> as<00:03:31.980> an<00:03:32.070> extra<00:03:32.310> step<00:03:32.520> on<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
just added it as an extra step on the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.760 
just added it as an extra step on the
how<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.210> use<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.660> their<00:03:33.780> mascara<00:03:33.960> so<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.440> found

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
how to use it their mascara so I found

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.440 
how to use it their mascara so I found
that<00:03:34.830> a<00:03:34.890> bit<00:03:34.980> odd<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:35.790> what<00:03:35.940> I'll<00:03:36.060> do<00:03:36.210> now<00:03:36.420> is

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
that a bit odd so what I'll do now is

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.320 
that a bit odd so what I'll do now is
I'll<00:03:36.930> show<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.230> three<00:03:37.620> pictures<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:38.340> my<00:03:38.910> eyes

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
I'll show you three pictures of my eyes

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.170 
I'll show you three pictures of my eyes
so<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.020> first<00:03:40.260> one<00:03:40.470> is<00:03:40.650> going<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:40.950> be<00:03:41.190> without

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
so the first one is going to be without

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.300 
so the first one is going to be without
any<00:03:42.360> mascara<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:43.350> second<00:03:43.740> one<00:03:43.890> is<00:03:44.040> when<00:03:44.190> I've

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
any mascara the second one is when I've

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.430 
any mascara the second one is when I've
done<00:03:44.460> those<00:03:44.610> three<00:03:44.880> layers<00:03:45.090> of<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.870> step<00:03:46.140> one

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
done those three layers of the step one

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.400 
done those three layers of the step one
and<00:03:46.710> the<00:03:47.100> third<00:03:47.370> one<00:03:47.670> is<00:03:47.910> going<00:03:48.570> to<00:03:48.690> be<00:03:48.930> when

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
and the third one is going to be when

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.550 
and the third one is going to be when
I've<00:03:49.770> done<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.100> two<00:03:50.280> layers<00:03:50.490> of<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.790> step<00:03:51.030> two

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
I've done the two layers of the step two

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.360 
I've done the two layers of the step two
so<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.590> don't<00:03:52.830> know<00:03:52.890> whether<00:03:53.040> you'll<00:03:53.190> agree

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
so I don't know whether you'll agree

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.670 
so I don't know whether you'll agree

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
with me but in my personal opinion the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.770 
with me but in my personal opinion the
best<00:03:55.920> look<00:03:56.460> out<00:03:56.700> of<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.910> three<00:03:57.120> peaches<00:03:57.600> is

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
best look out of the three peaches is

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.480 
best look out of the three peaches is
the<00:03:57.810> middle<00:03:58.200> one<00:03:58.230> which<00:03:58.530> is<00:03:58.650> actually<00:03:59.190> when

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.640 
the middle one which is actually when
I've<00:03:59.610> just<00:03:59.640> used<00:04:00.090> side<00:04:00.330> one<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.500> when<00:04:01.620> I

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
I've just used side one and and when I

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.950

put<00:04:01.890> side<00:04:02.100> two<00:04:02.340> on<00:04:02.520> I<00:04:02.730> don't<00:04:03.210> like<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.630> effect

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.510 
put side two on I don't like the effect
compared<00:04:04.320> to<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.530> previous<00:04:04.920> one<00:04:05.130> so<00:04:05.160> I'll

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
compared to the previous one so I'll

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:16.909 
compared to the previous one so I'll
show<00:04:05.700> those<00:04:05.850> to<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.060> now
