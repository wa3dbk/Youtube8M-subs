00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.359 

the<00:00:12.959> three<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.289> us<00:00:13.379> are<00:00:13.559> keen<00:00:13.740> photographers

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:14.369 
the three of us are keen photographers

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.490 
the three of us are keen photographers
and<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.029> last<00:00:15.240> few<00:00:15.480> years<00:00:15.509> we've

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
and in the last few years we've

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.409 
and in the last few years we've
developed<00:00:16.980> an<00:00:17.070> interest<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.640> taking<00:00:17.939> pictures

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:18.419 
developed an interest in taking pictures

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.050 
developed an interest in taking pictures
with<00:00:18.509> pinhole<00:00:18.990> cameras<00:00:19.460> which<00:00:20.460> seems<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.939> me

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
with pinhole cameras which seems to me

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.900 
with pinhole cameras which seems to me
to<00:00:21.210> be<00:00:21.240> growing<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.689> popularity<00:00:22.169> I<00:00:22.789> think<00:00:23.789> it

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
to be growing in popularity I think it

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.450 
to be growing in popularity I think it
was<00:00:24.060> an<00:00:24.180> Arabic<00:00:24.689> astronomer<00:00:25.439> who<00:00:25.619> first

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
was an Arabic astronomer who first

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.010 
was an Arabic astronomer who first
discovered<00:00:26.790> the<00:00:26.969> concept<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.660> pinhole

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
discovered the concept of a pinhole

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.369 
discovered the concept of a pinhole
camera<00:00:28.550> around<00:00:29.550> about<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.969> 10th<00:00:30.210> century<00:00:30.450> but

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
camera you really have to think very

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.810 
camera you really have to think very
much<00:01:56.600> about<00:01:56.660> the<00:01:57.020> technique<00:01:57.410> involved<00:01:57.950> but

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
much about the technique involved but

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.480 
much about the technique involved but
with<00:01:59.330> pinhole<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.170> equipment<00:02:00.620> is<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:01.010> basic

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
with pinhole the equipment is so basic

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.970 
with pinhole the equipment is so basic
that<00:02:01.730> we<00:02:02.600> have<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:02.870> think<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.200> lot<00:02:03.380> more<00:02:03.680> about

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
that we have to think a lot more about

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.830 
that we have to think a lot more about
the<00:02:04.130> technique<00:02:04.520> before<00:02:04.880> capturing<00:02:05.270> an<00:02:05.600> image

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
the technique before capturing an image

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.350 
the technique before capturing an image
and<00:02:06.140> for<00:02:07.070> us<00:02:07.160> that's<00:02:07.310> definitely<00:02:08.030> one<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.210> the

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
and for us that's definitely one of the

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.589 
and for us that's definitely one of the
most<00:02:08.479> satisfying<00:02:09.170> things<00:02:09.290> about<00:02:09.800> it

traditional photographs what we've

a journey of self-discovery exploring

a journey of self-discovery exploring
just<00:02:57.650> what<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:58.040> different<00:02:58.400> perspective<00:02:58.520> is

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
just what that different perspective is

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.050 
just what that different perspective is
going<00:02:59.569> to<00:02:59.660> mean<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.989> each<00:03:00.110> of<00:03:00.319> us<00:03:00.730> knowing<00:03:01.730> will

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
going to mean to each of us knowing will

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.479 
going to mean to each of us knowing will
naturally<00:03:02.540> interpret<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.410> same<00:03:03.620> subject<00:03:04.190> but

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
naturally interpret the same subject but

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.010 
naturally interpret the same subject but

most about pinhole photography is it

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.610 
most about pinhole photography is it
gives<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.630> different<00:03:15.019> perspective<00:03:15.050> on

photograph for us using a pinhole camera
has<00:03:36.290> taught<00:03:36.680> us<00:03:36.890> so<00:03:37.160> much<00:03:37.340> more<00:03:37.610> about

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
has taught us so much more about

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.300 
has taught us so much more about
photography<00:03:38.319> and<00:03:39.319> we<00:03:39.410> definitely<00:03:39.590> feel<00:03:40.040> we're

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
photography and we definitely feel we're

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.840 
photography and we definitely feel we're
moving<00:03:40.670> forwards<00:03:41.120> in<00:03:41.480> artistic<00:03:41.900> development

moving forwards in artistic development

moving forwards in artistic development
some<00:03:43.850> would<00:03:44.000> say<00:03:44.180> moving<00:03:44.569> backwards

some would say moving backwards

some would say moving backwards
technologically<00:03:46.060> but<00:03:47.060> perhaps<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.260> most

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
technologically but perhaps the most

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.069 
technologically but perhaps the most
surprising<00:03:48.650> thing<00:03:49.430> for<00:03:49.640> us<00:03:49.730> has<00:03:50.630> been<00:03:50.870> that

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
surprising thing for us has been that

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.160 
surprising thing for us has been that
taking<00:03:51.560> photographs<00:03:52.180> through<00:03:53.180> such<00:03:53.600> a<00:03:53.630> tiny

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
taking photographs through such a tiny

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.490 
taking photographs through such a tiny
hole<00:03:54.560> has<00:03:55.549> enabled<00:03:55.880> us<00:03:56.269> to<00:03:56.299> see<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.109> world<00:03:57.260> in

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
hole has enabled us to see the world in

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.670
