00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
very dirt-poor budget but this is just

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.809 
very dirt-poor budget but this is just
pure<00:03:10.550> laziness<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:11.540> can<00:03:12.290> handle<00:03:12.500> bad<00:03:12.770> AI<00:03:13.010> but

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
pure laziness I can handle bad AI but

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.660 
pure laziness I can handle bad AI but
this<00:03:13.940> is<00:03:14.120> just<00:03:14.150> pitiful<00:03:14.980> not<00:03:15.980> even<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.340> mighty

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
poorly done there's not much to do but

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.480 
poorly done there's not much to do but
just<00:04:32.570> shoot<00:04:33.050> each<00:04:33.200> other<00:04:33.380> and<00:04:33.740> camp<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.280> wait

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
for someone to come up behind you I

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.070

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
that improved on the past but instead

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.980 
that improved on the past but instead
this<00:04:43.070> game<00:04:43.280> is<00:04:43.490> not<00:04:43.610> even<00:04:43.850> worth<00:04:44.030> its<00:04:44.330> value<00:04:44.900> as

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990
