00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.849
 the deputy pérez cuéllar 

00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:02.720
 other 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.530
 twins plus income 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.720
 so that sap reading value to highlight 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.579
 2 0 80% 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:14.219
 make only 30 34% 15% of what you are spending 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.839
 that's what we need 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:19.839
 they start to manage money in a better way 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.400
 but it is unfair 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.870
 there are many people who say that money is not important to me 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.329
 money is not important to me 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.760
 I would like you to remember for two people of around a million said this 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.340
 and I would like you to remember if you said 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.820
 money is not important to me 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.460
 for me there are other essential things 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.820
 composing helping humanity by such as for example 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.910
 it is said as an example 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.420
 have many additional things that there is not someone but can not buy 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.690
 as love as spiritual wealth 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.980
 like the mote 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.790
 to be able to understand people 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.790
 definitely everything I have said are things 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.470
 very important 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.780
 but nevertheless 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.119
 you have to give the necessary importance to money 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.000
 money is important to you 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.780
 is money becomes a part 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.340
 important 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.160
 in your life 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.320
 or if we do not stop this nobody 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.320
 if you have an opinion a girlfriend 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.240
 what happens if it is that when one travels he will continue insisting 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.300
 everything is important to be able 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.820
 I would like to know how long that person will be near you 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.430
 Exactly the same if you are a woman and you tell your boyfriend time everything is 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.070
 Important for me 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.010
 I would like to know again how long that person 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.890
 it costs near you 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.210
 for some people who like to be in the color khaki 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.930
 but let's say they are people 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.570
 who like love 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.760
 so 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.750
 Exactly the same thing happens with money 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.650
 If you touch 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.509
 3 money is not important to you 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.869
 then imagine how long country to give money near you 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.859
 how much time do I have enriches 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.859
 How much time will you meet all your needs? 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.409
 and how much time can be accumulated 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.459
 it's something to think about 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.829
 then imagine now I want to show a photograph 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.059
 he makes you so many years 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:32.739
 Where is 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.239
 the grandparents 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.869
 grannies 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:37.759
 the aunts 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:43.349
 they were perhaps so famous these lists the employee that will help you our 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.279
 country had to employ the person they are giving in the chores of the 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:48.559
 home 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:51.719
 and all those people who are in that photograph 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:54.719
 they warned in one way or another 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:57.879
 to program your mind 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.039
 to the program comprises with things cd 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:02.779
 I want to be 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:05.639
 they started to have distorted 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.639
 everything you should know about money 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.909
 and I want you to remember 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.099
 like every one of those things that you said 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.150
 Yes, on saturday 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.760
 there in everything that you are doing 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.679
 it is said that when you have to be a year-end, 85% of the 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:26.039
 that we are now 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.309
 go figure 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.450
 when you were 40, 50 or 30 years old 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.739
 85% of what you can currently p programmed two girls from 0 to 7 years 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.699
 yoko p programmed the good and the bad 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.759
 we will see now what concerns us 

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:42.999
 the money 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:46.069
 that you have a hundred eggs 700 potatoes 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.679
 that seemed like another prism 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:50.829
 about money 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.079
 they told you about all the things that came 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.839
 for example remember we will always remember prevention and granny 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:03:59.559
 He said 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:02.599
 the money does not grow you will not know 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.469
 another of the things that I heard airs 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:07.549
 to get the money 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.909
 you must work very hard 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:11.750
 and of course 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.139
 those things are recording my mind 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.359
 and then 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.249
 when we started working thank you boselli was 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.019
 How good a roll generates so much money 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.189
 for 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:25.009
 If I do not work so hard 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.379
 then you start working 6 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:29.270
 10 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.860
 12 works per day 14 hours at táchira 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.110
 because the money to get it 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.610
 you have to work it 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.509
 you have to work very hard to get money 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.199
 this is over the second 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.919
 although it's a matter of time that everything you dedicate to work 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.460
 if it's a matter of taking out the father who weighed when 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.699
 Striving hard 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:51.889
 so 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:53.319
 a guard 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.370
 a security guard 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.479
 a person who spends all night caring for a residence a house a 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:01.430
 Commerce 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.659
 he came to work 12 14 hours a day 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:08.360
 then that person must have allowed a lot of money 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.939
 everis de rico 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:12.729
 however it is not a matter of time 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.529
 It is not a question of which strong work 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:19.819
 it's not a matter of what you have to do is take out the air to get 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.520
 everything depends on the three institutions 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.180
 and this is very fun because when I'm giving lectures to people 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.020
 I asked him what do you think about the leader 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.969
 which is the first thing you have to cover and at this moment you ask the 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.409
 here it is spreading all over 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.379
 I want to lose 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:40.990
 what do you think about the cinema 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.889
 the film 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.479
 this comedy and they keep things 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.099
 this moment is unique 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.490
 you start and bramble when you discover things like what 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.449
 percent maybe money I do not deserve 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.169
 maybe of money or 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.259
 with other people 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:00.449
 maybe 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.629
 the money 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:05.749
 it's a match will be that is not for me 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:08.870
 or maybe you have things in your head as saying 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.650
 Money is the most important thing 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.310
 it's worth thinking about if it's definitely the most important thing in 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.749
 your life 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:20.349
 maybe that value that you have at this moment that money is the most 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:21.639
 important turkey 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.849
 you can fix the problems 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:26.849
 there are many people who are alone 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:29.439
 who have lost their family 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:33.550
 but that they have a lot of money even to give away 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:34.719
 and they do not 

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:36.569
 because they do not simply have
