00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.380
 giving 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.969
 what do you think about this new project of the 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.830
 major league have you participated in 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.560
 other tournaments however this comes from 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.960
 one way you can expect different no 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.029
 yes good of what you heard and what is 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.590
 involved what the elections is 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.420
 important to make a new league and 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.340
 now if it reaches a real world level 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.990
 Olympic games you have played with 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.000
 national team precisely with the 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.610
 sub-20 category inÃ©s just or if not bad 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.380
 I remember with Andrea rodebaugh what 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.750
 seemed the participation now of the 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.010
 girls understudy well well well I see 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.170
 that are working well that already 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.300
 they are dedicating more they are giving their 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.220
 opportunity and are taking advantage of 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.840
 you matrices and advanced editorials but 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.790
 it is a matter of work to return it to 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.530
 always try who we have been in 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.660
 selection we live the games so 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.430
 different I do not know if it happens to you that happens 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.470
 for your mind that you feel when you read a 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.989
 national team match does not matter 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.420
 the category excites me a lot because it is 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.519
 my country and everything and know that I can 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.170
 being there I've been there is something that 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.450
 we must support 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.520
 and a happiness and congratulates them for having 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.930
 advanced take a big step that you think that 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.720
 missing for you to return to the team 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.640
 national as I say that I say that 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.380
 nothing I've been there and it's a matter of 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.509
 see me and I can go back and I'm going to 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.479
 be for the expense that I already notice claudia 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.180
 five goals and talk a little bit to the 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.120
 celeste people that is the project 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.300
 how much time do they have playing together 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.580
 I am two and a half years old so the majority 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.080
 they are like two or three new ones and not 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.480
 we train but thank God we 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.940
 we know we know we are a very team 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.160
 united outside and inside and that's what 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.160
 has helped us to improve already
