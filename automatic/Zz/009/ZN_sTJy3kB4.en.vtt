a<00:06:31.810> couple<00:06:33.130> disappointments<00:06:34.130> well<00:06:34.280> at<00:06:34.370> least

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
a couple disappointments well at least

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.700 
a couple disappointments well at least
one<00:06:34.850> disappointment<00:06:35.660> is<00:06:35.810> that<00:06:35.840> you<00:06:36.290> cannot

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
one disappointment is that you cannot

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.390 
one disappointment is that you cannot
copy<00:06:37.160> files<00:06:37.760> from<00:06:38.240> an<00:06:38.600> SD<00:06:38.960> card<00:06:38.990> to<00:06:39.620> the

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
copy files from an SD card to the

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.120 
copy files from an SD card to the
SanDisk<00:06:41.000> storage<00:06:42.340> drive<00:06:43.690> using<00:06:44.690> the<00:06:44.840> app

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
SanDisk storage drive using the app

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.340 
SanDisk storage drive using the app
obviously<00:06:46.130> when<00:06:46.850> you<00:06:46.970> connect<00:06:47.330> this<00:06:47.510> by<00:06:47.780> USB

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
obviously when you connect this by USB

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.230 
obviously when you connect this by USB
to<00:06:48.530> your<00:06:48.590> computer<00:06:48.650> it's<00:06:49.460> going<00:06:49.910> to<00:06:49.970> mount

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
to your computer it's going to mount

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.410 
to your computer it's going to mount
this<00:06:50.480> device<00:06:50.930> and<00:06:51.230> the<00:06:52.040> SD<00:06:52.400> card<00:06:52.700> if<00:06:52.970> it's<00:06:53.240> been

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:53.420 
this device and the SD card if it's been

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.860 
this device and the SD card if it's been
inserted<00:06:53.840> as<00:06:54.230> a<00:06:54.430> volume<00:06:55.430> on<00:06:55.790> your<00:06:56.030> computer<00:06:56.570> so

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:56.870 
inserted as a volume on your computer so

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.200 
inserted as a volume on your computer so
at<00:06:57.020> that<00:06:57.170> point<00:06:57.500> it's<00:06:57.860> very<00:06:58.040> easy<00:06:58.670> for<00:06:58.850> you<00:06:59.180> to

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210 
at that point it's very easy for you to

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.930 
at that point it's very easy for you to
drag<00:06:59.840> files<00:07:00.170> from<00:07:00.650> the<00:07:00.800> media<00:07:01.070> drive<00:07:01.370> to<00:07:01.790> the

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940 
drag files from the media drive to the

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.690 
drag files from the media drive to the
SanDisk<00:07:02.420> media<00:07:02.810> drive<00:07:03.080> but<00:07:03.890> as<00:07:04.010> far<00:07:04.280> as<00:07:04.310> just

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:04.700 
SanDisk media drive but as far as just

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.490 
SanDisk media drive but as far as just
being<00:07:04.940> able<00:07:05.090> to<00:07:05.210> do<00:07:05.420> it<00:07:05.450> within<00:07:05.780> the<00:07:05.930> app<00:07:06.200> that

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500 
being able to do it within the app that

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.080 
being able to do it within the app that
is<00:07:06.560> not<00:07:06.710> possible

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.090 
is not possible

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.300 
is not possible
perhaps<00:07:08.720> I<00:07:09.140> would<00:07:09.410> hope<00:07:09.590> that<00:07:09.620> maybe<00:07:10.010> in<00:07:10.220> a

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 
perhaps I would hope that maybe in a

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.760 
perhaps I would hope that maybe in a
future<00:07:10.550> firmware<00:07:11.240> upgrade<00:07:12.110> that<00:07:12.320> would<00:07:12.590> be<00:07:12.740> a

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.770 
future firmware upgrade that would be a

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.090 
future firmware upgrade that would be a
possibility<00:07:13.400> a<00:07:14.210> great<00:07:14.930> feature<00:07:15.260> of<00:07:15.410> this<00:07:15.740> as

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:16.100 
possibility a great feature of this as

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.290 
possibility a great feature of this as
you<00:07:16.280> can<00:07:17.150> have<00:07:17.419> this<00:07:17.600> hooked<00:07:17.900> up<00:07:18.080> to<00:07:18.260> USB<00:07:18.620> power

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300 
you can have this hooked up to USB power

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.520 
you can have this hooked up to USB power
while<00:07:20.300> it<00:07:20.510> is<00:07:20.660> working<00:07:21.200> so<00:07:22.900> downside<00:07:23.900> is<00:07:24.200> that

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:24.530 
while it is working so downside is that

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.060 
while it is working so downside is that
you<00:07:24.740> cannot<00:07:25.360> have<00:07:26.360> this<00:07:26.630> hooked<00:07:26.900> up<00:07:27.080> to<00:07:27.320> USB<00:07:27.620> as

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.070 
you cannot have this hooked up to USB as

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.010 
you cannot have this hooked up to USB as
a<00:07:28.130> mounted<00:07:28.550> volume<00:07:28.910> on<00:07:29.060> your<00:07:29.090> computer<00:07:29.840> and

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.020 
a mounted volume on your computer and

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.530 
a mounted volume on your computer and
use<00:07:30.770> the<00:07:31.010> Wi-Fi<00:07:31.300> capability<00:07:32.300> of<00:07:32.390> the

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:32.540 
use the Wi-Fi capability of the

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.690 
use the Wi-Fi capability of the
simultaneously<00:07:33.410> so<00:07:34.100> this<00:07:34.280> has<00:07:34.460> to<00:07:34.669> be

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:34.700 
simultaneously so this has to be

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.180 
simultaneously so this has to be
disconnected<00:07:35.180> from<00:07:35.540> your<00:07:35.840> computer<00:07:36.380> as<00:07:37.130> a

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.190 
disconnected from your computer as a

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.250 
disconnected from your computer as a
mounted<00:07:37.700> volume<00:07:37.910> in<00:07:38.270> order<00:07:38.510> for<00:07:38.690> the<00:07:38.780> Wi-Fi<00:07:39.200> to

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:39.260 
mounted volume in order for the Wi-Fi to

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.850 
mounted volume in order for the Wi-Fi to
work<00:07:39.650> I<00:07:40.780> just<00:07:41.780> realized<00:07:42.229> that<00:07:42.410> this<00:07:42.650> is<00:07:42.830> a

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:42.860 
work I just realized that this is a

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.310 
work I just realized that this is a
aluminum<00:07:43.460> enclosure<00:07:43.910> and<00:07:44.690> that's<00:07:44.960> why<00:07:45.169> it

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:45.320 
aluminum enclosure and that's why it

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.159 
aluminum enclosure and that's why it
feels<00:07:45.380> so<00:07:45.919> substantial<00:07:46.700> and<00:07:46.790> so<00:07:47.060> nice<00:07:47.330> it's<00:07:48.050> a

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:48.169 
feels so substantial and so nice it's a

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:50.260 
feels so substantial and so nice it's a
very<00:07:48.410> solid<00:07:48.979> little<00:07:49.160> thing<00:07:49.520> and<00:07:49.820> it's<00:07:50.060> got<00:07:50.240> a

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:50.270 
very solid little thing and it's got a

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.480 
very solid little thing and it's got a
rubberized<00:07:50.750> bottom<00:07:51.020> it's<00:07:51.770> just<00:07:51.830> beautifully

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:52.490 
rubberized bottom it's just beautifully

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.390 
rubberized bottom it's just beautifully
constructed<00:07:52.840> this<00:07:53.840> is<00:07:54.140> so<00:07:54.440> useful<00:07:54.740> to<00:07:54.979> me<00:07:55.190> I
