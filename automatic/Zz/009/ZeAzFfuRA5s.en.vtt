50 cents or something for that I paid
too<00:01:42.450> much<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.899> thing<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.220> is

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
too much for this thing you know this is

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.760 
too much for this thing you know this is
it's<00:01:45.060> an<00:01:45.149> occupy<00:01:45.540> Japan<00:01:45.570> piece<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.680> in

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.100 
it's an occupy Japan piece and it's in
really<00:01:46.799> good<00:01:47.130> shape<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:48.149> mean<00:01:48.509> if<00:01:48.930> I'm

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
really good shape so I I mean if I'm

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.649 
really good shape so I I mean if I'm
lucky<00:01:49.380> make<00:01:49.710> 10<00:01:49.890> or<00:01:49.920> 15<00:01:50.340> bucks<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.390> think<00:01:51.600> I

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.789

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
realize how much she wanted for it until

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.649 
realize how much she wanted for it until
she<00:01:56.189> was<00:01:56.280> lighting<00:01:56.640> everything<00:01:57.000> together<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
she was lighting everything together and

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.870 
she was lighting everything together and
I<00:01:57.780> didn't<00:01:58.049> feel<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.290> making<00:01:59.070> singing<00:01:59.610> put<00:01:59.729> it
