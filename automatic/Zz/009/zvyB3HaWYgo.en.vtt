all<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.570> 911<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.439> an<00:00:31.859> automotive<00:00:32.369> engineering

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
icon in CLE of tessa one of the reasons

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.470 
icon in CLE of tessa one of the reasons
for<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.340> because<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.760> design<00:00:39.210> has<00:00:39.449> been

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
for that is because the design has been

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.080 
for that is because the design has been
consciously<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.469> very<00:00:40.710> consistently<00:00:41.489> refined

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
consciously it very consistently refined

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.310 
consciously it very consistently refined
over<00:00:42.300> many<00:00:42.600> years<00:00:43.879> yeah<00:00:44.879> its<00:00:45.120> designer<00:00:45.570> won't

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
over many years yeah its designer won't

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.680 
over many years yeah its designer won't
find<00:00:46.920> us<00:00:47.129> for<00:00:47.309> headings<00:00:47.640> bright<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.300> sorry

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
find us for headings bright it sorry

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.630 
find us for headings bright it sorry
what<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.109> as<00:00:49.230> designers<00:00:49.440> are<00:00:49.949> striving<00:00:50.250> for

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
what we as designers are striving for

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.270 
what we as designers are striving for
above<00:00:50.879> all<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.989> optimize<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.710> width<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
above all is to optimize the width to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.130 
above all is to optimize the width to
height<00:00:53.309> ratio<00:00:53.660> with<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> result<00:00:55.079> that

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
height ratio with the result that

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.740 
height ratio with the result that
although<00:00:55.769> the<00:00:55.800> new<00:00:56.070> 911<00:00:56.280> s<00:00:56.699> overall<00:00:57.059> width<00:00:57.539> has

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
although the new 911 s overall width has

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.470 
although the new 911 s overall width has
not<00:00:57.930> increased<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:59.070> front<00:00:59.429> axle<00:00:59.579> area<00:01:00.300> has

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
not increased the front axle area has

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.689 
not increased the front axle area has
become<00:01:00.750> wider<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.379> we've<00:01:02.100> managed<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.519> make

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
become wider and we've managed to make

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.210 
become wider and we've managed to make
the<00:01:02.850> roof<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.210> bit<00:01:03.329> lower<00:01:03.890> especially<00:01:04.890> from<00:01:05.070> the
