favorite double knee joints it should be
on<00:01:57.210> most<00:01:57.990> figures<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.619> my<00:01:58.740> opinion<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.430> up<00:02:00.180> and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
on most figures in my opinion and up and

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.539 
on most figures in my opinion and up and
down<00:02:00.540> at<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.869> foot<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:02.070> little<00:02:02.310> bit<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.490> a

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
down at the foot and a little bit of a

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.800 
down at the foot and a little bit of a
swivel<00:02:02.909> there<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.329> spin<00:02:03.540> out<00:02:03.659> all<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
swivel there you can spin out all the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.219 
swivel there you can spin out all the
way<00:02:03.869> around

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
way around

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.200 
way around
and<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.770> course<00:02:04.950> peg<00:02:05.219> holes<00:02:05.430> there<00:02:05.729> for<00:02:05.969> a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
and of course peg holes there for a

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.240 
and of course peg holes there for a
stand<00:02:06.719> but<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.469> got<00:02:07.619> some<00:02:07.770> big<00:02:07.920> old<00:02:08.039> flappy

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
stand but it's got some big old flappy

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.400 
stand but it's got some big old flappy
feet<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.119> don't<00:02:09.720> think<00:02:09.780> he<00:02:09.899> needs<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.140> stand

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
feet so I don't think he needs a stand

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.680 
feet so I don't think he needs a stand
but<00:02:11.280> he<00:02:11.489> stands<00:02:11.700> about<00:02:11.849> approximately<00:02:12.420> 5

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
but he stands about approximately 5

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.880 
but he stands about approximately 5
inches<00:02:12.720> tall

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
inches tall

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.970 
inches tall
and<00:02:14.480> that's<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.690> good<00:02:15.930> solid<00:02:16.200> ratio<00:02:16.620> for<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.830> lot

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
and that's a good solid ratio for a lot

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.010 
and that's a good solid ratio for a lot
of<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.160> other<00:02:17.310> Marvel<00:02:18.210> Universe<00:02:18.690> figures

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
of the other Marvel Universe figures

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.890 
of the other Marvel Universe figures
theory<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.410> with<00:02:19.560> cap<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.210> can<00:02:21.540> see<00:02:21.750> the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
theory is with cap so you can see the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.650 
theory is with cap so you can see the
size<00:02:22.500> there<00:02:22.830> too<00:02:23.070> as<00:02:23.220> well<00:02:23.400> well<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.330> like<00:02:24.510> it

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
size there too as well well I like it

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.450 
size there too as well well I like it
yeah<00:02:24.960> go<00:02:25.170> get<00:02:25.320> yourself<00:02:25.650> one<00:02:25.910> it's<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.110> nice
