that's coming to 15 on the old gent

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.469 
that's coming to 15 on the old gent
because<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.580> because<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.330> is

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
because this is just because it is

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.810 
because this is just because it is
impossible<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.259> add<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.979> way<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
impossible to add it on the way the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.780 
impossible to add it on the way the
console<00:01:24.270> runs<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.780> not<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:26.100> certain

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790

scale<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.630> they<00:01:27.840> need<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.350> at<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
scale that they need to be at and the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.670 
scale that they need to be at and the
graphics<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:30.000> don't<00:01:30.180> think<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:30.990> good<00:01:31.439> as

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
graphics I don't think are as good as

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.740 
graphics I don't think are as good as
the<00:01:32.040> new<00:01:32.189> xbox<00:01:32.549> one<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.759> ps4<00:01:32.970> obviously

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the new xbox one and ps4 obviously

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.810 
the new xbox one and ps4 obviously
because<00:01:34.079> they<00:01:34.470> are<00:01:34.530> old<00:01:34.799> gen<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.340> then<00:01:35.490> they

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
because they are old gen and then they

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.160 
because they are old gen and then they
are<00:01:35.850> unable<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.210> bring<00:01:36.689> some<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.079> new

for the new fifa 15 so that piece of
innovation<00:02:04.229> i<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.409> for<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.560> guys<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
innovation i have for you guys is the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.570 
innovation i have for you guys is the
player<00:02:05.490> control<00:02:06.000> man<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:07.290> man<00:02:07.500> tackle<00:02:08.250> what

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
player control man to man tackle what

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.249 
player control man to man tackle what
this<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.209> when<00:02:09.660> you're<00:02:09.780> attacking<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
this is is when you're attacking the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.020 
this is is when you're attacking the
player<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:10.920> more<00:02:11.099> realistic<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.819> there's<00:02:11.970> a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
player it's more realistic so there's a

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.790 
player it's more realistic so there's a
lot<00:02:12.150> more<00:02:12.180> shoulder<00:02:12.690> barging<00:02:13.230> you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
lot more shoulder barging you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.230 
lot more shoulder barging you
I<00:02:13.830> don't<00:02:14.190> know<00:02:14.340> if<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.520> can<00:02:14.640> punish<00:02:14.790> trip<00:02:14.880> up

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
I don't know if you can punish trip up

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.910 
I don't know if you can punish trip up
the<00:02:15.330> player<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.780> can<00:02:15.930> do<00:02:16.080> dirty<00:02:16.350> tactics

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
the player but you can do dirty tactics

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.260 
the player but you can do dirty tactics
to<00:02:17.340> get<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.580> ball<00:02:17.700> off<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.850> other<00:02:17.970> player

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
to get the ball off the other player

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.790 
to get the ball off the other player
like<00:02:18.510> if<00:02:18.690> you're<00:02:19.050> running<00:02:19.170> side<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.650> side

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
like if you're running side to side

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.650 
like if you're running side to side
normally<00:02:20.250> it's<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.460> go<00:02:20.610> overpowers<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.540> other

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
normally it's to go overpowers the other

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.540 
normally it's to go overpowers the other
one<00:02:21.780> wins<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.110> ball<00:02:22.290> now<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:22.890> can<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.400> little

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
one wins the ball now you can do little

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.610 
one wins the ball now you can do little
techniques<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.240> shoulder<00:02:24.540> Bardem<00:02:24.870> away<00:02:25.140> like

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
techniques to shoulder Bardem away like

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.320 
techniques to shoulder Bardem away like
trip<00:02:25.860> them<00:02:26.040> up<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.310> stuff<00:02:26.490> like<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.060> you

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
trip them up and stuff like that so you

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.970 
trip them up and stuff like that so you
can<00:02:27.780> actually<00:02:27.930> get<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.380> ball<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> lot<00:02:28.830> better

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
can actually get the ball a lot better

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.890 
can actually get the ball a lot better
and<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.460> think<00:02:29.490> it's<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.850> new<00:02:30.000> feature<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.540> they

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
and I think it's a new feature that they

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.630 
and I think it's a new feature that they
be<00:02:31.080> added<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.590> can<00:02:31.740> pull<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.070> shirts<00:02:32.340> down

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
be added you can pull the shirts down

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.310 
be added you can pull the shirts down
like<00:02:33.090> properly<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.840> they<00:02:33.900> fall<00:02:34.110> on<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.290> floor

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
like properly and they fall on the floor

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.380 
like properly and they fall on the floor
you<00:02:34.530> get<00:02:34.770> red<00:02:34.950> cards<00:02:35.340> not<00:02:35.760> red<00:02:35.910> card<00:02:36.150> stuff

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
you get red cards not red card stuff

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.390 
you get red cards not red card stuff
like<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:36.780> get<00:02:36.900> really<00:02:37.110> bad<00:02:37.400> injuries

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
like that you get really bad injuries

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.920 
like that you get really bad injuries
and<00:02:38.700> stuff<00:02:38.940> like<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.360> know<00:02:39.540> it's<00:02:39.690> gonna<00:02:39.750> be

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
and stuff like that I know it's gonna be

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.690 
and stuff like that I know it's gonna be
a<00:02:39.960> bit<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.260> pain<00:02:40.440> sometimes<00:02:40.620> when<00:02:41.490> you<00:02:41.670> have

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
a bit of a pain sometimes when you have

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.370 
a bit of a pain sometimes when you have
players<00:02:42.210> like<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.450> barber<00:02:42.990> if<00:02:43.080> he's<00:02:43.230> still

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
players like a barber if he's still

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.380 
players like a barber if he's still
overpowered<00:02:44.040> running<00:02:44.640> costs<00:02:44.910> because<00:02:45.150> he<00:02:45.240> can

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
overpowered running costs because he can

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.630 
overpowered running costs because he can
be<00:02:45.420> able<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.780> dominate<00:02:46.020> everyone<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.830> place

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
be able to dominate everyone and place

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.490 
be able to dominate everyone and place
like<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:47.880> but<00:02:48.360> still<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.870> think<00:02:49.200> that's<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.380> new

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
like that but still I think that's a new

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.870 
like that but still I think that's a new
feature<00:02:49.680> they<00:02:49.950> have<00:02:50.070> added<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.700> more

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
feature they have added that is more

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.180 
feature they have added that is more
realistic<00:02:51.240> when<00:02:51.630> tackling<00:02:51.930> okay<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:53.010> is

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
realistic when tackling okay so this is

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.520 
realistic when tackling okay so this is
one<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.610> new<00:02:53.760> ones<00:02:53.790> for<00:02:54.390> FIFA<00:02:54.840> 50<00:02:55.110> altima
