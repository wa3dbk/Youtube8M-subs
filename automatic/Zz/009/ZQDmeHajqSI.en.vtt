New Jersey was just a spring thing and
now<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:47.999> evolved<00:01:48.569> to<00:01:48.600> where<00:01:48.929> we<00:01:49.889> have

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
now it's it's evolved to where we have

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.370 
now it's it's evolved to where we have
fish<00:01:50.399> all<00:01:50.759> through<00:01:51.090> spring<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.600> summer<00:01:51.929> we

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
have these big fish that win in the fall

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:56.539 
have these big fish that win in the fall
so<00:01:54.719> now<00:01:55.020> with<00:01:55.770> trout<00:01:56.009> fishing<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.429> New<00:01:56.520> Jersey

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
so now with trout fishing in New Jersey

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.570 
so now with trout fishing in New Jersey
a<00:01:56.939> year

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
a year
