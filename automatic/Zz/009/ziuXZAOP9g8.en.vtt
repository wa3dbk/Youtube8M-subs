00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.380
 Good day to all with you Brian 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.660
 This video is dedicated to the answer to 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.179
 your frequently asked questions 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.910
 because questions comments steadily 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.010
 what is called slowly but surely 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.050
 continue to grow if VKontakte is still all 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.550
 ok can not answer your 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.070
 questions then on y tube 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.529
 this is becoming problematic therefore 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.380
 from time to time there will be similar 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.949
 videos and so something like that five 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.050
 of questions 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.700
 which did not ask recently 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.340
 most often 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.690
 Well, naturally 1 why rarely steel 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.480
 go out in her videos 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.000
 make more commercials what can I do 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.489
 say we all grow we all grow 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.760
 and somehow, but our views change 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.340
 and our interests are changing for sure 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.440
 the same thing happened to me for the year 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.350
 shooting the same game probably 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.840
 warcraft I was pretty fed up with 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.859
 plus everything my videos are typing wrong 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.650
 too many views 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.420
 so definitely want to try that 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.880
 something new and even to the same 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.100
 my student freebie ends 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.780
 if april-may still okay 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.000
 more or less free can do 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.240
 videos what will happen next 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.310
 big big mystery however 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.390
 completely on the project to hammer all the same 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.000
 I would not like 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.759
 so well, let 3 videos for the month but 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.430
 I will try to do the next question 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.189
 which I probably get asked almost every 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.009
 week is which server do you play 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.320
 there is absolutely no change 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.380
 I play all the same official 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.360
 server Underdark well as played probably 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.520
 will say more precisely that all of mine 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.250
 characters are listed on this 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.370
 server and go somewhere i just 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.500
 see no point 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.240
 The third question you have is good and 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.580
 high-quality sound how are you 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.370
 use a microphone microphone 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.200
 me and a r perception 120 usb 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.570
 he really writes pretty well 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.150
 qualitatively and to me he is very very 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.170
 like essentially after i 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.450
 recorded his voice 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.170
 track in any settings not 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.690
 needs 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.390
 the next question is why are you old 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.850
 modelki is all very, very simple 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.400
 the fact is that before I shot my 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.770
 old notebooks which creepy whist 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.560
 lagged and generally difficult on her 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.750
 It was literally a week to do videos 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.000
 back bought a brand new computer 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.580
 relatively powerful to me at least 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.410
 it just grabs his eyes for removal 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.420
 rollers well and now accordingly 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.850
 I put new models 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.830
 Well, finally you have the last question 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.110
 something very few views 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.480
 maybe you try to shoot something 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.360
 still natural is a long time ago 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.340
 I noticed, therefore, and also 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.310
 because warcraft is not easy already 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.459
 a bit fed up with these two 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.580
 factors, I slowly move to a new 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.280
 year of shit it heroes storm present 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.590
 time I actively play it and study well 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.200
 and slowly begin to shoot on it 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.690
 videos on this video came up to 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.020
 end thanks for watching and also friends 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.480
 thank you very much for your support because 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.640
 that if you have not maintained the 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.800
 most likely warcraft I would stop 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.750
 shoot very , very long time ago 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.450
 let the circle of people who are interested 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.870
 military craft project he is very very 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.150
 narrow 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.209
 but so no less someone needs up to the rollers 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.870
 so the pieces occasionally but I do the video 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.060
 I will try 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.820
 and on this i have all subscribe to 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.820
 channel and wish you good luck everyone bye
