00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.040
 Hmm 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.300
 Hello everyone 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:16.500
 It is Gutchii of the world rubber market 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:17.160
 This time, I'm going to introduce some of the ways I'm doing the most with my practice. 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.520
 I will 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:26.690
 That 's right 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:29.940
 While the proper use of the Chiquita and Taijo drive way to say going to move from the receive 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:33.140
 But that's where I'm putting most effort 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.180
 Square Drive and Chiquita 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:41.220
 This is a two-edged style 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:45.840
 Doing Tteyuu take the initiative this and say whether integral does it mean 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:51.900
 Everybody in the world is very popular with Chiquita in recent years 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:56.170
 Frequently the uses only Chiquita of lateral rotation subject only Chiquita players in 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:00.850
 Or players who use only on the main driving of the upper rotation 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:05.710
 Take the selection in I think I'm almost I also greatly another Sendai Castle's 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.189
 In order to do so, it is important to use the drive and chikita very effectively. 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.140
 Everyone's 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.170
 Please try it because it is the manner recommended 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.860
 From A Dubai 1 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.860
 Yu mom 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.330
 Hmm 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.180
 pr 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.780
 th 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.780
 ta 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.070
 No 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.600
 w 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.540
 Hey 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.190
 There hot 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.810
 The practice menu I am most interested in now has the other party's serve on the background 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:10.060
 It is unexpected for long serve 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.830
 Long Serve got surprises and drive all Chikita challenges against that serve 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.180
 I'm doing something to do 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.710
 Long's obviously long is that I can't drive Chikita but I 'm short 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.910
 Lower service usually or lower serve 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.860
 Side-turning service knuckle serve etc is a chance to do Chikita and Taijo drive 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.310
 As much as possible 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.880
 For any serve 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.880
 I'm happy to stop Tsutsukii all Chikita do not 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.120
 Treated with either in the Water Yam over drive 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.629
 At least from there 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:44.300
 That because I am the and Rutteyuu feeling rely All 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:45.310
 It is my one push practice method of form that is pretty close to real battle 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.000
 Ad other Chi 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.000
 Variously 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.500
 Hmm
