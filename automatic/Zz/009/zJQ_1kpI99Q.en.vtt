00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.240 

there<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.020> can<00:02:24.140> see<00:02:24.320> now<00:02:24.500> as<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.890> actions

anti-aircraft battery that was causing

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.500 
anti-aircraft battery that was causing
so<00:02:56.680> much<00:02:56.770> trouble<00:02:57.010> earlier<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.610> defend<00:02:58.330> that

so much trouble earlier and defend that

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.330 
so much trouble earlier and defend that
now<00:02:59.080> taking<00:02:59.530> care<00:02:59.710> of<00:02:59.740> this<00:02:59.890> we'll<00:03:00.190> do<00:03:00.310> a

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
now taking care of this we'll do a

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.560 
now taking care of this we'll do a
couple<00:03:00.520> of<00:03:00.730> things<00:03:00.790> give<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.210> couple<00:03:01.450> of

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
couple of things give a couple of

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.510 
couple of things give a couple of
advantages<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.140> his<00:03:02.350> team<00:03:02.590> first<00:03:03.340> and

advantages to his team first and

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.340 
advantages to his team first and
foremost<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.090> will<00:03:04.209> allow<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.810> commanders<00:03:05.230> to

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
foremost it will allow the commanders to

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.230 
foremost it will allow the commanders to
call<00:03:05.530> in<00:03:05.650> airstrikes<00:03:05.800> as<00:03:06.250> they<00:03:06.370> battle<00:03:06.760> but

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
call in airstrikes as they battle but

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.610 
call in airstrikes as they battle but
it's<00:03:07.360> also<00:03:07.480> going<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.780> secure<00:03:08.140> this<00:03:08.380> as<00:03:08.590> a

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
it's also going to secure this as a

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.140 
it's also going to secure this as a
forward<00:03:08.920> spawn<00:03:09.280> point<00:03:09.550> for<00:03:09.700> his<00:03:09.790> team<00:03:10.000> which

bomb to clear the enemy off this wall

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.110 
bomb to clear the enemy off this wall
and<00:03:53.500> secure<00:03:54.159> the<00:03:54.250> point<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.609> his<00:03:54.730> team<00:03:54.940> can

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
and secure the point to his team can

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.580 
and secure the point to his team can
push<00:03:55.299> forward<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:55.900> hit<00:03:56.139> the<00:03:56.260> heart<00:03:56.440> of<00:03:56.500> this

push forward and hit the heart of this

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:05.440 
push forward and hit the heart of this
facility

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.390 

so<00:04:05.990> obviously<00:04:06.410> devastating<00:04:06.890> strike<00:04:07.160> it's

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
so obviously devastating strike it's

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.920 
so obviously devastating strike it's
cleared<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:07.760> enemy<00:04:07.970> off<00:04:08.090> this<00:04:08.270> position<00:04:08.780> now

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
cleared the enemy off this position now

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.390
