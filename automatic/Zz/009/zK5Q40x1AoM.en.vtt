00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.860 
bottom here just like that and it's like
a<00:02:49.980> really<00:02:50.310> creepy<00:02:50.639> looking<00:02:51.090> eyeball<00:02:51.510> in<00:02:51.659> there

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
a really creepy looking eyeball in there

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.099 
a really creepy looking eyeball in there
so<00:02:52.079> it's<00:02:52.260> like<00:02:53.090> decoding<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.269> eye<00:02:54.299> retina

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
so it's like decoding the eye retina

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.659 
so it's like decoding the eye retina
then<00:02:55.349> you<00:02:55.409> put<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:55.829> pink<00:02:56.099> one<00:02:56.159> on<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.459> side

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:56.669 
then you put this pink one on the side

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:58.640 
then you put this pink one on the side
here<00:02:56.879> and<00:02:56.939> it<00:02:57.000> reads<00:02:57.180> identity<00:02:57.870> confirmed

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
here and it reads identity confirmed

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.619 
here and it reads identity confirmed
flip<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.430> around<00:02:59.519> put<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.060> underneath<00:03:00.329> and

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
flip it around put it underneath and

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.809 
flip it around put it underneath and
then<00:03:00.810> right<00:03:01.019> here<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.409> has<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.650> thumbprint<00:03:02.579> or<00:03:02.790> a

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
then right here it has a thumbprint or a

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:03.709 
then right here it has a thumbprint or a
fingerprint<00:03:03.389> in<00:03:03.480> there

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:03.719 
fingerprint in there

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:04.940 
fingerprint in there
I<00:03:03.750> don't<00:03:04.019> know<00:03:04.109> well<00:03:04.319> that's<00:03:04.439> showing<00:03:04.739> up<00:03:04.829> on

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
intercepted and then you flip it

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.449 
intercepted and then you flip it
underneath<00:03:12.900> here<00:03:13.349> slide<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:13.919> in<00:03:14.040> here<00:03:14.069> and
