as<00:00:21.359> I'm<00:00:21.810> sure<00:00:21.869> most<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:22.830> know<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.820> we

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
as I'm sure most of you know that we

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.570 
as I'm sure most of you know that we
need<00:00:24.269> omega-3s<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.080> our<00:00:25.230> diet<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.590> omega-3<00:00:26.340> is

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
need omega-3s in our diet and omega-3 is

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.599 
need omega-3s in our diet and omega-3 is
an<00:00:27.420> essential<00:00:27.720> fatty<00:00:28.050> acid<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.740> your<00:00:29.429> body

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
an essential fatty acid and your body

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.179 
an essential fatty acid and your body
can<00:00:29.880> actually<00:00:30.359> can't<00:00:30.810> produce<00:00:31.050> Omega<00:00:31.920> threes

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
can actually can't produce Omega threes

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.840 
can actually can't produce Omega threes
it<00:00:32.369> has<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.790> get<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.030> from<00:00:33.239> food<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:34.309> if<00:00:35.309> you've

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
it has to get it from food and if you've

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.030 
it has to get it from food and if you've
read<00:00:36.090> about<00:00:36.149> omega-3<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.050> probably<00:00:37.559> know

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
read about omega-3 so you probably know

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.770 
read about omega-3 so you probably know
that<00:00:38.600> sources<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.750> omega-3s<00:00:40.440> are<00:00:40.649> usually<00:00:41.040> in

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
that sources of omega-3s are usually in

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.340 
that sources of omega-3s are usually in
fish<00:00:42.780> like<00:00:43.410> salmon<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.309> tuna<00:00:44.870> but<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.200> can

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
fish like salmon and tuna but it can

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.729 
fish like salmon and tuna but it can
also<00:00:46.440> be<00:00:46.620> found<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:47.480> different<00:00:48.480> algie's<00:00:49.079> like

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
also be found in different algie's like

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.549 
also be found in different algie's like
spirulina<00:00:50.219> things<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.539> also<00:00:51.960> in

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
spirulina things like that and also in

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.060 
spirulina things like that and also in
nuts<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.489> seeds<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:55.110> best<00:00:55.320> source<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.770> find

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
nuts and seeds the best source I find

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.430 
nuts and seeds the best source I find
for<00:00:56.640> omega-3<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.539> actually<00:00:57.750> hemp<00:00:58.140> seeds

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
for omega-3 is this actually hemp seeds

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.569 
for omega-3 is this actually hemp seeds
chia<00:00:59.100> seeds<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.789> flax<00:01:00.000> seeds<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:02.100> get

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
chia seeds and flax seeds and so get

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.340 
chia seeds and flax seeds and so get
into<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.420> also<00:01:03.570> get<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.140> you

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
into that but you can also get it if you

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.240 
into that but you can also get it if you
want<00:01:04.559> from<00:01:05.030> your<00:01:06.350> lg's<00:01:07.350> things<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.070> or

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
want from your lg's things like that or

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.510 
want from your lg's things like that or
marine<00:01:08.520> phytoplankton<00:01:09.110> they<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.650> Omega

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
marine phytoplankton they all have Omega

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.820 
marine phytoplankton they all have Omega
threes<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.210> essential<00:01:12.840> fatty<00:01:13.020> acids<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
threes and essential fatty acids the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.070 
threes and essential fatty acids the
main<00:01:14.070> thing<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:14.369> tend<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.820> get<00:01:15.000> more

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
main thing is we tend to get more

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.350 
main thing is we tend to get more
omega-6s<00:01:16.080> than<00:01:17.009> we<00:01:17.100> do<00:01:17.250> omega-3s<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.240> we

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
omega-6s than we do omega-3s in so we

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.570 
omega-6s than we do omega-3s in so we
need<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.600> kind<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.780> balance<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.409> out<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.890> so

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
need to kind of balance that out and so

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.850 
need to kind of balance that out and so
therefore<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.299> important<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.930> know<00:01:22.049> get<00:01:22.650> a

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
therefore it's important you know get a

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.679 
therefore it's important you know get a
tablespoon<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.610> chia<00:01:23.970> seeds<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.390> your<00:01:24.420> diet

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
actually to rinse out a blender so you

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.930 
actually to rinse out a blender so you
don't<00:04:25.810> have<00:04:25.900> any<00:04:25.960> pulp<00:04:26.380> in<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.740> blender<00:04:27.040> and
