3.25<00:01:34.920> at<00:01:35.190> bet365<00:01:36.560> yes<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.069> think<00:01:38.429> those<00:01:39.149> odds

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
3.25 at bet365 yes I I think those odds

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.960 
3.25 at bet365 yes I I think those odds
one<00:01:39.750> they<00:01:40.020> reflect<00:01:40.410> the<00:01:40.649> short<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.520> some<00:01:41.729> not

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
one they reflect the short on some not

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.850 
one they reflect the short on some not
making<00:01:42.270> out<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> group<00:01:42.869> two<00:01:43.560> they're

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
making out on the group two they're

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.680 
making out on the group two they're
probably<00:01:44.069> not<00:01:44.250> going<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.490> win<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> group<00:01:44.940> so

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
probably not going to win the group so

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.120 
probably not going to win the group so
they're<00:01:46.140> going<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.349> finish<00:01:46.440> second<00:01:46.950> they're

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
they're going to finish second they're

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.139 
they're going to finish second they're
probably<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.550> to<00:01:47.640> come<00:01:47.729> up<00:01:47.819> against

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
probably going to come up against

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.850 
probably going to come up against
Brazilian<00:01:48.539> the<00:01:48.630> next<00:01:48.840> round<00:01:48.959> if<00:01:49.170> they<00:01:49.319> do<00:01:49.380> that

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
Brazilian the next round if they do that

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.150 
Brazilian the next round if they do that
it's<00:01:50.399> 3.25<00:01:51.270> not<00:01:51.929> bad<00:01:52.170> dogs<00:01:52.410> actually<00:01:52.649> for<00:01:53.069> them

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
it's 3.25 not bad dogs actually for them

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.070 
it's 3.25 not bad dogs actually for them
to<00:01:53.250> go<00:01:53.369> out<00:01:53.489> at<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.789> stage<00:01:54.149> ideally<00:01:54.869> I'd<00:01:55.020> like

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
to go out at that stage ideally I'd like

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.059 
to go out at that stage ideally I'd like
seemed<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.590> little<00:01:55.709> bit<00:01:55.920> longer<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.940> you<00:01:57.780> know

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
seemed a little bit longer but you know

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.430 
seemed a little bit longer but you know
against<00:01:59.069> Brazil<00:01:59.459> I<00:01:59.700> don't<00:02:00.179> see<00:02:00.479> them<00:02:00.810> having

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
against Brazil I don't see them having

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.609 
against Brazil I don't see them having
much<00:02:01.709> chance<00:02:02.069> in<00:02:02.310> Brazil<00:02:02.819> particularly<00:02:03.619> host

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
much chance in Brazil particularly host

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.469 
much chance in Brazil particularly host
team<00:02:04.950> usually<00:02:05.369> does<00:02:05.729> well<00:02:05.940> in<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> world<00:02:06.270> cup

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
team usually does well in the world cup

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.910 
team usually does well in the world cup
finals<00:02:06.899> usually<00:02:07.229> plays<00:02:07.440> above<00:02:07.739> themselves

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
finals usually plays above themselves

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.699 
finals usually plays above themselves
and<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.910> Brazil<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.690> yeah<00:02:10.380> not<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> bad

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709

match-by-match on this chilly
team<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:18.210> think<00:02:19.210> that's<00:02:19.600> max<00:02:20.350> bye<00:02:20.530> max<00:02:20.560> betting

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
team I think that's max bye max betting

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.950 
team I think that's max bye max betting
on<00:02:21.250> this<00:02:21.430> team<00:02:21.670> would<00:02:21.910> be<00:02:22.030> an<00:02:22.150> excellent<00:02:22.660> idea

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
on this team would be an excellent idea

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.560 
on this team would be an excellent idea
simply<00:02:23.830> because<00:02:24.280> we<00:02:24.520> don't<00:02:25.120> know<00:02:25.240> how<00:02:25.390> they're

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
simply because we don't know how they're

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.970 
simply because we don't know how they're
going<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.750> react<00:02:26.050> as<00:02:26.290> we<00:02:26.470> said<00:02:26.680> there<00:02:26.860> are<00:02:26.950> a

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
going to react as we said there are a

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.610 
going to react as we said there are a
young<00:02:27.220> team<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.150> only<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.780> third<00:02:28.960> way<00:02:29.560> to

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
young team this is only the third way to

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.080 
young team this is only the third way to
the<00:02:29.800> first<00:02:30.010> time<00:02:30.220> they<00:02:30.340> qualify<00:02:30.790> for<00:02:30.940> two

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
the first time they qualify for two

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.450 
the first time they qualify for two
consecutive<00:02:31.240> World<00:02:31.840> Cup<00:02:32.080> Finals<00:02:32.590> didn't<00:02:33.310> set

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
consecutive World Cup Finals didn't set

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.150 
consecutive World Cup Finals didn't set
the<00:02:33.550> world<00:02:33.730> alight<00:02:33.880> back<00:02:34.360> in<00:02:34.570> 2010<00:02:34.930> this<00:02:35.860> time

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
the world alight back in 2010 this time

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.670 
the world alight back in 2010 this time
much<00:02:36.880> better<00:02:37.120> team<00:02:37.420> could<00:02:37.990> surprise<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.380> few

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
much better team could surprise a few

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.190 
much better team could surprise a few
people<00:02:39.130> so<00:02:39.670> match<00:02:40.180> by<00:02:40.420> match<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.960> think

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
people so match by match I think

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.740 
people so match by match I think
particularly<00:02:41.590> against<00:02:42.340> spain<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.420> against

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
particularly against spain and against

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.120 
particularly against spain and against
