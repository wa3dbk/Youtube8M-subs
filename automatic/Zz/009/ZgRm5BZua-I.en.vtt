in the car getting in it when it was

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.240 
in the car getting in it when it was
that<00:00:39.210> cold<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.780> know<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.079> inside<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> car

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
that cold you know the inside of the car

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.819 
that cold you know the inside of the car
was<00:00:41.489> minus<00:00:41.850> 25<00:00:42.420> when<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:42.899> got<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.200> hit<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.620> it

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
was minus 25 when we got in hit and it

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.650 
was minus 25 when we got in hit and it
was<00:00:43.920> very<00:00:44.070> noticeably<00:00:44.579> cold<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.059> how<00:00:45.210> fast

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
was very noticeably cold and how fast

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.410 
was very noticeably cold and how fast
that<00:00:45.899> heated<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.559> was<00:00:47.010> using<00:00:47.370> 10<00:00:47.820> kilowatts<00:00:48.300> of

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
that heated I was using 10 kilowatts of

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.360 
that heated I was using 10 kilowatts of
power<00:00:48.480> most<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> time<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.770> was<00:00:49.920> driving<00:00:50.250> out

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
power most of the time I was driving out

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.729 
power most of the time I was driving out
it<00:00:50.550> was<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:50.879> very<00:00:51.210> low<00:00:51.480> energy<00:00:51.840> use<00:00:52.020> which

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
it was so very low energy use which

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.889 
it was so very low energy use which
shows<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.370> heating<00:00:53.579> isn't<00:00:54.000> being<00:00:54.180> isn't

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
shows that the heating isn't being isn't

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.600 
shows that the heating isn't being isn't
sucking<00:00:55.199> power<00:00:55.379> out<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> battery<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:56.460> got

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
sucking power out of the battery it got

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.779 
sucking power out of the battery it got
so<00:00:56.850> hot<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.809> turned<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.620> heating<00:00:58.980> off<00:00:59.129> it

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
so hot that I turned the heating off it

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.209 
so hot that I turned the heating off it
got<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.239> hot<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.230> turned<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> heated<00:01:01.949> seats

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
got so hot but I turned the heated seats

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.759 
got so hot but I turned the heated seats
off<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.480> all<00:01:03.629> happened<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.350> space<00:01:04.739> of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
off and that all happened in a space of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.149 
off and that all happened in a space of
about<00:01:05.159> five<00:01:05.549> minutes<00:01:06.090> from<00:01:06.810> being<00:01:07.080> minus<00:01:07.590> 30

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
about five minutes from being minus 30

car<00:01:12.540> has<00:01:12.869> heated<00:01:13.080> up<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.830> five<00:01:14.220> minutes<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
car has heated up in five minutes and

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.899 
car has heated up in five minutes and
that's<00:01:15.060> facts<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:16.110> its<00:01:16.259> ethanol<00:01:16.830> heater<00:01:17.280> which

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
that's facts to its ethanol heater which

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.090 
that's facts to its ethanol heater which
uses<00:01:18.270> liquid<00:01:18.659> fuel<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.290> heat<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.590> car<00:01:19.830> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
uses liquid fuel to heat the car and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.649 
uses liquid fuel to heat the car and
saves<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.700> battery<00:01:21.060> power<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
saves the battery power for the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.630 
saves the battery power for the
important<00:01:22.110> thing<00:01:22.320> making<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.280> wheels<00:01:23.460> go

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
important thing making the wheels go

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:37.690 
important thing making the wheels go
round
