 ride these sandwiches valid- 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.930
 here I have the cucumber the only thing I'm going to 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.640
 to do is to put him very carefully and 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.370
 a little knife or a teaspoon 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.680
 little one my preparation that I did 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.140
 with the jocoque or the natural yoghurt what 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.720

 tasty with a lot of care that you see 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.759
 vast these sandwiches I think that with 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.430
 this is enough and I will take advantage 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.220
 to put a little dill or 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.910

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.440

 piece of bread 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.780
