but most of it is leather I mean most of

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.330 
but most of it is leather I mean most of
it<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.690> cloth<00:02:46.989> as<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.350> set<00:02:47.560> for<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:47.950> night<00:02:48.130> to

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
think you can clean them and one thing I

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.140 
think you can clean them and one thing I
wonder<00:04:12.500> is<00:04:12.590> that<00:04:12.620> if<00:04:12.980> they<00:04:13.280> get<00:04:13.490> on<00:04:13.640> here<00:04:14.000> is

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
wonder is that if they get on here is

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.570 
wonder is that if they get on here is
the<00:04:14.690> same<00:04:14.900> for<00:04:14.930> every<00:04:15.260> shoe<00:04:15.470> or<00:04:15.650> like<00:04:15.890> some

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
the same for every shoe or like some

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.820 
the same for every shoe or like some
shoes<00:04:16.790> are<00:04:16.970> in<00:04:17.239> different<00:04:17.959> places<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.590> stuff

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
shoes are in different places and stuff

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.910 
shoes are in different places and stuff
I<00:04:19.570> see<00:04:20.570> you<00:04:20.690> can<00:04:20.870> tell<00:04:21.170> right<00:04:21.200> here<00:04:21.530> that<00:04:21.650> dish

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920
