00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.430
 for some time now you can breathe online 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.720
 bad air 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.210
 in recent years there has been 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.700
 an escalation of the vote with 9 gifts and 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.150
 a little too many 10 while in the back the 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.710
 fifth 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.110
 several users shout theirs 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.059
 frustration even coming to 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.220
 accuse the websites of having sold themselves 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.190
 at the software house but the problem is 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.809
 really this far from me to say that 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.910
 rival cities are sold 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.410
 I write on z games in good faith e 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.690
 I hope others will do it too 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.790
 the question itself should not in fact 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.379
 focus on possible bundles or 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.600
 power taking by software 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.869
 house think about the votes themselves 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.909
 now lost the original numerical value 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:05.290
 in a context where votes are higher than 9 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.979
 they rain from the sky with an extreme 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.229
 simplicity 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.700
 the idea that is made to the intelligent reader 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.890
 that there is mars behind the websites 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.659
 because otherwise they would not be explained 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.119
 the high-sounding votes regardless 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.680
 all the most famous products and reviews 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.470
 which now seem more like advertisements 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.180
 instead of informative articles the users 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.220
 younger in response has been shaped 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.740
 over time this trend of voting 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.719
 so high that readers now tend to 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.000
 discard regardless of products with votes 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.890
 lower than 9 and although the value 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.359
 numeric is linked to the parameters of 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.490
 individual site evaluation 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.429
 I challenge anyone to affirm with an 8 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.780
 piero is not a good game 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.240
 a perfect example for this 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.130
 situation we find him in call of duty 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.840
 every year the activision title is carried 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.399
 at home at his full 9 following 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.460
 from the criticisms of users and experts 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.350
 that of the records of receipts at day one 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.569
 you will notice call of duty paradoxes from you 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.549
 he is rightly criticized for his 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.289
 nature of annual copy paste for the 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.899
 its zero innovation and for the 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.429
 decreasing quality chapter by chapter 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.100
 but this does not prevent him from selling 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.020
 wagon and take high grades 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.240
 this means that call of duty likes 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.800
 very much to the mass and that mass 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.230
 could also agree with i 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.360
 high marks that the minority takes instead 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.670
 points to the press that it was little 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.020
 objective or worse sold in exchange for 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.360
 money 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.940
 perhaps the truth is in the middle 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.980
 maybe no one takes money under the table but 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.740
 just lost the courage to do what 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.110
 should do and standardized on 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.270
 certain assessments for fear of 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.550
 upset the mass 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.230
 of today 's gamers in fact 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.610
 known that the task of an editor 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.310
 is to be the most objective 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.040
 possible but a new one is raised here 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.410
 question true objectivity does not exist 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.420
 we don't all know but the thing that most 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.740
 he approaches her and the opinion agrees 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.140
 of industry experts 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.920
 but who are the experts in the field in 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.630
 2013 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.400
 those who criticize in the true sense 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.630
 of the word they try to evaluate the 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.870
 product beyond its success 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.790
 commercial and where to look for them in videos 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.740
 past we have seen as the videogame 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.420
 has changed over time due to 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.700
 changes in the gamers themselves 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.350
 we then analyzed the situation of the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.180
 web that has not been rewarded for a long time 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.790
 merit but well founded other parameters 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.810
 on nothing instead of culture 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.400
 conditioning the sources of 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.740
 information present in the vast sea 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.150
 internet plan like a cat 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.560
 bites the tail we entered into a 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.320
 vicious circle from which it is difficult 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.020
 you will be able to go out on the average video player 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.880
 and superficially ignorant of the web however it 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.280
 rewards turning it into a phenomenon of 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.990
 mass built on its gab or 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.150
 in the case of the fairer sex its size 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.190
 of the front airbags until it is done 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.080
 appear as the industry expert who 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.060
 we are looking for 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.930
 the problem therefore is not the 9 a call of 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.670
 duty 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.830
 the problem is that the votes are now 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.980
 standardized and no longer reflect the 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.959
 true criticism ata precisely to criticize the 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.850
 real videogame information is dead 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.230
 you want for fear of criticizing that 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.030
 untouchable product 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.610
 you want for the ignorance that binds to one 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.090
 superficial evaluation and the situation 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.990
 general has now led to ridicule 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.270
 criticism burns in the corner 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.310
 videogame accused of selling votes 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.500
 high in the red corner there are the 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.790
 users who accuse but who instead of 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.490
 read the text of the review 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.739
 they criticize regardless alternatively 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.690
 there are small independent sites 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.549
 pity that maybe to write that 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.710
 kid with a cultural background that 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.360
 it ranges from gta to bulli but that does not result 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.580
 besides the skyrim it is right because also 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.980
 this is mainstream 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.620
 or bloggers lone wolves in general 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.990
 perhaps without the social life they dispense 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.880
 absolute truths about how corrupt it is and 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.590
 mafia that press that does not have 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.900
 accepted their request to enter 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.660
 in the staff, or worse, hunted them 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.100
 away for incompetence and then again 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.500
 youtuber we talked about in 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.060
 previous big video show man who 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.770
 they get success directly 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.960
 proportional to the number of bad words that 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.580
 use in their videos maybe surrounded 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.430
 from clichés and facial expressions 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.830
 by peter griffin and finally we have in 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.780
 gameplay video with affirming users 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.670
 to get a clear and clear idea of ​​the 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.370
 produced by watching only the videos on 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.660
 youtube of misunderstood genes 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.190
 I can probably understand a video 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.410
 commented gameplay that on balance 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.880
 becomes a mini review but not yes 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.610
 can affirm that it is enough to look at a 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.900
 video to know all about that game 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.940
 could show videos on a 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.100
 action game 2 fi screaming stunts 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.410
 i break my ass to everyone and everyone runs into it 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.150
 apocalyptic scenarios and then pad in hand 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.470
 he can't even jump on you 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.480
 same because the controls are 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.250
 implemented so badly to render 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.530
 apocalyptic only the nervous ulcer 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.450
 due to frustration in this 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.070
 information jumble has been lost on 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.810
 meaning of site review 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.420
 even the concept has been lost on the internet 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.010
 true of masterpiece and the fault is not alone 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.840
 of the big sight that perhaps they are 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.640
 commercialized the fault of all 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.590
 how many in a scenario that acts as 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.600
 mirror to a market where for some time 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.920
 no one reasons more with his head but 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.920
 buy based on the reputation of the brand 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.450
 the hype generated around it is not 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.710
 knows more than whom to trust when you are 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.140
 undecided about buying a game 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.430
 especially if these famous and should not 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.290
 get bad marks 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.720
 and I'm talking as a reader as I am 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.310
 been and still are to defend themselves from 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.220
 this situation must begin at 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.600
 think seriously about your purchases 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.040
 reading her blessed reviews that 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.680
 they are more than useful when you have them 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.630
 perplexity and seeking answers but not 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.850
 we must focus on evaluation 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.190
 is the text that contains the information 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.740
 necessary to get an idea of ​​the game 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.840
 read several different reviews 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.670
 portals from the largest and most renowned up to 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.740
 to the youngest of independent without 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.690
 take care of the numerical evaluation on 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.910
 first step towards the right direction 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.160
 to follow we can also look 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.960
 some gameplay videos that can lighten up 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.610
 even more the ideas and the bravest 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.080
 can also try reading the 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.880
 comments on facebook pages 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.530
 if nothing else the laughter will be made 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.110
 light of ignorance that depopulates among the 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.850
 alleged pd players of today 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.100
 finally, if you really want to give too 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.900
 a look at the numerical vote is due 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.030
 first look at the criteria of 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.430
 particular small site evaluation 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.190
 that nobody 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.200
 one never considers us that 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.180
 we write instead we must stop 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.370
 let us be subjugated by the layman by the name 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.310
 of the game it takes the courage of 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.630
 evaluate a product for what it is 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.940
 regardless of the obnoxious comments of the 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.770
 fan boy on duty ready to live there as 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.570
 incompetent when maybe while you 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.790
 you played shinobi them still flab 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.440
 nipples compartment to feed if we have 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.180
 decided to do information we can not 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.250
 bend us the market rules 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.780
 we cannot give 10 to a title because 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.700
 everyone likes it and sells like bread
