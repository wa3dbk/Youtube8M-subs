00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.550 
actually play two players without having
to<00:01:35.520> split<00:01:35.759> your<00:01:35.909> screen<00:01:36.200> like<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.350> split

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
to split your screen like the split

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560 
to split your screen like the split
screen<00:01:37.680> feature<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.399> the<00:01:38.520> other<00:01:38.640> consoles<00:01:39.180> so

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
screen feature in the other consoles so

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.819 
screen feature in the other consoles so
I<00:01:39.600> thought<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.960> was<00:01:40.079> pretty<00:01:40.200> cool<00:01:40.469> that<00:01:40.530> we

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
I thought that was pretty cool that we

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.560 
I thought that was pretty cool that we
both<00:01:40.979> were<00:01:41.460> playing<00:01:41.700> at<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> same<00:01:42.060> time<00:01:42.270> and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
both were playing at the same time and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.149 
both were playing at the same time and
we<00:01:42.689> both<00:01:42.930> had<00:01:43.140> kind<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.469> like<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> full<00:01:43.890> screen

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
we both had kind of like a full screen

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.370 
we both had kind of like a full screen
experience<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.810> yeah<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.229> thought<00:01:46.320> that

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
experience so yeah I just thought that

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.380 
experience so yeah I just thought that
was<00:01:46.530> pretty<00:01:46.680> cool<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.219> if<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.030> for<00:01:48.240> those<00:01:48.360> who

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
was pretty cool and if you for those who

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.090 
was pretty cool and if you for those who
don't<00:01:48.630> know<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:49.110> use<00:01:49.469> four<00:01:49.920> different

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.889 
don't know you can use four different

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.710 
settings a lot which is another good
thing<00:02:47.099> that<00:02:47.430> they<00:02:47.819> did<00:02:48.000> right<00:02:48.180> there's<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.510> lot

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720

really stress it enough
it<00:02:58.079> runs<00:02:58.319> so<00:02:58.530> smoothly<00:02:58.859> now<00:02:59.219> because<00:02:59.549> it's<00:02:59.700> on

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
it runs so smoothly now because it's on

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.030 
it runs so smoothly now because it's on
60<00:03:00.180> frames<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.540> second<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.500> if<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.709> guys<00:03:01.889> are

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
update I guess for the Wii U when it

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.490 
update I guess for the Wii U when it
comes<00:04:26.580> out<00:04:26.729> initially<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:27.180> software<00:04:27.659> update<00:04:27.810> so

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
comes out initially a software update so

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.600 
comes out initially a software update so
that<00:04:28.650> you<00:04:28.710> can<00:04:28.860> start<00:04:29.070> playing<00:04:29.220> your<00:04:29.430> games

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
that you can start playing your games

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.100 
that you can start playing your games
and<00:04:29.789> all<00:04:29.880> that<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.150> actually<00:04:30.449> took<00:04:30.720> me<00:04:30.780> pretty

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
and all that it actually took me pretty

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.620 
and all that it actually took me pretty
long<00:04:31.289> it's<00:04:31.500> about<00:04:31.710> half<00:04:32.370> hour<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.820> 45<00:04:32.849> minutes

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
long it's about half hour to 45 minutes

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.879 
long it's about half hour to 45 minutes
and<00:04:33.810> then<00:04:33.930> there's<00:04:34.110> actually<00:04:34.440> another<00:04:34.620> update

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
and then there's actually another update
