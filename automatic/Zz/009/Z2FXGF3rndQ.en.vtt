00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.540 
looking at the demo I there was an
ex-con<00:01:54.630> soldier<00:01:55.050> that's<00:01:55.200> God<00:01:55.890> incapacitated

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
ex-con soldier that's God incapacitated

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.040 
ex-con soldier that's God incapacitated
yeah<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.210> had<00:01:57.300> to<00:01:57.330> carry<00:01:57.600> her<00:01:57.840> out

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
yeah and then you had to carry her out

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.039 
yeah and then you had to carry her out
um<00:01:58.640> how<00:01:59.640> does<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.909> work<00:02:00.330> compared<00:02:00.870> to<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
um how does that work compared to the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.330 
um how does that work compared to the
older<00:02:01.290> game<00:02:01.409> because<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.830> older<00:02:02.010> game<00:02:02.130> if

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
older game because in the older game if

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.250 
older game because in the older game if
they<00:02:02.610> got<00:02:02.940> incapacitated<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.659> stabilize

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
they got incapacitated you stabilize

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260 
they got incapacitated you stabilize
them<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:04.620> then<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.280> could<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.670> leave<00:02:05.850> yeah

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
them and then you could just leave yeah

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.150 
them and then you could just leave yeah
but<00:02:06.420> did<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.350> get<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.620> character<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.010> now

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
but did you get the character so now

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.460 
but did you get the character so now
yeah<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.850> you<00:02:09.239> know<00:02:09.330> again<00:02:09.479> exhale<00:02:09.869> exhale<00:02:10.350> me

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
yeah so you know again exhale exhale me

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.810 
yeah so you know again exhale exhale me
you<00:02:10.590> as<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.769> game<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.130> was<00:02:11.220> about<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.700> know

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
you as a game that was about you know

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.120 
you as a game that was about you know
making<00:02:11.970> makes<00:02:12.480> making<00:02:12.989> meaningful<00:02:13.830> decisions

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
making makes making meaningful decisions

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.699 
making makes making meaningful decisions
and<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:15.140> one<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.320> things<00:02:16.350> where<00:02:16.650> we

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
and so one of the things where we

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:17.750 
and so one of the things where we
thought<00:02:16.830> we<00:02:16.890> could<00:02:16.920> kind<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.220> expand<00:02:17.580> on<00:02:17.700> that

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
thought we could kind of expand on that

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.520 
thought we could kind of expand on that
was<00:02:18.060> was<00:02:18.420> carrying<00:02:18.810> your<00:02:18.900> soldiers<00:02:19.260> off<00:02:19.380> the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
was was carrying your soldiers off the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.250 
was was carrying your soldiers off the
battlefield<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.730> if<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.299> have<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> soldier

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
battlefield and so if you have a soldier

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.830 
battlefield and so if you have a soldier
who<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.500> critically<00:02:22.950> wounded<00:02:23.160> dinner<00:02:23.340> or

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
who is critically wounded dinner or

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.990 
who is critically wounded dinner or
in<00:02:24.349> capacity<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.040> can<00:02:25.069> actually<00:02:25.370> pick<00:02:25.849> them

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
in capacity you can actually pick them

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.940 
in capacity you can actually pick them
up<00:02:26.060> an<00:02:26.390> evac<00:02:27.080> but<00:02:27.349> it's<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.530> choice<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:27.830> have<00:02:27.860> to

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
up an evac but it's a choice you have to

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.530 
up an evac but it's a choice you have to
make<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.400> it's<00:02:28.819> got<00:02:28.970> some<00:02:29.090> trade-offs<00:02:29.269> to<00:02:29.450> it

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
make and it's got some trade-offs to it

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.830 
make and it's got some trade-offs to it
along<00:02:29.690> on<00:02:30.170> with<00:02:30.349> it<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:31.360> you'll<00:02:32.360> you'll<00:02:32.720> make

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
along on with it so you'll you'll make

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.940 
along on with it so you'll you'll make
that<00:02:32.870> choice<00:02:33.140> or<00:02:33.379> not<00:02:33.500> make<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.769> choice

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
that choice or not make that choice

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.380 
that choice or not make that choice
depending<00:02:34.340> on<00:02:34.430> how<00:02:34.519> valuable<00:02:34.819> soldier<00:02:35.239> was

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
depending on how valuable soldier was

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.979 
depending on how valuable soldier was
too<00:02:35.510> okay<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.530> guess<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:38.330> last<00:02:38.510> thing<00:02:38.690> that<00:02:38.840> I

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
too okay I guess the last thing that I

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.199 
too okay I guess the last thing that I
wanted<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.290> mention<00:02:39.560> was<00:02:39.950> at<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.730> end<00:02:40.879> of<00:02:41.030> the

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
wanted to mention was at the end of the

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.309 
wanted to mention was at the end of the
reveal<00:02:41.959> trailer<00:02:42.200> if<00:02:42.560> there<00:02:42.769> was<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.280> know<00:02:43.310> big

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
reveal trailer if there was you know big

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.380 
reveal trailer if there was you know big
ship<00:02:45.319> that<00:02:46.220> would<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.400> think<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.879> would<00:02:47.060> acts<00:02:47.269> as

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
ship that would I think it would acts as

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.839 
ship that would I think it would acts as
a<00:02:47.420> base<00:02:47.900> now<00:02:48.110> yes<00:02:48.319> yep<00:02:48.739> so<00:02:48.950> my<00:02:49.459> question<00:02:49.489> was

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
a base now yes yep so my question was

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.240 
a base now yes yep so my question was
considering<00:02:50.360> XCOM<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:51.500> first<00:02:51.680> one<00:02:51.830> focused<00:02:52.129> a

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
considering XCOM the first one focused a

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.979 
considering XCOM the first one focused a
lot<00:02:52.400> on<00:02:52.459> base<00:02:52.760> building<00:02:53.030> yeah<00:02:53.480> how<00:02:53.750> is<00:02:53.780> that

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
lot on base building yeah how is that

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.370 
lot on base building yeah how is that
gonna<00:02:54.200> play<00:02:54.650> into<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.220> whole<00:02:55.400> big<00:02:56.150> ship<00:02:56.660> so

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
gonna play into the whole big ship so

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.630 
gonna play into the whole big ship so
there's<00:02:57.709> something<00:02:58.010> there's<00:02:58.190> still<00:02:58.370> base

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
there's something there's still base

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.000 
there's something there's still base
building<00:02:58.910> of<00:02:59.329> course<00:02:59.690> but<00:03:00.500> your<00:03:00.620> base<00:03:00.739> moves

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
building of course but your base moves

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.670 
building of course but your base moves
and<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.780> yeah<00:03:02.930> there's<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.170> whole<00:03:03.380> another

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
and and yeah there's a whole another

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.229 
and and yeah there's a whole another
layer<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.250> game<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.670> strategy<00:03:05.030> section

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
layer to the game the strategy section

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.210 
layer to the game the strategy section
that<00:03:05.480> we<00:03:05.569> we<00:03:05.870> we<00:03:06.170> haven't<00:03:06.410> really<00:03:06.500> go<00:03:06.920> on<00:03:07.040> into

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
that we we we haven't really go on into

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.160 
that we we we haven't really go on into
the<00:03:07.280> depth<00:03:07.400> look<00:03:07.579> but<00:03:07.819> but<00:03:08.420> yeah<00:03:08.540> base

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
the depth look but but yeah base

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.440 
the depth look but but yeah base
building<00:03:09.410> will<00:03:09.590> still<00:03:09.739> be<00:03:09.829> there<00:03:10.329> that<00:03:11.329> it

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
building will still be there that it

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.920 
building will still be there that it
that<00:03:11.569> is<00:03:11.690> part<00:03:11.870> of<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.049> the<00:03:12.349> excom<00:03:12.920> DNA<00:03:13.310> and

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
that is part of the the excom DNA and

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.569 
that is part of the the excom DNA and
yeah<00:03:14.930> but<00:03:15.110> now<00:03:15.260> its<00:03:15.410> moves<00:03:15.709> now<00:03:16.069> just<00:03:16.340> this

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579
