00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
Supercross and motocross basically we

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.010

got<00:00:29.640> into<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.000> sport<00:00:30.349> a<00:00:31.349> couple<00:00:32.279> years<00:00:32.520> ago

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
got into the sport a couple years ago

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.229 
got into the sport a couple years ago
and<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.829> reason<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.340> chose<00:00:35.550> KTM

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
and the reason that we chose KTM

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.479 
and the reason that we chose KTM
obviously<00:00:37.050> outside<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> colors<00:00:38.190> being

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
obviously outside of the colors being

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.540 
obviously outside of the colors being
orange<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.180> matching<00:00:39.890> Jagermeister<00:00:40.890> brand

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
orange and matching Jagermeister brand

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.389 
orange and matching Jagermeister brand
colors<00:00:41.969> but<00:00:42.450> also<00:00:42.950> was<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> fact<00:00:44.250> that

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
colors but also was the fact that

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.580 
colors but also was the fact that
they're<00:00:44.579> both<00:00:44.760> European<00:00:45.360> companies<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.079> so

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
they're both European companies and so

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.100 
they're both European companies and so
we<00:00:46.710> wanted<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.039> make<00:00:47.219> sure<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.780> we<00:00:48.780> chose<00:00:49.050> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
