00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.230
 hello everyone my name is Ruben Amun and 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.230
 I welcome you to the course of 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.360
 modeling character for video games the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.919
 or Paul and the software that we will use 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.960
 will be 3d studio max 2012 our goal 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.829
 main will be the creation of a mesh 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.320
 with very few polygons 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.769
 so the final result will be 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.000
 optimal for importing to any 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.949
 graphic engine type unit and public if 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.780
 we look at the last generation of 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.649
 videogames one of the ingredients 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.640
 main is realism what 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.250
 it entails very detailed graphics 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.160
 that result in consumption 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.530
 of great resources of the machine the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.140
 modeling the political as objective 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.720
 main savings of this kind of 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.150
 resources 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.910
 the optimal number of polygons for a 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:18.080
 Full 3d model is around the 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:22.090
 2,500 3000 polygons the course that is to 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.310
 Point to start consists of 21 videos 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.820
 without counting the present and we will begin 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.330
 with the setup of the scene where you 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.820
 I explain the use of reference images 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.030
 as a little help to have in 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.570
 count the proportions of a model 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.240
 real 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.710
 we will continue with torso modeling 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.260
 shoulders arms legs feet and hands we 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.410
 We stop modeling of the face and 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.750
 the head we will pay special 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.500
 importance to the optimization of certain 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.290
 details of the resulting mesh 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.590
 already in video 15 we will open a chapter 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.750
 apart with the modeling of clothing 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.560
 so we'll see how a jacket is modeled 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.470
 some boots and pants 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.290
 I will also teach you how to model a weapon 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.520
 for our character in this case it 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.160
 It's about a katana 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.630
 and to finish the course we will give 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.460
 forms the mouth and ears in the eyes and 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.320
 I can only wish those who have a good time 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.880
 also as I have spent in the 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.100
 modeling this character for 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.100
 videogames with few polygons
