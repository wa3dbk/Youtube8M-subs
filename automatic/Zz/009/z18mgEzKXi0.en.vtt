00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.090
 prepared for congratulations and I 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.310
 the flowers that I steal from my mother 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.710

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.850
 what does this video video try to do and 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.800
 above 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.530
 how not to lose the diet that me 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.110
 material and and snake wanna motivate 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.719
 those people those girls mostly up 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.730
 who are overweight those who 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.190
 tend to exhaustion and those who 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.350
 strive to take exactly this extra weight 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.760
 which prevents to get it some 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.140
 perezaliv because it is a video on 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.730
 channel on my already was on was 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.829
 terrible disgusting by all criteria 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.780
 and they generally did not like either 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.789
 so i'm im usually a song we feel 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.190
 a breakdown we feel when we break 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.600
 covers us and we understand what we want 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.489
 to break that we are here now 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.240
 right we wait usually flog in the evening 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.159
 its that you are tired of the mood yes we are 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.250
 feel the first thing to do before 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.939
 you just need to think why 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.990
 you spent the time that sit and 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.909
 why did we spend the strength 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.520
 doing sports up to 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.350
 physical exertion exhausting themselves and 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.950
 holding ourselves constantly why are we 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.530
 spent 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.900
 here these here these are possible on hearts why 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.320
 you just spend then since you 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.270
 go mad and lose the result why 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.950
 second point is an important hobby 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.560
 we each have some 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.829
 increase codes that carry 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.490
 entice absolutely we abstract 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:49.710
 of all and forget about food about thoughts of breaking i 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.650
 on a diet very often we are pursued 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.870
 just killed fat if they 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.920
 me and we need to do this next 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.200
 whether we are habib 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.060
 which will distract you from these us to 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.670
 You can cross stitching circle 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.910
 beading beading reading drawing 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.980
 screen singing music is a method on 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.950
 all kinds of dances anything sport 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.450
 all you like is something everyone has 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.730
 man from this is such an occupation 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.340
 which extracts it absolutely also 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.160
 before the explosion must somehow with a 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.900
 talk that is what i did i just 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.940
 moved away from the computer on tv 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.920
 put on headphones included some of his 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.260
 the motivating music that i had 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.240
 on his arm, and torture also have immediately 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.980
 turned on music closed eyes sat down 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.680
 before you go into the kitchen and gobble 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.500
 cake or something else military is 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.170
 rarely started a conversation with him in my head I 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.209
 I ask myself why I started trying 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.130
 set it up then that positive mood i 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.900
 boiled that if I do not decide the results 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.030
 now it doesnâ€™t mean u see 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.770
 when that is, you can't just go with 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.420
 the right path cannot be turned off 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.400
 where if you go goal means you go 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.880
 khz and no need to go anywhere going 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.010
 where to set yourself up somehow that everything will be 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.700
 well everyone will fail if I am now 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.440
 at the very 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.269
 that is, I do not need a situation well, in short 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.519
 talked with so maybe it sounds 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.140
 schizophrenia how are you not at all normal but 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.050
 yes it helped me 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.720
 girls with summer square are usually sandwiched 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.090
 fettered they don't like going out at all on 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.769
 buy to appear society i was such i 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.570
 was notorious when I only 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.000
 I started to lose weight when I realized that I was fat 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.910
 previously did not understand that fat was not 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.580
 firm when down 2012 4 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.160
 I realized that I was so stout and I 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.959
 just found a bunch of complexes to 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.610
 get rid of the matrix and feel 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.800
 sure need like that 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.610
 work on yourself also need to take on 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.000
 prioritize what's more important to you 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.310
 a piece of junk food in the mouth kick drink 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.920
 or slim and healthy body swap 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.560
 priorities either you break down and just 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.500
 get out of the way 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.569
 and lose the result or you continue 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.250
 work on yourself and not lose 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.920
 self confidence is more important to you 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.080
 when I personally lost weight and yes to myself 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.970
 somehow motivate I imagined myself 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.239
 already thinner drew herself an image 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.550
 strict authority and just remembered about 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.440
 this image thought about the result that is 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.790

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.680

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.130
 result correctly result 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.530
