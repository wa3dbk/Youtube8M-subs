the twelfth fret g string on the twelfth

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.410 
the twelfth fret g string on the twelfth
fret<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:32.280> hit<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.549> one<00:02:32.670> above<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.150> F

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
fret you hit the one above it the F

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.890 
fret you hit the one above it the F
sharp<00:02:34.880> that's<00:02:35.880> going<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.209> it's<00:02:36.510> going<00:02:36.599> to<00:02:36.780> give

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
sharp that's going to it's going to give

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.599 
sharp that's going to it's going to give
you<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.019> G<00:02:37.230> because<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> string<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:37.950> bent<00:02:38.310> and

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
you a G because the string is bent and

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:44.360 
you a G because the string is bent and
the<00:02:39.269> pitch<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.930> string<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.200> raised<00:02:43.370> and

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
the pitch of the string is raised and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.620 
the pitch of the string is raised and
like<00:02:44.669> I<00:02:44.760> said<00:02:44.819> you<00:02:45.060> could<00:02:45.150> do<00:02:45.269> anything<00:02:45.299> you

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
like I said you could do anything you

00:02:45.630 --> 00:03:02.420 
like I said you could do anything you
long<00:02:45.780> before<00:02:45.930> in<00:02:46.139> front<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.470> that<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:02.250> could

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
long before in front of that you could

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:18.620 
long before in front of that you could
also<00:03:02.579> do<00:03:02.849> stuff<00:03:03.090> like<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.299> and<00:03:17.299> I<00:03:18.299> suppose

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
also do stuff like this and I suppose

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.290 
also do stuff like this and I suppose
that's<00:03:18.810> lesson<00:03:19.139> one
