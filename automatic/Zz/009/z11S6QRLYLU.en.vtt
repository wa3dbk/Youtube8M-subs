00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
is I mean it's smooth it's just tarnish

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
is I mean it's smooth it's just tarnish
it's<00:04:22.479> not<00:04:22.660> like<00:04:22.960> I<00:04:24.510> mean<00:04:25.510> it'll<00:04:25.720> clean<00:04:25.960> up<00:04:25.990> like

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
it's not like I mean it'll clean up like

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.159 
it's not like I mean it'll clean up like
a<00:04:26.350> mirror<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:27.970> it's<00:04:28.180> real<00:04:28.360> tight<00:04:28.660> I<00:04:28.900> mean<00:04:29.050> when

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
a mirror and it's real tight I mean when

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.550 
a mirror and it's real tight I mean when
you<00:04:29.260> close<00:04:29.500> it<00:04:29.770> you<00:04:30.690> can<00:04:31.690> see<00:04:31.870> stuff<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.320> pinch

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
you close it you can see stuff to pinch

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.120 
you close it you can see stuff to pinch
a<00:04:32.710> little<00:04:32.860> bit

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
a little bit

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.650 
a little bit
and<00:04:33.639> that<00:04:33.820> thing<00:04:34.030> close<00:04:34.300> isn't<00:04:34.600> doesn't<00:04:36.660> so

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
and that thing close isn't doesn't so

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.510 
and that thing close isn't doesn't so
mean<00:04:37.900> I'm<00:04:38.139> assuming<00:04:38.260> this<00:04:38.680> isn't<00:04:38.889> a<00:04:39.100> knockoff

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
mean I'm assuming this isn't a knockoff

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.260 
mean I'm assuming this isn't a knockoff
that's<00:04:40.090> a<00:04:40.180> good<00:04:40.389> one<00:04:41.250> but<00:04:43.380> see<00:04:44.380> if<00:04:44.440> I<00:04:44.560> can<00:04:44.710> go
