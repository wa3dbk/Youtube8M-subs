00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 well this is dedicated to 2 francisco 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.560
 be it for it to be for I remove the red of 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.350
 sevilla great among the great 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:15.770
 he died from childhood 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:18.300
 well my childhood has already good and 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.279
 what I want is that I do it with a lot 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.010
 true love and for so many years paid 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.390
 low then it 's a game where yes 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.580
 there would be a spectator here I would tell 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.100
 leave your deck or mix this deck what 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.309
 let it be and draw high numbers letters 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.620
 high red and black and it takes out that 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.050
 take out 4 that are what they want from 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.590
 truth that they are the four cards that more 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.019
 like those of high numbers and 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.720
 I ask you please and take out for example 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.820
 these eight cards in the sleeves 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.400
 rolled up and I say look here there are 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.489
 four has taken out four blacks and says yes 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.640
 and he has taken four red and says it 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.129
 what purpose the truth moves four 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.409
 red and four black on the side are the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.400
 red and red flags I give you a turn 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:11.130
 that turn immediately 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.540
 you see the face also immediately 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.850
 that turn makes the letters 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.310
 become a bit magical and these 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.470
 others and I make the turn like that too 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.180
 they become magical because they 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.430
 I turn it into magic 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.190
 as follows because the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.800
 colors that are now together I'm going to 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.260
 separate and to separate them what I do is 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.420
 that intercalated a black of the red the 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.310
 is interspersed and in this way they remain 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.650
 separated but as they have become 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.710
 magical you are going to see what happens to 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.530
 the colors as soon as I left them a 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.229
 moment as they are very clearly 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.350
 in front and behind comes 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.630
 alternating I will close well very clear 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.430
 very clear that there is no doubt that you see 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.300
 and until the last moment with two 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.550
 little fingers doing nothing at all 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.320
 but be careful because as soon as a 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:05.940
 magical pass the colors separate 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.310
 I'm going to push the space letters 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.580
 slowly like this until they fit 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.250
 completely square squares there are 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.430
 to do that if the turn and when 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.390
 makes chosen for having made spin 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.390
 immediately wait to see if it comes out 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.250
 it is done like this 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.250
 and without more or less the four letters 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.489
 this is how it is and it is important to deliver it to 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.470
 that nobody believes that the colors are 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.689
 they change color or something and you are given 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.319
 You can advance a hand although you do not have 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:47.579
 hand in hand 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.080
 examines them, sees them from wounds no longer 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.370
 are not 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.620
 completely 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:59.430
 for you thank you very much want it alone one 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.430
 does not appear
