00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
scrunching it and it will help maintain

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.960

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
the wavy effect and literally it takes

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.869 
the wavy effect and literally it takes
like<00:02:21.120> five<00:02:21.300> minutes<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.780> do<00:02:21.959> before<00:02:22.920> school<00:02:23.250> so
