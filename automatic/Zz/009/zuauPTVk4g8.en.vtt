 they say that moose is black 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.640
 support this ridiculous joke but 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.310
 then weight but in the computer opened in the evening 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.960
 and and become this growth santiago this dress 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.099

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.140
 wrote and saw it blue-black yes 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.890
 so I am superman who is now 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.690
 may even change as a resident of this party 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.170
 live in the world without knowing how each person 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.440
 which I know saw this dress and mine 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.579
 Subscribers too , firstly this is your book 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.579
 Richard Dawkins 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.430
 I discovered a long time for just about 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.710
 this month although I knew it earlier 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.390
 What is the time it exists in the world is 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.239
 one of his early books is called 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.150
 blind watchmaker 8 what a sorcerer is written 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.970
 it seems like a kind peel who doesn't know such 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.090
 zoologist scientist and you can say philanthropist 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.850
 which contains the whole ford ranger then up 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.640
 the end and as I understand it the main occupation 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.700
 of this foundation spread science do 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.250
 science trendy you come in 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.690
 fight creationists and creationists 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.470
 these are people who are in the states 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.970
 Yes, anyone states pofantazuyu something to 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.990
 children were not taught theory in schools 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:38.080
 evolution from and basement which fact 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.620
 that god created animals 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.640
 where is everything for life why is it to trudge from 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.380
 of this book because she made me 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.410
 get interested in what i used to be 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.200
 not interested and that means everything 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.560
 besides humanities here 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.660
 boffins to prove capable argument 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.640
 what is natural evolution theory 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.010
 Darwin is the only possible way 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.750
 explain the appearance of people proves 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.750
 his argument he comes in a lot 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.080
 interesting facts from the world of animals with 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.470
 of how the earth was a good nanny man 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.090
 and before the appearance of life in general and so 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.460
 great these because now we have 21 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.810
 century then developed science that seems to me 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.960
 here we are ordinary people are accustomed so you are chris 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.910
 flash simple questions that you 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.040
 interested but know for sure that yes there 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.110
 there is quantum physics or does it seem 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.510
 sorry proved that there are parallels 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.400
 and it's so complicated that we don't even 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.700
 trying to understand this . 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.270
 he asks the question is not shy type 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.260
 do you know where the person came from 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.099
 generally 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.560
 man has passed now for this my new 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:03:01.189
 fascination is to look at youtube every 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:03.950
 debate atheists vs i put 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:09.200
 blamed on these sofas and you 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:12.560
 sharpness and so i'm not a religious person 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.510
 in theory, I should always there such demos 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.579
 agree with atheists 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.609
 and usually i agree but very often 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.760
 It happens and that people ebb, too, say 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:27.010
 very interesting things that me 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.010
 takes and it's cool 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.530
 another canister book which me in from 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.019
 revenge is very much remembered this 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.000
 room giovanni and I will tell you already 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.150
 previous video if that link here 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.150
 here 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.590
 oh my one more speaks directly to me 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.349
 there is this shirt with my logo 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:54.930
 favorite blog this text would usually be 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:58.330
 the internet will need a fight and 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.000
 Free t-shirt in only had 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.489
 for shipping and I decided to order myself 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.060
 T-shirt and now I go and I hope that 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:11.549
 someone gets to say oh god. this 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:16.209
 block and we will be friends forever not 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:18.340
 want there will be about everything there 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.620
 very original guy and you wrote on 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.150
 time my favorite post is where he writes 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.580
 about Fermi paradox 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.660
 that is why the aliens are endless 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.790
 have contacted us 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.110
 although in essence considering how huge 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.050
 the number of planets exists besides 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.630
 knives is strange that according to probability theory 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.440
 none of them appeared so 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.850
 life did not appear such an alarm 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.620
 which we have already reached such a level 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.520
 so that they could precede by others 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:52.120
 planets and eventually would find us 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:55.090
 strange that it did not happen simply and 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.520
 this post is written simultaneously and 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.490
 scientific and fascinating explanation 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.780
 why so several options 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.470
 could happen 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.180
 cool i hope we are not the only ones 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.590
 living things in the universe 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:13.600
 by the way it would be very sad still I 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.560
 I want to tell you about one reign series 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.930
 This girls Elena then us which can 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.750
 be you know recently the book did not come out 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.840
 our sensational above because it is already 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.430
 known for this series notes around 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.250
 and this series 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.889
 he pretends to 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.240
 reflect the essence of our generation of mine 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.250
 generations of 20 year olds 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.100
 it's very strange because the action 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.000
 the series happens in new york and i live 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.490
 in Almaty 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.560
 but I still identify very much 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.620
 the main characters with all their 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:53.460
 problems with thoughts that are overcome 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:56.470
 yes it is exactly here our knees up guy 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.560
 or do you like someone like to know gay 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.690
 he or not or how do you know just 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.860
 make friends and or almost start 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:10.199
 meet and the more often be friends and 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:12.970
 if there is a question of the week it is long 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:16.510
 I highly recommend to read it 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:18.090
 because you need to be all he on and 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.400
 at last 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:25.120
 I come I think very rarely come 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:28.419
 but I'm really hooked on frozen 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.040
 yogurt from fruit republic and i opened 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:32.630
 when I do not eat this yogurt I think about him 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:37.970
 nothing much just frozen 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:40.550
 yogurt is like ice cream and berries itself 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:44.450
 process and just love the portfolio 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:47.330
 they look like this sad package 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:50.300
 coupe italy 90s what for me 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.630
 now the most perfect friday is go 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.610
 cinema jacqueline migal 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:58.040
 before or after that sit on 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:03.590
 frozen yogurt parfen from large 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:06.800
 public and everything i'm happy my day is just 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:09.980
 not everyone talks about me today 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.930
 made me say so don't get 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.520
 and write in the comments what you 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.780
 liked in this place that you 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.850
 interesting looked read and ate 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:24.940
 i will be happy to hear for 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.940
 recommendations we will see meaningful
