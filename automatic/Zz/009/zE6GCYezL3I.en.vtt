00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
to begin flicking my pencil around

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.380 
to begin flicking my pencil around
creating

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
creating

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.380 
creating
those<00:02:13.630> little<00:02:13.840> shadows<00:02:17.850> kind<00:02:18.850> of<00:02:18.910> helping<00:02:19.240> out

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
those little shadows kind of helping out

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.150 
those little shadows kind of helping out
to<00:02:19.569> find<00:02:19.810> those<00:02:19.959> clumps<00:02:20.380> in<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.590> hair<00:02:23.160> any

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
to find those clumps in the hair any

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.100 
to find those clumps in the hair any
kind<00:02:24.459> of<00:02:24.550> parts<00:02:24.910> I'm<00:02:25.060> going<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.270> be<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.510> pulling

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
kind of parts I'm going to be in pulling

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:33.660 
kind of parts I'm going to be in pulling
in<00:02:26.319> my<00:02:26.500> parts<00:02:31.830> sideburns<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.920> little<00:02:33.130> bit<00:02:33.280> back

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
in my parts sideburns a little bit back

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:55.220 
in my parts sideburns a little bit back
behind<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:34.060> ear

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.140 

so<00:02:55.770> as<00:02:56.099> I'm<00:02:56.280> putting<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.580> in<00:02:56.700> here<00:02:56.970> I'm

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
so as I'm putting this in here I'm

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.699 
so as I'm putting this in here I'm
finding<00:02:57.420> where<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.720> want<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.170> push<00:02:58.379> things<00:02:58.560> back

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
finding where I want to push things back

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.979 
finding where I want to push things back
but<00:02:59.129> I'm<00:02:59.519> also<00:02:59.670> saying<00:03:00.090> where<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.540> highlights

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
but I'm also saying where the highlights

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.720 
but I'm also saying where the highlights
are<00:03:01.200> going<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.590> shine<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.069> brightest<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:02.610> the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
are going to shine the brightest on the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.250 
are going to shine the brightest on the
head<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.300> this<00:03:03.450> case<00:03:03.690> it's<00:03:03.870> gonna<00:03:03.959> be<00:03:04.050> the

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
head so in this case it's gonna be the

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.690 
head so in this case it's gonna be the
crowds<00:03:04.560> gonna<00:03:04.830> make<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.099> a<00:03:05.160> little<00:03:05.340> bit<00:03:05.550> of<00:03:05.640> a

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
crowds gonna make this a little bit of a

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.800 
crowds gonna make this a little bit of a
halo<00:03:06.150> right<00:03:06.360> in<00:03:06.540> here<00:03:07.819> so<00:03:08.819> as<00:03:08.970> I'm<00:03:09.150> adding<00:03:09.480> my

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
halo right in here so as I'm adding my

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.900 
halo right in here so as I'm adding my
color<00:03:10.080> in<00:03:10.290> here<00:03:10.470> I'm<00:03:10.620> not<00:03:10.650> adding<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.430> in<00:03:11.670> this

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
color in here I'm not adding it in this

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:12.710 
color in here I'm not adding it in this
section<00:03:12.180> here

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
section here

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.410 
section here
I<00:03:12.750> might<00:03:13.230> bring<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.560> line<00:03:13.800> up<00:03:14.099> through<00:03:14.640> it<00:03:14.819> that

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
I might bring a line up through it that

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.640 
I might bring a line up through it that
kind<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.690> helps<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.019> give<00:03:16.260> some<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.530> little

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
kind of helps to give some a little

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.710 
kind of helps to give some a little
dimension<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.370> texture<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.880> hair<00:03:18.180> but

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
dimension and texture to the hair but

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.839 
dimension and texture to the hair but
I'm<00:03:18.810> not<00:03:18.930> coloring<00:03:19.260> this<00:03:19.440> all<00:03:19.590> in<00:03:19.800> once<00:03:20.730> you

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
I'm not coloring this all in once you

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.729 
I'm not coloring this all in once you
have<00:03:21.030> this<00:03:21.239> kind<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.540> mid-tone<00:03:21.989> put<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.590> in<00:03:22.650> the

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
have this kind of mid-tone put it in the

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.289 
have this kind of mid-tone put it in the
way<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:22.890> like<00:03:23.190> you're<00:03:23.730> gonna<00:03:23.849> go<00:03:24.090> ahead<00:03:24.150> and

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
way you like you're gonna go ahead and

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.990 
way you like you're gonna go ahead and
add<00:03:24.629> in<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.170> darker<00:03:25.680> tone<00:03:25.890> now<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.489> can<00:03:26.819> go

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
add in a darker tone now you can go

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.400 
add in a darker tone now you can go
ahead<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.180> add<00:03:27.450> it<00:03:27.599> in<00:03:27.720> with<00:03:27.750> just<00:03:28.019> a<00:03:28.080> darker

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
ahead and add it in with just a darker

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.199 
ahead and add it in with just a darker
Brown<00:03:28.650> or<00:03:29.099> you<00:03:29.310> could<00:03:29.459> have<00:03:29.549> fun<00:03:29.760> with<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:30.060> add

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
Brown or you could have fun with it add

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.990 
Brown or you could have fun with it add
a<00:03:30.269> contrasting<00:03:31.170> color<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.530> kind<00:03:31.769> of<00:03:31.920> make<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.819> a

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
a contrasting color to kind of make it a

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.620 
a contrasting color to kind of make it a
little<00:03:33.030> bit<00:03:34.610> interesting<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:36.180> let's<00:03:36.390> try<00:03:36.599> it

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
little bit interesting so let's try it

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.960 
little bit interesting so let's try it
I'm<00:03:37.079> gonna<00:03:37.260> go<00:03:37.440> with<00:03:37.590> this<00:03:37.769> slate<00:03:38.280> gray<00:03:38.640> and

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
I'm gonna go with this slate gray and

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.479 
I'm gonna go with this slate gray and
again<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.959> same<00:03:40.230> technique<00:03:40.829> I'm<00:03:41.099> just<00:03:41.370> gonna

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
again the same technique I'm just gonna

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:54.220 
again the same technique I'm just gonna
flick<00:03:41.910> my<00:03:42.150> colors

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.110 

so<00:03:55.220> you<00:03:55.310> could<00:03:55.550> definitely<00:03:55.670> do<00:03:55.970> this

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
so you could definitely do this

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.479 
so you could definitely do this
shadowing<00:03:56.569> with<00:03:56.750> just<00:03:56.959> darker<00:03:57.349> Browns<00:03:57.620> but<00:03:58.400> I

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
shadowing with just darker Browns but I

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.580 
shadowing with just darker Browns but I
find<00:03:58.760> just<00:03:59.000> testing<00:03:59.480> out<00:03:59.629> the<00:03:59.810> water<00:04:00.019> sinking

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
find just testing out the water sinking

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.080 
find just testing out the water sinking
