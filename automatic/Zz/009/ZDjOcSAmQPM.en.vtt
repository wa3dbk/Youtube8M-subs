00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.910
 crew battles 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.420
 today we will talk about such a tank as m103 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.000
 this car is an american heavy tank 9 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.610
 level for me there pretty much 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.320
 liked though can not be said to 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.910
 probably he bent this one strongly 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.570
 flashlight of course he has me very much 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.180
 like such as cyclops becomes 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.130
 very merry very tanchik well before 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.710
 all because of what but still he 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.830
 more or less goes yes she has a maximum speed 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.329
 the highest is also 30 kilometers per hour 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.239
 but in any case he gathers them 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.329
 pretty cheerfully also what we have 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.800
 there is in principle a good forehead armor 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.710
 the upper armor is not making its way almost 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.110
 by anyone and the towers are very so ricochet but 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.520
 bottom armor sheet sadly sew us all 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.350
 projectile damage 665 units breaking 269 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.239
 grandmother then there is enough of that in 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.430
 turnover betting 7th level without any 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.989
 problems sometimes arise up of course 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.489
 situations when it will be difficult for someone 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.680
 punch but for that we have gold 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.580
 shells in general and bbc is always enough 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.920
 general tanchik to 100 pretty 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.630
 interesting and more than that gun 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.430
 recharges for about 7 seconds 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.670
 only 6.9 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.710
 that is, with a damage 665 we average 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.619
 quite good rate of fire unlike 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.840
 Isa and unfortunately the information we have is not 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.820
 very two point one tenth 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.350
 that is, we get it of course a little 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.930
 faster and 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.759
 maybe a little faster rate 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.340
 an instrument but in any case it is less 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.540
 exact and quite the way seriously 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.659
 less sure you'll see 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.579
 i'm half wound up and caught equally 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.320
 the building immediately with this gun not fall 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.170
 options like this now trying 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.079
 do i of course i understood it and already here 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.810
 general, no problem can be worthwhile 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.920
 yagdtigru you goals some place come down 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.450
 to end 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.850
 but sometimes in combat the situation does not allow 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.610
 you come to the end and therefore you 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.000
 will not fall so not 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.689
 contact the circle 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.450
 scatter better wait until you reduce 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.550
 armor at the tank as I said good 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.619
 pretty strong but still 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.300
 fly right here now how i do it i don't 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.400
 standing suddenly out of nowhere 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.640
 a third ferdinand appears say 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.310
 thank you gorgeous light mechanics i 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.489
 bump in general is not clear where 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.850
 some pillar to me ferdinand to harp 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.650
 Damage to three also does not break through 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.080
 begins to mow the gun and quite 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.130
 strongly 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.080
 you can't say that to me strongly 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.840
 I was pleased not Ferdinand me as always 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.220
 did not break that is from guns even very much and 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.100
 very good 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.110
 get no punishment ricochet madsa 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.769
 again the projectile flies somewhere in the joint 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.260
 armor plates 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.440
 but already in such a situation when you 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.950
 aim wes no chance to get out 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.500
 and so he is pretty fast 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.780
 ends in this fight I'm nothing more 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.140
 supernatural certainly did not 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.269
 All the old fashioned a little train and 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.700
 because especially shoot more and not 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.250
 I thought I had a pretty good time 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.010
 the fight is indicative that we are not 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.660
 punch in the forehead but the boards and all 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.900
 the rest of the parts quietly makes its way 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.640
 and not bad but very oblique weapon 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.480
 Row with you and look at 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.480
 battle results
