00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.119
 record then we will start with the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.700

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.869
 dose it's not mandatory our 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.270
 force that I wanted to have was the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.800
 little flake in the center here so that can 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.439
 to be anything he threatens Parisian 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.170
 a decoration you will see that because 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.390
 that I really like the ball here then 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.020
 what am I going to do I'm going to come 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.580
 perforated the ball your water near the bar 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.900
 because after I'm going to go do a 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.940
 beautiful circle game about it and there I 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.800
 will take the hole punch 5 enemies 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.250
 you could take a few times 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:01:00.600
 worry we feel them ready and we get 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.949
 this form here frozen in my paper 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.920
 men who is style to spare 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.630
 and I will come and have my gold 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.549
 in perdition dimension I could 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.890
 leave that way I could take 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.020
 the other side i'll take this one 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.450
 view of the photo you will have the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.140
 two different so I just put 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.610
 of the ten mention I think it's important 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.870
 and you could do this activity there 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.210
 with your children 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.479
 kind an evening did all our 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.070

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.229
 so I come package over it 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.290
 the window come back to the hours expectations 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.049
 golden ok then I go first free 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.710
 murder but study with the piggy 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.470
 embossing you could take all so much 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.510
 that you're there there you could even 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.979
 box here would be nice but I 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.200
 did not want to put too much and I wanted 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.840
 still keep it simple because 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.799
 when we have gift tags 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.189
 currently does not just make it a 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.220
 time we made several why I 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.730
 not complete sinkhole it's con power 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:16.290
 gave me the opportunity to write to 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:19.150
 who I give this gift 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.920
 and then I wanted to keep a little trick 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:28.420
 in the center so what I did I 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.370
 took my perf would be three quarter of an inch 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.590
 and on taste to children they die 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.240
 on six visitors the montois you lose 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.980
 strong swell and it's you you perforate 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.240
 balls 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.790
 he would be very very happy it's just 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.440
 to go added a little detail to 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.540
 middle as a game it could be a 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.150
 Parisian tie is preparing something else 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.350
 who come in the middle because here me 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.530
 I decided to take 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:00.610
 I found my paper 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.380
 ok then I take a snowflake here and I 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.400
 come by creating this armed risk in 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:14.350
 taking care of deck created around I 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:16.170
 live on my party i'm going to look for and 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.680
 it's almost done 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:31.180
 what I have to do simply 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:33.790
 it's going to go punched and go to them 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.300
 shake my daughter the one that I can not find 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.590
 in we ellip6 so I took my fief 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:45.450
 it's removed in two I'm going 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.450
 insert it in the small hole 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.040
 and then I spend both ends in the 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.220
 loppsi simply play for 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.980
 hang on to a gift the other version 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.650
 I'm talking about that and I want to get that back 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.930
 here because it's very pretty 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:10.330
 so I'm going to go perforated in a 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:13.330
 revival of design paper I will come 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.310
 just stick we pay attention 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:21.010
 not put everywhere are seen that it 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:24.880
 go beyond me like I did here we go out 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.770
 cursed mention it is still very 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.340
 rigid carton there I do not need to 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.040
 put more sizing and there this 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:38.770
 that I can do that would be to go 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.540
 look for this risk because not yet one 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.660
 use non-retail use the 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.310
 hole puncher at home i'm going 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:52.810
 go do a little more detail at 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:58.240
 center of my ornaments so we come 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:06.820
 do the same thing sometimes can you 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:07.990
 have small flakes use them the 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.000
 are due I took a lot of 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.760
 perforator yes when I saved from 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.900
 time that's what I do and especially 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.090
 when I want to work at the chain 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.850
 as I go now if I want 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.350
 do all my studies for example 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.500
 chosen all the time the hole punch or 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.430
 stuff to bitch up for that 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.470
 go faster 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:31.890
 web - very much like it takes already 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.890
 form 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:41.690
 I could add some steps 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.310
 aware that there is never an end but there 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.650
 we will be productive because we have 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.820
 many to make spring a beautiful 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.540
 evening to do with friends so here 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.340
 what it gives 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:57.230
 and that's with the port motif so we 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.470
 share nothing we recover everything we have 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.330
 because we use both the positive 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.610
 and the negative when we see perforated 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.110
 so I wish you good clothes 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.110
 ti Christmas cats good day 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.600
 no
