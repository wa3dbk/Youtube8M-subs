00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
aggressive behavior and sometimes

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.990 
aggressive behavior and sometimes
regress

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
regress

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.210 
regress
it<00:02:05.090> isn't<00:02:05.390> full<00:02:05.660> blown<00:02:06.020> it's<00:02:06.680> not<00:02:06.800> really<00:02:06.920> bad

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
it isn't full blown it's not really bad

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.120 
it isn't full blown it's not really bad
suppression<00:02:08.060> can<00:02:08.390> be<00:02:08.479> enough<00:02:08.780> but<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:10.039> have

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
suppression can be enough but you have

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.830 
suppression can be enough but you have
to<00:02:10.250> understand<00:02:10.610> is<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:10.789> when<00:02:11.030> aggression<00:02:11.750> is

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
to understand is that when aggression is

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.080 
to understand is that when aggression is
suppressed<00:02:12.290> it's<00:02:12.590> still<00:02:12.950> there<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.550> there's

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
suppressed it's still there and there's

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.610 
suppressed it's still there and there's
a<00:02:14.180> good<00:02:14.300> chance<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.750> will<00:02:14.870> come<00:02:15.080> out<00:02:15.110> again

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
a good chance that will come out again

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.800 
a good chance that will come out again
so<00:02:16.280> as<00:02:16.460> I<00:02:16.580> said<00:02:16.640> aggression<00:02:17.240> is<00:02:17.330> very<00:02:17.540> tricky

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
so as I said aggression is very tricky

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.690 
so as I said aggression is very tricky
