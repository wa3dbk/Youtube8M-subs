00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.790
 hello today I present you and 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.590
 the meta watch human price that this 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.650
 beautiful connected watch so is 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.790
 compatible with ios and android so this 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.360
 that you have to know first of all is that she 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.890
 has a screen of reading lights inc and suddenly the 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.199
 made of filming and very complicated but 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.460
 the advantage is double even outside 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.010
 in full sun we see very very well 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.600
 a screen and suddenly in autonomy 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.250
 hold more than five days so that's 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.080
 really a big advantage but a 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.250
 disadvantage for filming so in 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.960
 terms of features towards the 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.210
 alerts e mails sms alerts 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.579
 we will see the facebook alerts and 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.450
 twitter and we will especially be able to 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.520
 customize the display of all these 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.370
 screens so there for example it's me who 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.600
 I decided on the left to put the 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.460
 stock prices 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.329
 on the right is below the weather at 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.309
 laval we see that it is rather ugly 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.160
 then we have it here so for fans of 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.649
 nba here are the results of the tickets 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.469
 for the last matches still a 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.489
 few scholarships the state of the battery 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.089
 so we can really customize everything 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.199
 so suddenly via the application up so 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.700
 it's really me who choose 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.189
 completely what I want to put in 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.179
 my watch and who will manage the 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.889
 notifications 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:13.479
 so here I will really be able to choose 

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:15.639
 to put incoming calls the 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.399
 sms / mms the calendar alerts the 

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:19.929
 tunes gmail facebook and twitter so a 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.719
 true watch then the advantage is 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:25.659
 that she finally has faux leather strap and 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:27.609
 a metal entourage that really makes it 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.789
 very very classy so with a suit 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:33.099
 she is really beautiful to wear 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.709
 she is very nice that she is pretty 

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:37.240
 light and suddenly it's really a 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.289
 shows that we can advise you if 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.450
 you're used to putting 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.280

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.810
 it will be perfect if you are a little 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.619
 the habit of wearing clothes a 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.719
 little more streetwear 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.950
 you have the strata that is the hand 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.229

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.850
 metal version and a little more jones there 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.360
