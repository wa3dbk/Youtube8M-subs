00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.649
 what came born we begin 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:44.690
 and we'll start with perhaps Nico murazor 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.760
 mean critical thinking but for 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.100
 simplicity of perception danil burzum himself about 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.379
 vich namely this person is hiding under 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:59.090
 ruin anybody offers to call him 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:01:00.860
 find quarrels here i will be back on and i'm already 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.500
 for a long time for murazor he entrenched 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.600
 the status of the main whiner of the world of tanks 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.940
 he constantly that does not like something 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.270
 not satisfied and all his claims he 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.040
 will give light to famous monologues 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.840
 hits mostly gaming like 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.040
 specific man business and all 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.840
 corporations as a whole can be praised by everyone 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:26.330
 constructively to developers because 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.780
 bring down they will stop doing good 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.300
 interesting for us forgets Murazor and 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.970
 mere mortals of all 40 percentage 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.300
 players he drove and collective image and 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.840
 affectionately calls nuts 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.030
 diagnosed with autism 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.920
 and in some cases specifically says 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.880
 where do they all need to go 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.100
 because unfortunately most people 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.619
 nomad didn't often use reviews though 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.899
 of course there is a characteristic feature 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.479
 review morazor but sorry for 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.520
 tautology is a deep analysis 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.590
 whatever event be 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.510
 new patch label new tanks or 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.880
 specific machine 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.240
 crazy channel on the channel no pop videos 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.910
 muvikov funny bugs and so on here 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.440
 just a little joke from me they are every minute 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.640
 but 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.860
 channel can be characterized as 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.260
 intellectual well and his audience 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.780
 looking elite but that too on 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.120
 Amateur watch 20 minutes on bearded 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.320
 head against the background of the carpet and listen to boring 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.370
 parameter summary 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.630
 it must be loved by the way about beard beard 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.540
 like the carpet behind 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.220
 is the hallmark of the morazor 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.970
 his beard loves to be proud of it 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.500
 even released one guide for her care 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.580
 actually this video we will have about 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.830
 a few things as i promised both for the sake of 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.870
 first thing in let's say beard you decide 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.270
 I'll try to run you now 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.760
 explain in what cases do not do this 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.010
 it is necessary and what it is necessary to wait 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.110
 let's say so that the beard is already growing and 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.780
 grew normal and now about the problems 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.270
 anal sex 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.060
 nothing like 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.880
 it seemed rumored that morazor not 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.940
 just saw the surveyor count bluebeard 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.040
 and the more in the hospital deer order 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.460
 stronger grow choice yes therefore 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.810
 Murazor is so angry at Alekseyevka Timothy 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.720
 Well, now a little history of creation 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.750
 channel first video on the channel came out in 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.520
 the middle of the summer of 2012 it was a movie 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.130
 was warmly received 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.050
 he was ambiguous many liked 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.440
 well, as always sounded in opte cho for 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.450
 bullshit and so on their godfathers murazor 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.360
 thinks joey and of course flash 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.300
 it was jow who most helped with advice and 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.970
 PR was crossed sled likely 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.090
 in the clan deer he knocked out John for a long time and 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.980
 Murazor was until recently necessary 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.040
 notice that this is the second channel of the morazor and 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.640
 The first video is brought on August 28 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.470
 2012 that some of you are very 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.320
 much liked a lot scored to 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.350
 hare plyusom that damn lump 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.210
 Murazor 666 was called 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.980
 So the dynamics of the channel was 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.170
 not bad after nine months was 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.750
 100,000 followers in a year and a half 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.760
 almost 300 thousand one hundred thousand this is the first 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.370
 big really big let's say so 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.580
 numbers on my path to development 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.640
 the channel plays moore nitrogen mostly solo 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.050
 shows off his battles streams one more 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.840
 moment responding ruin and 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.430
 that's gonna be god to german tanks 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.040
 most videos are dedicated to this 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.530
 cars but what 's not to like 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.150
 visual bearded head 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.460
 hard to find in a pile of malicious comments 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.139
 really objective judgments 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.690
 we can see like lovers 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.240
 rampant fun on the channel especially 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.550
 do not hurt him and constantly crying 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.550
 at nights that they often merge there without 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.960
 damage something else 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.300
 i like the patriot not the fist 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.190
 mura aka real with the one where you can 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.630
 include perhaps a little too high 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.810
 sense of grandeur 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.849
 how hard to live and only 4200 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.000
 average damage 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:11.250
 legs positive we assign flawlessly already 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.160
 mentioned intellectuality video 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.169
 you know that I always try to you 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.490
 show in battles on some items 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.039
 tactics 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.380
 here is what I apply specifically 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:28.570
 all sorts of simple game chips bunk us 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.190
 million there is no sense clip figs a bunch 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.590
 same content 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.880
 everyday 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:39.060
 the video is kind of dull but nothing at all 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.470
 tive will not introduce yourself 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.060
 monologues murazor speaks without cheat sheets 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.490
 it is clear that the person knows what it is about 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.240
 maybe so some videos a little and 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.180
 tightened 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.190
 I can certainly make a very long time to see 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.800
 long and need to tell how it all 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.180
 it was on the Internet even appeared the concept 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.699
 Moore will light 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:02.960
 Well, the highlight of his channel in immense 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:05.990
 sarcasm to my favorite tank once 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.820
 not just my beloved was weaving 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.430
 I was 50 and I thought that the other 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:14.539
 cars are not just not needed but not so 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:18.169
 long time have some favorite guys 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:21.520
 pens that need a tank 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:24.979
 put the historic engine on 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:28.570
 paper mother and here it is paper which 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:32.169
 existed by the very paper put 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:36.590
 historic engine elah-burns 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:39.530
 brilliant idea but such humor can be 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.990
 be able to understand so let's summarize 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.660
 now almost two years bearded head 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.970
 tightly occupied its niche in front of the carpet and 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.919
 thousands of lovers of poisonous humor with 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:53.389
 looking forward to when she will again 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:54.800
 at least everything and everything is probably all I 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:57.530
 tried as objectively as possible 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.620
 tell about our hero but it turned out 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:03.260
 would that be 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.260
 I have to judge you. But for now. 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.800
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.160
