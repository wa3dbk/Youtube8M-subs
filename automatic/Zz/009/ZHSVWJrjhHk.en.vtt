00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 After all, still everyone with you is no kir and Natasha 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.750
 Hello and today's release, we 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.210
 tell you about the standard modes 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.250
 today we really tell 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.210
 you about standard game modes and 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.490
 we begin with the arena the arena is one of 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.789
 the very first modes created in team 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.630
 fortress main task arenas 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.210
 kill all your opponents and if in 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.189
 for a minute you will not kill all your 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.720
 opponents will be available to capture 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.410
 here is this central point she is alone here 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.450
 the only 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.610
 and you can see that now she 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.469
 are highlighted in gray and there is a lock on it 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.399
 is located that is you cannot while i 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.960
 grab and now you hear the report 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.879
 This means that a minute has passed and no one 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.010
 killed my last opponent i 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.980
 now I am at the point and I'm trying 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.510
 grab if i grab i win a 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.940
 if my opponent gets to the point 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.120
 it's locked for grabbing i gotta 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.449
 either kill him or try to somehow 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.449
 to push 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:15.240
 here you can see me tyrannizing 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.130
 won in this arena like this principle 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.270
 shortly about the first mode we go further 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.369
 Now we will tell you about the capture mode 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.250
 intelligence all maps of this mode 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.000
 start with a network prefix from 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.659
 english ketchup flag all maps of this 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.720
 modes are symmetrical i.e. base is red 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.479
 them and the specularity is symmetric in the basis 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.189
 their intelligence is usually 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.759
 in secluded places that it was not to 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.430
 so easy to get close you'll need 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:52.350
 run into their intelligence 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.810
 opponents and capture them that is 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.600
 the suitcase will be on your back 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.329
 being the only problem is 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.860
 that players like a charge cannot 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.290
 carry intelligence 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.110
 and spies disguised too can not 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.300
 carry intelligence-data now you'll see 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.910
 how do i capture intelligence teams 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.090
 red ones 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.430
 now i have to deliver these 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.430
 intelligence to the base of their team and 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.970
 advantages 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.980
 scout in this mode just him 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.260
 speed here likes to play very often 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.090
 scouts as soon as possible 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.710
 capture data mode generally home 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.520
 feature of the regime is that you need 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.770
 recruit as much as possible 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.090
 more times capture intelligence for 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.500
 wins if fails after 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.630
 certain times which 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.430
 installed on server 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.130
 grab with advantage any 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.830
 explored then the sudden mode is turned on 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.540
 deaths usually meaning you can 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.400
 use only melee weapons 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.090
 and you will have to kill all your 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.980
 opponents I captured explored and me 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.950
 given a bonus in the form of critical damage 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.530
 which almost kills a player right away 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.320
 that's basically all and now we will tell 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.190
 about capture points standard capture 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.709
 control points 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.020
 all cards begin with the prefix seppi 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.820
 cards of this mode are symmetric both 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.050
 teams start with the same 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.600
 number of control points 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.000
 central . does not belong to anyone and 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.459
 she is a gray wins that team 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.290
 which will capture all the points if for 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.600
 time allotted by the server none of 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.310
 teams will not be able to capture all the points to 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.840
 match goes into instant mode 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.190
 death that is available only weapons 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.430
 melee and nobody can 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.020
 revive checkpoint 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.880
 located closer to the base are captured 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:04:00.390
 faster and also the same points can be 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:01.680
 grab back here basically everything 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.260
 what we wanted to tell you about 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.060
 standard grip 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.760
 continue the story next standard 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.920
 mode capture and hold points of the map 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.280
 this mode also begins with the prefix 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.959
 yourself cards asymmetric and red 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.520
 teams start the round have all the points 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.709
 under your control you can see it 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.320
 they are all red below the blue team 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.630
 wins if it captures all the points and 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.630
 reds red team wins if 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.060
 they do not give their points to capture 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.640
 allotted time and points captured 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:37.050
 blue players can not be uniquely 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.729
 captured back red you can 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.010
 see that this point is now uniquely 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.950
 my and the red circle cannot capture it 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.910
 back that's basically all we wanted 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.650
 tell capture and hold points 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.169
 now guys we will tell you about the mode 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.419
 king of the hill is called king in English 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.840
 of the hill therefore all the cards of this 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.979
 mode can be recognized by prefix code 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.310
 king burn mode which is necessary 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.600
 grab and hold one point 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.820
 center point as soon as she 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.590
 captured about captured teams 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.680
 the countdown begins 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.860
 report last 3 minutes if the enemy 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.479
 team capture the point that she had 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.000
 the countdown begins 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.039
 that team will win which reset its 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.729
 the counter is basically everything you can 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.990
 talk about kim air mode 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.250
 the next mode about which we would you 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.110
 wanted to tell this race 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.510
 accompanied this is a mode with two 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.600
 trolleys every team required 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.500
 escort your trolley to the finish 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.470
 initially they move towards each other 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.630
 to a friend and after going half way 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.280
 in vaganetke and pass on the other side 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.030
 moving in the opposite direction then 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.940
 have diverge 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.100
 wins the team which is 1 in the round 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.900
 will take his cart to the finish line 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.539
 maximum trolley speed 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:55.680
 achieved when accompanied by and three 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:57.360
 players if within 30 seconds neither 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.710
 one of the players does not touch the trolley 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.450
 she will start moving back 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.750
 the trolley treats the players and 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.580
 replenish stocks of cartridges if someone from 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.229
 players of the opposing team will rise 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.229
 to the cart then she will stop 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.960
 there is also an escort mode in 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.790
 which has only one trolley and 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.370
 the blue team has to push it up 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.300
 bases red red only defend 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.250
 on such cards 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.070
 that's basically all we wanted for you 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.050
 tell the escort mode of this 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.940
 In principle, all the guys here we told 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.230
 you about all the standards and regimes that 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.780
 there is team fortress 2 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.970
 they are presented than you all saw 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.080
 his own eyes in the whole 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.080
 Natalia told
