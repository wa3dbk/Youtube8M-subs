00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.650
 Wants to live there came to a new 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.429
 mystery of video today we go again 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.379
 shop for a bit and myrad points 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.059
 or my riding club go a bit 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.270
 that's why we'll just get there 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.730
 charge fast and yo are there now 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.760
 a few new skins out there and me 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.250
 I still wanted a few so still 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.440
 pick some new ones because I have some 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.559
 So now, quite often, some seem to be 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.829
 new camps is relatively often and games 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.350
 bio I thought if I then 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.329
 already buy what I take that 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.780
 Just go on like this 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.809
 just once degree for some money again 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.159
 the riot points on and then we can 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.190
 sometimes I take that too 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:53.530
 Sometimes I do not like the red flag 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.530
 but now such thought namely 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.739
 just 20 actually found very cool 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.589
 if we just 420 pence so 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:07.000
 to get that is I think is super cool 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:09.189
 so would 1 4565 riot points and the 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.009
 Of course, first child is me directly 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.960
 times like the blood moon is right because he 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.329
 It's just super cool I got back then 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.680
 the championships about the mystery 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.360
 skin got me just mega 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.380
 happy and then it just has it 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.990
 to buy 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.780
 because I mega adapted well and now 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.880
 the blood moon quickly because we just cool 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.149
 looks 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.009
 so it to me the first the we 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.189
 i'm pretty good, i'm pretty often 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.840
 and makes mega buck in any case 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.220
 junior champion berlin not played 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.860
 should definitely be able to see him 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.329
 then try in the blood moon symbol 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.829
 I got myself even earlier 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.720
 a bit that was not included 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.079
 but you have that cool that we do that 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.549
 directly brought 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.439
 In general, I use symbols so first 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.340
 after a while when I'm like this 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.810
 are mainstream 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.579
 you can already see me here 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.959
 friends it is already a few 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:06.319
 had this well in it 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:08.399
 Not many, but none in it 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:13.560
 that's what I wanted to see 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:16.290
 right now out this would have been like 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.200
 homer one okay it's still something 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.000
 then of course I'll take that back then 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.530
 but what times in the newspaper as to 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.380
 let but I think it will be 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.120
 something so david a bit 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.900
 So who can bring more people with you? 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.620
 use the time 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.079
 I go make out then which skin 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.709
 want and wanted to pick us up yet 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.790
 in any case, jesus the vault 101 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.829
 It costs 7000 and I have it back then 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.389
 So brought a new edition of 900 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.769
 something and then I have the advice 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.950
 simply being taken away is no more 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.139
 with kaka anyway I do not know 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.560
 why I suppose I'm assuming 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:54.840
 that I ever had this frentrop 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.829
 mega exploited and on ebay me 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.870
 then somehow got me out then 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.310
 apparently or widely assumed 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.620
 is that we stopped with the monsters 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.500
 somehow this guy got it 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.580
 too bad 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:13.770
 Well you can not do anything like us 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.330
 Go through the sg list here 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.680
 I just wanted a ramos 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:29.500
 a pick I must just look degree of 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:30.970
 bottom up through the upper command 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:40.720
 I also wanted katharina eventual 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:43.050
 I do not play very interesting games 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.050
 so often 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:51.610
 I have actually the whole skins 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.959
 animal wanted full metal ramos exactly the 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:58.380
 I wanted to get me wanted mega 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.380
 we could cool ourselves though 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.710
 I'm just wondering if I'm mine 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.510
 In fact, I would have to trust the investors 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.140
 buy rudi rudi 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.870
 but you're a nonsense 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.610
 ok for metal ramos in any case of it 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.280
 namely mega kracher skin and me 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:25.820
 want because you have to stop relative including 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:28.020
 more often than normal so then I try 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.820
 not into kindle i 'm fine 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.510
 that I now believe in lightning 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.400
 I currently have no skin at all 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.870
 because the other one also brought me away 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:44.670
 been torn out of his hands 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:47.430
 However, I find the river sick 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:51.780
 not even the coolest but the 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:54.890
 residential complex springs there I will 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.690
 then probably get de niro 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:03.500
 I think this is so mainstream 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:05.610
 so completely crank megacool ok 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.940
 otherwise I'll just go mine 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.940
 champion available 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.480
 I've kid's children for everything 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.400
 I do not have one in the form 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.230
 insurance for sofia for darius leads 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.720
 raven I do not have the one I have 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:31.260
 not really because it will 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:34.440
 I do not like that but I do 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.380
 think of just the skin actually 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.249
 cooler than that, that's why I leave 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:45.829
 the finished I have a skin for 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:47.569
 i do not play katharina that 

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:49.399
 katzchen's katharina became mine as well 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.169
 taken away that has me too mega 

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:54.619
 Annoyed because the kid was so cool and 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:58.159
 something special child was to have held 

00:05:54.619 --> 00:06:03.079
 which is therefore cool but a pity 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:07.839
 just a pity but I'll pick me 

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:10.969

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:13.129
 times katar skins this is currently available 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:15.129
