00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.150
 look shampoo 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.790
 let's start the pomeranian bath what 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.740
 first we are going to wet very well all the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.600
 hair and the psuv hair the pomeranian will be 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.320
 a double layer race you have to wet 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.120
 well all in depth you have to have 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.190
 special care that he did not give them 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.350
 in the ears we can help with the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.579
 thumb to close the little ear and not 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.589
 between no water 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.789
 we help with the hands to penetrate 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.190
 well the water 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.470
 the more drenched the hair is, the better 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.710
 the saint sinks 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.760
 we already have everything wet the head 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.760
 the cheeks 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.890
 philosophical 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.020
 we give in my eyes to clean it 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.719
 of deception 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.290
 reveal we say start now 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.420
 we will proceed to the soap opened 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.340
 when we soap we will always 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.020
 the root to the tips we do not do it in 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.020
 circles to not deliver the hair 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.060
 equal the skirts 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.880
 the legs 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.990
 the tail just like this we get 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.540
 that the product penetrates the same in the root 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.250
 of the tips and we get a wash in 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.250
 depth of our trade 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.600
 We're going under the eye where it's done 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.119
 the spot for the lacrimal will do with 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.689
 carefully and later we will clarify it 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.689
 very 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.890
 now we will go with the clarified is very 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.900
 important to make a correct clarification 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.090
 so that there is no residue left in 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.950
 the skin 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.190
 so little by little I'm already clarifying 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.340
 the soap from the eye area 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.340
 ah 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.090
 you see that bibi is very very relaxed 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.080
 at the beginning when they are puppies jump 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.300
 they move but it is normal I advise 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.860
 always bathe our frequency but 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.930
 more in the puppy stage to 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.820
 help them make the move 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.130
 a good behavior that will be 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.490
 essential for them to behave well in 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.490
 the bathtub 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.400
 And now we already had the second or 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.829
 nothing in the second hub or nothing is there 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.400
 breathe I know very well that it looks good 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.459
 cleared up 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.459
 ah 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.660
 finally we go with the conditioner 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.260
 in this case to wine and we will apply 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.410
 a mask we will use oil 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.500
 ozonized olive we will use a little bit 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.380
 of collagen and we will use oil from 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.270
 avocado 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.370
 they begin with we have a great variety 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.620
 of products depending on each type of 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.780
 hair we will use some products or others 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.100
 to make the mask ask us in 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.740
 your next session for our 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.930
 treatments 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.160
 we will take the product and I will 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.720
 we will extend so that we go 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.300
 massaging the root 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.530
 distributing by all the subject and of equal 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.530
 way who shampoo 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.950
 I'll leave three to five minutes for the 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.950
 products make all holes 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.080
 now we go with the rinse to remove 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.080
 the product 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.420
 For us it is very important 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.180
 hygiene that's why we use towels 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.190
 Disposable for each dog is very 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.810
 important to absorb all the water 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.600
 the more drinks we pray with the towel 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.340
 we will reduce the drying time 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.470
 dry with small massages and not 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.380
 ruffling the hair after each use 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.740
 we throw it now let's start with 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:35.680
 this heat is very important to brush 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.680
 the time we dry the dryer and start 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.950
 in sin let's start with the 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.950
 head 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.480
 We will open the hair layer by layer to 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.970
 contrapelo 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.800
 with your hand we are going to help you catch 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.000
 the hair and with the brush let's go 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.569
 taking out the layers 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.119
 ah 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.470
 so we can open the hair from the root to 

00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:01.020
 the plants 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.300
 we put the dryer in the area where 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.310
 let's brush this helps us to go 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.440
 opening the hair and while we go 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.680
 developing with the brush is very 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.120
 important to brush while drying 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.690
 just as it is very important to go 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.220
 doing it by layer we leave a layer 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.490
 to start another until it is not 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:24.300
 completely dry the first 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.490
 we place him lying on his side like that 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.759
 we can go head and ending 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.759
 neck 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.560
 I am a lack of half- side and so 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.509
 we can make the leg and the skirt 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.660
 lateral always a posture that in this 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:38.660
 car 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.639
 It is always very important to help yourself 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.710
 hand not to miss 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.110
 to brush the back and the bum 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.800
 we're still separating by layer towards 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.800
 up with paper 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.420
 now let's use the legs 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.030
 back and the skirt 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.190
 we hold and we are opening the roots 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.230
 inks we've got that hair 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.920
 aesthetically degenerated from the root to 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.080
 the tips 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.080
 this is the effect we want to consume 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.130
 already with the incorporated dog we went to 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.680
 finish the skirts that we will make 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.720
 favor the hair down and now it 's the 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.600
 turn of the legs we help each other with the 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.080
 load we comb them up and we go 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.390
 opening the hair always up 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.000

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:34.820

 totally open and unraveled 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.039
