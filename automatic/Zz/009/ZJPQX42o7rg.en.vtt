the<00:00:04.710> musculoskeletal<00:00:05.279> system<00:00:05.990> consists<00:00:06.990> of

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
the musculoskeletal system consists of

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.850 
the musculoskeletal system consists of
bones<00:00:07.379> muscles<00:00:08.280> ligaments<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.179> tendons

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
bones muscles ligaments and tendons

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.930 
bones muscles ligaments and tendons
together<00:00:10.860> they<00:00:11.099> support<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.730> body

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
together they support the body

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.299 
together they support the body
protecting<00:00:12.690> internal<00:00:13.230> organs<00:00:13.620> allowing

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
protecting internal organs allowing

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.240 
protecting internal organs allowing

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
cause can be a direct force for example

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.590 
cause can be a direct force for example
a<00:00:30.420> heavy<00:00:30.660> object<00:00:30.750> falling<00:00:31.470> onto<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.859> foot<00:00:32.189> or

a heavy object falling onto the foot or

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.540 
a heavy object falling onto the foot or

outstretched arm which may cause a
fractured<00:00:37.980> collarbone<00:00:39.020> there<00:00:40.020> are<00:00:40.140> three

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
fractured collarbone there are three

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.490 
fractured collarbone there are three
types<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:41.040> fractures<00:00:41.629> closed<00:00:42.629> where<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> skin

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
types of fractures closed where the skin

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.400 
types of fractures closed where the skin
remains<00:00:43.890> intact<00:00:44.660> open<00:00:45.660> where<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> bone

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
remains intact open where a bone

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.160 
remains intact open where a bone
penetrates<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.340> skin<00:00:47.670> or<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.969> wound<00:00:48.360> leads<00:00:48.899> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
penetrates the skin or a wound leads to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.340 
penetrates the skin or a wound leads to
the<00:00:49.260> fracture<00:00:49.649> below<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.899> complicated<00:00:51.899> where
