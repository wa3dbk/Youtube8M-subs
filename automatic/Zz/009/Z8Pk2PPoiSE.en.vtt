mobility with the stretchy cord 1 point
2<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.500> 3<00:02:25.800> meters<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:26.430> 1.2<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.120> it's<00:02:27.239> coiled<00:02:27.569> form

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
2 to 3 meters so 1.2 in it's coiled form

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.970 
2 to 3 meters so 1.2 in it's coiled form
and<00:02:28.260> 3<00:02:28.950> meters<00:02:29.340> when<00:02:29.610> it's<00:02:30.230> extended<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.860> then

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
and 3 meters when it's extended and then

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.979 
and 3 meters when it's extended and then
on<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:32.459> end<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:32.819> end<00:02:33.000> here<00:02:33.269> obviously<00:02:33.540> goes

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
on this end this end here obviously goes

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.259 
on this end this end here obviously goes
into<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.380> headphones<00:02:34.769> this<00:02:34.950> end<00:02:35.160> here<00:02:35.519> go

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
into the headphones this end here go

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.630 
into the headphones this end here go
into<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.930> larger<00:02:37.410> jack<00:02:37.680> or<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.040> does<00:02:38.280> actually

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
into a larger jack or it does actually

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.910 
into a larger jack or it does actually
have<00:02:39.269> i<00:02:39.510> think<00:02:39.690> it's<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.590> screw-on

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
have i think it's a it's a screw-on

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.670 
have i think it's a it's a screw-on
converter<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.239> comes<00:02:42.390> down<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> 3.5

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
converter so it comes down to a 3.5

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.670 
converter so it comes down to a 3.5
millimeter<00:02:43.709> jack<00:02:44.310> as<00:02:45.180> well<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:46.260> that's<00:02:46.440> cool

your<00:04:05.670> review<00:04:06.090> of<00:04:06.150> these<00:04:06.269> later<00:04:06.569> on<00:04:06.870> on<00:04:07.079> the

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
your review of these later on on the

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.159 
your review of these later on on the
bottom<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.160> this<00:04:08.190> cup<00:04:08.670> here<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.750> is<00:04:09.930> where

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
bottom of this cup here that is where

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.280 
bottom of this cup here that is where
the<00:04:10.440> three-and-a-half<00:04:11.280> millimeter<00:04:12.290> cable

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
the three-and-a-half millimeter cable

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.450 
the three-and-a-half millimeter cable
plugs<00:04:13.560> in<00:04:13.739> so<00:04:13.979> the<00:04:14.100> jack

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
plugs in so the jack

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.640 
plugs in so the jack
in<00:04:14.730> there<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.150> they<00:04:15.660> do<00:04:15.720> fold<00:04:16.110> down<00:04:16.170> as<00:04:16.500> well

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
in there and they do fold down as well

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.150 
in there and they do fold down as well
so<00:04:16.860> you<00:04:16.920> can<00:04:16.980> swivel<00:04:17.340> these<00:04:18.090> in<00:04:18.420> and<00:04:19.010> fold<00:04:20.010> them

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
so you can swivel these in and fold them

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.130 
so you can swivel these in and fold them
down<00:04:20.220> not<00:04:20.880> sure<00:04:20.910> even<00:04:21.270> how<00:04:21.480> they<00:04:21.510> fold<00:04:21.930> at<00:04:22.080> the

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
down not sure even how they fold at the

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.640 
down not sure even how they fold at the
moment<00:04:22.500> it<00:04:23.280> was<00:04:23.400> something<00:04:23.910> like<00:04:24.270> oh<00:04:24.690> there<00:04:25.560> we

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
moment it was something like oh there we

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.830 
moment it was something like oh there we
go<00:04:25.680> so<00:04:26.070> that's<00:04:26.220> folded<00:04:26.430> down<00:04:26.790> and<00:04:27.540> then<00:04:27.690> this

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
go so that's folded down and then this

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.280 
go so that's folded down and then this
one<00:04:28.430> does<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:30.120> same<00:04:30.390> so<00:04:30.690> they<00:04:30.810> do<00:04:30.870> fold<00:04:31.230> down

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
one does the same so they do fold down

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.170 
one does the same so they do fold down
so<00:04:31.590> there<00:04:31.800> we<00:04:31.860> go<00:04:31.890> that<00:04:32.130> one<00:04:32.280> folds<00:04:32.610> in<00:04:32.700> like<00:04:32.880> so

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
so there we go that one folds in like so

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.510 
so there we go that one folds in like so
and<00:04:33.450> then<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:34.260> one<00:04:34.410> folds<00:04:34.800> down<00:04:34.860> so<00:04:35.280> they<00:04:35.370> can

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
and then that one folds down so they can

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.510 
and then that one folds down so they can
go<00:04:35.640> into<00:04:35.790> that<00:04:35.970> pouch<00:04:36.350> nice<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.950> compact

go into that pouch nice and a compact

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.820 
go into that pouch nice and a compact
