00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.740 
simply retracts very quick and easy up
out<00:01:39.950> of<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.130> way<00:01:40.250> for<00:01:40.790> when<00:01:40.939> it's<00:01:41.119> darker<00:01:41.630> out

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
out of the way for when it's darker out

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.300 
out of the way for when it's darker out
so<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:42.350> don't<00:01:42.500> have<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.680> change<00:01:42.950> out<00:01:43.130> the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
so you don't have to change out the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.350 
so you don't have to change out the
external<00:01:43.579> face<00:01:43.909> shield

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
external face shield

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.050 
external face shield
very<00:01:44.780> often<00:01:45.229> if<00:01:45.439> at<00:01:45.740> all<00:01:45.799> now<00:01:46.549> changing<00:01:46.969> out

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
very often if at all now changing out

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.670 
very often if at all now changing out
that<00:01:47.210> external<00:01:47.479> face<00:01:47.750> shield<00:01:47.990> does<00:01:48.350> require<00:01:48.560> a

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
that external face shield does require a

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.990 
that external face shield does require a
little<00:01:48.890> bit<00:01:49.009> more<00:01:49.189> work<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.490> see<00:01:49.670> there's<00:01:49.939> a

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
little bit more work you see there's a

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.969 
little bit more work you see there's a
slider<00:01:50.719> here<00:01:51.049> on<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.290> side<00:01:51.469> and<00:01:51.649> basically

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
slider here on the side and basically

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.709 
slider here on the side and basically
going<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.130> have<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.399> give<00:01:52.790> this<00:01:52.969> knob<00:01:53.210> a<00:01:53.240> twist

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
going to have to give this knob a twist

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.600 
going to have to give this knob a twist
quarter<00:01:54.350> turn<00:01:54.530> that's<00:01:54.740> going<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:54.979> pop<00:01:55.159> off<00:01:55.369> and

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
quarter turn that's going to pop off and

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.950 
quarter turn that's going to pop off and
then<00:01:55.939> you'll<00:01:56.060> be<00:01:56.090> able<00:01:56.210> to<00:01:56.390> change<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.750> shield

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
then you'll be able to change the shield

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.420 
then you'll be able to change the shield
out<00:01:57.110> but<00:01:57.290> again<00:01:57.619> with<00:01:57.740> that<00:01:57.860> internal<00:01:58.189> Sun

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
out but again with that internal Sun

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.340 
out but again with that internal Sun
Visor<00:01:58.610> you<00:01:59.240> won't<00:01:59.540> have<00:01:59.719> to<00:01:59.899> do<00:01:59.990> that<00:02:00.170> very

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
Visor you won't have to do that very

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.679 
Visor you won't have to do that very
often<00:02:00.649> now<00:02:01.430> like<00:02:01.579> I<00:02:01.700> said<00:02:01.759> it<00:02:02.030> is<00:02:02.149> a<00:02:02.180> modular

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
often now like I said it is a modular

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:03.940 
often now like I said it is a modular
helmet<00:02:03.049> that<00:02:03.229> means<00:02:03.439> that<00:02:03.619> you<00:02:03.680> have<00:02:03.710> the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
helmet that means that you have the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.219 
helmet that means that you have the
ability<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.640> open<00:02:05.119> up<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.450> front<00:02:05.689> of<00:02:05.899> the

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
ability to open up the front of the

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:06.730 
ability to open up the front of the
helmet<00:02:06.380> here

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
helmet here

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.559 
helmet here
see<00:02:06.920> there's<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.159> slider<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.790> just<00:02:08.330> pull<00:02:08.539> down

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
see there's a slider you just pull down

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.300 
see there's a slider you just pull down
on<00:02:08.750> that<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.259> that's<00:02:09.679> going<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:09.920> allow<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.190> to

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
on that and that's going to allow you to

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.000 
on that and that's going to allow you to
open<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:11.120> front<00:02:12.050> of<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.260> chin<00:02:12.440> bar<00:02:12.620> up<00:02:12.800> all

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
open the front of the chin bar up all

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.670 
open the front of the chin bar up all
the<00:02:13.280> way<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:14.420> does<00:02:14.569> have<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.750> nice<00:02:14.900> solid<00:02:15.110> detent

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
the way it does have a nice solid detent

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.290 
the way it does have a nice solid detent
up<00:02:15.860> at<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.130> top<00:02:16.340> in<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.610> uppermost<00:02:16.940> position

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
up at the top in the uppermost position

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.270 
up at the top in the uppermost position
and<00:02:17.780> this<00:02:18.230> is<00:02:18.290> really<00:02:18.650> convenient<00:02:19.010> especially

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280
