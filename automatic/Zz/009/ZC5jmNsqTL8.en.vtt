jump straight in i'm gonna start with
Gohan<00:00:21.900> because<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.310> reckon<00:00:23.910> Gohan's<00:00:24.269> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
Gohan because I I reckon Gohan's the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.650 
Gohan because I I reckon Gohan's the
weaker<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.930> two<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.740> be<00:00:25.830> perfectly<00:00:26.220> honest

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
weaker of the two to be perfectly honest

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.169 
weaker of the two to be perfectly honest
but<00:00:27.830> who<00:00:28.830> knows<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.220> mean<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.369> honestly<00:00:29.820> don't

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
but who knows I mean I honestly don't

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.770 
but who knows I mean I honestly don't
know<00:00:30.470> but<00:00:31.470> i<00:00:31.769> reckon<00:00:32.520> Gohan<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.090> his<00:00:33.329> default

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
know but i reckon Gohan and his default

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.479 
know but i reckon Gohan and his default
form<00:00:34.140> would<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:34.469> weaker<00:00:34.770> than<00:00:34.800> trucks<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.399> this

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
form would be weaker than trucks in this

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.420 
form would be weaker than trucks in this
default<00:00:35.850> form<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.360> guess<00:00:36.960> trunks<00:00:37.430> despatched

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
default form I guess trunks despatched
