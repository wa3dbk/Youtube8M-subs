00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
really know going into it being such a

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.519 
really know going into it being such a
youthful<00:00:15.030> squad<00:00:15.420> what<00:00:15.809> exactly<00:00:16.199> was<00:00:16.320> going<00:00:16.379> to

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
happen and you can never plan for

happen and you can never plan for
injuries<00:00:18.480> or<00:00:18.630> adversity<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.109> think<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.680> way

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
injuries or adversity I think the way

has been really great and think it's

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.650 
has been really great and think it's
really<00:00:23.340> proven<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:24.359> could<00:00:24.539> be

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
really proven that we could be

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.910 
really proven that we could be
potentially<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.350> best<00:00:25.470> team<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.890> league
