00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.190
 reading of 15 Old Testament paremia 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.849
 since the creation of the world 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.880
 look like the whole story 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:20.630

 creating the inevitability of mortal 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.620
 dominion and felt it 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.720
 unnaturalness 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.610

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.400
 transformations get their execution 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.410

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.840
 see the mysterious sacrifices and 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.690
 all these completely different biblical 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.670
 narratives separated from each other 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.420
 look today for centuries 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.850
 one common story of our salvation 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.180
 when we understand who is the true 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.700
 Isaac ready to sacrifice who is 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.030
 the giver of the resurrection is better than 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.570

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:49.180
 Whom it is received we do not use 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.730
 unclaimed gift can take away to 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.640
 accepted with grateful prayer 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.400
