00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.420
 Something last time I went last time 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:22.340
 May-June 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:26.810
 I think that maybe it was a make-up with the last finger probably taken in the school dormitory 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:32.689
 Pretty and Well why Every day makeup say or do not take too much 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.380
 How is the combination of this foundation and this foundation with different makeup every day ? 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.410
 Or 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.440
 How and what Kako of liquid combination of this powder is what 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.010
 Akatsuka every day various items are fine 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.219

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:57.329
 Something every day and Toka or looking for a combination 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:03.930
 It looks like I'm looking for makeup while searching for everything, but my makeup is quite different every day 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:09.390
 I do n't feel like I 'm going to take a lot of make- up 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.810
 Why it is say or took the make-up on this time I hope I'm moving 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.950
 That base makeup has changed a lot 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:21.450
 Before it is a liquid foundation and powder, it is absolutely a day surely foundation 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.920
 I mean I'd had process is what one skin and recent use liquid foundation 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:29.620

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:50.369
 Because it is a pull that comments say what color comments are used 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.550
 I wonder if it's just going to use Hasegawa 's future color conch 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.450

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.100

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.850

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:18.310
