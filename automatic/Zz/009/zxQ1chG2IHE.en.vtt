00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.850
 no religion and gets his new video of me what to kill 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:15.899
 by SMS Michèle all comment or during sex and the city project videos 

00:00:15.899 --> 00:00:16.769
 thank 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.669
 I am so happy that it is 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.410
 Project is so well received by you 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.750
 and this almost again with one leg next project and that's me 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.739
 in my study 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.119
 I'm just doing my study a bit too well let's say 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.269
 they all benefit 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.980
 By the way, from my workroom that no commitment to the award 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.760
 awarded by some above 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.550
 the gate but also ahead 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.640
 meanwhile I have a new desks big to work on 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.290
 can cut through good on a silo 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.430
 At some point I repainted the band around the students for drivers 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.170
 and 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.250
 but also a new printer 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.670
 but there are even at the beginning even extra video 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.350
 Competitions certainly want to know who has warned now 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.780
 four years the weather may have gotten I know he is just one 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.160
 Draw a card because that's a clear majority 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.390
 but that's not enough 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.000
 because there are still a few days on the way 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.950
 and we wait and around 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.980
 I think next week I hope to be able to tell you too 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.130
 and the winner is 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.130
 there is, for example, I have to say that first 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.090
 he was only allowed to 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.660
 He was only able to participate once 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.760
 and that's for example 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.430
 something for sure 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.430
 I'll look for it 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.580
 but this card 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.410
 and 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.200
 These and I think they are very strong 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.479
 to join Michael Ballack only once, that is, to have extended by a year 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.530
 meaningful and a better person 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.960
 a thunderstorm not thrown off the head at the expense of staying outside 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.140
 I am very excited about the super cool cards 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.280
 a commission set water cannons to the example 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.230
 Boehner 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.240
 around 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.990
 their hatred is anyway 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.539
 generally becomes free 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.069
 Copenhagen is really a lot of water to dig off 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.899
 got together here 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:17.879
 if Sarah 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.239
 These are the first ones 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.239
 that's always such a little naughty 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:26.359
 then it never comes 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.359
 which world have 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.909
 another counterfeiter with maps 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:39.629
 we still have a fan with Case »Brad Pitt have a dream 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.369
 and I will still make the profits this week 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:47.119
 at the end of the week hoping that the last cards will be there too 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:48.009
 arrive 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.680
 and set off immediately - and get done 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.069
 has in front 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.079
 and percent 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.349
 then I have 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.069
 Willow YouTube was the thing 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.679
 won something else that will be if you want to know Daniel 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:06.059
 Writer of comments and a quiet time too 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:07.269
 and 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.079
 the man i have new printer 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.739
 I was told only to spend as much money on smart cards they should have 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:13.749
 therefore of 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:18.369
 percentages of the sonorous and Freiburg have connection to the computer 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:22.419
 and I can even look great from one of them 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.840
 to print directly with it so pretty cool the whole thing is going to be around too 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:31.239
 giving an interview at Astana was going to be great in the future 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.189
 Who videos about how office furniture and technology for the office 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.930
 come 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.029
 because also the big break-in 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:41.520
 a living space the man in his home office or when I'm old 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.180
 As always, it is easy to set up nicely so that you can be at the same time 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.789
 Office feel so good 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:47.809
 Surely Pröll is already 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:51.669
 quite different from one used as the Val d'isere bit by bit lowered 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.909
 become as we do it exactly how and now and that and that and 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.329
 then again and again so it can be from 10 000 euros and then I stopped on the 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.049
 Until now, the design of the lamp has been planned, and with it, of course, we too 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.609
 come 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.079
 I would like to say again with the rumor percent to 9 in this rumor 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.789
 that the successor of Tine Wittler should become RTL 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:15.419
 I have to say that 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.189
 9 the thought no it's pretty funny 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:21.959
 this has to be yes I have two offers from different tv channels 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.689
 to get 

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:26.879
 and who wanted to work with me 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.879
 and percent 

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:32.580
 there will not be 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.139
 I will not be a successor to Tine Wittler 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.210
 around 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.550
 So that's really a rumor 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.729
 Japan somehow the readers will not remember a facebook page 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:47.119
 I was happy when we stop by my favorite us 

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:48.069
 Facebook no 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.550
 and of course I am also on Twitter that always has the line 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.900
 today's use of premises 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.900
 May be first published frequently 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:00.629
 Light is also everything I have about the others have found each other 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:05.079
 but now I'm in such a mess here in the study but practice 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.050
 by percent is going to be no sooner again 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.059
 which people see here 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:15.209
 and what do you say that there will be some videos about audio in the near future? 

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:18.430
 and gadgets for office and office furniture and 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.630
 Of course, he would have done so then let me have the summer weather 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.700
 As a commentary among these the lawyer for me is always contact with you 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.520
 very important so have to swap 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.520
 so I look like so what followed is currently in demand 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.969
 and what not 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:35.080
 Percent if you want you can make even more powerful answers 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.030
 Bird I am super happy about it too 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.330
 and "I was at the barber 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.949
 it looks like this is just a bit shorter 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:42.449
 the sovereign ones 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.569
 the side walls are again up my friends as well as each said 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.629
 has that so very good thing just a little bit shorter the whole 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.870
 that's what you say visit 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.379
 So I am satisfied 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:57.759
 and yes it was already title of this video 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:01.569
 Iran sees so we see so there is some news and the Active Sa 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.039
 have to turn on mystery and then this already I have prince this year 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:05.559
 happen
