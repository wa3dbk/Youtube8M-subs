00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:38.939 
you collect the iron out of the some of

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:40.549 
you collect the iron out of the some of
these<00:05:39.029> things<00:05:39.329> here<00:05:39.779> you<00:05:39.959> see<00:05:40.109> little<00:05:40.319> iron

these things here you see little iron
things<00:05:40.859> hence<00:05:41.099> laying<00:05:41.609> around<00:05:43.639> it's<00:05:44.639> hard<00:05:44.789> to

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
things hence laying around it's hard to

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:51.409 
things hence laying around it's hard to
tell<00:05:46.939> they<00:05:47.939> look<00:05:48.179> like<00:05:48.299> they're<00:05:48.479> sparkling<00:05:50.419> so
