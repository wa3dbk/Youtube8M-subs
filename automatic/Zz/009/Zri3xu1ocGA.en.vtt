some modes like like domination I

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.219 
some modes like like domination I
captured<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> flag<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> basically<00:01:27.900> the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
the monster will will actually see that

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.580 
the monster will will actually see that
the<00:02:27.030> warrior<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.480> doing<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.959> lot<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.170> damage<00:02:28.440> to

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
the warrior is doing a lot of damage to

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.100 
the warrior is doing a lot of damage to
it<00:02:28.830> he<00:02:29.130> will<00:02:29.250> also<00:02:29.430> try<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.850> focus<00:02:30.720> on<00:02:30.989> the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
it he will also try to focus on the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.560 
it he will also try to focus on the
priest<00:02:31.380> because<00:02:31.709> that's<00:02:31.950> obviously<00:02:32.570> much

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
priest because that's obviously much

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.670 
priest because that's obviously much
easier<00:02:33.930> target<00:02:34.320> for<00:02:34.470> him<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.900> as<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.350> can<00:02:37.470> see

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
easier target for him so as you can see

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.949 
easier target for him so as you can see
priest<00:02:38.489> can<00:02:38.640> also<00:02:38.790> do<00:02:39.060> some<00:02:39.269> damage<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:39.630> he

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
priest can also do some damage but he

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.840 
priest can also do some damage but he
also<00:02:40.200> needs<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.650> be<00:02:40.739> very<00:02:41.130> accurate<00:02:41.340> with<00:02:41.819> it

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
also needs to be very accurate with it

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.900 
also needs to be very accurate with it
and<00:02:42.120> yeah<00:02:42.780> shouldn't<00:02:43.560> get<00:02:43.739> too<00:02:44.069> close<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.819> the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
and yeah shouldn't get too close to the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.330 
and yeah shouldn't get too close to the
monster<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:46.080> course<00:02:46.230> every<00:02:46.800> spell<00:02:47.040> has<00:02:47.310> a

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
monster and of course every spell has a

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.520 
monster and of course every spell has a
range<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.239> you<00:02:48.299> can<00:02:48.660> do<00:02:48.930> damage<00:02:49.140> from<00:02:49.470> the

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
range so you can do damage from the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.560 
range so you can do damage from the
other<00:02:50.280> end<00:02:50.549> of<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.850> room<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.180> need<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.420> be

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
other end of the room you need to be

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.870 
other end of the room you need to be
quite<00:02:52.200> close<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.799> for<00:02:53.280> your<00:02:53.400> spouse<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.760> be

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
quite close to for your spouse to be

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.229 
quite close to for your spouse to be
effective<00:02:54.390> but<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.650> also<00:02:55.940> puts<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.120> in

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
effective but that also puts you in

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.000 
effective but that also puts you in
danger<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:57.930> need<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.350> adjust<00:02:58.620> your

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
danger so you need to adjust your

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.220

tactics<00:02:59.579> all<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.910> time<00:03:00.150> this<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.450> not<00:03:00.600> you

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
tactics all the time this is not you

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.050 
tactics all the time this is not you
cannot<00:03:01.500> predefine<00:03:01.980> tactics<00:03:02.489> in<00:03:02.640> terror<00:03:02.850> you

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
cannot predefine tactics in terror you

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.380 
cannot predefine tactics in terror you
need<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.390> adjust<00:03:03.709> adjust<00:03:04.709> your<00:03:05.100> actions<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:06.090> to

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
need to adjust adjust your actions to to

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.670 
need to adjust adjust your actions to to
what's<00:03:06.570> happening<00:03:06.720> on<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.170> screen<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.620> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
what's happening on the screen and the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.199 
what's happening on the screen and the
situation<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.489> you're<00:03:08.579> facing<00:03:08.850> at<00:03:09.150> the

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
situation that you're facing at the

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:25.080 
situation that you're facing at the
moment<00:03:11.720> okay<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.870> that's<00:03:13.049> all<00:03:13.230> for<00:03:13.530> me<00:03:13.650> so

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.759 

okay<00:03:25.780> we<00:03:25.900> won't<00:03:25.989> be<00:03:26.170> killing<00:03:26.349> this<00:03:26.560> boss

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
okay we won't be killing this boss

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.430 
okay we won't be killing this boss
because<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.580> would<00:03:27.760> be<00:03:27.879> to<00:03:28.090> take<00:03:28.269> like<00:03:28.810> 10

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
because it would be to take like 10

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.040 
because it would be to take like 10
minutes<00:03:29.650> or<00:03:29.980> more<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:31.030> think<00:03:31.269> that<00:03:31.510> that's

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
minutes or more so I think that that's

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.769 
minutes or more so I think that that's
not<00:03:32.379> right
