00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.509 
productive on Chester's um if you take
out<00:03:19.680> these<00:03:20.450> defenses<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:22.590> completely<00:03:23.010> negate

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
out these defenses you completely negate

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.259 
out these defenses you completely negate
anything<00:03:24.329> in<00:03:24.510> here<00:03:24.780> just<00:03:25.940> because<00:03:26.940> there's<00:03:27.150> no

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
anything in here just because there's no

anything in here just because there's no
path<00:03:27.510> anymore<00:03:28.940> so<00:03:29.940> if<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.389> take<00:03:31.049> out<00:03:31.260> this

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
path anymore so if you take out this

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.379 
path anymore so if you take out this
base<00:03:31.440> in<00:03:31.980> any<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.910> these<00:03:33.030> four<00:03:33.329> corners<00:03:34.220> no<00:03:35.389> you

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
base in any of these four corners no you

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.110 
base in any of these four corners no you
pretty<00:03:36.540> much<00:03:36.690> can<00:03:36.930> take<00:03:37.079> out<00:03:37.200> two<00:03:37.349> double<00:03:37.620> bond

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
pretty much can take out two double bond

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.210 
pretty much can take out two double bond

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.470 
very popular after our giant bomb ba
from<00:03:51.519> central<00:03:52.519> AC<00:03:52.819> rose<00:03:53.000> um<00:03:54.700> then<00:03:55.700> I<00:03:55.730> guess<00:03:56.060> it

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
from central AC rose um then I guess it

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.339 
from central AC rose um then I guess it
really<00:03:57.549> worked<00:03:58.549> back<00:03:58.760> then<00:03:58.790> now<00:03:59.720> surgical

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
really worked back then now surgical

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.210 
really worked back then now surgical
hogs<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:01.040> can<00:04:01.189> get<00:04:01.310> away<00:04:01.400> with<00:04:01.849> lesser<00:04:03.220> less

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.089 
hogs you can get away with lesser less
healing<00:04:04.609> so<00:04:05.560> you<00:04:06.560> can<00:04:06.709> bring<00:04:06.859> back<00:04:07.040> that

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
healing so you can bring back that

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:16.449 
healing so you can bring back that
lightning<00:04:13.510> like<00:04:14.510> I'll<00:04:14.659> saying<00:04:14.930> take<00:04:15.349> out<00:04:15.560> two

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
lightning like I'll saying take out two

lightning like I'll saying take out two
sides<00:04:16.699> of<00:04:16.880> double<00:04:17.150> giant<00:04:17.359> bombs<00:04:17.419> doesn't<00:04:18.410> even

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
sides of double giant bombs doesn't even

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.319 
sides of double giant bombs doesn't even
matter<00:04:18.590> if<00:04:18.859> you<00:04:19.010> pass<00:04:19.220> over<00:04:19.609> it<00:04:19.669> or<00:04:19.789> not<00:04:19.970> with

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
matter if you pass over it or not with

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.000 
matter if you pass over it or not with
your<00:04:20.539> kill<00:04:20.840> spoiled<00:04:21.260> and<00:04:21.380> you<00:04:21.440> go<00:04:21.590> on<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.859> that

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
your kill spoiled and you go on to that

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.310 
your kill spoiled and you go on to that
they<00:04:23.000> are<00:04:23.300> they're<00:04:23.930> not<00:04:24.050> going<00:04:24.139> to<00:04:24.199> be

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
they are they're not going to be

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:32.110 
they are they're not going to be
effective<00:04:24.710> anymore<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:30.610> this<00:04:31.610> one<00:04:31.880> doesn't

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
effective anymore and this one doesn't

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.060 
effective anymore and this one doesn't
have<00:04:32.270> double<00:04:32.630> giant<00:04:32.810> bombs<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.470> this<00:04:33.860> one

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
have double giant bombs and this one

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.870 
have double giant bombs and this one
can't<00:04:34.370> have<00:04:34.550> double<00:04:34.849> giant<00:04:35.030> bombs<00:04:35.120> either<00:04:36.880> so

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
can't have double giant bombs either so

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:53.050 
can't have double giant bombs either so
I<00:04:37.910> guess<00:04:38.599> we<00:04:38.780> go

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.760 

so<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.270> theory<00:04:54.510> behind<00:04:54.630> having<00:04:55.020> four<00:04:55.290> singles

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
so the theory behind having four singles

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.290 
so the theory behind having four singles
is<00:04:56.010> like<00:04:56.190> lead<00:04:56.460> bases<00:04:57.320> where<00:04:58.320> you<00:04:58.889> are<00:04:59.300> forced

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
is like lead bases where you are forced

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:08.240 
is like lead bases where you are forced
them<00:05:00.510> to<00:05:03.139> heal<00:05:04.139> four<00:05:04.560> times<00:05:06.470> but<00:05:07.470> if<00:05:07.919> you<00:05:08.100> only

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
them to heal four times but if you only

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.370 
them to heal four times but if you only
have<00:05:08.520> four<00:05:08.790> positions<00:05:09.300> for<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:09.720> double<00:05:09.990> full

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
have four positions for the double full

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.140 
have four positions for the double full
the<00:05:11.310> single<00:05:11.610> drop<00:05:11.790> bombs<00:05:12.350> then<00:05:13.370> you<00:05:14.370> all<00:05:15.000> you

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
the single drop bombs then you all you

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.659 
the single drop bombs then you all you
have<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.360> do<00:05:15.450> is<00:05:15.570> take<00:05:15.750> out<00:05:15.930> one<00:05:16.310> you<00:05:17.310> know<00:05:17.370> take

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
have to do is take out one you know take

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.879 
have to do is take out one you know take
three<00:05:17.910> heels<00:05:18.210> while<00:05:18.630> our<00:05:18.840> watch<00:05:19.500> yourself

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
three heels while our watch yourself

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.640 
three heels while our watch yourself
through<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:20.730> base<00:05:21.139> so<00:05:22.139> it's<00:05:22.350> kind<00:05:22.530> of<00:05:22.560> a

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
through the base so it's kind of a

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.550 
through the base so it's kind of a
catch-22<00:05:23.040> system<00:05:23.730> you<00:05:24.060> know<00:05:24.180> it<00:05:25.110> might<00:05:25.380> work

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
catch-22 system you know it might work

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.500 
catch-22 system you know it might work
and<00:05:25.860> why<00:05:25.919> not<00:05:26.100> double<00:05:26.580> giant<00:05:26.760> bombs<00:05:26.820> my<00:05:27.240> work

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
and why not double giant bombs my work

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.270 
and why not double giant bombs my work
that<00:05:27.630> might<00:05:27.810> not<00:05:27.960> all<00:05:28.440> comes<00:05:28.710> down<00:05:28.830> to<00:05:28.980> the

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
that might not all comes down to the
