00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.830
 most housewives have many home 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.559
 plants bake a variety of but 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.510
 probably no one that could 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.900
 bloom in summer and winter 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.309
 all year round that's why we offer 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.189
 such a miracle device will grow 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.529
 or rather create your own hands like 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.689
 to do it correctly will tell our 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.509
 good morning master 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.029
 each of us wants to be happy 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.999
 therefore we invent ourselves various 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.630
 things that brings us joy 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:37.480
 today we will be making wood with you 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.600
 happiness or topiary as he is different 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.990
 called for this we need 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.210
 round floral sponge it can 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.300
 buy at a flower shop 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.890
 but you need to buy a floral sponge for 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.860
 artificial flowers 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.690
 if you do not find a floral sponge 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.610
 you can use foam 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.590
 foam you can trim round 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:09.719
 molds with a hot knife still us 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.719
 you will need different berries flowers 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:12.719
 roses 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:21.950
 shelves or branches and what you can 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.460
 gather on the street I have enough 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.500
 the number of sticks that remained with me 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:33.530
 from artificial flowers i will 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:39.789
 use their lace pearls which 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:43.039
 advance over and thread the pot 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:52.009
 i use the pot that we did with 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:55.099
 you last time water and plaster so 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:02:00.099
 let's start we need to take clean 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:00.099
 tank and pour water there 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.260
 the water should be slightly warm 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.550
 then gradually pour plaster and 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.550
 mix 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.829
 now we need to pour this cast in 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.829
 potty 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.800
 for gypsum to be enough 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.730
 thick we will reach here still dry mix 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.730
 and mix 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:52.780
 now we need to take our wands 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.780
 and twist them in a spiral 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.860
 and now we need to insert them plaster 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:11.560
 now we can plant floristic 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.750
 sponge for wire for this we 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.710
 use a heat gun 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.660
 to floral sponge on our here 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.660
 these rods held tight 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.150
 Here we have such a bun check on 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.220
 the trunk now we have to fill it 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.800
 flowers but before that 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.830
 take sisal and wind our 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.780
 floral sponge so that it was not 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:55.890
 visible then take flowers and chaotically 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.730
 We start to insert so that it is filled 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.730
 circle shape 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.380
 Well, we have inserted all the roses now 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:21.130
 we take lace we cut it 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.740
 and folding we glue with 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.370
 heat gun him to the tree 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.250
 this is the lace we used on the pot 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.590
 Now we use the same lace on 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.620
 tree so that everything looked 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.620
 harmoniously 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.420
 Here we have such a wonderful 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.170
 tree to him yet 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.090
 embellish we use berries and 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:05.430
 fill all the empty places you can 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:08.950
 take the berries and flowers you have 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:14.070
 the main thing that they were different sizes 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.070
 then the tree will look richer 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.030
 and 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:44.269
 Well, it remains for us to decorate down and 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:44.269
 attach beads to our tree 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:06:00.409
 beads we glue with a thermogun and 

00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:03.189
 we cut them too big for us 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.189
 is necessary 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:40.420
 here is a tree made by your hands 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.420
 can bring joy to your home
