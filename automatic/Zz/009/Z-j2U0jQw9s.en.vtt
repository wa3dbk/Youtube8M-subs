00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.289 
makes you want to sit and and snuggle up
and<00:01:47.259> I<00:01:47.350> think<00:01:47.649> that<00:01:48.280> is<00:01:48.579> the<00:01:48.640> easiest<00:01:49.030> way<00:01:49.240> to

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
and I think that is the easiest way to

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.980 
and I think that is the easiest way to
start<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:50.110> change<00:01:50.350> your<00:01:50.590> room<00:01:50.829> is<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:52.060> give<00:01:52.899> it

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
start to change your room is to give it

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.469 
start to change your room is to give it
a<00:01:53.049> bit<00:01:53.229> more<00:01:53.259> weeks<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:54.039> comfort<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:54.969> so

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
a bit more weeks and comfort and so

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.529 
a bit more weeks and comfort and so
cushions<00:01:56.490> curtains<00:01:57.490> rugs<00:01:57.939> is<00:01:58.210> probably<00:01:58.450> the

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
cushions curtains rugs is probably the

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.600 
cushions curtains rugs is probably the
first<00:01:58.720> way<00:01:58.960> to<00:01:59.020> start<00:01:59.409> maybe<00:02:00.009> change<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.399> color

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
first way to start maybe change a color

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.630 
first way to start maybe change a color
