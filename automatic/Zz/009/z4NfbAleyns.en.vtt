00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:12.480
 we have here a videos new geforce 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.500
 gtx 760 for around 230 to 240 euros in 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.330
 should come to the trade 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.439
 and they want to introduce you now 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.779
 and in comparison to the predecessor card and 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.240
 new cards were a few things to it 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.910
 say 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.410
 purely visually if I'm always so direct 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.719
 next to each other I come cameraman 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:37.410
 she looks almost exactly like her 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.270
 gtx 670 but not what official 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.950
 the predecessor model is just the fan 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.500
 are very little bit different at the time 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:49.020
 needle 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:50.489
 otherwise from the front as from the back one 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.850
 identical to one the board carries 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.370
 even the same component number that is 2 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.359
 gb gddr5 memory installed 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.430
 it comes to a gk 104 say 25 chip 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.650
 commitment 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.119
 and as I said the great actually 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.310
 that's because a video is finally here 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.700
 times with the prices goes down 240 euros 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.400
 the GTX 670's only in small tick 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.229
 faster is against time for 300 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.780
 euro in the trade 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:24.150
 but even 390 euro 400 are so that is 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.720
 this 60 and if you have a number higher 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.619
 go 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.420
 the gtx 77 is not only much bigger 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.270
 she also looks significantly more valuable with the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.579
 referenzkÃ¼hler but there come as the us 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.390
 partner in the game, for example, asus 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.250
 gainward msi in 3d and how they all 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.470
 and we have some of them 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.580
 sometimes we throw cards there and there 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.490
 times short view it 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.800
 so we start with the asus 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.330
 of course the first card and has 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.050
 equal to a small special feature as 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:59.320
 only card uses this one very much 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.900
 short pcb that means cards clearly 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.690
 shorter than the other cards and also 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.800
 as the reference model only the the 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:12.180
 exeo 2 mini itx 670 a little shorter 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.680
 that really stops at the pcb 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.990
 the asus card uses only one 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.670
 power connection for it with eight poles and 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.430
 in the first little test with battlefield 3 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.890
 she brushed up to 1150 megahertz and 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:32.830
 remained relatively quiet accurate 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:34.959
 readings follow country second in the league 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.180
 is gainward with the known phantom 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.790
 design it is a little higher two and a half 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.950
 Slots also has two fans here below 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.680
 hidden in the grille blows in the test 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.850
 with battlefield 3 with 1215 mhz the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.000
 memory is also clocked at 100 mhz 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.739
 download all the cards until now 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.560
 are equipped with two gigabytes of it 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.300
 should also come four gigabyte models 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.720
 as you can see here of the pcbs too 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.970
 relatively short needed but 260 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.860
 Power connections then the fans 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.630
 remove some of them from the dust 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.630
 freeing is relatively convenient 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.689
 it continues with the presumable 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.269
 most potent card to date 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:26.420
 arrived and that in the 3d 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.750
 gtx 460 whdi has so to speak 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:35.989
 complete pcb and the complete 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:37.879
 equipment of the gtx 680 260 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.280
 power connections as I said two gigabytes 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.829
 Memory the monitor outputs are too 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.150
 everywhere equal to twice 3 1 x hdmi and 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:50.510
 once displayport from the cooler ago 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.120
 certainly the most potent plant costs in the 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:58.180
 test with 12 100 megahertz and also has 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:02.389
 to 3.1 ghz overclocked gddr5 memory 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.879
 so the penultimate card in the test lab that 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.969
 is the ms 15 hauser gaming here too 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:11.139
 Of course, that's not what it's all about 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:15.560
 has to two gigabytes as I said before 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:17.720
 two slot but looks a bit up 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.109
 beyond the normal height beyond the 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.560
 large fan to accommodate 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:27.440
 the design sounds relatively softly puffing 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:32.990
 in the test on 1150 mhz the memory remains 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:37.960
 as usual at 3004 march so the last 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:40.580
 card the jetstream jet gtx 760 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:45.440
 also standard display 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:48.560
 equipping a relatively short board after 26 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.060
 Pohl connections and visually with the 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.300
 immokasse certainly the most striking 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.180
 Model with the reddish brown cooler and the 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:02.470
 Two big fans are blowing in the test 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:05.140
 also up to 1200 megahertz 1228 even 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.690
 Now that we have all five cards in 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.680
 test lab 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:14.790
 first of all in our test system and 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.790
 look at the performance
