light the tiger which starts with the
letter<00:00:17.820> T<00:00:17.930> stands<00:00:18.930> for<00:00:19.220> TIR<00:00:20.220> optics<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.570> uses

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
letter T stands for TIR optics this uses

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.849 
letter T stands for TIR optics this uses
a<00:00:21.960> total<00:00:22.470> internal<00:00:22.890> reflection

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
a total internal reflection

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.050 
a total internal reflection
optic<00:00:25.859> which<00:00:26.010> gives<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.340> more<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.820> bright

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
optic which gives you more of a bright

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.189 
optic which gives you more of a bright
punch<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.510> an<00:00:27.599> output

punch of an output

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.189 
punch of an output
we've<00:00:28.470> also<00:00:28.710> over<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> top<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:29.939> those<00:00:30.240> optics

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
we've also over the top of those optics

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.500 
we've also over the top of those optics
included<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.070> linear<00:00:32.460> up-and-down<00:00:33.030> optic

ambulance or and as you can see and just

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.000 
ambulance or and as you can see and just
set<00:01:12.600> an<00:01:12.720> aside<00:01:13.049> with<00:01:13.200> flash<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.680> whole<00:01:13.710> light

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
set an aside with flash the whole light

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.399 
set an aside with flash the whole light
let<00:01:14.189> me<00:01:14.250> go<00:01:14.400> off<00:01:14.880> access<00:01:15.360> that's<00:01:15.570> 45<00:01:16.020> degrees

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
let me go off access that's 45 degrees

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.020 
let me go off access that's 45 degrees
according<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.100> my<00:01:17.189> chart<00:01:17.490> here<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.700> my<00:01:17.850> table

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
according to my chart here on my table

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.210 
according to my chart here on my table
and<00:01:18.330> that's<00:01:19.259> 45<00:01:19.710> degrees<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> other

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and that's 45 degrees the other

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.120 
and that's 45 degrees the other
directions<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.270> see<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.659> linear<00:01:22.130> up

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
directions you can see that linear up

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.310 
directions you can see that linear up
and<00:01:23.400> down<00:01:23.580> vertical<00:01:24.299> optic<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.840> put<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.170> there

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
and down vertical optic we put on there

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.390 
and down vertical optic we put on there
gives<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.740> little<00:01:25.830> more<00:01:26.009> side-to-side

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
gives it a little more side-to-side

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.719 
gives it a little more side-to-side
output<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.590> little<00:01:28.590> faster<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.280> there's<00:01:29.670> a

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
output a little faster and there's a

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.120 
output a little faster and there's a
half-and-half<00:01:30.119> pattern<00:01:30.689> use<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> total<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.890> six

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
half-and-half pattern use a total of six

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.710 
half-and-half pattern use a total of six
diodes<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.670> that's<00:01:32.850> three<00:01:33.090> flashing<00:01:33.509> against

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
diodes so that's three flashing against

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.800 
diodes so that's three flashing against
three<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.670> depending<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> colors<00:01:36.450> your

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
three so depending on the colors your

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.510 
three so depending on the colors your
preference<00:01:37.409> whatnot<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> flash

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
preference whatnot you can have a flash

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.280 
preference whatnot you can have a flash
solid<00:01:38.970> where<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.180> whole<00:01:39.329> light<00:01:39.509> flashes<00:01:40.020> or

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
solid where the whole light flashes or

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.700 
solid where the whole light flashes or
you<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:41.070> do<00:01:41.250> half<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.640> half<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.500> there's<00:01:43.500> half

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
you can do half and half so there's half

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.130 
you can do half and half so there's half

lights stop flashing and go solid when

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.190 
lights stop flashing and go solid when
you<00:02:05.430> put<00:02:05.670> your<00:02:05.759> brake<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.079> little

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
you put your brake on so it's a little

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.719 
you put your brake on so it's a little
added<00:02:07.530> measure<00:02:07.740> if<00:02:07.920> somebody<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.310> behind<00:02:08.550> you

added measure if somebody is behind you

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.180 
added measure if somebody is behind you
they<00:02:08.910> know

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
they know

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.170 
they know
when<00:02:09.250> you're<00:02:09.369> putting<00:02:09.520> your<00:02:09.610> brakes<00:02:09.880> on<00:02:10.060> your

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
when you're putting your brakes on your

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.050 
when you're putting your brakes on your
lights<00:02:10.390> will<00:02:10.510> go<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.690> steady<00:02:10.960> burn<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:12.060> stop

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
lights will go to steady burn and stop

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.460 
lights will go to steady burn and stop
flashing<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.890> this<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.310> solid<00:02:15.760> red<00:02:16.170> all<00:02:17.170> six

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
flashing so this is a solid red all six

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.260 
flashing so this is a solid red all six
diodes<00:02:17.890> are<00:02:17.980> red<00:02:18.130> we<00:02:18.310> do<00:02:18.460> it<00:02:18.550> in<00:02:18.730> half<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.090> half

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
diodes are red we do it in half and half

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.020 
diodes are red we do it in half and half
and<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:19.780> know<00:02:19.870> it's<00:02:19.990> all<00:02:20.140> solid<00:02:20.500> colors<00:02:21.030> so

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
and you know it's all solid colors so

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.520 
and you know it's all solid colors so
let<00:02:22.390> me<00:02:22.480> try<00:02:22.600> some<00:02:22.810> different<00:02:22.900> patterns<00:02:23.380> on

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
let me try some different patterns on

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
let me try some different patterns on
this<00:02:23.650> one<00:02:23.830> there's<00:02:24.040> half<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.460> half

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.650 

steady<00:02:30.550> on<00:02:30.610> one<00:02:30.880> side<00:02:31.090> these<00:02:31.240> are<00:02:31.300> some<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.600> the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
steady on one side these are some of the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.180 
steady on one side these are some of the
California<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.380> steady<00:02:32.710> burn<00:02:32.950> if<00:02:33.100> you

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
California is a steady burn if you

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.150 
California is a steady burn if you
wanted<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.520> run<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.880> your<00:02:34.240> own<00:02:34.360> flasher<00:02:34.870> and

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
wanted to run it to your own flasher and

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.060 
wanted to run it to your own flasher and
that's<00:02:36.160> solid<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:38.380> again<00:02:38.620> this<00:02:38.770> is<00:02:38.950> the

that's solid so again this is the
