00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
anyway let's move on to the screen

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.860 
anyway let's move on to the screen
okay<00:02:14.310> now<00:02:14.459> when<00:02:14.579> we<00:02:14.670> last<00:02:14.849> saw<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.299> picture

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
okay now when we last saw this picture

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.690 
okay now when we last saw this picture
it<00:02:16.140> was<00:02:16.290> very<00:02:16.439> blurry<00:02:16.829> we<00:02:17.099> couldn't<00:02:17.370> see<00:02:17.459> much

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
it was very blurry we couldn't see much

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.929 
it was very blurry we couldn't see much
but<00:02:18.329> now<00:02:18.599> things<00:02:19.349> are<00:02:19.560> becoming<00:02:19.920> very<00:02:20.489> clear

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
but now things are becoming very clear

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.020 
but now things are becoming very clear
so<00:02:21.569> firstly<00:02:22.019> it<00:02:22.349> is<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.860> fact<00:02:23.010> moderate<00:02:23.579> versus

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
so firstly it is in fact moderate versus

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.920 
so firstly it is in fact moderate versus

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
is what honestly makes me think that

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.640 
is what honestly makes me think that
this<00:03:08.819> is<00:03:08.939> going<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.239> be<00:03:09.389> a<00:03:09.569> next-gen<00:03:10.139> game<00:03:10.379> only

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.539 
there are something but I missed out
from<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.440> scan<00:03:19.680> because<00:03:19.889> it<00:03:20.040> was<00:03:20.129> so<00:03:20.220> blurry

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
from the scan because it was so blurry

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.119 
from the scan because it was so blurry
first<00:03:21.150> off<00:03:21.389> I<00:03:21.629> can<00:03:21.959> see<00:03:21.989> Karuma<00:03:22.620> wrapped

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
first off I can see Karuma wrapped

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.860 
first off I can see Karuma wrapped
around<00:03:23.340> in<00:03:23.790> motherís<00:03:24.150> Susanoo

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
around in motherís Susanoo

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.470 
around in motherís Susanoo
so<00:03:25.290> before<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:25.919> didn't<00:03:26.310> even<00:03:26.430> see<00:03:26.819> Karuma<00:03:27.299> in

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
so before I didn't even see Karuma in

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.899 
so before I didn't even see Karuma in
this<00:03:27.900> picture<00:03:28.319> second<00:03:28.919> of<00:03:29.010> all<00:03:29.129> there<00:03:29.669> is<00:03:29.790> a

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
this picture second of all there is a

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.750 
this picture second of all there is a
50/50<00:03:30.329> chance<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:31.139> this<00:03:31.560> being<00:03:31.889> free<00:03:32.579> battle

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
50/50 chance of this being free battle

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.729 
50/50 chance of this being free battle
gameplay<00:03:33.239> yeah<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:33.900> know<00:03:34.079> that<00:03:34.379> sounds<00:03:34.620> crazy

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
gameplay yeah I know that sounds crazy

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.460 
gameplay yeah I know that sounds crazy
and<00:03:35.220> this<00:03:36.209> would<00:03:36.480> be<00:03:36.659> the<00:03:36.810> first<00:03:36.959> time<00:03:37.230> ever

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
and this would be the first time ever

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.189 
and this would be the first time ever
that<00:03:38.040> two<00:03:38.459> huge<00:03:39.000> awakenings<00:03:39.510> like<00:03:39.720> this<00:03:39.930> can

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
that two huge awakenings like this can

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.449 
that two huge awakenings like this can
be<00:03:40.319> on<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.500> same<00:03:40.680> battlefield<00:03:40.980> at<00:03:41.220> once

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
be on the same battlefield at once

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.089 
be on the same battlefield at once
before<00:03:42.209> in<00:03:42.659> revolution<00:03:43.169> you<00:03:43.409> can<00:03:43.530> only<00:03:43.680> do<00:03:43.859> one

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
before in revolution you can only do one

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.069 
before in revolution you can only do one
at<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.280> time<00:03:44.489> but<00:03:45.090> now<00:03:45.329> it<00:03:45.569> looks<00:03:45.750> like<00:03:45.900> we're

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
at a time but now it looks like we're

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.689 
at a time but now it looks like we're
taking<00:03:46.199> it<00:03:46.409> to<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.590> next<00:03:46.799> level<00:03:46.859> still<00:03:47.519> though

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
taking it to the next level still though

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.460 
taking it to the next level still though
all<00:03:47.849> that<00:03:47.940> being<00:03:48.180> said<00:03:48.239> take<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.229> with<00:03:49.379> a

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
all that being said take that with a

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.619 
all that being said take that with a
grain<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.650> salt<00:03:49.799> this<00:03:50.340> just<00:03:50.609> could<00:03:50.790> be<00:03:50.819> story

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
grain of salt this just could be story

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.360 
grain of salt this just could be story
mode<00:03:51.870> gameplay<00:03:52.379> as<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.859> mentioned<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.310> my

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
mode gameplay as I mentioned in my

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.099 
mode gameplay as I mentioned in my
previous<00:03:53.549> video<00:03:53.940> there's<00:03:54.510> trees<00:03:54.870> on<00:03:55.049> the

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
previous video there's trees on the

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.539 
previous video there's trees on the
ground<00:03:55.139> so<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.560> don't<00:03:55.769> know<00:03:55.919> where<00:03:56.220> the

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
ground so I don't know where the

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.030 
ground so I don't know where the
opponent<00:03:56.819> would<00:03:57.060> run<00:03:57.329> if<00:03:57.599> he<00:03:58.199> was<00:03:58.409> a<00:03:58.440> small

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
opponent would run if he was a small

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.559 
opponent would run if he was a small
character<00:03:59.310> so<00:03:59.970> that's<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.269> only<00:04:00.449> thing

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
character so that's the only thing

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.789 
character so that's the only thing
that's<00:04:00.720> holding<00:04:00.840> me<00:04:01.049> back<00:04:01.229> from<00:04:01.349> thinking

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
that's holding me back from thinking

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.649 
that's holding me back from thinking
that's<00:04:02.069> actually<00:04:02.549> free<00:04:03.060> barrel<00:04:03.329> gameplay

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
that's actually free barrel gameplay

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.110 
that's actually free barrel gameplay
still<00:04:04.079> though<00:04:04.260> whichever<00:04:04.979> it<00:04:05.129> is<00:04:05.159> it's<00:04:05.819> going

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
still though whichever it is it's going

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.030 
still though whichever it is it's going
to<00:04:06.239> be<00:04:06.359> amazing<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.930> play<00:04:07.229> anyway<00:04:07.739> that's

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.770 
to be amazing to play anyway that's
pretty<00:04:08.220> much<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.609> again<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.359> graphics<00:04:09.720> look

amazing<00:04:09.900> if<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.560> look<00:04:10.739> carefully<00:04:10.979> around<00:04:11.370> the

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
amazing if you look carefully around the

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.000 
amazing if you look carefully around the
edges<00:04:11.819> and<00:04:12.030> where<00:04:12.510> he<00:04:12.629> punches<00:04:13.169> there<00:04:13.620> is<00:04:13.739> so

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
edges and where he punches there is so

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.430 
edges and where he punches there is so
