00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.809

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.720
 found it 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.670

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.000
 mileage of mook we answer 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.160
 clouds come to me now 200 300 64,000 km 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.269
 with an original first seen engine 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.170
 in it 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.170
 hence your car sold 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.769
 I wonder if some shade in the 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.769
 this edition around the clock 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.880
 well say all those miles yourself 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.200
 You don't see the foundation on it 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.520
 clio 16v 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.080
 let's take a look or maybe or 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.740
 like a fall or he would like it 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.740
 museum in then 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.000
 it's your fight 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.310
 is 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.390
 whole engine up comes from above lucy 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.430
 to under the china 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.450
 look it can be alcohol and top fucking 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.250
 but had time yet highly 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.140
 more i packing a sleeping bed are it 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.140
 is here 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.670
 look here and he has the back 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.340
 probably once the damage goes 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.409
 sheet parts have been welded there again and 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.799
 there is orange paint on it 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.799
 for the crown 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.790
 look there he is fancy that you can 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:36.040
 there can be of it on arie weasel with the oil 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.040
 channel to boats 13 a little leak 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.630
 and I such a cunha 16 clapper well as you 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.910
 she still encounters because the or they are 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.720
 They are also kicked off or cruise from 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.390
 survivor 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.150
 is it really going to take a long time 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.160
 two big enemies that is actually one 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.970
 major oil spills which then must play 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.460
 it really has to be 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.050
 be traced yes and the corrosion 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.410
 we begin to speak a little 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.580
 play 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.950
 yes so you see beams and the bottom plate 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.690
 there must be a must yes I have 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.830
 heard for clutter that you really continue 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.260
 so she wants it all 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.090
 so yes then I would stay 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.890
 existence might become our classic 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.300
 yes but then you need a repair 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.870
 hurry up a bit 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.870
 I will tell him 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.540
 we are now the test result 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.160
 have received from our judge 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.620
 the 100 things are positive 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.450
 coincidence is also what 19 points like 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.820
 stopping some rust found on the bottom 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.920
 at the stones behind a sushi bar 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.740
 Luckily I did n't know it through and through 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.260
 liquid is then also almost 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.030
 oil spill found some big ones 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.370
 seems to be but we can't really 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.440
 find out where t 3 comes from 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.870
 totally sort of my best with it 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.150
 actually few strange things in terms of state 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.790
 in terms of support arms or lilac coffee somewhere 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.290
 etc. They come out and I'm sure 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.480
 Taking away this like this 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.950
 tip because yes it's just what works 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.950
 better suits but it is certainly ah
