right<00:02:06.329> now<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.869> we<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.020> take<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:10.410> we<00:02:10.530> put

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
right now so we just take it and we put

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.360 
right now so we just take it and we put
it<00:02:10.830> in

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
it in

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.220

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
important if you notice the level of the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.750 
important if you notice the level of the
liquid<00:02:53.420> is<00:02:53.660> above<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.320> solids<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:55.190> always

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
liquid is above the solids you always

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.510 
liquid is above the solids you always
want<00:02:56.210> that<00:02:56.440> anything<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.470> is<00:02:57.650> above<00:02:58.040> the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
want that anything that is above the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.130 
want that anything that is above the
solids<00:02:58.940> is<00:02:59.090> going<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.570> rot

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
solids is going to rot

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.800 
solids is going to rot
you<00:03:00.560> don't<00:03:00.950> want<00:03:01.490> rotting<00:03:02.060> we're<00:03:02.240> not<00:03:02.450> trying

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
you don't want rotting we're not trying

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.720 
you don't want rotting we're not trying
to<00:03:02.870> rot<00:03:03.170> food<00:03:03.440> here<00:03:03.680> or<00:03:03.770> trying<00:03:04.100> to<00:03:04.160> ferment<00:03:04.520> it

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
to rot food here or trying to ferment it

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.970 
to rot food here or trying to ferment it
so<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.210> want<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.570> below<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.350> lactobacilli

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
so you want it below the lactobacilli

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.100 
so you want it below the lactobacilli
are<00:03:07.280> all<00:03:07.400> going<00:03:07.580> to<00:03:07.640> be<00:03:07.790> below<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.630> surface<00:03:08.810> of

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
are all going to be below the surface of

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:17.710 
are all going to be below the surface of
Earth<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.730> now<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:11.030> it<00:03:11.210> is<00:03:11.270> filled<00:03:12.170> up<00:03:16.720> we

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
Earth so now that it is filled up we

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.840 
Earth so now that it is filled up we
cover<00:03:17.990> it<00:03:18.200> up<00:03:18.260> and<00:03:18.380> also<00:03:18.590> what's<00:03:19.220> important

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
cover it up and also what's important

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.580 
cover it up and also what's important
we've<00:03:20.240> got<00:03:20.450> about<00:03:20.690> an<00:03:20.810> inch<00:03:20.960> inch<00:03:21.320> and<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.560> half

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
we've got about an inch inch and a half

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.380 
we've got about an inch inch and a half
here<00:03:22.100> on<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:23.830> above<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:24.980> top<00:03:25.220> so<00:03:26.120> this<00:03:26.270> is

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
here on the above the top so this is

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.750 
here on the above the top so this is
going<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:26.720> bubble<00:03:26.840> like<00:03:27.110> crazy<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:28.460> so<00:03:28.670> you

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
going to bubble like crazy and so you

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.450 
going to bubble like crazy and so you
want<00:03:29.090> some<00:03:29.270> space<00:03:29.510> in<00:03:29.720> here<00:03:29.900> because<00:03:30.530> if<00:03:31.250> you

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
want some space in here because if you

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.760 
want some space in here because if you
put<00:03:31.670> it<00:03:31.790> up<00:03:31.940> too<00:03:32.180> close<00:03:32.480> to<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.780> top<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.620> will

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
put it up too close to the top it will

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.800 
put it up too close to the top it will
actually<00:03:34.010> spill<00:03:34.790> over<00:03:35.150> while<00:03:35.510> it's

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
actually spill over while it's

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.170 
actually spill over while it's
fermenting<00:03:36.020> and<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:37.040> definitely<00:03:37.640> suggest<00:03:37.820> that

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
fermenting and I definitely suggest that

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.580 
fermenting and I definitely suggest that
you<00:03:38.300> put<00:03:38.600> this<00:03:39.610> bottle<00:03:40.610> somewhere<00:03:41.480> into<00:03:42.290> a

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
you put this bottle somewhere into a

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.310 
you put this bottle somewhere into a
glass<00:03:43.040> casserole<00:03:43.670> because<00:03:44.000> as<00:03:44.300> Kathy<00:03:45.230> has

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
glass casserole because as Kathy has

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.470 
glass casserole because as Kathy has
found<00:03:45.560> out<00:03:45.740> many<00:03:46.040> times<00:03:46.100> I've<00:03:46.700> placed<00:03:47.240> a

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
found out many times I've placed a

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.110 
found out many times I've placed a
fermenting<00:03:47.990> jar<00:03:48.260> somewhere<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.220> it's<00:03:49.910> just

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
fermenting jar somewhere and it's just

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.820 
fermenting jar somewhere and it's just
bubbled<00:03:50.540> over<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.050> it's<00:03:51.170> gotten<00:03:51.410> all<00:03:51.500> over

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
bubbled over and it's gotten all over

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.400 
bubbled over and it's gotten all over
counters<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:52.910> stuff<00:03:53.150> and<00:03:53.390> that<00:03:54.020> was<00:03:54.170> my

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
counters and stuff and that was my

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.400 
counters and stuff and that was my
secondary<00:03:55.280> containment<00:03:55.700> idea<00:03:56.120> yes<00:03:56.600> that<00:03:57.260> was

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
secondary containment idea yes that was

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.000 
secondary containment idea yes that was
her<00:03:57.620> idea<00:03:58.130> so<00:03:58.340> anyway<00:03:59.110> we're<00:04:00.110> done<00:04:00.320> now<00:04:00.350> you

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
her idea so anyway we're done now you

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.280 
her idea so anyway we're done now you
just<00:04:01.190> take<00:04:01.370> this<00:04:01.640> put<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:02.630> in<00:04:02.750> an<00:04:02.840> area<00:04:03.170> where

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
just take this put it in an area where

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.790 
just take this put it in an area where
there's<00:04:03.500> not<00:04:03.710> much<00:04:04.100> of<00:04:04.430> any<00:04:04.700> direct<00:04:05.180> sunlight

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
there's not much of any direct sunlight

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.350 
there's not much of any direct sunlight
temperature-wise<00:04:06.800> you<00:04:07.670> want<00:04:07.880> to<00:04:08.000> be<00:04:08.120> between

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
temperature-wise you want to be between

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.350 
temperature-wise you want to be between
65<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:09.320> 80<00:04:09.500> degrees<00:04:09.980> you<00:04:10.610> don't<00:04:10.820> really<00:04:11.090> want

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
65 to 80 degrees you don't really want

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.960 
65 to 80 degrees you don't really want
it<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:11.480> be<00:04:11.630> below<00:04:11.990> 65<00:04:12.410> degrees<00:04:12.920> it's<00:04:13.160> not<00:04:13.280> going

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
it to be below 65 degrees it's not going

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.970 
it to be below 65 degrees it's not going
to<00:04:14.090> ferment<00:04:14.480> quick<00:04:14.870> enough<00:04:15.140> if<00:04:15.530> it<00:04:15.710> doesn't

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
to ferment quick enough if it doesn't

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.500 
to ferment quick enough if it doesn't
remember<00:04:16.190> now<00:04:16.670> if<00:04:16.730> something<00:04:17.060> else<00:04:17.210> can

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
remember now if something else can

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.039 
remember now if something else can
happen<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.900> it

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
happen to it

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.210 
happen to it
ie<00:04:18.230> mold<00:04:19.190> or<00:04:19.430> other<00:04:19.580> bacteria<00:04:20.359> so<00:04:21.169> 65<00:04:21.890> degrees

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
ie mold or other bacteria so 65 degrees

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.680 
ie mold or other bacteria so 65 degrees
is<00:04:22.370> pretty<00:04:22.580> much<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:22.850> lowest<00:04:23.060> that<00:04:23.330> you<00:04:23.479> want

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
is pretty much the lowest that you want

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.400
