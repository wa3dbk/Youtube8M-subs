00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
school or in this film what happened in

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.949 
school or in this film what happened in
the<00:03:32.889> second<00:03:33.340> half<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.849> jet<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.329> mean<00:03:34.599> the

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
the second half the jet I mean the

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.050 
the second half the jet I mean the
Patriots<00:03:35.769> brought<00:03:36.040> in<00:03:36.220> there<00:03:36.400> hurry<00:03:36.730> up

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
Patriots brought in there hurry up

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.170 
Patriots brought in there hurry up
spread<00:03:37.780> offense<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:39.370> know<00:03:39.489> with<00:03:39.700> three<00:03:40.030> or

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
spread offense you know with three or

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.300 
spread offense you know with three or
four<00:03:40.419> wide<00:03:40.630> receivers<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:41.470> that<00:03:41.650> essentially

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
four wide receivers and that essentially

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.970 
four wide receivers and that essentially
took<00:03:42.819> Chris<00:03:43.510> Jenkins<00:03:43.840> out<00:03:44.349> of<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.739> game

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
took Chris Jenkins out of the game

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.309 
took Chris Jenkins out of the game
because<00:03:45.760> Chris<00:03:46.150> not<00:03:46.389> only<00:03:46.690> makes<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.079> running

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
because Chris not only makes the running

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.400 
because Chris not only makes the running
game<00:03:47.680> goes<00:03:48.040> he<00:03:48.519> makes<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:48.970> pass<00:03:49.299> rush<00:03:49.720> go<00:03:50.019> to

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
game goes he makes that pass rush go to

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.559 
game goes he makes that pass rush go to
so<00:03:50.980> that<00:03:51.280> was<00:03:51.519> just<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.880> brilliant<00:03:52.150> brilliant

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
so that was just a brilliant brilliant

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.309 
so that was just a brilliant brilliant
move<00:03:52.959> by<00:03:53.489> Bill<00:03:54.489> Belichick<00:03:54.970> thank<00:03:55.269> you<00:03:56.139> though

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.509 
so I think a lot of teams are going to
go<00:03:58.480> to<00:03:58.540> school<00:03:58.870> on<00:03:59.139> that<00:03:59.349> and<00:03:59.530> then<00:03:59.680> also<00:03:59.889> the

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
go to school on that and then also the
