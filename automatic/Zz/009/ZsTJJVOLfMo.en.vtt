00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.490 
impressive thing about the 308 is the
gearbox<00:04:08.549> it's<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.360> 6-speed<00:04:09.900> manual<00:04:09.930> with<00:04:10.470> a

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
gearbox it's a 6-speed manual with a

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.800 
gearbox it's a 6-speed manual with a
really<00:04:10.980> short<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.430> solid<00:04:11.940> action<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.390> some

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
really short and solid action and some

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.810 
really short and solid action and some
well<00:04:13.049> sort<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.470> ratios<00:04:13.920> it's<00:04:14.549> almost

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
well sort of ratios it's almost

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.000 
well sort of ratios it's almost
perfectly<00:04:15.450> matched<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.049> engine

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
perfectly matched to the engine

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.070 
perfectly matched to the engine
never<00:04:18.520> really<00:04:18.790> thought<00:04:18.940> I'd<00:04:19.090> describe<00:04:19.600> a<00:04:19.720> 308

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
never really thought I'd describe a 308

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.770 
never really thought I'd describe a 308
as<00:04:20.410> enjoyable<00:04:21.340> but<00:04:21.610> that's<00:04:22.150> exactly<00:04:22.660> what

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
as enjoyable but that's exactly what
