00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.940 
run wide in the middle of the corner and
rotate<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.750> car<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.140> aim<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.500> towards<00:03:31.800> the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
rotate the car to aim it towards the

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.640 
rotate the car to aim it towards the
second<00:03:32.310> apex<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:32.850> onto<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.330> exit<00:03:33.690> this<00:03:34.470> is

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
second apex and onto the exit this is

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.410 
second apex and onto the exit this is
particularly<00:03:35.010> effective<00:03:35.640> if<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.940> corner<00:03:36.269> has

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
particularly effective if the corner has

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.600 
particularly effective if the corner has
a<00:03:36.450> relatively<00:03:36.930> large<00:03:37.260> radius<00:03:37.800> and<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.430> car

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
a relatively large radius and the car

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.190 
a relatively large radius and the car
that<00:03:38.760> you're<00:03:38.880> driving<00:03:38.910> is<00:03:39.450> pretty<00:03:39.720> nimble<00:03:39.900> and

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
that you're driving is pretty nimble and

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.120 
that you're driving is pretty nimble and
has<00:03:40.709> good<00:03:40.890> power<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.519> accelerate<00:03:42.000> quickly

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
has good power to accelerate quickly

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.190 
has good power to accelerate quickly
the<00:03:43.610> third<00:03:43.850> option<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.510> most<00:03:44.780> common

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
the third option and most common

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.260 
the third option and most common
approach<00:03:45.500> is<00:03:45.710> to<00:03:46.070> simply<00:03:46.550> treat<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.880> hairpin

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
approach is to simply treat the hairpin

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.960 
approach is to simply treat the hairpin
like<00:03:47.570> a<00:03:47.600> late<00:03:47.870> apex<00:03:48.260> corner<00:03:48.710> at<00:03:49.460> the<00:03:49.730> end<00:03:49.880> of

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
like a late apex corner at the end of

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.760 
like a late apex corner at the end of
the<00:03:50.030> braking<00:03:50.360> zone<00:03:50.390> you'll<00:03:50.990> turn<00:03:51.260> in<00:03:51.500> very

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
the braking zone you'll turn in very

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.800 
the braking zone you'll turn in very
late<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.190> aim<00:03:52.520> for<00:03:52.790> an<00:03:52.880> apex<00:03:53.240> that<00:03:53.480> is<00:03:53.600> about

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
late and aim for an apex that is about

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.320 
late and aim for an apex that is about
3/4<00:03:54.530> of<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.680> way<00:03:54.860> around<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.250> corner<00:03:55.580> this

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
3/4 of the way around the corner this

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.060 
3/4 of the way around the corner this
allows<00:03:56.630> you<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.900> get<00:03:57.020> back<00:03:57.170> to<00:03:57.350> power<00:03:57.560> early

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
allows you to get back to power early

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.730 
allows you to get back to power early
