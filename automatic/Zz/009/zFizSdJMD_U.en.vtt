the transports we have to wave serpents
these<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.369> converted<00:01:20.909> from<00:01:21.330> fire<00:01:21.720> prism<00:01:22.200> kits

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
these are converted from fire prism kits

cockpit they are

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.800 
cockpit they are
excuse-me<00:01:27.509> turret<00:01:27.810> they're<00:01:28.229> magnetized<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
excuse-me turret they're magnetized and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.120 
excuse-me turret they're magnetized and
yes<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.020> does<00:01:31.200> come<00:01:31.439> off<00:01:31.470> just<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> right

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
yes that does come off just the right

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.080 
yes that does come off just the right
amount<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.400> pole<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:34.369> so<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.880> is

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
amount of pole on that and so this is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.969 
amount of pole on that and so this is
how<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.270> prefer<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.079> magnetized<00:01:37.680> down

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
how I prefer this is magnetized down

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.550 
how I prefer this is magnetized down
here<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.520> well<00:01:38.820> they<00:01:39.630> have<00:01:39.900> options<00:01:40.229> for
