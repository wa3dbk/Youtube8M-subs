00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.030
 Counter-Strike 

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.990
 a first-person shooter computer game 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.640
 , created by Minh "Gooseman" Le and Jess "Cliffe" Cliffe 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.440
 and being a modification ("modem") of Half-Life. 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.060
 Initially Counter-Strike required Half-Life to work 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.031
 however, with the passage of time 

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:25.162
 other versions of it were created 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.320
 which have evolved into independent productions 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.820
 only using the original game engine. 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.560
 And Half-Life - Counter Strike in both box and official version 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.320
 was released 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.140
 by Sierra Enterteiment 

00:00:43.778 --> 00:00:45.778
 he changed the typical Half-Life 

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:47.596
 in a tactical battlefield 

00:00:47.856 --> 00:00:49.856
 for a team game on the Internet. 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.580
 The player favors the special anti-terrorist group 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.220
 or joins terrorists 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.360
 Like playing in Policemen and Thieves 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.700
 And it operated on the GoldSource engine 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.940
 which was a highly modified Quake engine. 

00:01:09.174 --> 00:01:11.174
 After the huge success of this MOD 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.900
 the time has come for the boxed version 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.420
 containing in addition to Counter-Strike 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.120
 full version of Half-Life Multiplayer 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.360
 and such additions as Team Fortress Classic 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.280
 or Half-Life: Opposing Force Multiplayer 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.720
 The game is intended primarily for multiplayer games 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.360
 based on team competition 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.880
 just like in Team Fortress or Delta Force2. 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.240
 In Poland Counter-Strike was attached to the golden edition 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.680
 named Half-Life: Generation. 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.220
 Currently, in my opinion, a high equivalent of today's CS: GO 

00:01:47.558 --> 00:01:49.558
 was CS 1.6 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.100
 which was just another patch to 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.031
 the official game stand 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.640
 Interestingly, all the current maps 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.640
 were created by players and then added 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.360
 I list the entire list of birds from previous years, I leave in the description of the film for the more inquisitive. 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.940
 After the big hype that the modification caused 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.380
 Valve has decided to buy all the rights to this modification 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.320
 at the same time employing its creators in its ranks 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.160
 along with purchasing rights before Valve 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.580
 work on the continuation was started right away 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.140
 which in assumptions was supposed to be something new and better 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.971
 than the original CS 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.200
 and we're talking about Counter-Strike: Condition Zero 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.780
 has been published 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.780
 year and uses the GoldSrc engine the same as the official CS edition 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.680
 CS: Condition Zero also has a multiplayer version 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.460
 which differs from the previous one (Counter-Strike 1.6) 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.060
 new textures, slightly modified maps and visual elements 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.900
 What in my mind was funny at that time 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.760
 because after almost 5 years, players got a new refreshed version 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.800
 which had nothing to change, which should be introduced 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.160
 continuation of a great cs 1.6 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.100
 she did not take in very well 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.980
 and thus Valve decided to start work on the next installment of the series. 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.880
 and we're talking about Counter-Strike: Source here 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.800
 who left a few months later after the previous fall of what was Condition Zero 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.740
 created by Valve on the Source graphics engine (hence Source in the name) 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.920
 The beta version was available from 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.300
 and the premiere 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.140
 in the Steam service 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.120
 CS: S was one of the elements of some Half-Life 2 editions 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.640
 and then it was released separately in a game set 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.000
 "Day of Defeat: Source" and "Half-Life 2: Deathmatch 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.340
 In spite of a previous slip, it was Condition Zero 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.520
 Source has been very well received by players as well as reviewers 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.740
 although I personally still preferred the older honest 1.6 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.420
 but for many other Source players and its phenomenon 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.459
 lasted for many years 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.460
 until in 2011 Valve announced continuation, and it was her 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.980
 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.500
 issued by Valve Corporation and Hidden Path Entertainment 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.360
 that have previously worked on Counter-Strike: Source 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.280
 And that works on the same Source engine 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.820
 Source which is already years old, however numerous modifications 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.540
 made the game unheard of in a visual matter. 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.100
 Global Offensive was issued 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.700
 on the platform (Steam). 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.980
 The game added two new modes: "Arms race" and "Demolka". 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.860
 which previously had their equivalents on modifications 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.740
 modifications that were on the servers created by the players 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.200
 Maps have been made from scratch. 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.960
 And CS: GO itself with update "the arms deal" 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.640
 he changed the game unrecognizable 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.600
 he changed the game unrecognizable 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.660
 the desire to collect new weapon skins also came 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.860
 and some of them reach prices even for several thousand dollars. 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.240
 Other versions of the game were also created, and they were them 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.360
 Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies that appeared on the steam 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.380
 and also quite strange equivalents 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.780
 located on the market of Asian countries 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.260
 CS-Neo and CS-Online 1/2. 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.060
 Although 16 years have passed since the creation of the game 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.380
 the series is still very popular 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.720
 The usual modification of Half Life 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.600
 it has become a phenomenon and has been playing throughout all these years 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.420
 the years have undergone first and foremost visual changes 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.080
 with slight improvements in game mechanics 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.720
 which does not bother you in the game at all 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.900
 And understanding mechanics can be a challenge 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.920
 challenge what is your answer to e-sport tournaments 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.180
 where the best players from around the world 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.080
 they are trying to create an unforgettable spectacle.
