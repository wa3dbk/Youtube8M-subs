00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.270
 good afternoon to all, holiday me 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.840
 Doenits name here repair doing the first time 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.250
 immediately talk about it taking 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.320
 I read information about the Internet 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.630
 Studied and then applied on 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.600
 practice 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.050
 accordingly wanted to share 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.039
 moments of repair that I had 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:32.250
 here is the first thing you have to face 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:35.640
 that's what i had about him 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.270
 overdue plaster for a year here is the date 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.730
 Now I will show you and that was 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.739
 as follows 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.750
 when I mixed you the solution she quickly 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.079
 hardened and not that is can say 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.079
 just spent material on the release 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.930
 then I read on the internet what can 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.870
 add duo glue or citric acid 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:08.220
 accordingly, the solution is already larger 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:09.990
 time was in that condition 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.540
 there could have been more time working with 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:19.729
 With a solution about that calmly apply here 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:23.159
 after the solution is approved 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.509
 he covered spring with these from the head so 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.070
 Further 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:33.360
 marazzi different that's what i found out later 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.289
 that after being dealt 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.619
 plaster dumps leveled 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:44.170
 after that you can use this 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.530
 a tool like a grout thats like 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.000
 show how i do it suppose 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.960
 this is the wall 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.490
 well i actually have this truth there 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.069
 right here i started you can only say 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.830
 It works trowel so she's ironing 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.689
 such a tool 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.149
 but here that is i wet it plentifully 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.479
 and starting though here you can say 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.830
 passed well it's 12 hours 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.830
 wanted desirable do this somewhere 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.489
 when it went well I don't know but often 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.480
 not half an hour on when hardened and 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.829
 that is why it is impossible to remove this one 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.380
 plaster and that is these here 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:29.890
 irregularities she basically i'm on them for 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:33.340
 smoothly wanted from bumps layer 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.560
 applied large enough i watched 4 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.190
 centimeter that's because here 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.330
 significantly because of her account 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.910
 align 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:49.989
 then I see my honest one 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.989
 fighting with the second form here is the repair I do 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:03:01.730
 one doing the first time so on all 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.090
 learning information went away sufficient 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.739
 well as more absurd decently time 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.140
 so would like to share with you 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.360
 something useful here see the following 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.230
 rooms some moments she may be 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.230
 still tell you
