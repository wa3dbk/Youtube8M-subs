00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.719
 I'm going to start talking about this little sponge 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.520
 that I bought at it's your chair ' is a 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.670
 rectangle the truth is that in the 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.430
 catalog looks much smaller and 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.890
 thin I decided to buy it I'm not very 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.010
 fan of the sponges but I decided to 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.020
 buy it 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.580
 because I saw that they had the version 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.500
 that is like a little pink egg 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.060
 female I tried with a makeup that 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.440
 I liked it a lot and the truth is that I was 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.900
 little disappointed because as you can see 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.510
 is this stain that was made was the 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.110
 first application that I did the first 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.150
 Once I used me action absorbed me 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.250
 all the makeup is impressive the 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.380
 amount of makeup that absorbs 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.630
 even this was changed the way it was 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.140
 so couple 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.270
 more porous 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.670
 she provides it twice with makeup 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.309
 I was very disappointed then look 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.280
 a makeup that I mistakenly for 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.380
 much more clear 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.659
 is this 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.460
 de l'orÃ©al I bought a tone and decided 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.619
 try it and the truth is that it was a 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:22.170
 totally different change since it is 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.750
 more fluid is more fluid and it was much 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.230
 easier to apply with the sponge 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.390
 so that's how I do it now 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.880
 you just put in a little bit they give you the 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.210
 touches and now you start to apply 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.210
 your face 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.729
 what I liked this expo remove despite 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.409
 what is the candle I already have a little 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.260
 stained is that I overdo it in the 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.690
 makeup with a clean side I can 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.870
 follow 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.930
 dancing a little taps and falls 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.490
 the excess that applies if I recommend it 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.370
 my skin is fat I have not had any 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.340
 problem with him and it 's quite 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.670
 Only you have to give the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.670
 return 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.450
 and the product comes out automatically you do not 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.709
 you are going to see here but there is to press it you go 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.709
 to see as if it applies 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.860
 this for example I am applying it 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.480
 little touches and in the advantage is that with 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.840
 this same sponge you can 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.840
 blur 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.200
 you can not put a little here for 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:30.040
 give and take advantage of light as 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.010
 come is clearer it is more yellow than my 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.629
 skin this stage I'm not even 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.590
 pressing only I'm as if 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.590
 I was caressing 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.030
 now the dust that I am already using 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.470
 I apply it with this intrusion kabuki 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.250
 the truth is that I liked it a lot because 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.770
 it's very dense I grab the product but you 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.510
 it diffuses it very well the dust that to me 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.240
 I liked it is the second time that 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.840
 I buy this 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.090
 mineral becks the tone is neutral but 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.120
 still has a yellow tone is not a 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.420
 translucent powder because it has has 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.420
 colour 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.700
 I like to turn it around a little bit 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.340
 and that it falls here in the lid then 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.610
 with kabuki only 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.840
 I put you here 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.840
 as already that step 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.860
 and I can apply to touch 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.439
 as you see I apply it more or less as the 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.439
 blush as if you were caressing 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.340
 this is natural that you can use 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.980
 Any blush you want is a very 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.690
 intense a red orange rose one natural 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.240
 only gloss there is no problem 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.090
 right now I do not bring anything I like many 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.300
 Sometimes decide for the lipstick if it is not 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.580
 I have it planned I like to decide already 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.350
 that I changed because sometimes if you bring the 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.940
 very dark clothes or if you bring it too 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:07.310
 colorful this a very intense pink tone 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.100
 a short one makes the difference and makes 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.050
 harmonize that harmonize much more then 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.580
 why not 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.580
 do not wash my makeup
