before<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.590> definitely<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.980> first

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
before so this is definitely a first

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.299 
before so this is definitely a first
about<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> whole<00:00:30.420> bunch<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.720> year<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:31.019> me<00:00:31.309> one

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
about a whole bunch of year with me one

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.270 
about a whole bunch of year with me one
of<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> one<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.940> first<00:00:33.180> things<00:00:33.420> I

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
of the one of the first things I

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
of the one of the first things I
definitely<00:00:35.280> doing<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:35.730> there's<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.090> whole

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
definitely doing because there's a whole

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.280 
definitely doing because there's a whole
bunch<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.600> different<00:00:36.719> lights<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.170> here

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
bunch of different lights in here

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.830 
bunch of different lights in here
there's<00:00:37.469> fluorescents<00:00:38.160> LEDs<00:00:38.840> halogens

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
there's fluorescents LEDs halogens

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.750 
there's fluorescents LEDs halogens
because<00:00:40.469> I've<00:00:40.649> been<00:00:40.710> using<00:00:40.770> my<00:00:41.040> digital

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
because I've been using my digital

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.410 
because I've been using my digital
calibration<00:00:42.270> target<00:00:43.820> awesome<00:00:44.820> just<00:00:45.120> for

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
calibration target awesome just for

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.119 
calibration target awesome just for
setting<00:00:45.930> custom<00:00:46.320> light<00:00:46.739> bounce

setting custom light bounce
every<00:00:47.430> time<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> move<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.030> camera<00:00:48.180> because

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
every time I move the camera because

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.959 
every time I move the camera because
every<00:00:48.899> shot<00:00:49.140> though<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:50.219> color<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.640> changing

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
every shot though the color is changing

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.430 
every shot though the color is changing
in<00:00:51.059> fact<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.390> I'm<00:00:51.480> doing<00:00:51.899> right<00:00:51.989> now<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.199> I'm

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
kind of killing time and I am as you can

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.319 
kind of killing time and I am as you can
see<00:00:55.890> out<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> window<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.789> about<00:00:57.030> there

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
see out the window it's just about there

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.450 
see out the window it's just about there
maybe<00:00:57.750> not<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.020> twenty<00:00:58.320> minutes<00:00:58.620> or<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.070> want

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
maybe not a twenty minutes or so I want

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.400 
maybe not a twenty minutes or so I want
to<00:00:59.550> shoot<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.030> part<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.480> Interior<00:01:00.960> which

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
to shoot this part of the Interior which

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.959 
to shoot this part of the Interior which
has<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> lot<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.980> windows<00:01:02.280> coming<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.730> want<00:01:02.910> to

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
has a lot of windows coming in I want to

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.310 
has a lot of windows coming in I want to
get<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> light<00:01:03.480> even<00:01:04.549> between<00:01:05.549> outside<00:01:05.820> and

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
get the light even between outside and

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.570 
get the light even between outside and
inside<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.830> they're<00:01:07.950> very<00:01:07.979> similar<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.520> I've

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
inside so they're very similar and I've

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.070 
inside so they're very similar and I've
got<00:01:08.700> some<00:01:08.880> extra<00:01:09.090> lights<00:01:09.479> with<00:01:09.659> me<00:01:09.840> I'm<00:01:09.930> going

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
got some extra lights with me I'm going

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.899 
got some extra lights with me I'm going
to<00:01:10.140> bounce<00:01:10.409> light<00:01:10.650> up<00:01:11.040> off<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.460> corners<00:01:11.790> of

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
to bounce light up off the corners of

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.719 
to bounce light up off the corners of
the<00:01:11.970> walls<00:01:12.119> try<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> get<00:01:13.200> some<00:01:13.350> more<00:01:13.729> fill

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the walls try to get some more fill

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.490 
the walls try to get some more fill
light<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.659> add<00:01:15.720> more<00:01:15.900> detail<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
light so I can add more detail in the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.820 
light so I can add more detail in the
shadows<00:01:17.840> but<00:01:18.840> definitely<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.530> total

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
shadows but definitely the total

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.890 
shadows but definitely the total

calibration target if you're not
familiar<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.310> an<00:01:23.400> awesome<00:01:23.549> product

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
familiar with it it's an awesome product

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.880 
familiar with it it's an awesome product
really<00:01:25.710> helps<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.159> teach<00:01:27.080> learn<00:01:28.080> how<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.409> you

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
really helps you teach learn how you you

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.890 
really helps you teach learn how you you
know<00:01:28.920> custom<00:01:29.340> white<00:01:29.490> balance<00:01:29.520> exposure<00:01:29.939> for

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
know custom white balance exposure for

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.230 
know custom white balance exposure for
instance<00:01:31.229> if<00:01:31.290> you're<00:01:31.409> doing<00:01:31.530> exposure<00:01:32.119> in<00:01:33.119> a

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
instance if you're doing exposure in a

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.840 
instance if you're doing exposure in a
difficult<00:01:33.720> situation<00:01:34.759> depending<00:01:35.759> your

difficult situation depending your
picture<00:01:36.150> style<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.479> how<00:01:36.570> much<00:01:36.720> contrast

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
picture style on how much contrast

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.270 
picture style on how much contrast
you've<00:01:37.380> got<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.040> you're<00:01:38.159> using

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
you've got in it but if you're using

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.980 
you've got in it but if you're using
like<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.520> standard<00:01:38.880> picture<00:01:39.090> style<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.509> you're

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
like a standard picture style and you're

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.480 
like a standard picture style and you're
looking<00:01:40.200> at<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> histogram<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:41.220> should<00:01:41.369> have

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
looking at the histogram you should have

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.950 
looking at the histogram you should have
a<00:01:41.520> nice<00:01:41.700> clean<00:01:42.060> spike<00:01:42.390> right<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.720> center

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
a nice clean spike right in the center

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.749 
a nice clean spike right in the center
to<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.530> spike<00:01:43.829> off<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> right<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.670> you

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
to have a spike off to the right and you

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.550 
to have a spike off to the right and you
have<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.939> spike<00:01:45.210> off<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> left<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.140> use

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
have a spike off to the left I use

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.990 
have a spike off to the left I use
neutral<00:01:47.040> picture<00:01:47.280> styles<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:47.700> those<00:01:47.850> are

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
neutral picture styles so those are

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.260 
neutral picture styles so those are
actually<00:01:48.560> constricted<00:01:49.579> the<00:01:50.579> white<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.030> over

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
actually constricted the white is over

the<00:03:43.409> song<00:03:43.650> in<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.340> background<00:03:44.489> of<00:03:45.449> me<00:03:45.720> talking

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
the song in the background of me talking

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.740 
the song in the background of me talking
right<00:03:46.259> here<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:46.650> what<00:03:46.859> I<00:03:46.889> did<00:03:47.159> is<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.489> just<00:03:47.759> put

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
right here so what I did is I just put

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.240 
right here so what I did is I just put
my<00:03:48.840> headphones<00:03:49.019> on<00:03:49.379> and<00:03:49.739> it<00:03:49.799> was<00:03:49.919> kind<00:03:50.069> of<00:03:50.099> neat

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
my headphones on and it was kind of neat

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.009 
my headphones on and it was kind of neat
because<00:03:50.430> when<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:50.639> would<00:03:50.909> do<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.150> slide<00:03:51.509> movement

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
because when I would do a slide movement

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.129 
because when I would do a slide movement
or<00:03:52.139> a<00:03:52.169> pan<00:03:52.500> or<00:03:52.829> a<00:03:52.859> rack<00:03:53.099> focus<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:54.299> timing<00:03:54.930> of

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
or a pan or a rack focus the timing of

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.599 
or a pan or a rack focus the timing of
the<00:03:55.319> music<00:03:55.769> just<00:03:55.799> going<00:03:56.220> through<00:03:56.250> my<00:03:56.400> head

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
the music just going through my head

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.569 
the music just going through my head
subconsciously<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.569> kind<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:57.959> knew<00:03:58.259> how<00:03:58.919> far<00:03:59.250> a

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
subconsciously I kind of knew how far a

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.149 
subconsciously I kind of knew how far a
bass<00:04:00.359> the<00:04:00.720> slide<00:04:00.989> should<00:04:01.229> be<00:04:01.409> where<00:04:01.979> I<00:04:02.009> would

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
bass the slide should be where I would

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.460 
bass the slide should be where I would
cut<00:04:02.489> from<00:04:02.729> one<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.359> another<00:04:03.599> so<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.259> was<00:04:04.349> just

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
cut from one to another so it was just

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.710 
cut from one to another so it was just
kind<00:04:04.560> of<00:04:04.769> an<00:04:04.949> interesting<00:04:05.699> thing<00:04:06.329> I'll<00:04:06.540> see

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
kind of an interesting thing I'll see

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.860 
kind of an interesting thing I'll see
how<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.019> works<00:04:07.229> in<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.620> actual<00:04:07.859> Edit<00:04:08.159> Bay<00:04:08.280> but

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
how it works in the actual Edit Bay but

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.300 
how it works in the actual Edit Bay but
so<00:04:09.870> far<00:04:10.079> it<00:04:10.199> seems<00:04:10.349> like<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.680> was<00:04:10.769> kind<00:04:11.129> of<00:04:11.189> a

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
so far it seems like it was kind of a

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.759 
so far it seems like it was kind of a
neat<00:04:11.609> way<00:04:11.759> to<00:04:11.790> do<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.290> also<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.560> know<00:04:13.739> just

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
neat way to do it also you know just

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.610 
neat way to do it also you know just
listening<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.639> music<00:04:14.729> coming<00:04:15.180> up<00:04:15.359> here<00:04:15.629> it
