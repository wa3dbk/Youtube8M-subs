00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.980
 halo reach your friends the season 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.160
 is coming to an end 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.790
 we come to the last stretch of the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.410
 olympiastracke in sochi rolls at the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.900
 the spirits divide the one 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.840
 love the others, hate them 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.670
 understandably because the route is 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.810
 very different 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.730
 the upper region of the curve a super 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.279
 ski in our area long dress 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.440
 stretch one agrees already 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.210
 what is now actually what 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.460
 Settings Everyone has the best ten 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.190
 actually decide for yourself 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.170
 you should test out what to do with one 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.579
 gets along a bit and needs it 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.940
 they knew each other 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.180
 if you need more clothes you need us 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.360
 but I'll say it upstairs 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.520
 lower edge speed takes along 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.719
 That's better than being too much 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.079
 speed loses what can you do 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.090
 down with little good still only what 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.710
 you 're screwed up and I'm fine too 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.100
 do 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:12.150
 exceptional popularity because I patented my 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:16.560
 Okay, so we come to the same ride 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.420
 In the beginning I would like to say used as 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.270
 the brenz button is not the least 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.560
 I bind you was this route 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.470
 not wanted to pay and that is ice 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.810
 but this little wave is pressed 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.369
 now 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.110
 the right then it has the jump that 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.079
 He pressed so that middle bit longer 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.610
 sorrow suddenly here the actually 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.390
 Sport class ball only to fast 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.320
 get up 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.329
 Now , yes solar corner comes here indeed 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.880
 the rights of this first interim 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:50.570
 you will indeed go to the left 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.070
 driven but that makes the 6 kaladse 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.850
 Take the next turn very well and now 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.500
 These curves actually come 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.640
 cut over and understeer may otherwise 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.520
 the whole thing swings on the long 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.750
 behind the vehicle until the fall 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.630
 or until you're always around the 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.110
 curve comes you should always be accurate 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.030
 find the exact right time and 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.430
 but do not be afraid of anything 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.500
 You also have to come here at the gates 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.060
 we take a little closer now 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.870
 in the first jump you should press 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.739
 the you can press and to zero 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.720
 15 meters to the track you should 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.100
 drive a little parallel to the blue line 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:40.760
 then in a train the double listing 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.530
 now green wave you press and 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.299
 the next wave in any case too 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.900
 press and hold the button down track 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.530
 to let 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.299
 Gutmann left Opel stays a bit 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.440
 angle to this come short that me 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.060
 also the jump that a bit longer 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.489
 pressed not come to nothing 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.920
 because there is only a small wave on the left 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:02.150
 These can also be pressed to zero 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.500
 it was the tour with 106 127 takes the 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.450
 whole speed in the last flight 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.620
 piece with and we need to press 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.489
 So I did not notice a difference 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.120
 between press rather slower than without 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.450
 to press 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.190
 and we come to the goal jump also the 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.780
 you should stretch them yourself 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.639
 here to drift outward 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.609
 It was a bit too far here 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:27.139
 outside that you take the king kite with you 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.310
 If you are fast enough, you can see 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:33.470
 the tournament 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:36.530
 with 123 prevention is fine that okay 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.120
 It was not more for me now 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.810
 one of the settings you have on 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.209
 seen at the beginning and I wish you then 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.300
 much success in sochi and hope that 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.860
 We are in the next season 4000 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:55.310
 his gives that we will meet again 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:58.340
 until then all good luck in success 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.670
 sochi and a nice simon breuer 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.670
 movie theater
