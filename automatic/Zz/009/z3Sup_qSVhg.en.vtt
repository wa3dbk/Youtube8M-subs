00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
that were made like dragon's lair or

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.950 
that were made like dragon's lair or
space<00:00:39.870> ace<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.860> type<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.219> game<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:42.300> what

space ace that type of game but what
makes<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.350> cool<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.550> sort<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
makes it cool is is that it's sort of a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.049 
makes it cool is is that it's sort of a
holographic<00:00:46.100> image<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.340> pops<00:00:47.550> up<00:00:47.820> and

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
holographic image that pops up and

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.319

you're able to play the game so they

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.900 
you're able to play the game so they
only<00:00:51.449> made<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> few<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.260> these<00:00:52.469> Sega<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.670> think

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
only made a few of these Sega I think

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.819 
only made a few of these Sega I think
two<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.210> them<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:55.140> happens<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.620> one

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
two of them and this happens to be one

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.560 
two of them and this happens to be one
of<00:00:55.980> them<00:00:56.100> time<00:00:56.399> traveller<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.090> there's<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.390> lot

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
of them time traveller and there's a lot

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.599 
of them time traveller and there's a lot
of<00:00:57.690> scenes<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.890> tend<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.399> get

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
of scenes in this you tend to not get

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.360 
of scenes in this you tend to not get
the<00:00:59.789> same<00:01:00.000> game<00:01:00.300> because<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:00.930> go<00:01:01.370> through

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the same game because you can go through

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.039 
the same game because you can go through
different<00:01:02.579> time<00:01:02.879> periods<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.480> add<00:01:03.600> bonus

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
different time periods and add bonus

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.620 
different time periods and add bonus
boards<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.559> pretty<00:01:04.799> elaborate<00:01:05.510> it's<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
boards it's pretty elaborate it's a

you can basically go through time and
vary<00:01:16.680> what's<00:01:17.580> cool<00:01:17.790> about<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.240> game<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.689> is

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
vary what's cool about this game is is

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.080 
vary what's cool about this game is is
it<00:01:19.229> breaks<00:01:19.590> apart<00:01:19.770> into<00:01:20.159> two<00:01:20.250> pieces<00:01:20.909> this

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
it breaks apart into two pieces this

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.910 
it breaks apart into two pieces this
piece<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.720> piece<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.140> top<00:01:22.409> comes<00:01:22.710> off

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
piece and this piece this top comes off

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.280 
piece and this piece this top comes off
so<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> door<00:01:24.420> opening<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.049> let's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
so if you have a door opening of let's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.700 
so if you have a door opening of let's
say<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.590> know<00:01:26.060> 28<00:01:27.060> inches<00:01:27.479> which<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.869> your

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
say you know 28 inches which is your

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.890 
say you know 28 inches which is your
standard<00:01:29.189> or<00:01:29.280> even<00:01:29.549> low<00:01:29.790> lesson<00:01:30.210> standard<00:01:30.570> you

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
standard or even low lesson standard you

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.780 
standard or even low lesson standard you
can<00:01:30.930> get<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.290> down<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.740> your<00:01:31.770> game<00:01:32.070> room<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
can get this down in your game room the

game weighs about 300 pounds but when
you<00:01:35.759> break<00:01:36.000> both<00:01:36.299> pieces<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:37.020> half<00:01:37.259> you're

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
you break both pieces in half you're

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.910 
you break both pieces in half you're
only<00:01:38.009> looking<00:01:38.189> at<00:01:38.430> 150<00:01:39.180> pounds<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.869> don't<00:01:40.650> be

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
only looking at 150 pounds so don't be

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.760 
only looking at 150 pounds so don't be
scared<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.000> size<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> machine<00:01:43.020> its

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
scared of the size of the machine its

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.819 
scared of the size of the machine its
although<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.729> appears<00:01:45.149> very<00:01:45.270> big<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.500> really

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829
