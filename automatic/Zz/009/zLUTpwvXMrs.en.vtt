oh you can see it moving I would say

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.750 
oh you can see it moving I would say

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.060 
18 wall clouds rapidly rotating I cannot
see<00:05:42.350> if<00:05:42.410> there's<00:05:42.560> a<00:05:42.620> tornado<00:05:42.740> on<00:05:42.920> the<00:05:42.980> ground

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
see if there's a tornado on the ground

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.210 
see if there's a tornado on the ground
but<00:05:43.400> this<00:05:43.580> thing<00:05:43.760> is<00:05:43.940> really<00:05:43.970> rotating<00:05:44.810> very

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
but this thing is really rotating very

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.610 
but this thing is really rotating very
very<00:05:46.220> violently<00:05:46.670> I<00:05:46.730> can<00:05:46.910> put<00:05:47.030> it<00:05:47.090> that<00:05:47.120> in<00:05:47.330> okay

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
very violently I can put it that in okay

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.890 
very violently I can put it that in okay
let's<00:05:49.070> head<00:05:49.310> up<00:05:49.430> around<00:05:49.730> this

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
as to look at that rotation it's

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:54.809 
as to look at that rotation it's
tightening<00:06:48.860> up<00:06:49.009> on<00:06:49.130> the<00:06:49.190> backside<00:06:49.370> they're

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:17.820 
see right there let's tighten it up

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.440 
see right there let's tighten it up
right<00:07:18.390> there<00:07:18.690> oh<00:07:18.870> yeah<00:07:19.290> that's<00:07:19.830> a<00:07:19.920> coal<00:07:20.450> right

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:21.450 
right there oh yeah that's a coal right

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:34.900 
right there oh yeah that's a coal right
there

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:34.910 

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.490 

we<00:07:35.910> were<00:07:36.270> like<00:07:36.390> cloud<00:07:36.630> the<00:07:36.840> striations<00:07:37.350> like

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 
we were like cloud the striations like

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.840 
we were like cloud the striations like
right<00:07:37.850> about<00:07:38.850> the<00:07:39.030> bar

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:39.850 
right about the bar

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.330 
right about the bar
it<00:07:40.270> started<00:07:40.660> and<00:07:40.750> slowly<00:07:40.960> so<00:07:41.290> it's<00:07:41.890> all<00:07:42.010> moving

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:42.340 
it started and slowly so it's all moving

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.770 
it started and slowly so it's all moving
that<00:07:42.430> with

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:43.780 
that with

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.320 
that with
let<00:07:44.320> me<00:07:44.410> if<00:07:44.770> ik<00:07:44.950> rotates<00:07:45.910> even<00:07:46.120> further

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:46.330 
let me if ik rotates even further

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.910 
let me if ik rotates even further
underneath<00:07:46.840> there<00:07:47.170> you<00:07:47.290> might<00:07:47.440> see<00:07:47.620> a<00:07:47.650> tornado

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:47.920 
underneath there you might see a tornado

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.080 
underneath there you might see a tornado
on<00:07:48.490> the<00:07:48.550> ground<00:07:49.410> but<00:07:50.670> yeah<00:07:51.670> we<00:07:51.760> saw<00:07:51.910> a<00:07:51.940> couple

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.090 
on the ground but yeah we saw a couple

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.330 
on the ground but yeah we saw a couple
just<00:07:52.660> actual<00:07:53.020> same<00:07:53.200> storm<00:07:53.560> for<00:07:53.890> the<00:07:53.950> north<00:07:54.190> we

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:54.340 
just actual same storm for the north we

00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:01.290 
just actual same storm for the north we
saw<00:07:54.490> it<00:07:54.570> oh<00:07:55.980> yeah<00:07:57.600> so<00:07:59.250> look<00:08:00.250> at<00:08:00.520> that<00:08:00.850> whole

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:01.300 
saw it oh yeah so look at that whole

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.010 
saw it oh yeah so look at that whole
corkscrew<00:08:02.290> of<00:08:02.470> an<00:08:02.560> updraft<00:08:03.600> it's<00:08:04.600> just<00:08:04.720> all<00:08:04.840> up

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:05.020 
corkscrew of an updraft it's just all up

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.320 
corkscrew of an updraft it's just all up
too<00:08:05.170> if<00:08:05.290> it's<00:08:05.470> all<00:08:05.560> updraft

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:07.330 
too if it's all updraft

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.389 
too if it's all updraft
you
