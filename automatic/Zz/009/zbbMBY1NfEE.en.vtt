processor<00:01:42.509> you'll<00:01:43.439> find<00:01:43.710> these<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:44.069> you<00:01:44.399> know

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
processor you'll find these on you know

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.330 
processor you'll find these on you know
Chinese<00:01:45.030> stereos<00:01:45.539> there<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.170> go

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
Chinese stereos there you go

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.849 
Chinese stereos there you go
if<00:01:47.999> I<00:01:48.119> remember<00:01:48.389> correctly<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.049> I

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
if I remember correctly this is I

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.699 
if I remember correctly this is I
squared<00:01:50.369> C<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.329> must<00:01:51.600> mean<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.469> guy

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
squared C so this must mean this guy

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:54.319 
squared C so this must mean this guy
over<00:01:52.859> here<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.249> the<00:01:53.700> microcontroller

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
over here is the microcontroller

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.959 
over here is the microcontroller
controlling<00:01:55.109> the<00:01:55.259> input<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:56.039> can<00:01:56.069> also<00:01:56.490> see<00:01:56.939> a

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
controlling the input you can also see a

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.309 
controlling the input you can also see a
lot<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.179> traces<00:01:57.569> going<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.200> that's

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
lot of traces going to that so that's

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.010 
lot of traces going to that so that's
probably<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.770> main<00:01:59.280> brains<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.020> outfit

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
probably the main brains of this outfit

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.989 
probably the main brains of this outfit
and<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:03.630> ok<00:02:04.560> two<00:02:04.829> important<00:02:05.189> things<00:02:05.249> we<00:02:05.789> know

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:05.999 
and so ok two important things we know

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:08.749 
and so ok two important things we know
we<00:02:06.179> have<00:02:06.359> an<00:02:06.509> out<00:02:06.689> simple<00:02:07.170> here<00:02:07.610> we<00:02:08.610> can

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
we have an out simple here we can

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.910 
we have an out simple here we can
probably<00:02:08.940> find<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.479> through<00:02:10.289> here<00:02:10.590> since

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
probably find that through here since

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.970 
probably find that through here since
the<00:02:11.130> face<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:11.760> on<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.120> faceplate<00:02:12.980> so

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
the face it's on the faceplate so

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.250 
the face it's on the faceplate so
probably<00:02:14.340> tell<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.640> faceplate<00:02:15.060> comes<00:02:15.990> out

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
probably tell the faceplate comes out

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.770 
probably tell the faceplate comes out
like<00:02:16.830> that

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
like that

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.470 
like that
so<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:19.560> connector<00:02:20.010> here<00:02:20.250> must<00:02:20.580> have<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:21.090> way

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
so this connector here must have a way

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.380 
so this connector here must have a way
to<00:02:21.950> hook<00:02:22.950> up<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.490> outs<00:02:23.760> here<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.270> we'll

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
to hook up to the outs here so we'll

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.640 
to hook up to the outs here so we'll
need<00:02:24.599> to<00:02:24.780> figure<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.260> out

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
need to figure that out

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.920 
need to figure that out
a<00:02:25.970> little<00:02:26.970> Mike<00:02:28.069> multimeter<00:02:29.069> action<00:02:29.610> there

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
a little Mike multimeter action there

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.500 
a little Mike multimeter action there
should<00:02:30.930> tell<00:02:31.140> us<00:02:31.170> what<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.739> ikonn<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.579> we<00:02:33.360> also

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
should tell us what to ikonn to we also

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.009 
should tell us what to ikonn to we also
know<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.780> this<00:02:34.230> USB<00:02:35.099> has<00:02:35.340> or<00:02:36.120> should<00:02:36.360> have<00:02:36.540> at

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
know that this USB has or should have at

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.039 
know that this USB has or should have at
least<00:02:37.049> 5<00:02:37.409> volts<00:02:37.939> which<00:02:38.939> means<00:02:39.209> one<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.840> these

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
least 5 volts which means one of these

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.649 
least 5 volts which means one of these
guys<00:02:40.500> here<00:02:40.860> has<00:02:41.099> five<00:02:41.489> bolts<00:02:41.760> we<00:02:42.299> can<00:02:42.480> probably

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
guys here has five bolts we can probably

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.839 
guys here has five bolts we can probably
trace<00:02:43.019> that<00:02:43.290> down<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.890> regulator<00:02:44.489> which

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
trace that down to the regulator which

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.369 
trace that down to the regulator which
I'm<00:02:45.030> guessing<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.450> either<00:02:45.599> this<00:02:45.930> guy<00:02:46.140> or<00:02:46.170> this

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
I'm guessing is either this guy or this

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.960 
I'm guessing is either this guy or this
guy<00:02:47.069> here<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.900> what<00:02:48.900> else<00:02:49.099> I<00:02:50.099> think<00:02:50.670> that's

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
guy here and what else I think that's

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.339 
guy here and what else I think that's
pretty<00:02:51.060> much<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.689> actually<00:02:52.019> get<00:02:52.170> this

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
pretty much it to actually get this

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.259 
pretty much it to actually get this
working<00:02:52.560> we<00:02:52.799> will<00:02:53.129> just<00:02:53.400> need<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.790> get<00:02:54.180> the

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
working we will just need to get the

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.110 
working we will just need to get the
ground<00:02:54.540> which<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:55.230> all<00:02:55.409> over<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.709> place<00:02:56.120> get

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
ground which it's all over the place get

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.119 
ground which it's all over the place get
the<00:02:57.329> five<00:02:57.599> bolts<00:02:57.840> from<00:02:58.109> someplace<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.920> we

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
the five bolts from someplace and we

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.509 
the five bolts from someplace and we
just<00:02:59.370> want<00:02:59.549> a<00:02:59.609> little<00:02:59.909> guy<00:03:00.750> from<00:03:00.989> here<00:03:01.519> and

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
just want a little guy from here and

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.500 
just want a little guy from here and
we'll<00:03:03.209> need<00:03:03.389> to<00:03:03.569> hook<00:03:03.780> into<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.409> audio<00:03:05.510> either

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
we'll need to hook into the audio either

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.349 
we'll need to hook into the audio either
input<00:03:06.780> um<00:03:07.280> I've<00:03:08.280> already<00:03:08.519> asked<00:03:09.060> they<00:03:09.150> don't

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
input um I've already asked they don't

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.059 
input um I've already asked they don't
really<00:03:09.629> use<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.959> Aksum<00:03:10.349> probably<00:03:10.859> going<00:03:11.010> to

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
really use the Aksum probably going to

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.960 
really use the Aksum probably going to
hook<00:03:11.129> into<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.519> probably<00:03:14.879> is

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
hook into that so that probably is

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.610 
hook into that so that probably is
either<00:03:15.599> here<00:03:16.260> or<00:03:16.290> somewhere<00:03:17.129> near<00:03:17.430> here

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
either here or somewhere near here

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.960 
either here or somewhere near here
either<00:03:19.620> case<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.159> should<00:03:20.370> be<00:03:20.489> fairly<00:03:20.730> simple

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
either case it should be fairly simple

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.960 
either case it should be fairly simple
so<00:03:21.420> let's<00:03:21.689> open<00:03:22.260> up<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.829> USB<00:03:23.189> dongle<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.790> see

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
so let's open up the USB dongle and see

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:34.550 
so let's open up the USB dongle and see
what's<00:03:24.180> in<00:03:24.359> that<00:03:32.959> right<00:03:33.959> so<00:03:34.139> this<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.319> the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
what's in that right so this is the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.449 
what's in that right so this is the
inside<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.069> the<00:03:35.609> Bluetooth<00:03:36.269> ah<00:03:37.190> little<00:03:38.190> USB

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
inside of the Bluetooth ah little USB

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.220 
inside of the Bluetooth ah little USB
module<00:03:38.669> as<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.180> can<00:03:39.299> see<00:03:39.449> it<00:03:39.599> has<00:03:39.810> nicely

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
module as you can see it has nicely

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.039 
module as you can see it has nicely
labeled<00:03:40.980> pads<00:03:41.370> there<00:03:41.730> we<00:03:41.879> have<00:03:42.030> grounded<00:03:42.449> Phi

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
labeled pads there we have grounded Phi

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.339 
labeled pads there we have grounded Phi
B<00:03:43.260> which<00:03:43.889> means<00:03:44.180> those<00:03:45.180> will<00:03:45.569> be<00:03:45.720> fairly<00:03:46.199> easy

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
B which means those will be fairly easy

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.210 
B which means those will be fairly easy
to<00:03:46.590> solder<00:03:46.949> onto<00:03:47.629> and<00:03:48.629> seems<00:03:49.139> to<00:03:49.290> have<00:03:49.440> Rx<00:03:50.099> and

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
to solder onto and seems to have Rx and

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.119 
to solder onto and seems to have Rx and
TX<00:03:50.310> which<00:03:50.870> are<00:03:51.870> probably<00:03:52.409> part<00:03:52.799> of<00:03:52.919> the

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
TX which are probably part of the

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.569 
TX which are probably part of the
Bluetooth<00:03:53.819> bit<00:03:54.299> here<00:03:54.739> which<00:03:55.739> you<00:03:56.250> know<00:03:56.340> might

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
Bluetooth bit here which you know might

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.219 
Bluetooth bit here which you know might
be<00:03:56.639> interesting<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.269> see<00:03:57.419> what<00:03:57.629> what<00:03:57.900> we<00:03:58.019> get

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.229 
be interesting to see what what we get

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.159 
be interesting to see what what we get
from<00:03:58.409> that<00:03:59.209> over<00:04:00.209> here<00:04:00.389> we<00:04:00.510> have<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.870> little

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
from that over here we have the little

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:02.659 
from that over here we have the little
Bluetooth<00:04:01.349> antenna<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:02.099> you<00:04:02.220> can<00:04:02.400> probably

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
Bluetooth antenna and you can probably

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.030

tell<00:04:02.819> this<00:04:03.180> thing<00:04:03.419> is<00:04:03.540> come<00:04:03.989> little<00:04:04.650> bit<00:04:04.769> dirty

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
tell this thing is come little bit dirty

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.580 
tell this thing is come little bit dirty
you<00:04:05.970> can<00:04:06.060> even<00:04:06.239> kind<00:04:06.840> of<00:04:06.989> tell<00:04:07.169> somebody's

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.760 
a few wires to this a solder a couple of
wires<00:04:27.449> to<00:04:27.659> this<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.050> we<00:04:28.169> can<00:04:28.320> hook<00:04:28.530> that<00:04:28.710> up

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
wires to this and we can hook that up

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.520 
wires to this and we can hook that up
into<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.310> stereo<00:04:29.729> and<00:04:30.050> Bob's<00:04:31.050> your<00:04:31.139> uncle

into the stereo and Bob's your uncle

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:51.839 
into the stereo and Bob's your uncle
that<00:04:31.740> should<00:04:31.919> be<00:04:32.039> it

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.670 

as<00:04:52.060> you<00:04:52.210> can<00:04:52.360> see<00:04:52.449> I<00:04:52.479> put<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:52.960> little<00:04:53.110> dot<00:04:53.410> symbol

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
as you can see I put a little dot symbol

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.659 
as you can see I put a little dot symbol
here<00:04:54.009> on<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.849> board<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:55.630> on<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:56.669> connector

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
here on the board and on the connector

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.439 
here on the board and on the connector
here<00:04:57.819> so<00:04:58.419> this<00:04:58.720> pad<00:04:59.110> will<00:04:59.470> need<00:04:59.650> to<00:04:59.800> be<00:05:00.449> wired

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
here so this pad will need to be wired

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.110 
here so this pad will need to be wired

will<00:05:04.360> need<00:05:04.569> to<00:05:04.690> be<00:05:04.780> wired<00:05:05.110> on<00:05:05.349> to<00:05:05.500> this<00:05:05.620> pad

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
will need to be wired on to this pad

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.550 
will need to be wired on to this pad
over<00:05:06.039> here<00:05:06.250> assets<00:05:07.150> little<00:05:07.509> dot<00:05:07.720> dot<00:05:07.990> dash

dash<00:05:08.889> that's<00:05:09.280> basically<00:05:09.849> it<00:05:10.120> I<00:05:10.150> also<00:05:10.599> found

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
dash that's basically it I also found

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.060 
dash that's basically it I also found
the<00:05:11.979> ground<00:05:12.310> and<00:05:12.639> it<00:05:13.509> goes<00:05:13.690> from<00:05:13.810> here<00:05:14.139> to<00:05:14.590> here

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
the ground and it goes from here to here

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.980 
the ground and it goes from here to here
to<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:15.370> connector<00:05:15.729> you<00:05:15.759> can<00:05:15.849> see<00:05:16.270> it<00:05:16.419> made<00:05:16.780> me

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
to the connector you can see it made me

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.200 
to the connector you can see it made me
again<00:05:17.320> here<00:05:17.680> on<00:05:18.340> DL<00:05:19.090> left<00:05:19.330> and<00:05:19.860> I<00:05:20.860> might<00:05:21.849> still

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
again here on DL left and I might still

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.719 
again here on DL left and I might still
well<00:05:22.660> I'm<00:05:22.840> sure<00:05:23.380> these<00:05:23.560> tours<00:05:24.039> are<00:05:24.070> still

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
well I'm sure these tours are still

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.149 
well I'm sure these tours are still
fairly<00:05:25.090> connected<00:05:25.570> so<00:05:25.720> either<00:05:26.080> hook<00:05:26.949> the

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
fairly connected so either hook the

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.460 
fairly connected so either hook the
ground<00:05:27.400> straight<00:05:27.789> to<00:05:27.940> this<00:05:28.120> or<00:05:28.389> I'll<00:05:28.750> see

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
ground straight to this or I'll see

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.790 
ground straight to this or I'll see
whichever<00:05:30.130> makes<00:05:30.400> less<00:05:30.699> noise<00:05:30.729> in<00:05:31.210> the<00:05:31.690> end<00:05:31.840> we

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
whichever makes less noise in the end we

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.430 
whichever makes less noise in the end we
just<00:05:32.979> need<00:05:33.159> to<00:05:33.250> figure<00:05:33.370> out<00:05:33.490> which<00:05:34.440> regulator

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
just need to figure out which regulator

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.350 
just need to figure out which regulator
where<00:05:35.710> they<00:05:35.830> actually<00:05:36.130> gives<00:05:36.520> us<00:05:36.699> five<00:05:37.060> bolts

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
where they actually gives us five bolts

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.430 
where they actually gives us five bolts
we<00:05:37.750> can<00:05:37.930> either<00:05:38.110> do<00:05:38.620> that<00:05:38.650> by<00:05:38.830> powering<00:05:39.340> the

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
we can either do that by powering the

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.350 
we can either do that by powering the
stereo<00:05:41.440> here<00:05:41.710> or<00:05:41.919> we<00:05:42.159> can<00:05:42.190> just<00:05:42.580> try<00:05:42.789> and<00:05:42.849> trace

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
stereo here or we can just try and trace

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.300 
stereo here or we can just try and trace
back<00:05:43.599> the<00:05:43.630> USB<00:05:44.229> connector<00:05:44.590> which<00:05:44.860> is<00:05:45.039> probably

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
back the USB connector which is probably

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.430 
back the USB connector which is probably
what<00:05:45.460> I'm<00:05:45.550> going<00:05:45.699> to<00:05:45.729> do<00:05:45.880> since<00:05:46.810> I<00:05:46.960> have<00:05:47.139> no

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
what I'm going to do since I have no

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:59.490 
what I'm going to do since I have no
extra<00:05:48.009> USB<00:05:48.389> so<00:05:49.530> harnesses<00:05:50.530> laying<00:05:51.039> around<00:05:58.500> so

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
extra USB so harnesses laying around so

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.589 
extra USB so harnesses laying around so
we<00:05:59.620> figured<00:06:00.009> out<00:06:00.099> that<00:06:00.159> this<00:06:00.520> guy<00:06:00.789> here<00:06:01.150> is<00:06:01.180> the

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
we figured out that this guy here is the

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:03.270 
we figured out that this guy here is the
one<00:06:01.810> that's<00:06:01.960> supplying<00:06:02.440> the<00:06:02.620> five<00:06:02.800> bolts<00:06:03.039> to

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
one that's supplying the five bolts to

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.689 
one that's supplying the five bolts to
the<00:06:03.310> usb<00:06:03.849> so<00:06:04.300> we<00:06:04.449> can<00:06:04.630> use<00:06:04.810> this<00:06:05.080> guy<00:06:05.380> here<00:06:05.830> to

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
the usb so we can use this guy here to

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.740 
the usb so we can use this guy here to
power<00:06:06.909> our<00:06:07.300> little<00:06:07.630> module<00:06:08.969> so<00:06:09.969> I<00:06:10.000> guess<00:06:10.630> the

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
power our little module so I guess the

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.450 
power our little module so I guess the
next<00:06:10.930> step<00:06:11.050> would<00:06:11.320> be<00:06:11.380> to<00:06:11.530> actually<00:06:11.800> solder

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
next step would be to actually solder

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.629 
next step would be to actually solder
some<00:06:13.000> wires<00:06:13.449> here<00:06:13.900> and<00:06:14.050> on<00:06:14.800> the<00:06:15.159> pads<00:06:15.550> over

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
some wires here and on the pads over

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.760 
some wires here and on the pads over
here<00:06:15.940> over<00:06:16.120> to<00:06:16.389> the<00:06:16.449> module<00:06:16.840> and<00:06:16.960> isolate<00:06:17.620> the

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
here over to the module and isolate the

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.950 
here over to the module and isolate the
module<00:06:18.099> so<00:06:18.219> it<00:06:18.340> won't<00:06:18.550> short<00:06:18.789> out<00:06:18.940> and<00:06:19.240> we

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
module so it won't short out and we

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.230 
module so it won't short out and we
should<00:06:20.169> be<00:06:20.320> done<00:06:20.469> there<00:06:21.099> it<00:06:21.280> is<00:06:21.430> it's<00:06:21.699> far<00:06:22.030> from

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
should be done there it is it's far from

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.920 
should be done there it is it's far from
pretty<00:06:22.599> but<00:06:22.930> it's<00:06:23.080> a<00:06:23.229> it<00:06:23.740> should<00:06:24.130> work<00:06:24.400> fine<00:06:24.930> in

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
pretty but it's a it should work fine in

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.409 
pretty but it's a it should work fine in
any<00:06:26.139> case<00:06:26.380> I'm<00:06:26.560> going<00:06:26.710> to<00:06:26.909> shrink<00:06:27.909> wrap<00:06:28.180> this

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
any case I'm going to shrink wrap this

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:29.070 
any case I'm going to shrink wrap this
baby<00:06:28.750> up

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
and we can go and try it on the car what

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.670 
and we can go and try it on the car what
happens<00:06:33.780> alright<00:06:34.780> let's<00:06:35.020> see<00:06:35.139> if<00:06:35.169> it<00:06:35.289> works

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
happens alright let's see if it works
