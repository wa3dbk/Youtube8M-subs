00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
other selling point to it is it's a

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.290 
other selling point to it is it's a
self-cleaning<00:03:00.680> chain<00:03:01.040> lubricant<00:03:01.520> so<00:03:02.120> what

self-cleaning chain lubricant so what

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.470 
self-cleaning chain lubricant so what
happens<00:03:02.720> is<00:03:02.959> it's<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:04.010> patented<00:03:04.610> wax<00:03:04.820> formula

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
happens is it's a patented wax formula

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.270 
happens is it's a patented wax formula
that<00:03:05.900> actually<00:03:06.260> adheres<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.920> dirt<00:03:07.130> that

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
and then flake off so that's why you

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.840 
and then flake off so that's why you
have<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:17.800> again<00:03:18.800> put<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.190> cleanliness<00:03:19.400> that
