also the nail polishes that i picked

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.919

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.840 
maybe that explains the crazy metallic
sweat<00:00:33.660> shirt<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.200> I'm<00:00:34.350> wearing<00:00:34.550> but<00:00:35.550> anyways

color and this is by OPI and this is in
the<00:00:46.260> color<00:00:46.440> glitz<00:00:47.430> Earl<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.570> I'll<00:00:48.809> let<00:00:48.960> you

the color glitz Earl and so I'll let you

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.299 
the color glitz Earl and so I'll let you
get<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> better<00:00:49.590> look<00:00:49.980> at<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:52.039> and<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.100> can

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
get a better look at that and you can

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.569 
get a better look at that and you can
get<00:00:53.430> OPI<00:00:53.840> from<00:00:54.840> Ulta<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.770> where<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:55.980> normally<00:00:56.129> by

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
get OPI from Ulta is where I normally by

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.080 
get OPI from Ulta is where I normally by
OPI<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.859> sephora<00:00:58.859> actually<00:00:59.340> has<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> four<00:00:59.910> by

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
OPI and sephora actually has a four by

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.110 
OPI and sephora actually has a four by
OPI<00:01:00.390> which<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.289> OPI<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
OPI which is OPI but it's like the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.240 
OPI which is OPI but it's like the
Sephora<00:01:03.570> brand<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.229> OPI<00:01:04.500> if<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.860> makes<00:01:05.070> sense

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
Sephora brand of OPI if that makes sense

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.940 
Sephora brand of OPI if that makes sense
so<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.570> OPI<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
so this is just OPI and this is in the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.070 
so this is just OPI and this is in the
color<00:01:08.070> glitz<00:01:08.490> Earl<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.880> now<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.780> takes

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
color glitz Earl and now this takes

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.130 
color glitz Earl and now this takes
about<00:01:10.500> two<00:01:11.010> coats<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.549> be<00:01:11.670> opaque<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.360> it's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
about two coats to be opaque and it's

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.750 
about two coats to be opaque and it's
actually<00:01:13.500> pretty<00:01:13.710> easy<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.220> remove<00:01:14.490> even

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
actually pretty easy to remove even

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.070 
actually pretty easy to remove even
though<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.180> kind<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.810> glitter

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
though it is kind of like a glitter

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.410 
though it is kind of like a glitter
polish<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.520> really<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.180> think

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
polish and I really like this I think

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.020 
polish and I really like this I think
gold<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.350> nice<00:01:19.830> kind<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.189> neutral<00:01:20.490> but

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
gold is just a nice kind of neutral but

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.910 
gold is just a nice kind of neutral but
a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.390> bit<00:01:21.509> glitzy<00:01:21.900> color<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.740> full

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
a little bit glitzy color for the full

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.920 
a little bit glitzy color for the full
time<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.729> when<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.210> your<00:01:24.330> nails<00:01:24.600> it

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
time so when it's on your nails it

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.230 
time so when it's on your nails it
doesn't<00:01:25.320> look<00:01:25.500> like<00:01:25.950> much<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.850> then<00:01:27.030> if

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
doesn't look like much but then if

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.490 
doesn't look like much but then if
you're<00:01:27.390> wearing<00:01:27.540> kind<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.930> an<00:01:28.049> old<00:01:28.200> dark

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
you're wearing kind of an old dark

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.140 
you're wearing kind of an old dark
outfit<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.070> kind<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.490> adds<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.909> little<00:01:30.000> bit

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
outfit it kind of just adds a little bit

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.420 
outfit it kind of just adds a little bit
like<00:01:30.960> something<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.770> i<00:01:31.799> hope<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.070> kind<00:01:32.369> of

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
like something so i hope that kind of

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.520 
like something so i hope that kind of
makes<00:01:32.610> sense<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.720> next<00:01:33.930> color<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.500> a

green and then in some ways it looks
purple<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:16.880> then<00:03:17.390> in<00:03:17.660> some<00:03:17.900> lights<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.410> has

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
purple and then in some lights it has

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.890 
purple and then in some lights it has
like<00:03:18.830> some<00:03:19.040> really<00:03:19.370> pretty<00:03:19.549> gold<00:03:19.970> reflex<00:03:20.630> and

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
like some really pretty gold reflex and

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.840 
like some really pretty gold reflex and
it's<00:03:21.049> just<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.320> really<00:03:21.560> unique<00:03:21.850> interesting

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.330 
it's just a really unique interesting
color<00:03:23.090> again<00:03:23.780> though<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.140> is<00:03:24.290> subtle<00:03:24.620> so<00:03:25.100> it

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
color again though it is subtle so it

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.130 
color again though it is subtle so it
looks<00:03:25.370> pretty<00:03:26.030> subtle<00:03:26.360> on<00:03:26.570> your<00:03:26.690> nails<00:03:26.870> but

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
looks pretty subtle on your nails but

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.449 
looks pretty subtle on your nails but
then<00:03:27.260> when<00:03:27.380> it<00:03:27.470> catches<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.950> light<00:03:28.100> it<00:03:28.430> gives

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
then when it catches the light it gives

the most part all of their colors um are

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.640 
the most part all of their colors um are
pretty<00:03:50.180> bright<00:03:50.600> and<00:03:50.900> don't<00:03:51.110> take<00:03:51.320> a<00:03:51.350> ton<00:03:51.620> of

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650

like<00:03:51.980> maintenance<00:03:52.310> to<00:03:52.700> use<00:03:52.970> so<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.570> definitely

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
like maintenance to use so I definitely

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.280 
like maintenance to use so I definitely
just<00:03:54.500> prefer<00:03:55.160> OPI<00:03:55.580> nail<00:03:55.850> polishes<00:03:56.390> but<00:03:57.200> again

just prefer OPI nail polishes but again

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.630 
just prefer OPI nail polishes but again
I<00:03:57.680> just<00:03:57.890> think<00:03:58.040> this<00:03:58.160> is<00:03:58.310> something<00:03:58.489> different

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
I just think this is something different

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.420 
I just think this is something different
for<00:03:59.209> full<00:03:59.450> I<00:03:59.660> personally<00:04:00.230> love<00:04:00.680> dark<00:04:01.100> blues

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
for full I personally love dark blues

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.699 
for full I personally love dark blues
and<00:04:01.820> I<00:04:02.570> like<00:04:02.930> them<00:04:03.110> pretty<00:04:03.350> much<00:04:03.470> year-round

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
and I like them pretty much year-round

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.680 
and I like them pretty much year-round
but<00:04:04.130> especially<00:04:04.340> for<00:04:04.640> fall<00:04:04.970> I<00:04:05.000> think<00:04:05.330> a<00:04:05.420> dark

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
but especially for fall I think a dark

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.810 
but especially for fall I think a dark
blue<00:04:05.900> is<00:04:06.140> more<00:04:06.620> appropriate<00:04:07.160> obviously<00:04:07.670> than

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
blue is more appropriate obviously than

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.030 
blue is more appropriate obviously than
a<00:04:07.910> lighter<00:04:08.150> blue<00:04:08.420> and<00:04:08.660> I<00:04:09.290> tend<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.709> wear<00:04:09.799> a<00:04:09.860> lot

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
a lighter blue and I tend to wear a lot

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.560 
a lighter blue and I tend to wear a lot
of<00:04:10.070> black<00:04:10.340> and<00:04:10.670> gray<00:04:10.880> when<00:04:11.150> it<00:04:11.269> starts

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
of black and gray when it starts

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.509 
of black and gray when it starts
becoming<00:04:11.690> fall<00:04:12.140> and<00:04:12.380> i<00:04:12.650> think<00:04:12.950> this<00:04:13.070> bright

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
becoming fall and i think this bright

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.449 
becoming fall and i think this bright
blue<00:04:13.850> just<00:04:14.090> really<00:04:14.360> contrasts<00:04:15.110> with<00:04:15.590> black

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
blue just really contrasts with black

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.099 
blue just really contrasts with black
and<00:04:16.910> kind<00:04:17.120> of<00:04:17.180> gray<00:04:17.450> and<00:04:17.510> just<00:04:17.840> looks<00:04:18.019> like

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
and kind of gray and just looks like

this<00:04:21.169> blue<00:04:21.410> color<00:04:21.650> and<00:04:21.859> this<00:04:22.190> new<00:04:22.970> poll

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
this blue color and this new poll

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.390 
this blue color and this new poll
only<00:04:23.599> requires<00:04:23.900> one<00:04:24.020> coat<00:04:24.409> to<00:04:24.830> be<00:04:24.949> really<00:04:25.250> nice
