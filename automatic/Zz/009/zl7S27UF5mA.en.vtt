00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.380 
the second area of the New Orleans map
and<00:00:16.619> it's<00:00:16.949> worth<00:00:17.100> 30<00:00:17.279> G<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:18.529> double<00:00:19.529> take<00:00:19.680> down

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
and it's worth 30 G so double take down

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.460 
and it's worth 30 G so double take down
it's<00:00:21.390> probably<00:00:21.660> worth<00:00:21.779> mentioning<00:00:21.810> for<00:00:22.320> what

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
it's probably worth mentioning for what

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.170 
it's probably worth mentioning for what
we<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.010> do<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> treatment<00:00:23.699> which<00:00:23.939> is

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
we have to do to the treatment which is

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.080 
we have to do to the treatment which is
take<00:00:24.900> down<00:00:25.140> everyone<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.189> level<00:00:26.670> without

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
take down everyone in this level without

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.310 
take down everyone in this level without
alerting<00:00:27.720> anyone

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
alerting anyone

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.870 
alerting anyone
which<00:00:28.529> means<00:00:28.800> no<00:00:29.010> elasto<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.730> to

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
which means no elasto you have to

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.460 
which means no elasto you have to
unrealistic<00:00:30.359> difficulties<00:00:30.960> well<00:00:31.170> that's

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
unrealistic difficulties well that's

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.870 
unrealistic difficulties well that's
like<00:00:31.619> okay<00:00:31.890> that's<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.460> kick<00:00:34.190> so<00:00:35.190> yeah<00:00:35.430> it

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
like okay that's the kick so yeah it

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.080 
like okay that's the kick so yeah it
pays<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.300> actually<00:00:37.290> split<00:00:37.649> up<00:00:37.739> we<00:00:38.700> tried<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.059> a

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
pays to actually split up we tried it a

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.780 
pays to actually split up we tried it a
couple<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.540> times<00:00:39.809> doing<00:00:40.469> different<00:00:41.280> ways<00:00:41.430> and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
couple of times doing different ways and

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.590 
couple of times doing different ways and
it<00:00:42.570> depends<00:00:43.050> how<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.230> level<00:00:44.149> bounced<00:00:45.149> out

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
it depends how the level bounced out

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.510 
it depends how the level bounced out
yeah<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:45.989> uh<00:00:46.170> if<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.800> played<00:00:47.070> -<00:00:47.370> uh

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
yeah because uh if you played - uh

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.680 
yeah because uh if you played - uh
conviction<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:47.969> any<00:00:48.120> amount<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.390> time<00:00:48.539> you'll

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
conviction for any amount of time you'll

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.889 
conviction for any amount of time you'll
probably<00:00:48.899> realize<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.829> changes<00:00:50.460> any<00:00:51.390> number

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
probably realize it changes any number

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.450 
probably realize it changes any number
of<00:00:52.020> times<00:00:54.170> once<00:00:55.170> again<00:00:55.800> if<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.190> watch<00:00:56.309> our

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
of times once again if you watch our

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.990 
of times once again if you watch our
previous<00:00:56.820> one<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.480> worth<00:00:58.260> marking<00:00:59.160> every<00:00:59.699> one

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
previous one is worth marking every one

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.849 
previous one is worth marking every one
that<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.570> see<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.320> know<00:01:01.410> where

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
that you can see just so you know where

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.619 
that you can see just so you know where
they<00:01:01.980> are<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.760> makes<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.030> lot<00:01:03.180> easier<00:01:03.239> to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
they are and it makes a lot easier to

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.070 
they are and it makes a lot easier to
kill

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
kill

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.520

people in this and just mark even makes

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.030 
people in this and just mark even makes
a<00:01:09.240> lot<00:01:09.510> easier<00:01:09.540> that's<00:01:10.110> not<00:01:10.350> relevant<00:01:10.530> seeing

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
a lot easier that's not relevant seeing

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.440 
a lot easier that's not relevant seeing
as<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.549> hand-to-hand<00:01:11.760> kill<00:01:12.150> everyone

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.800 
that um just another tip once he once
you<00:01:50.130> start<00:01:50.369> off<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.670> level<00:01:50.880> we're<00:01:51.689> never

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
you start off this level we're never

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.100 
you start off this level we're never
used<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.439> not<00:01:52.619> deliberately<00:01:53.899> look<00:01:54.899> all

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
used to so not deliberately look all

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.550 
used to so not deliberately look all
around<00:01:55.500> because<00:01:56.270> this<00:01:57.270> level<00:01:57.630> has<00:01:58.079> loads<00:01:58.409> of

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
around because this level has loads of

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.679 
around because this level has loads of
different<00:01:59.040> levels<00:01:59.460> on<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.790> if<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.329> supported

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
different levels on it if you supported

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.539 
different levels on it if you supported
me<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:01.020> different<00:02:01.560> heights<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.100> they<00:02:02.340> can

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
me to different heights and they can

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.800 
me to different heights and they can
easily<00:02:02.700> get<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> drop<00:02:03.270> when<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.540> click<00:02:03.780> that

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
easily get the drop when you click that

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.270 
easily get the drop when you click that

yeah at when he actually got this one
this<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:04.440> capturing<00:03:04.950> session<00:03:05.459> was<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.610> little

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
this is capturing session was a little

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.640 
this is capturing session was a little
more<00:03:06.000> embarrassing<00:03:06.690> but<00:03:06.870> do<00:03:07.050> we<00:03:07.110> go<00:03:07.230> fast<00:03:07.500> man

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
more embarrassing but do we go fast man

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.259 
more embarrassing but do we go fast man
I<00:03:07.739> think<00:03:07.920> intense<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.850> word<00:03:09.000> not

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
I think intense is the word not

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.559 
I think intense is the word not
embarrassing<00:03:10.730> but<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:11.790> guess<00:03:12.000> it's<00:03:12.180> debatable

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
embarrassing but I guess it's debatable

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.259 
embarrassing but I guess it's debatable
and<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:13.400> stopped<00:03:14.400> up<00:03:14.519> here<00:03:14.550> debate<00:03:14.940> jumping
