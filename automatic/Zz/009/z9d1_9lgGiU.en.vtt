00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.920
 hello guys how are you welcome 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.990
 what this new video is that I bring 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.539
 this application that is an editor 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.880
 pretty good for what would be our 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.160
 photography in this case because I'm going to 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.019
 enter what would be the application this 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.789
 is your interface we have the option of 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.640
 take the picture directly from 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.230
 the camera from this application or 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.730
 direct us to what would be our 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.700
 gallery in this case I will choose what 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.460
 what would this image be like? 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.170
 and here we have the different 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.730
 options and the different effects that 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.830
 we can add to what this would be 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.270
 future that in this case I'm going to try 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:49.070
 the other effect we can try 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.300
 and the truth is that this application me 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.750
 it seems pretty 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.440
 complete here we can go to what 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.300
 would be the study explain here 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.420
 what would this effect be here 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.900
 we can turn we can put it to the side 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.610
 left and put it on this 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.729
 in this way it seems pretty 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.880
 customizable here we can reduce 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.340
 what this effect would be and so on and 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.350
 good to go testing the different effects 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.810
 that the wta is pretty good me between 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.400
 the effects you use is this for 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.000
 here 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.710
 is that the other effect is quite good 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.230
 that I also use is the option of self 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.620
 and that is one time I also like 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.350
 a lot and good this is the criticism that 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.880
 good as you can see the truth is that 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.470
 it is quite good another of the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.350
 functions that we can also add what 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.870
 that would be different stickers as they can 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.350
 see here 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.940
 and well we have here some variety like 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.110
 can see 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.610
 we have the option to add what would be 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:06.410
 I detest here we are going to add a text 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.410
 pretty fast, let's put 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.480
 this 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.470
 we can change what would be the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.769
 different the different types of 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:24.470
 extra letters or we can also change 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.470
 the color back that was an irle an effect 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.000
 and in such a way that we can portland and 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.330
 draw as it would be the text here 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.880
 we can enlarge shrink what would be the 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.360
 photography good the truth is that it remains 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.220
 pretty good we're going to accept it and something 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.930
 also that I liked the 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.180
 time to add the text is that we have 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.600
 This option that duplicates 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.390
 the text this way and leave it these 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.650
 forms here 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.480
 we can move it we can erase it and good 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.920
 pretty customizable 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.230
 among the other options we also have 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.110
 the option to add what would be form 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.220
 we can change what the color would be and 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.040
 over here 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.210
 with that transparent effect so that 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.950
 we can play what would be the 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.780
 photography in different colors and 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.880
 the different formal 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.850
 among the options we have is the 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.280
 option d 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.740
 manipulate what would be the day what 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.870
 it would be the contrast the shadows the 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.680
 saturation the warmth because we can already 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.640
 focus 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.109
 we can make a blur effect 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.750
 how can you see that now there is enough 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.670
 all right 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.380
 and another one of the people we have is 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.690
 also add bullets that what he does 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.210
 this darken the corners of what 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.250
 it would be our photography and good too 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.950
 we have the option to add what would be 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.410
 in these white parts what would be the 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.690
 color we can have what they would be 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.670
 also these different backgrounds 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.860
 something else that we can also do is 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.050
 cut out what would be the image of such 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.180
 so we leave it between the 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.490
 different options or in a way 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.580
 free so that we can 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:13.640
 modify the size freely of what 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.000
 it would be the photograph we have the option 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:21.370
 also to rotate what the image would be 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.620
 and put it horizontally and vertically 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.630
 As you can see we have the option of 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.550
 straighten what would be the photograph 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:32.590
 simply moving this part of here 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.610
 the option of this photograph stopped 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:39.969
 chopped we can also modify 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:42.189
 We have the 3d effect as you can see 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:44.019
 and well these different ways that 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:45.489
 you will be able to taste them 

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:47.949
 I want to be pretty long what 

00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:51.489
 it would be the video so that we get what 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:54.519
 it would be the collage so we can 

00:04:51.489 --> 00:04:56.559
 send different photographs and then 

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:59.529
 nothing guys over here we can share the 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:05:01.779
 image we can share life and 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:03.759
