Jarvis will become the vision but it is

quite possible that Jarvis and the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.860 
quite possible that Jarvis and the

vision could be two completely different
entities<00:02:36.319> and<00:02:36.670> Paul<00:02:37.670> Bettany<00:02:37.879> can<00:02:38.180> just<00:02:38.390> do

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
both characters you know one who's doing

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.559 
both characters you know one who's doing
a<00:02:40.430> voice<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.879> one<00:02:41.000> he's<00:02:41.180> doing

the<00:02:42.439> vision<00:02:42.799> but<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:43.069> think<00:02:43.459> it<00:02:43.579> would<00:02:43.730> be<00:02:43.909> more

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
the vision but I think it would be more

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.410 
the vision but I think it would be more
um<00:02:44.749> I<00:02:45.739> think<00:02:46.400> it<00:02:46.459> would<00:02:46.549> be<00:02:46.579> it<00:02:46.909> would<00:02:47.060> make<00:02:47.269> for

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
um I think it would be it would make for

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.470 
um I think it would be it would make for
a<00:02:47.480> better<00:02:47.599> film<00:02:47.930> if<00:02:48.200> they<00:02:48.499> actually<00:02:48.980> make

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
a better film if they actually make

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.300 
a better film if they actually make
Jarvis<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.900> vision<00:02:51.290> right<00:02:51.889> now<00:02:52.040> it's<00:02:52.189> this

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
Jarvis the vision right now it's this

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.339 
Jarvis the vision right now it's this
speculation<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.969> lot<00:02:53.150> of<00:02:53.359> the<00:02:53.629> popular

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
speculation a lot of the popular

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.140 
speculation a lot of the popular
consensus<00:02:54.799> is<00:02:55.159> that<00:02:55.189> Jarvis<00:02:55.700> will<00:02:55.819> become<00:02:56.120> the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
consensus is that Jarvis will become the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.339 
consensus is that Jarvis will become the
vision<00:02:56.480> but<00:02:56.599> we<00:02:56.749> really<00:02:57.019> don't<00:02:57.109> know<00:02:57.319> the

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
vision but we really don't know the

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.899 
vision but we really don't know the
facts<00:02:57.739> there's<00:02:58.310> been<00:02:58.489> no<00:02:58.549> confirmation

facts there's been no confirmation

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.030 
facts there's been no confirmation
they're<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.629> only<00:02:59.750> confirmation<00:03:00.319> we<00:03:00.439> have<00:03:00.680> is

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
they're the only confirmation we have is

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.160 
they're the only confirmation we have is
that<00:03:01.579> we're<00:03:01.760> going<00:03:01.849> to<00:03:01.909> see<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.209> vision<00:03:02.389> now

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
that we're going to see the vision now

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.569 
that we're going to see the vision now
the<00:03:03.230> other<00:03:03.409> thing<00:03:03.709> I'm<00:03:03.980> looking<00:03:04.010> forward<00:03:04.400> to

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
the other thing I'm looking forward to

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.789 
the other thing I'm looking forward to
is<00:03:04.700> his<00:03:04.879> powers<00:03:05.389> we<00:03:05.989> know<00:03:06.139> in<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.319> comic<00:03:06.650> that

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
is his powers we know in the comic that

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.500 
is his powers we know in the comic that
he's<00:03:06.950> got<00:03:07.129> this<00:03:07.280> crystal<00:03:07.819> on<00:03:07.939> his<00:03:08.060> head<00:03:08.269> that

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
he's got this crystal on his head that

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.530 
he's got this crystal on his head that
gets<00:03:09.109> power<00:03:09.379> uh<00:03:09.739> you<00:03:10.700> know<00:03:10.819> through<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.180> Sun

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
gets power uh you know through the Sun

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.089 
gets power uh you know through the Sun
solar<00:03:11.930> energy<00:03:12.349> that's<00:03:12.590> how<00:03:12.739> he<00:03:12.799> keeps

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
solar energy that's how he keeps

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.890 
solar energy that's how he keeps
themselves<00:03:13.549> functioning<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.269> that's<00:03:14.750> how<00:03:14.870> he

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
themselves functioning and that's how he

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.280 
themselves functioning and that's how he
generates<00:03:15.409> power<00:03:15.650> he<00:03:16.400> can<00:03:16.609> shoot<00:03:16.849> beams<00:03:17.290> he

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
generates power he can shoot beams he

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.990 
generates power he can shoot beams he
can<00:03:18.439> utilize<00:03:18.889> the<00:03:19.069> crystal<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:19.549> shoot<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.819> more

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
can utilize the crystal to shoot a more

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.179 
can utilize the crystal to shoot a more
powerful<00:03:20.209> beam<00:03:20.750> but<00:03:21.379> it<00:03:21.500> kind<00:03:21.680> of<00:03:21.739> drains<00:03:22.040> his

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
powerful beam but it kind of drains his

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.099 
powerful beam but it kind of drains his
resources<00:03:22.609> and<00:03:22.879> functioning<00:03:23.510> because<00:03:23.870> he's

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
resources and functioning because he's

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.809 
resources and functioning because he's
an<00:03:24.230> Android<00:03:24.379> he's<00:03:24.709> got<00:03:24.889> synthetic<00:03:25.400> parts<00:03:25.669> and

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
an Android he's got synthetic parts and

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.490 
an Android he's got synthetic parts and
all<00:03:25.909> that<00:03:26.060> stuff<00:03:26.180> but<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:27.139> other<00:03:27.290> thing

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
all that stuff but the other thing

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.229 
all that stuff but the other thing
that's<00:03:27.680> cool<00:03:28.010> about<00:03:28.069> him<00:03:28.430> is<00:03:28.609> that<00:03:28.879> he's<00:03:29.209> got

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
that's cool about him is that he's got

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.619 
that's cool about him is that he's got
this<00:03:29.629> like<00:03:29.900> phase<00:03:30.379> shift<00:03:30.859> where<00:03:31.730> he<00:03:32.449> could

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
this like phase shift where he could

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.199 
this like phase shift where he could
almost<00:03:32.870> have<00:03:33.169> like<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.409> ghostly<00:03:34.010> appearance<00:03:34.209> he

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
almost have like a ghostly appearance he

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.860 
almost have like a ghostly appearance he
can<00:03:35.389> fly<00:03:36.129> he's<00:03:37.129> got<00:03:37.400> incredible<00:03:37.870> strength

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
can fly he's got incredible strength

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.949 
can fly he's got incredible strength
because<00:03:39.560> again<00:03:40.099> this<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.699> power<00:03:40.939> that<00:03:41.780> he

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
because again this the power that he

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.860 
because again this the power that he
gets<00:03:42.230> um<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:43.159> forget<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.269> name<00:03:44.389> of<00:03:44.449> it<00:03:44.689> it

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
gets um I forget the name of it it

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.399 
gets um I forget the name of it it
escapes<00:03:45.439> me<00:03:45.680> but<00:03:45.790> he<00:03:46.790> he<00:03:47.299> can<00:03:47.449> make<00:03:47.689> his<00:03:47.840> armor

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
escapes me but he he can make his armor

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.580 
escapes me but he he can make his armor
harden<00:03:49.069> like<00:03:49.280> like<00:03:49.849> a<00:03:49.879> like<00:03:50.269> diamond<00:03:50.780> so<00:03:51.049> he's

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
harden like like a like diamond so he's

Ultron<00:05:10.160> doesn't<00:05:10.729> have<00:05:10.970> like<00:05:11.930> another<00:05:12.560> villain

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
Ultron doesn't have like another villain

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:14.350 
Ultron doesn't have like another villain
to<00:05:13.160> help<00:05:13.370> him<00:05:13.520> I<00:05:13.610> think<00:05:13.669> he'll<00:05:14.030> have<00:05:14.210> the

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
to help him I think he'll have the

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.140 
to help him I think he'll have the
capability<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.250> maybe<00:05:16.250> fashioning<00:05:16.880> his<00:05:16.970> own

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
capability of maybe fashioning his own

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.379 
capability of maybe fashioning his own
small<00:05:17.599> like<00:05:17.930> robot<00:05:18.349> army<00:05:18.770> but<00:05:19.699> I<00:05:19.910> think<00:05:20.240> he's

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
small like robot army but I think he's

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:21.879 
small like robot army but I think he's
going<00:05:20.569> to<00:05:20.630> display<00:05:20.930> enough<00:05:21.199> power<00:05:21.440> that<00:05:21.740> he's

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
going to display enough power that he's

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.650 
going to display enough power that he's
going<00:05:22.039> to<00:05:22.099> be<00:05:22.190> enough<00:05:22.460> he<00:05:23.090> might<00:05:23.240> be<00:05:23.449> too<00:05:23.630> much

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
going to be enough he might be too much

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.270 
going to be enough he might be too much
to<00:05:23.960> handle<00:05:24.080> for<00:05:24.289> some<00:05:24.590> of<00:05:24.710> them<00:05:24.800> and<00:05:24.979> which<00:05:25.130> is

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
to handle for some of them and which is

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.670 
to handle for some of them and which is
