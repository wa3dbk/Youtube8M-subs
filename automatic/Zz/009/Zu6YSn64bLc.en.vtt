hey<00:00:01.500> guys<00:00:01.650> so<00:00:01.860> I<00:00:01.890> just<00:00:02.100> want<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.370> go<00:00:02.490> over

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
hey guys so I just want to go over

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.960 
hey guys so I just want to go over
ketosis<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.840> little<00:00:04.110> bit<00:00:04.259> for<00:00:04.620> anyone<00:00:05.310> that<00:00:05.520> has

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
ketosis a little bit for anyone that has

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.330 
ketosis a little bit for anyone that has
never<00:00:06.089> heard<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.480> it<00:00:06.629> before<00:00:06.720> or<00:00:07.160> is<00:00:08.160> it

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
never heard of it before or is it

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.580 
never heard of it before or is it
interested<00:00:08.849> in<00:00:08.970> getting<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.690> get<00:00:10.139> getting<00:00:10.469> it

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
interested in getting to get getting it

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.339 
interested in getting to get getting it
to<00:00:10.830> try<00:00:11.099> out<00:00:11.309> ketosis<00:00:11.990> basically<00:00:12.990> where<00:00:13.200> you

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
to try out ketosis basically where you

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.620 
to try out ketosis basically where you
switch<00:00:13.650> over<00:00:13.980> from<00:00:14.099> using<00:00:14.480> carbohydrates<00:00:15.480> as

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
switch over from using carbohydrates as

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.620 
switch over from using carbohydrates as
your<00:00:15.839> primary<00:00:16.109> fuel<00:00:16.560> source<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:17.340> fat<00:00:18.150> as<00:00:18.420> your

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
your primary fuel source to fat as your

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.040 
your primary fuel source to fat as your
primary<00:00:18.810> fuel<00:00:19.260> source<00:00:20.270> your<00:00:21.270> body<00:00:21.660> when<00:00:21.930> you

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
primary fuel source your body when you

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.080 
primary fuel source your body when you
consume<00:00:22.529> carbohydrates<00:00:23.220> gets<00:00:23.760> converted

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
consume carbohydrates gets converted

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.740 
consume carbohydrates gets converted
into<00:00:24.359> blood<00:00:24.720> glucose<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.410> then<00:00:26.359> your<00:00:27.359> organs

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
into blood glucose and then your organs

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.660 
into blood glucose and then your organs
your<00:00:27.900> brain<00:00:28.260> everything<00:00:28.800> runs<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.220> glucose

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
your brain everything runs on glucose

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.540 
your brain everything runs on glucose
when<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.449> go<00:00:30.599> into<00:00:30.750> ketosis<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.740> when

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
when you go into ketosis it's when

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.740 
when you go into ketosis it's when
you've<00:00:32.700> lowered<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.450> amount<00:00:33.660> of

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
you've lowered the amount of

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.110 
you've lowered the amount of
carbohydrates<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.500> eat<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.610> extent

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120

lowers as much as low as 25 grams of
carbohydrates<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.390> given<00:00:42.690> day<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.140> then

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
carbohydrates in a given day and then

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.180 
carbohydrates in a given day and then
your<00:00:44.489> body<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:45.000> using<00:00:45.390> fat<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.620> takes<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
your body is using fat and it takes the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.900 
your body is using fat and it takes the
fat<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.610> converts<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.270> into<00:00:48.360> acetone<00:00:49.050> and

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
fat and converts it into acetone and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.639 
fat and converts it into acetone and
beta<00:00:50.910> hydroxy<00:00:51.390> butyrate<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.170> those<00:00:52.440> are

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
beta hydroxy butyrate and those are

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.750 
beta hydroxy butyrate and those are
ketones<00:00:53.100> which<00:00:54.949> your<00:00:55.949> brain<00:00:56.219> actually

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
ketones which your brain actually

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.420 
ketones which your brain actually
prefers<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.690> run<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.260> many<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.280> your

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
prefers to run on and many of your

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.459 
prefers to run on and many of your
organs<00:00:59.850> actually<00:01:00.210> prefer<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.570> run<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.020> when

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
organs actually prefer to run on so when

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.049 
organs actually prefer to run on so when
you're<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.800> state<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.100> ketosis<00:01:02.399> you'll<00:01:02.760> find

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
you're in a state of ketosis you'll find

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.570 
you're in a state of ketosis you'll find
yourself<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:04.320> heightened<00:01:04.739> performance<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
yourself in a heightened performance and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.880 
yourself in a heightened performance and
mental<00:01:06.270> you'll<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.750> enhanced<00:01:07.560> mental

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
mental you'll have enhanced mental

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.460 
mental you'll have enhanced mental
clarity<00:01:08.310> that's<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.780> main<00:01:09.960> reason<00:01:09.990> why<00:01:10.439> I

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
clarity that's the main reason why I

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.590 
clarity that's the main reason why I
enjoy<00:01:11.070> being<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.400> ketosis<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:12.420> not

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
enjoy being in ketosis it's not

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.020 
enjoy being in ketosis it's not
necessarily<00:01:13.200> completely<00:01:13.530> critical<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.490> fat

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
necessarily completely critical for fat

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.510 
necessarily completely critical for fat
loss<00:01:15.060> although<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.320> does<00:01:16.740> make<00:01:16.770> fat<00:01:17.280> loss

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
loss although it does make fat loss

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.420 
loss although it does make fat loss
quite<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> bit<00:01:18.509> easier<00:01:18.689> because<00:01:19.500> your<00:01:19.920> body<00:01:20.189> is

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
quite a bit easier because your body is

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.120 
quite a bit easier because your body is
that<00:01:20.909> much<00:01:21.090> more<00:01:21.390> inclined<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.439> use<00:01:22.470> fat<00:01:22.890> as<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that much more inclined to use fat as a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.340 
that much more inclined to use fat as a
fuel<00:01:23.430> source<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:24.150> when<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.750> are<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.020> ketosis

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
fuel source so when you are in ketosis

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.410 
fuel source so when you are in ketosis
your<00:01:25.950> body<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.430> then<00:01:26.640> very<00:01:27.540> easily<00:01:27.890> use<00:01:28.890> your

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
your body can then very easily use your

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.289 
your body can then very easily use your
physical<00:01:30.420> body<00:01:30.570> fat<00:01:30.869> stores<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.790> an<00:01:32.790> energy

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
physical body fat stores as an energy

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.990 
physical body fat stores as an energy
source<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.680> make<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.950> conversion<00:01:35.369> that

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
source so can make that conversion that

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.270 
source so can make that conversion that
much<00:01:36.240> easier<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:37.079> opposed<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.250> are

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
much easier as opposed to if you are

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.600 
much easier as opposed to if you are
eating<00:01:38.670> high<00:01:39.299> glycemic<00:01:39.600> index<00:01:40.140> foods<00:01:40.610> like

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
eating high glycemic index foods like

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.480 
eating high glycemic index foods like
high<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:41.909> sugar<00:01:42.299> breads<00:01:43.020> pastas<00:01:43.619> high<00:01:43.829> those

glucose and insulin and you're going to

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.440 
glucose and insulin and you're going to
have<00:01:51.259> periodic<00:01:52.259> energy<00:01:52.820> rises<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:53.970> crashes

throughout the day and that's why

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.160 
throughout the day and that's why
they'll<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.000> periods<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.509> time<00:01:57.689> maybe<00:01:57.930> you're

in the office maybe you're working
somewhere<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.570> get<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> headache<00:02:01.290> or

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.740 
somewhere and you get a headache or
you're<00:02:01.770> tired<00:02:02.070> or<00:02:02.460> you're<00:02:03.180> not<00:02:03.329> thinking

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
you're tired or you're not thinking

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.530 
you're tired or you're not thinking
clearly<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:05.130> that's<00:02:05.579> probably<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.390> it's

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
clearly and that's probably what it's

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.980 
clearly and that's probably what it's
what's<00:02:06.899> causing<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.380> so

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
what's causing that so

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.260 
what's causing that so
when<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.680> are<00:02:09.950> in<00:02:10.130> a<00:02:10.220> state<00:02:10.430> of<00:02:10.520> ketosis<00:02:10.790> that

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
when you are in a state of ketosis that

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.140 
when you are in a state of ketosis that
doesn't<00:02:11.600> happen<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:12.350> have<00:02:12.560> higher<00:02:13.190> amount<00:02:13.970> of

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
doesn't happen you have higher amount of

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.850 
doesn't happen you have higher amount of
energy<00:02:14.300> than<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:14.750> would<00:02:14.960> when<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.260> consume

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
energy than you would when you consume

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.010 
energy than you would when you consume
carbohydrates<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.790> it's<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.480> much<00:02:17.990> more

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
carbohydrates and it's a much more

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.470 
carbohydrates and it's a much more
stable<00:02:18.410> energy<00:02:18.890> so<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.520> can<00:02:19.940> actually<00:02:20.120> sit

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
stable energy so you can actually sit

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.160 
stable energy so you can actually sit
down<00:02:20.690> at<00:02:21.200> your<00:02:21.260> desk<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.950> have<00:02:22.190> clear<00:02:23.170> mental

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
down at your desk and have clear mental

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.920 
down at your desk and have clear mental
mental<00:02:24.830> focus<00:02:25.010> for<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.520> entire<00:02:25.790> day<00:02:26.060> and

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
mental focus for the entire day and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.240 
mental focus for the entire day and
there's<00:02:27.110> actually<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.440> few<00:02:27.620> studies<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:27.950> show

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
there's actually a few studies that show

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.800 
there's actually a few studies that show
that<00:02:28.280> there's<00:02:28.610> actually<00:02:28.760> increased<00:02:29.480> amount

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
that there's actually increased amount

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.750 
that there's actually increased amount
of<00:02:29.930> blood<00:02:30.140> flow<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.440> your<00:02:30.680> brain<00:02:30.830> when<00:02:31.580> you're

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
of blood flow to your brain when you're

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.890 
of blood flow to your brain when you're
in<00:02:31.820> a<00:02:31.910> state<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.600> ketosis<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:34.660> there's<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.750> lot

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
in a state of ketosis so there's a lot

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
in a state of ketosis so there's a lot
of<00:02:35.930> advantages<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:38.120> consider<00:02:38.860> why<00:02:39.860> you

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
of advantages to to consider why you

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.550 
of advantages to to consider why you
should<00:02:40.250> be<00:02:40.430> doing<00:02:40.910> ketosis<00:02:41.440> experiment<00:02:42.440> with

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
should be doing ketosis experiment with

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.070 
should be doing ketosis experiment with
it<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:43.070> know<00:02:43.100> maybe<00:02:43.550> it<00:02:44.150> doesn't<00:02:44.720> feel<00:02:45.020> that

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
it you know maybe it doesn't feel that

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.560 
it you know maybe it doesn't feel that
good<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.040> try<00:02:46.610> maybe<00:02:46.820> one<00:02:47.120> or<00:02:47.240> two<00:02:47.270> days<00:02:47.540> a

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
good so you try maybe one or two days a

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.770 
good so you try maybe one or two days a
week<00:02:47.870> or<00:02:51.670> maybe<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:53.000> may<00:02:53.180> be<00:02:53.240> for<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.510> full<00:02:53.750> week

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
week or maybe it may be for a full week

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.960 
week or maybe it may be for a full week
and<00:02:54.110> then<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.500> then<00:02:54.680> see<00:02:54.830> how<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.040> goes<00:02:55.190> sort

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
and then and then see how it goes sort

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.010 
and then and then see how it goes sort
of<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.270> got<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.510> do<00:02:56.600> a<00:02:56.630> little<00:02:56.870> bit<00:02:56.990> of

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
of you got to do a little bit of

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.230 
of you got to do a little bit of
experimenting<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.860> see<00:02:57.890> what<00:02:58.670> what<00:02:58.910> level

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
experimenting to see what what level

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.440 
experimenting to see what what level
works<00:02:59.450> for<00:02:59.690> you<00:02:59.780> most<00:03:00.290> people<00:03:01.030> will<00:03:02.030> find<00:03:02.240> it

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
works for you most people will find it

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.540 
works for you most people will find it
there<00:03:02.810> they're<00:03:03.350> gonna<00:03:03.410> see<00:03:03.680> in<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.250> state<00:03:04.520> of

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
there they're gonna see in the state of

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.000 
there they're gonna see in the state of
ketosis<00:03:04.760> under<00:03:05.720> 50<00:03:06.080> grams<00:03:06.110> but<00:03:06.770> you<00:03:06.860> could

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
ketosis under 50 grams but you could

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.210 
ketosis under 50 grams but you could
even<00:03:07.130> you<00:03:07.580> know<00:03:07.670> get<00:03:08.000> up<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.300> 75<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.440> 100<00:03:10.010> grams

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
even you know get up to 75 to 100 grams

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.280 
even you know get up to 75 to 100 grams
of<00:03:10.400> carbohydrates<00:03:11.060> in<00:03:11.210> the<00:03:11.240> day<00:03:11.420> as<00:03:11.600> long<00:03:12.050> as

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
of carbohydrates in the day as long as

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.130 
of carbohydrates in the day as long as
they<00:03:12.410> are<00:03:12.590> low<00:03:13.250> glycemic<00:03:13.850> index

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
they are low glycemic index

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.940 
they are low glycemic index
carbohydrates<00:03:15.140> you'll<00:03:15.320> be<00:03:15.440> fine<00:03:15.680> at

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
carbohydrates you'll be fine at

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.580 
carbohydrates you'll be fine at
maintaining<00:03:16.610> that<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.360> stable<00:03:18.080> blood

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
maintaining that the stable blood

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.430 
maintaining that the stable blood
glucose<00:03:19.070> and<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.700> then<00:03:19.880> some<00:03:20.570> ketone

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
glucose and and then some ketone

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.130 
glucose and and then some ketone
production<00:03:22.340> so<00:03:22.790> definitely<00:03:23.600> something<00:03:23.960> to

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
production so definitely something to

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.750 
production so definitely something to
consider<00:03:24.230> if<00:03:24.710> you<00:03:25.100> want<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.400> increase<00:03:25.520> your

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
consider if you want to increase your

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.300 
consider if you want to increase your
mental<00:03:26.150> performance<00:03:26.270> and<00:03:26.870> have<00:03:27.650> rapid<00:03:28.100> fat

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
mental performance and have rapid fat

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.290 
mental performance and have rapid fat
loss<00:03:28.600> so<00:03:29.600> look<00:03:29.930> into<00:03:30.170> it
