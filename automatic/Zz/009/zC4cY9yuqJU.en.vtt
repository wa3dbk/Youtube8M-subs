if you had these little like mushroom

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.240 
if you had these little like mushroom
like<00:05:11.790> pedestals<00:05:12.420> on<00:05:12.720> 6x6<00:05:13.560> posts<00:05:14.010> again

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
like pedestals on 6x6 posts again

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.650 
like pedestals on 6x6 posts again
cemented<00:05:14.850> into<00:05:15.030> ground<00:05:15.210> that<00:05:15.390> you<00:05:15.480> could

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
cemented into ground that you could

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.810 
cemented into ground that you could
climb<00:05:16.200> or<00:05:16.470> hop<00:05:16.620> from<00:05:16.800> one<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:17.070> go<00:05:17.220> to<00:05:17.280> ascend

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
climb or hop from one to go to ascend

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.530

down low at night just kind of a cool
backwoods<00:06:13.840> thing<00:06:14.080> so<00:06:14.560> that's<00:06:14.710> the<00:06:14.830> general

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
backwoods thing so that's the general

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.800 
backwoods thing so that's the general
idea<00:06:15.190> I'm<00:06:15.850> thinking<00:06:16.240> this<00:06:16.390> here<00:06:16.630> would<00:06:16.720> either

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
idea I'm thinking this here would either

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.960 
idea I'm thinking this here would either
be<00:06:17.020> sited<00:06:17.500> and<00:06:17.650> you<00:06:18.460> know<00:06:18.550> tongue-and-groove

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
be sited and you know tongue-and-groove

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.690 
be sited and you know tongue-and-groove

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
car siding you know that that being

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.400 
car siding you know that that being

train car siding tiny grove style not

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.640 
train car siding tiny grove style not
like<00:06:23.620> metal<00:06:24.070> automobile<00:06:24.640> doors<00:06:25.030> or<00:06:25.450> even<00:06:25.650> just

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
like metal automobile doors or even just

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.800 
like metal automobile doors or even just
a<00:06:26.800> fly<00:06:27.490> sided<00:06:27.940> and<00:06:28.000> painted<00:06:28.390> with<00:06:28.480> a<00:06:28.540> couple

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
structure and would be very very

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.670 
structure and would be very very
inexpensive<00:06:33.160> to<00:06:33.910> build<00:06:34.720> so<00:06:35.350> that's<00:06:35.530> the

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
inexpensive to build so that's the

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.980 
inexpensive to build so that's the
general<00:06:35.920> idea<00:06:36.270> for<00:06:37.270> those<00:06:37.390> are<00:06:37.510> you<00:06:37.570> watching

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
general idea for those are you watching

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.020 
general idea for those are you watching
or<00:06:38.230> for<00:06:38.530> show<00:06:38.860> and<00:06:39.040> carry<00:06:39.250> very<00:06:39.760> whimsical

or for show and carry very whimsical

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.480 
or for show and carry very whimsical
different<00:06:40.720> but<00:06:40.900> the<00:06:40.990> idea<00:06:41.230> is<00:06:41.320> fun<00:06:41.770> simple

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
different but the idea is fun simple

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.650
