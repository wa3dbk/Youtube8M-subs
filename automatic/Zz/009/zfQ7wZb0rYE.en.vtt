00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
on it because it's starting to put out

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.240 
on it because it's starting to put out
buds<00:00:58.540> this<00:00:59.050> here<00:00:59.380> doesn't<00:00:59.590> have<00:00:59.650> any<00:00:59.800> buds<00:01:00.010> but

buds this here doesn't have any buds but
it's<00:01:00.400> starting<00:01:00.670> some<00:01:00.850> new<00:01:00.880> growth<00:01:01.770> again<00:01:02.770> it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
it's starting some new growth again it

broke<00:01:03.100> off<00:01:03.280> of<00:01:03.490> another<00:01:03.730> plant<00:01:04.030> and<00:01:05.009> thought

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
broke off of another plant and thought

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:07.289 
broke off of another plant and thought
I'd<00:01:06.159> just<00:01:06.340> stick<00:01:06.520> it<00:01:06.670> in<00:01:06.729> there<00:01:06.790> see<00:01:07.090> if<00:01:07.210> it

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
I'd just stick it in there see if it

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:08.850 
I'd just stick it in there see if it
grew<00:01:07.509> don't<00:01:08.080> want<00:01:08.229> to<00:01:08.320> throw<00:01:08.470> it<00:01:08.590> out<00:01:08.680> if<00:01:08.799> I

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
grew don't want to throw it out if I

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.460 
grew don't want to throw it out if I
don't<00:01:09.040> have<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.430> I<00:01:09.720> don't<00:01:10.720> know<00:01:10.810> I<00:01:11.020> don't<00:01:11.290> need

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.490 
don't have to I don't know I don't need
more<00:01:11.680> plants<00:01:12.100> but<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.689> hard<00:01:13.930> time<00:01:14.200> just

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
more plants but have a hard time just

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.340 
more plants but have a hard time just
letting<00:01:14.890> them<00:01:14.950> go<00:01:15.159> so<00:01:16.090> anyway<00:01:16.689> I'll<00:01:17.020> bring<00:01:17.229> you

in<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.470> little<00:01:17.619> bit<00:01:17.710> closer<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.130> you<00:01:18.189> could<00:01:18.610> see

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
in a little bit closer and you could see

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.760 
in a little bit closer and you could see
all<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.939> new<00:01:19.090> growth<00:01:19.360> on<00:01:19.630> here<00:01:19.960> in<00:01:20.080> some

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
all the new growth on here in some

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.920 
all the new growth on here in some
instances<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.970> new<00:01:22.090> growth<00:01:22.330> is<00:01:22.510> a<00:01:22.540> little<00:01:22.810> bit

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
instances the new growth is a little bit

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.860 
instances the new growth is a little bit
yellow<00:01:23.190> I<00:01:24.190> don't<00:01:25.030> know<00:01:25.120> whether<00:01:25.270> that's<00:01:25.480> from

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
yellow I don't know whether that's from

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.080 
yellow I don't know whether that's from
too<00:01:26.110> much<00:01:26.260> Sun<00:01:26.530> or<00:01:26.830> too<00:01:27.130> much<00:01:27.250> shade<00:01:27.550> I<00:01:27.790> did

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
too much Sun or too much shade I did

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.980 
too much Sun or too much shade I did
actually<00:01:28.270> have<00:01:28.510> this<00:01:28.870> over<00:01:29.170> by<00:01:30.870> some<00:01:31.870> other

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
actually have this over by some other

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.719 
actually have this over by some other
plants<00:01:32.409> and<00:01:32.500> it<00:01:32.560> was<00:01:32.740> right<00:01:33.310> next<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:33.640> the

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
plants and it was right next to the

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.190 
plants and it was right next to the
house<00:01:33.909> so<00:01:34.300> I<00:01:34.330> think<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:34.720> might<00:01:34.900> have<00:01:35.020> gotten

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
house so I think it might have gotten

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.780 
house so I think it might have gotten
shaded<00:01:35.710> for<00:01:35.860> too<00:01:36.010> much<00:01:36.130> of<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.370> day<00:01:36.520> so<00:01:36.580> I

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
shaded for too much of the day so I

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.130 
shaded for too much of the day so I
think<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.180> that's<00:01:37.300> why<00:01:37.600> they're<00:01:37.900> a<00:01:37.930> little

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
think that that's why they're a little

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.340 
think that that's why they're a little
bit<00:01:38.320> discolored<00:01:38.680> but<00:01:39.640> I'll<00:01:40.390> bring<00:01:41.020> in<00:01:41.200> and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
bit discolored but I'll bring in and

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.980 
bit discolored but I'll bring in and
show<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:44.670> okay<00:01:45.670> so<00:01:45.729> here<00:01:46.240> we<00:01:46.270> are<00:01:46.390> a<00:01:46.840> little

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
show you okay so here we are a little

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.899 
show you okay so here we are a little
bit<00:01:47.170> closer<00:01:47.440> as<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:48.040> can<00:01:48.220> see<00:01:48.370> this<00:01:48.549> was<00:01:48.760> the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
bit closer as you can see this was the

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.149 
bit closer as you can see this was the
rosette<00:01:49.299> that<00:01:49.479> we<00:01:49.570> left<00:01:49.810> on<00:01:50.049> there<00:01:50.830> because<00:01:50.979> it

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
rosette that we left on there because it

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.620 
rosette that we left on there because it
was<00:01:51.220> doing<00:01:51.490> all<00:01:51.640> right<00:01:51.820> it<00:01:52.000> was<00:01:52.120> branching<00:01:52.540> out

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
was doing all right it was branching out

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.660 
was doing all right it was branching out
and<00:01:52.690> doing<00:01:53.140> what<00:01:53.290> it<00:01:53.380> should<00:01:53.799> be<00:01:54.040> doing<00:01:56.670> at

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
and doing what it should be doing at

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.670 
and doing what it should be doing at
further<00:01:58.180> glance<00:01:58.600> it<00:01:58.869> looks<00:01:59.049> like<00:01:59.290> I<00:01:59.409> still

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
further glance it looks like I still

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.820 
further glance it looks like I still
have<00:01:59.920> a<00:01:59.950> problem<00:02:00.250> here<00:02:00.670> with<00:02:01.500> sorry<00:02:02.500> scale

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
have a problem here with sorry scale

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.800 
have a problem here with sorry scale
insect<00:02:03.250> so<00:02:03.940> just<00:02:04.119> rub<00:02:04.299> that<00:02:04.450> off<00:02:04.600> with<00:02:04.780> my

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
insect so just rub that off with my

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.070 
insect so just rub that off with my
finger<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:06.729> plant<00:02:07.090> for<00:02:07.299> some<00:02:07.450> reason<00:02:07.840> has

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
finger this plant for some reason has

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.960 
finger this plant for some reason has
been<00:02:08.319> a<00:02:09.750> big<00:02:10.750> target<00:02:11.110> for<00:02:11.290> scale<00:02:11.799> insects<00:02:12.400> so

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
been a big target for scale insects so

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.789 
been a big target for scale insects so
I'll<00:02:13.480> definitely<00:02:13.659> keep<00:02:14.319> watching<00:02:14.769> it<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.069> and

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
I'll definitely keep watching it and and

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.410 
I'll definitely keep watching it and and
rubbing<00:02:17.799> them<00:02:17.920> away<00:02:18.129> and<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.760> using<00:02:19.209> some

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
rubbing them away and and using some

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.020 
rubbing them away and and using some
alcohol<00:02:19.870> on<00:02:19.900> there<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.500> try<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.739> kill<00:02:20.980> them<00:02:21.159> but

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
alcohol on there to try to kill them but

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.570 
alcohol on there to try to kill them but
they<00:02:22.840> always<00:02:22.989> seem<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.230> come<00:02:23.470> back<00:02:23.650> stupid

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
they always seem to come back stupid

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.970 
they always seem to come back stupid
little<00:02:24.700> things<00:02:25.080> so<00:02:26.080> as<00:02:26.349> you<00:02:26.500> can<00:02:26.590> see<00:02:26.650> we've

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
little things so as you can see we've

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.450 
little things so as you can see we've
got<00:02:27.010> all<00:02:27.250> kinds<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.700> new<00:02:27.880> growth

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
got all kinds of new growth

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.390 
got all kinds of new growth
points<00:02:29.200> where<00:02:30.200> there<00:02:30.440> was<00:02:30.560> one<00:02:30.830> growth<00:02:31.130> tip

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
points where there was one growth tip

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.690 
points where there was one growth tip
here<00:02:31.730> now<00:02:31.940> there's<00:02:32.180> two<00:02:33.070> there's<00:02:34.070> one<00:02:34.340> on<00:02:34.490> this

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
here now there's two there's one on this

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.560 
here now there's two there's one on this
one<00:02:35.980> there's<00:02:36.980> two<00:02:37.340> over<00:02:37.370> here<00:02:37.760> on<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.300> one

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
one there's two over here on this one

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.870 
one there's two over here on this one
and<00:02:39.430> there's<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.580> one<00:02:41.210> over<00:02:41.390> here<00:02:41.750> on<00:02:41.900> this<00:02:42.110> one

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
and there's a one over here on this one

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.670 
and there's a one over here on this one
but<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.420> does<00:02:44.690> look<00:02:44.720> like<00:02:44.990> I<00:02:45.380> don't<00:02:45.530> know

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
but it does look like I don't know

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.870 
but it does look like I don't know
whether<00:02:45.830> I<00:02:45.920> can<00:02:46.100> bring<00:02:46.220> this<00:02:46.370> in<00:02:46.550> with<00:02:46.700> it

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
whether I can bring this in with it

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.070 
whether I can bring this in with it
without<00:02:47.540> at<00:02:47.810> losing<00:02:48.170> focus<00:02:49.630> there<00:02:50.630> by<00:02:50.900> my

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
without at losing focus there by my

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.050 
without at losing focus there by my
thumb<00:02:51.290> there's<00:02:51.590> another<00:02:51.800> growth<00:02:52.100> point<00:02:52.430> or

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
thumb there's another growth point or

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.460 
thumb there's another growth point or
what<00:02:53.840> possibly<00:02:54.410> could<00:02:54.710> be<00:02:54.830> a<00:02:54.860> growth<00:02:55.130> point<00:02:56.470> so

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
what possibly could be a growth point so

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.040 
what possibly could be a growth point so
very<00:02:57.740> exciting<00:02:58.190> very<00:02:58.490> exciting<00:02:58.640> I<00:02:59.390> thought

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
very exciting very exciting I thought

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.750 
very exciting very exciting I thought
that<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.380> wouldn't<00:03:00.590> wouldn't<00:03:01.370> take<00:03:01.640> to

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
that it wouldn't wouldn't take to

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.700 
that it wouldn't wouldn't take to
pruning<00:03:02.150> because<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:02.990> general<00:03:03.350> health<00:03:03.560> of

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
pruning because of the general health of

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.430 
pruning because of the general health of
it<00:03:03.860> as<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.460> was<00:03:04.610> but<00:03:05.570> it<00:03:05.990> seems<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.290> be<00:03:06.350> doing

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
it as it was but it seems to be doing

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.960 
it as it was but it seems to be doing
just<00:03:06.560> fine<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.370> we'll<00:03:07.490> keep<00:03:07.610> it<00:03:07.760> for<00:03:07.910> another

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
just fine so we'll keep it for another

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.710 
just fine so we'll keep it for another
year<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.530> here<00:03:09.530> is<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.920> step<00:03:10.670> Elia<00:03:11.000> or<00:03:11.360> step

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
year and here is the step Elia or step

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.790 
year and here is the step Elia or step
Ella<00:03:12.850> it's<00:03:13.850> looking<00:03:14.180> really<00:03:14.300> nice<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:15.290> will<00:03:15.530> go

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
Ella it's looking really nice it will go

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.820 
Ella it's looking really nice it will go
more<00:03:16.100> green<00:03:16.480> when<00:03:17.480> I<00:03:17.510> bring<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.870> inside<00:03:18.020> but

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
more green when I bring it inside but

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.550 
more green when I bring it inside but
when<00:03:19.070> it<00:03:19.190> gets<00:03:19.340> lots<00:03:19.580> of<00:03:19.730> Sun<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.300> tends<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.440> go

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
when it gets lots of Sun it tends to go

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.360 
when it gets lots of Sun it tends to go
more<00:03:21.770> red<00:03:22.660> brownish<00:03:23.660> red<00:03:23.960> color<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:25.040> the

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
more red brownish red color to the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.080 
more red brownish red color to the
foliage<00:03:25.730> so<00:03:26.560> very<00:03:27.560> natural<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.190> like<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:28.850> on

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
foliage so very natural I like it on

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.910 
foliage so very natural I like it on
this<00:03:29.480> side<00:03:29.720> this<00:03:29.930> must<00:03:30.170> be<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.470> side<00:03:30.650> that<00:03:30.800> it

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
this side this must be the side that it

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.850 
this side this must be the side that it
doesn't<00:03:31.190> get<00:03:31.280> as<00:03:31.370> much<00:03:31.520> Sun<00:03:31.790> it's<00:03:32.390> more<00:03:32.660> green

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
doesn't get as much Sun it's more green

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.380 
doesn't get as much Sun it's more green
so<00:03:33.860> it<00:03:33.980> looks<00:03:34.160> really<00:03:34.340> really<00:03:34.550> nice<00:03:34.670> I<00:03:35.000> can't

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
so it looks really really nice I can't

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.730 
so it looks really really nice I can't
wait<00:03:35.540> for<00:03:35.720> this<00:03:35.810> one<00:03:35.960> to<00:03:36.020> start<00:03:36.260> flowering<00:03:36.440> as

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
wait for this one to start flowering as
