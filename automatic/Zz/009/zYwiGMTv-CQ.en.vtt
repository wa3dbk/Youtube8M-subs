00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 results I am very satisfied this in 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.780
 I special the cube for my 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.090

 in level for my products has given me 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.870
 very good results as I said and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.910
 well if I have not seen my unpacked 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.290
 from this camera click up there and 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.170
 above is the link so you can see the 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.440
 unpacked good let's start with 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.840
 the analysis 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.300
 first of all let's start with the 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.600
 cost the cost of this type of cameras 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.670
 these types of cameras are very accessible 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.369
 of camera in this particular camera 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.909
 it costs around 400 600 dollars 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.470
 It depends on where on where you buy 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:13.310
 this is the canon t 3 as I said 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.570
 also known as a canon of 1100 and 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.460
 is 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.100
 is similar to the nike with 3,100 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.270
 prices are also are they run around 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.920
 of $ 400 and $ 600 for the nike in the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.540
 two cameras are are for 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.920
 beginners or for people who do not 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.770
 they have a lot of notion of this kind of 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.750
 cameras this camera is a reflex one 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.229
 Diesel Ar as you want to call it 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.910
 good and it comes and I bought the kit the kit 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.860
 it means that it comes with the camera and 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:51.570
 comes with the lens 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:55.640
 the lens is one and this efes is one of 18 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.970
 55 millimeters buy kit 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.760
 the kit is what the camera cost me 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.860
 pay 300 dollars seems to me why 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:09.560
 they achieve special good and the lens is a 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.440
 lens and efes that is a new a new 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.050
 line of canon lenses is one of the 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.810
 cheaper this costs around 150 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.760
 200 dollars and what they have special is 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.550
 this kind of glasses since he brings 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.300
 bring options for manual focus or 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.050
 auto focus or autofocus focus too 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:34.000
 bring a lot for the stabilizer 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.820
 and good is the entity is very light and very 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.160
 important always always put the 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.230
 cab when you're not using when not 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.530
 are you using the camera put the cover 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.400
 Y 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.670
 also I bought my filters this 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:55.260
 is for you to put salt on the lens 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:03:00.050
 Apart from that it gives you better images 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.050
 the video of the entity also protects you 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.980
 well this camera also allows you 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.970
 recording in high definition does not allow you 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:18.350
 record in full hd 1080 but if you can 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:21.110
 record in 780 the image is very clear 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.780
 the sound is also very clear it brings a 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.540
 integrated microphone and a speaker too 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.700
 and well my next videos I'm going to 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.739
 use 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.150
 are going to do with this guy every time 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.360
 I'm going to use this camera to record my 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:38.680
 next videos this one brings a plaster of 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:42.220
 100 to 1600 and also the battery 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.640
 lets you allow you to take up to 700 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:50.440
 photos per charge and good if you put it in 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:53.380
 the auto shot mode then to take 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.390
 up to three photos per second that is not 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.099
 something very very impressive very 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.560
 impressive but then candanchÃº that 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:02.860
 make some types of these sacrifices 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.660
 to lower the cost of this good camera 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:10.000
 and this menu is very friendly if you never 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.510
 have you had one of these is very very 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.970
 simple to use the menu in this in this 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.919
 video I will not show you how to use it 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.680
 it is simply an analysis of this type 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:24.340
 of cameras like this one told them 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:30.850
 I am very satisfied the camera brings a 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:32.270
 apss sensor and it's a adif processor and 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.610
 4 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.130
 the sensor is 12 megapixels that's not 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.280
 it means that you drink and that you can not 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.230
 take good pictures 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.129
 the megapixels really 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:49.039
 do not take much importance 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.989
 this is a very good camera very very 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:55.219
 good the only complaint that I would have is 

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:58.300
 of the bar and the body is does not come with a 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:05:02.149
 Anti slip texture like other 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.339
 other cameras that are professionals 

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:06.860
 but hey, he did not have to do this 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:08.779
 for to lower a bit the cost was 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.499
 to give us those types of prices 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:16.669
 that are really very accessible this 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:19.059
 this camera brings a built-in flash like 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.059
 you can see 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.430
 here is the flash but it also brings a 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.420
 adapter so you can add it 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:31.600
 the other type of flash that also gray-haired 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.410
 with a new line of flashes but they are 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.750
 very expensive 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.050
 the cheapest worth about 200 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.760
 dollars and the and the most expensive the 580 vale 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:44.110
 It's worth up to 500 dollars 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:48.070
 you can use the lcd screen that is 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.980
 2.7 inches or you can use the view 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:54.040
 finder ' also from this side we can see 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.160
 who brings the tickets to 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:01.540
 the fact has more for your television or 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:04.610
 a micro and usb below we can see 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:09.979
 what he brings 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:12.259
 wicket for one for a tractor and 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:15.960
 here we can see the one launched for the 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:18.650
 battery and these cameras grab 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.370
 that of 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.530
 sd memory cards and this good me 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:30.660

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:33.030
 I had there and I bought once for 4 gigs 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.520
 also what I recommend if 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:38.520
 you think about buying a type of camera 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.730
 These and buy a kit to clean 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.960
 They are very sensitive to dust and good not 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:48.610
 you want your pictures to come out 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:52.000
 with those little powder hairs to 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.800
 this buy a cleaner cost me well
