00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.039
 for this project you need and you put 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.060
 and crochet hook i use a crochet hook 2 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.800
 mm and yarn I use a medium thick 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.740
 yarn that you would normally 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.180
 knit or crochet with a report 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:32.660
 six or seven mm and beads are reasonable 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:36.400
 large beads with a hole in it 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.400
 diameter of 4 mm 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.410
 I start with the thread on the back 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.190
 between 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.280
 inside forward around it 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.700
 on the other side and we pass this one 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.730
 side kind 8 you make 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.600
 pull this thread and that's the start 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:03.410
 of the cord 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.590
 always tilt and the lower loop 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.190
 and now it is important that we 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:17.289
 That 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:19.789
 jobs started counting so this was a two 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:25.330
 sides 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:25.330
 plus extend a little 3 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.310
 and 4 and 4 is the number that we keep 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.340
 are going to hold on 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.710
 after the fourth you go for the fifth loop 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.200
 pull a little tight if you are now on 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.570
 these upper draws then make you want 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.600
 she's a little small again 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.170
 now we are going to add the first bead 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.650
 do you need the crochet hook for the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.370
 hook or by gold and then pick up the 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:03.160
 wire where you are now here 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:05.880
 after after that last accident is exactly 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.880
 here 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:16.740
 yes i hold you and you hold it by it 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:20.130
 bead and then there will be a loop 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.130
 through the bead 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.820
 it touches something on the back from it 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:33.250
 bead the loop that you put around it 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.940
 next pin talks and pull tight 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.700
 Then the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.680
 plus this we do not count this 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.140
 just belongs to the bead so it is 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:49.860
 just fix the bead and now 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:49.860
 we are going again 4 plus to make one 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.350
 we see 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.670
 3 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:14.860
 far later than will float 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:19.230
 a bit too tight we don't 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.230
 we go next kramer the format 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.600
 pull the working thread through 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:43.350
 pear crawling list at the back so 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.350
 around the pin 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:59.130
 pull the trigger tight and go again 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:59.130
 reset one 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.290
 No 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.430
 3 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.040
 freezer 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:32.200
 furthermore , my bit is tight 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.200
 next bead 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.410
 thread on the back 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.430
 photo page 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.330
 and 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.260
 the three 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.260
 4 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.030
 find this way you keep going and 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:44.550
 just as long make you be so lammers you 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:46.290
 you need the for your bracelet 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.340
 determining the correct length is a matter of 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.290
 measure 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.720
 it is full so that stretches so you can 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.630
 keep the bracelet a bit tighter so that 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.060
 it stays nice and firm 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.080
 slide one more over your hand 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.580
 damn well with it 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.100
 it's really just a matter of 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.940
 just measure and think I am already there 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.940
 am about 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:14.690
 thread well now from the right so I do 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.690
 find linker then 7 transfer 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:24.470
 right side yes about the cut 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.840
 and by that listening are fetching 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.680
 a knot at the beginning and the end 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.569
 just get as close to each other as possible 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.569
 each other 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:51.660
 easiest is a flat knot 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:54.080
 we get left over right below 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.080
 strike out 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:07:00.110
 go under right over left
