servo<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.039> ordered<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.610> basic<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:52.079> goes<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
servo I ordered a basic that goes to

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.750 
servo I ordered a basic that goes to
three<00:00:52.850> 3.52<00:00:54.050> basic<00:00:55.050> analog<00:00:55.410> servo<00:00:55.829> might<00:00:56.579> use

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
three 3.52 basic analog servo might use

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.290 
three 3.52 basic analog servo might use
it<00:00:56.910> here<00:00:57.059> might<00:00:57.239> not<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.420> don't<00:00:57.660> know<00:00:57.719> yet<00:00:57.960> okay

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
wheel here we have pinion gear and looks

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.289 
wheel here we have pinion gear and looks
like<00:01:10.290> some<00:01:10.470> hardware<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.159> some<00:01:11.850> screws<00:01:12.270> and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
rubber coming off or I don't know that's

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.410 
rubber coming off or I don't know that's
just<00:02:07.259> dirt<00:02:07.590> or<00:02:07.740> not<00:02:07.890> let's<00:02:08.879> see<00:02:09.000> right<00:02:09.030> there

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
just dirt or not let's see right there

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.780 
just dirt or not let's see right there
I'll<00:02:09.599> probably<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:09.989> or<00:02:10.890> off<00:02:11.039> eventually<00:02:11.340> so

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
I'll probably just or off eventually so

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.949 
I'll probably just or off eventually so
here<00:02:11.940> we<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.590> scale<00:02:13.590> looking<00:02:13.950> feet<00:02:14.959> let's

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
here we have a scale looking feet let's

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.030 
here we have a scale looking feet let's
try<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.230> see<00:02:16.470> how<00:02:17.599> how<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.660> driver<00:02:18.989> looks<00:02:19.260> and

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
try to see how how the driver looks and

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.130 
try to see how how the driver looks and
they<00:02:20.129> just<00:02:20.400> set<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:21.239> camera<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.750> know<00:02:21.810> decide

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
they just set the camera you know decide

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.680 
they just set the camera you know decide
1/7<00:02:22.739> they<00:02:23.190> open<00:02:23.459> up<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.670> driver<00:02:24.980> all<00:02:25.980> right

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
1/7 they open up the driver all right

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.809 
1/7 they open up the driver all right
let's<00:02:27.690> see<00:02:27.870> what<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.140> looks<00:02:28.319> like<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:31.819> let's

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
let's see what this looks like so let's

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:45.199 
let's see what this looks like so let's
go<00:02:35.540> something<00:02:36.540> like<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:43.790> mostly<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:45.060> like

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
go something like that mostly just like

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.850 
go something like that mostly just like
this<00:02:46.190> looks<00:02:47.190> pretty<00:02:47.430> scaled<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:48.000> me<00:02:48.620> not<00:02:49.620> bad

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
this looks pretty scaled to me not bad

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.400 
this looks pretty scaled to me not bad
oh<00:02:50.540> yeah<00:02:51.540> one<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.930> best<00:02:52.050> things<00:02:52.319> about

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
oh yeah one of the best things about

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.309 
oh yeah one of the best things about
this<00:02:53.030> one-port<00:02:54.030> scale<00:02:54.300> go-kart<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.110> price

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
this one-port scale go-kart is the price

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.550 
this one-port scale go-kart is the price
it<00:02:56.220> was<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.879> think<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.209> was<00:02:57.239> $38<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.319> paid<00:02:58.530> a

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
it was I think it was $38 I paid a

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.240 
it was I think it was $38 I paid a
little<00:02:58.800> under<00:02:59.250> 50<00:02:59.519> shipped<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.180> my<00:03:00.300> door<00:03:00.709> so<00:03:01.709> it

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
little under 50 shipped to my door so it

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.790 
little under 50 shipped to my door so it
is<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.489> fantastic<00:03:02.879> deal<00:03:03.470> take<00:03:04.470> this<00:03:04.590> out<00:03:04.769> of

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
is a fantastic deal take this out of

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.210 
is a fantastic deal take this out of
here

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
here

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.690 
here
look<00:03:05.610> what<00:03:05.790> else<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.269> here<00:03:07.010> alright<00:03:08.010> so<00:03:08.280> the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
look what else is in here alright so the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.399 
look what else is in here alright so the
chassis<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:10.170> far<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.440> chassis<00:03:11.180> it<00:03:12.409> is

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
chassis so far the chassis it is

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:14.390 
chassis so far the chassis it is
supposed<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.830> be<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:13.980> four<00:03:14.190> millimeter

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
supposed to be a four millimeter

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.699 
supposed to be a four millimeter
aluminum<00:03:15.120> piece<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.780> really<00:03:15.810> does<00:03:16.319> look<00:03:16.560> like

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
aluminum piece it really does look like

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.070 
aluminum piece it really does look like
a<00:03:16.769> three<00:03:17.040> millimeter<00:03:17.569> doesn't<00:03:18.569> look<00:03:18.690> as<00:03:18.840> thick

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
a three millimeter doesn't look as thick

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.750 
a three millimeter doesn't look as thick
as<00:03:19.260> four<00:03:19.530> could<00:03:19.890> be<00:03:20.069> because<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.370> definitely

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
as four could be because I definitely

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.160 
as four could be because I definitely
formula<00:03:21.420> me<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.690> looks<00:03:21.840> like<00:03:21.930> kind<00:03:22.140> of

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
formula me that looks like kind of

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.050 
formula me that looks like kind of
chassis<00:03:22.530> all<00:03:23.129> the<00:03:23.340> bolts<00:03:23.610> here<00:03:23.790> are

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
chassis all the bolts here are

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.240 
chassis all the bolts here are
countersunk<00:03:24.860> except<00:03:25.860> these<00:03:26.849> four<00:03:27.480> right<00:03:27.780> here

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
countersunk except these four right here

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.030 
countersunk except these four right here
they're<00:03:29.250> not<00:03:29.400> countersunk<00:03:29.879> at<00:03:30.060> all<00:03:30.209> and

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
they're not countersunk at all and

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.830 
they're not countersunk at all and
they're<00:03:32.040> attached<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.549> motor<00:03:32.700> mount<00:03:32.970> so

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
they're attached to the motor mount so

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.300 
they're attached to the motor mount so
maybe<00:03:34.019> there's<00:03:34.379> something<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.920> that

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
maybe there's something to that

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.990 
maybe there's something to that
I<00:03:35.340> really<00:03:35.700> don't<00:03:35.940> think<00:03:36.000> so<00:03:37.640> but<00:03:38.640> hopefully

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
I really don't think so but hopefully

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.559 
I really don't think so but hopefully
those<00:03:39.120> don't<00:03:39.390> get<00:03:39.569> scratched

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
those don't get scratched

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.940 
those don't get scratched
alright<00:03:42.709> the<00:03:43.709> driveline<00:03:44.010> itself<00:03:45.470> so<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:46.769> is

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
alright the driveline itself so this is

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.000 
alright the driveline itself so this is
set<00:03:47.129> to<00:03:47.159> have<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.459> live<00:03:47.849> rear<00:03:48.239> axle<00:03:48.769> now<00:03:49.769> that

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
set to have a live rear axle now that

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.860 
set to have a live rear axle now that
does<00:03:50.250> look<00:03:50.549> like<00:03:50.849> a<00:03:51.860> solid<00:03:52.860> axle<00:03:53.159> I<00:03:53.720> mean<00:03:54.720> let

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
does look like a solid axle I mean let

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.130 
does look like a solid axle I mean let
me<00:03:54.900> try<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.200> spin<00:03:55.560> both<00:03:55.830> tires<00:03:56.989> different<00:03:57.989> ways

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
me try to spin both tires different ways

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.280 
me try to spin both tires different ways
let<00:03:58.470> me<00:03:58.560> see<00:03:58.680> what<00:03:58.799> happens

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.520 

so<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.710> reason<00:04:06.010> of<00:04:06.100> this<00:04:06.310> just<00:04:07.210> a<00:04:07.270> solid<00:04:07.720> live

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
so the reason of this just a solid live

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.010 
so the reason of this just a solid live
we<00:04:08.920> were<00:04:09.040> actual<00:04:09.370> set<00:04:09.550> up<00:04:09.700> I<00:04:10.000> actually<00:04:10.450> do<00:04:10.780> like

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
we were actual set up I actually do like

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.320 
we were actual set up I actually do like
that<00:04:11.230> because<00:04:11.530> that<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.310> does<00:04:12.550> mean<00:04:12.790> you'll

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
that because that that does mean you'll

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.680 
that because that that does mean you'll
never<00:04:13.540> have<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:13.930> break<00:04:14.320> another<00:04:14.560> difficut<00:04:15.690> on

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
never have to break another difficut on

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.660 
never have to break another difficut on
the<00:04:16.840> other<00:04:16.959> hand<00:04:17.230> probably<00:04:17.680> not<00:04:18.220> great<00:04:18.489> for

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
the other hand probably not great for

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.870 
the other hand probably not great for
handling<00:04:19.290> but<00:04:20.290> I'll<00:04:21.190> see<00:04:21.430> how<00:04:21.549> this<00:04:21.730> thing

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
handling but I'll see how this thing

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.490 
handling but I'll see how this thing
drives<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:23.790> give<00:04:24.790> an<00:04:24.880> update<00:04:24.970> on<00:04:25.270> that<00:04:25.500> here's

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
drives and give an update on that here's

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.840 
drives and give an update on that here's
the<00:04:26.620> spur<00:04:26.860> gear<00:04:26.890> nice<00:04:27.640> drive<00:04:28.060> belt<00:04:29.850> aluminum

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
the spur gear nice drive belt aluminum

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.410 
the spur gear nice drive belt aluminum
motor<00:04:31.060> mount<00:04:31.360> a<00:04:32.130> lot<00:04:33.130> of<00:04:33.340> space<00:04:33.760> for<00:04:33.790> mountain

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
motor mount a lot of space for mountain

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.360 
motor mount a lot of space for mountain
electronics<00:04:34.990> most<00:04:35.920> like<00:04:36.070> you're<00:04:36.190> going<00:04:36.340> to

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
electronics most like you're going to

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.520 
electronics most like you're going to
put<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.610> battery<00:04:36.790> right<00:04:37.210> here<00:04:40.410> probably<00:04:41.410> the

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
put the battery right here probably the

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.950 
put the battery right here probably the
receiver<00:04:41.920> somewhere<00:04:42.580> here<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:46.510> rest<00:04:46.720> of

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
receiver somewhere here and the rest of

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.470 
receiver somewhere here and the rest of
us<00:04:47.080> there's<00:04:47.260> definitely<00:04:47.710> plenty<00:04:47.770> of<00:04:47.980> space

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
us there's definitely plenty of space

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.030 
us there's definitely plenty of space
the<00:04:49.480> interesting<00:04:50.080> thing<00:04:50.350> about<00:04:50.380> this<00:04:50.770> is

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
the interesting thing about this is

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.580 
the interesting thing about this is
there's<00:04:51.340> absolutely<00:04:51.790> no<00:04:52.000> suspension<00:04:52.600> the

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
there's absolutely no suspension the

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.920 
there's absolutely no suspension the
front<00:04:53.890> has<00:04:54.070> no<00:04:54.280> suspension<00:04:54.790> at<00:04:54.880> all<00:04:55.030> that's

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
front has no suspension at all that's

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.450 
front has no suspension at all that's
probably<00:04:56.290> why<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.500> tires<00:04:56.890> are<00:04:57.130> somewhat

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
probably why the tires are somewhat

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.850 
probably why the tires are somewhat
softer<00:04:57.760> and<00:04:57.880> regular<00:04:58.390> or<00:04:58.600> see<00:04:58.930> cars<00:04:59.170> to

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
softer and regular or see cars to

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.070 
softer and regular or see cars to
provide<00:05:00.130> a<00:05:00.160> lot<00:05:00.370> of<00:05:00.400> cushion<00:05:00.790> the<00:05:01.540> rear<00:05:01.720> here

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
provide a lot of cushion the rear here

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.110 
provide a lot of cushion the rear here
is<00:05:02.500> a<00:05:02.560> nice<00:05:02.920> looking<00:05:03.430> very<00:05:03.820> nice-looking

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
is a nice looking very nice-looking

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.170 
is a nice looking very nice-looking
carbon<00:05:04.810> fiber<00:05:04.990> piece<00:05:05.490> this<00:05:06.490> is<00:05:06.670> an<00:05:06.760> adjustable

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
carbon fiber piece this is an adjustable

over<00:05:12.520> here<00:05:12.760> you<00:05:13.150> could<00:05:13.330> adjust<00:05:13.419> them<00:05:13.810> put<00:05:14.260> some

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
over here you could adjust them put some

over here you could adjust them put some
tension<00:05:14.710> on<00:05:14.770> them<00:05:14.980> or<00:05:15.220> loosen<00:05:15.820> them<00:05:15.910> up<00:05:16.030> and
