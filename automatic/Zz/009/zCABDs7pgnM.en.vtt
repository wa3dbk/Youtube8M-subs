00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.160 

this<00:00:34.430> is<00:00:34.580> the<00:00:34.760> Strymon<00:00:35.180> mobius<00:00:35.750> and<00:00:36.080> we're

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
this is the Strymon mobius and we're

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.740 
this is the Strymon mobius and we're
going<00:00:36.320> to<00:00:36.380> look<00:00:36.530> at<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:36.770> rotary<00:00:37.270> and<00:00:38.530> we<00:00:39.530> have

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
going to look at the rotary and we have

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.080 
going to look at the rotary and we have
some<00:00:41.750> controls<00:00:42.230> here<00:00:45.430> this<00:00:46.430> is<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:46.730> horn

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
some controls here this is the horn

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.080 
some controls here this is the horn
level<00:00:48.040> sort<00:00:49.040> of<00:00:49.130> brings<00:00:49.370> up<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.670> harshness<00:00:49.970> of

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
level sort of brings up the harshness of

00:00:50.090 --> 00:01:03.250 
level sort of brings up the harshness of
the<00:00:50.390> horn<00:01:00.309> we<00:01:01.309> have<00:01:01.430> that<00:01:01.580> preamp<00:01:01.970> drive<00:01:02.330> it's

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
the horn we have that preamp drive it's

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:21.310 
the horn we have that preamp drive it's
kind<00:01:03.440> of<00:01:03.530> distorts<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:04.129> sound

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.969 

the<00:01:22.320> slope<00:01:22.680> speed<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.789> the<00:01:24.680> how<00:01:25.680> fast

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the slope speed of the how fast

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.350 
the slope speed of the how fast
transitions<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.030> fast<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.350> slow<00:01:29.360> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
transitions to the fast and the slow and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:49.060 
transitions to the fast and the slow and
here's<00:01:30.600> acceleration

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.590 

you<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.250> choose<00:01:50.430> between<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.910> slow<00:01:51.300> and<00:01:51.510> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
you can choose between the slow and the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:17.770 
you can choose between the slow and the
fast<00:01:51.840> speed

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.290 

and<00:02:18.780> depth<00:02:19.170> becomes<00:02:19.650> our<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.520> distance<00:02:21.030> from

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
and depth becomes our the distance from

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.460 
and depth becomes our the distance from
the<00:02:21.480> horn<00:02:22.550> this<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:23.760> farther<00:02:24.390> away<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:25.290> is

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
the horn this is farther away this is

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:59.320 
the horn this is farther away this is
closer

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.260 

sort<00:03:00.330> of<00:03:00.360> like<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.540> real<00:03:00.930> Leslie<00:03:01.970> slows<00:03:02.970> down

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
sort of like a real Leslie slows down

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:27.230 
sort of like a real Leslie slows down
and<00:03:03.570> speeds<00:03:03.750> up

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240
