 sunny location in a matter of absolute 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.880

 before crying pose 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.820
 Labuda with translation from the circle and after 10 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.130
 years begins to shoot central

 and shape I already said she 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.960
 completely in principle do not require 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.790
 the soil is not the only thing that requires 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.830
 this is twice a year for such a room 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.600
 fertilizer for conifers and in 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.960
 young age when you plant it 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.130
 age 1 2 years 1 2 years she requires 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.319
 shelter from the union of twigs and from 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.300
 burning spring that is brand good 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.150

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.270
 6 years spruce glauka globoza was was 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.300

 Spruce Glauka Globoza is very important to my 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.659
 look to use not only 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.430

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.430
 but be sure to use decorative 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.400
 garden elements in the form of some pots 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.459
 arches pergol it will give necessarily 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.159
