everything and anything I can learn
about<00:00:22.670> how<00:00:23.150> to<00:00:23.210> make<00:00:23.510> a<00:00:23.539> bow<00:00:23.750> shoot<00:00:24.050> flatter

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
about how to make a bow shoot flatter

hunter<00:00:29.000> so<00:00:29.599> I<00:00:29.630> asked<00:00:29.900> myself<00:00:30.170> how<00:00:30.680> does<00:00:31.010> a

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
hunter so I asked myself how does a

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.330 
hunter so I asked myself how does a
blazer<00:00:31.640> vein<00:00:32.029> stabilize<00:00:32.960> an<00:00:33.170> arrow<00:00:33.379> let's

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
blazer vein stabilize an arrow let's

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.100 
blazer vein stabilize an arrow let's
start<00:00:34.670> by<00:00:34.850> breaking<00:00:35.090> down<00:00:35.270> the<00:00:35.420> shot<00:00:35.750> with

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
start by breaking down the shot with

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.830 
start by breaking down the shot with
ultra<00:00:36.649> slow<00:00:36.980> motion<00:00:37.010> in<00:00:37.579> almost<00:00:37.820> 2700<00:00:38.480> frames

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
ultra slow motion in almost 2700 frames

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.080 
ultra slow motion in almost 2700 frames
a<00:00:39.079> second<00:00:39.500> when<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:39.980> string<00:00:40.280> is<00:00:40.309> released<00:00:40.820> the

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
a second when the string is released the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.780 
a second when the string is released the
force<00:00:41.360> is<00:00:41.629> added<00:00:42.020> to<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.260> arrow<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:43.160> cams<00:00:43.489> and

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
force is added to the arrow the cams and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.209 
force is added to the arrow the cams and
the<00:00:43.850> lens<00:00:44.090> lunge<00:00:44.570> forward<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:45.890> string

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
the lens lunge forward and the string

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.130 
the lens lunge forward and the string
sends<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.879> force<00:00:47.120> down<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:47.660> center<00:00:47.960> of<00:00:48.050> the

sends the force down the center of the

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.380 
sends the force down the center of the
shaft<00:00:48.350> it's<00:00:49.129> important<00:00:49.670> that<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:49.940> spine<00:00:50.239> of

shaft it's important that the spine of
the<00:00:50.480> shaft<00:00:50.750> is<00:00:50.960> weighted<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:51.590> bow<00:00:51.829> as<00:00:52.160> the

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
the shaft is weighted to the bow as the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.580 
the shaft is weighted to the bow as the
string<00:00:52.789> applies<00:00:53.120> pressure<00:00:53.449> the<00:00:53.840> arrow<00:00:54.079> starts

movement is left to the vein to spin and
stabilize<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:17.210> arrow<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.140> broad<00:01:18.380> head

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
stabilize the arrow and the broad head

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.830 
stabilize the arrow and the broad head
that's<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.490> only<00:01:19.939> way<00:01:20.150> you<00:01:20.210> can<00:01:20.509> hit<00:01:20.720> your

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
that's the only way you can hit your

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.790 
that's the only way you can hit your
mark

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.440 

spin<00:01:27.800> rate<00:01:28.070> is<00:01:28.250> really<00:01:28.700> important<00:01:29.150> but<00:01:29.270> if<00:01:29.360> you

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
spin rate is really important but if you

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.910 
spin rate is really important but if you
spin<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.720> arrow<00:01:29.840> too<00:01:30.080> fast<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:30.590> lose<00:01:30.740> too

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
spin the arrow too fast you lose too

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.470 
spin the arrow too fast you lose too
much<00:01:31.040> velocity<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:31.850> it<00:01:31.940> slows<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.300> arrow

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
much velocity and it slows the arrow

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.660 
much velocity and it slows the arrow
down<00:01:32.720> but<00:01:33.560> I<00:01:33.590> found<00:01:33.800> with<00:01:33.950> these<00:01:34.040> Blazers<00:01:34.490> have

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
down but I found with these Blazers have

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.220 
down but I found with these Blazers have
used<00:01:34.910> a<00:01:35.000> three<00:01:35.180> degree<00:01:35.330> offset<00:01:35.870> with<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.050> right

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
used a three degree offset with a right

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.020 
used a three degree offset with a right
helical<00:01:36.710> it'll<00:01:37.310> work<00:01:37.460> best

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
helical it'll work best

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.360 
helical it'll work best

it's<00:01:46.460> one<00:01:46.640> thing<00:01:46.820> to<00:01:46.880> hit<00:01:47.120> our<00:01:47.240> mark<00:01:47.480> but<00:01:47.690> it's

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
it's one thing to hit our mark but it's

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.700 
it's one thing to hit our mark but it's
another<00:01:47.960> thing<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.260> use<00:01:48.470> high-speed

the new blazer vein is a lot smaller
than<00:03:10.390> it's<00:03:10.689> ever<00:03:10.780> been<00:03:10.959> but<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.620> means<00:03:11.769> it's

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
than it's ever been but that means it's

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.140 
than it's ever been but that means it's
going<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.099> have<00:03:12.159> less<00:03:12.459> clearance<00:03:12.849> issues

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150

helps<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.640> arrow<00:03:24.849> become<00:03:25.390> more<00:03:25.599> stable<00:03:25.930> and

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
helps the arrow become more stable and

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.050 
helps the arrow become more stable and
will<00:03:26.530> be<00:03:26.650> less<00:03:26.890> affected<00:03:27.430> by<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.579> outside

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.179 
will be less affected by the outside
influences<00:03:28.299> like<00:03:28.780> wind<00:03:29.319> this<00:03:29.620> helps<00:03:30.069> with

influences like wind this helps with

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:31.500 
influences like wind this helps with

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
penetration this is how it works the

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.000

what's<00:05:04.560> really<00:05:04.740> interesting<00:05:05.009> is<00:05:05.520> is<00:05:05.729> that

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
what's really interesting is is that

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.879 
what's really interesting is is that
none<00:05:06.270> of<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.479> glue<00:05:06.720> material<00:05:07.259> in<00:05:07.379> the<00:05:07.470> facing

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
of the shaft that's due to the fact that

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.070 
of the shaft that's due to the fact that
the<00:05:11.729> bottom<00:05:11.970> of<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.150> flesh<00:05:12.419> has<00:05:12.659> a<00:05:12.690> suction
