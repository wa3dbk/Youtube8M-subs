00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.980 
freeze it but I done this a number of
times<00:02:43.700> trying<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.180> recreate<00:02:44.860> McDonald's<00:02:46.990> Big

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
times trying to recreate McDonald's Big

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.449 
times trying to recreate McDonald's Big
Macs<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:48.830> really<00:02:49.040> like<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.250> way<00:02:49.340> this

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
Macs and I really like the way this

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.940 
Macs and I really like the way this
turns<00:02:49.760> out<00:02:49.970> it<00:02:50.090> makes<00:02:50.270> it<00:02:50.420> easy<00:02:50.890> especially<00:02:51.890> if

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
turns out it makes it easy especially if

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.900 
turns out it makes it easy especially if
you<00:02:52.070> you<00:02:52.280> want<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.550> cut<00:02:54.190> square<00:02:55.190> hamburgers

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
you you want to cut square hamburgers

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.170 
you you want to cut square hamburgers
like<00:02:56.300> Wendy's<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:56.990> I'm<00:02:57.920> just<00:02:58.070> gonna<00:02:58.190> score

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
like Wendy's so I'm just gonna score

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:08.380 
like Wendy's so I'm just gonna score
these<00:03:00.340> score<00:03:01.340> this<00:03:01.459> frozen<00:03:02.090> ground<00:03:02.300> beef<00:03:07.390> and

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
these score this frozen ground beef and

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.509 
these score this frozen ground beef and
then<00:03:08.570> kind<00:03:08.930> of<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.770> just<00:03:09.950> cut<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.310> little

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
then kind of and just cut that a little

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.690 
then kind of and just cut that a little
bit<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:11.000> know<00:03:11.120> kind<00:03:11.360> of<00:03:11.480> break<00:03:11.720> through

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
bit you know kind of break through

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.250 
bit you know kind of break through
because<00:03:13.700> when<00:03:14.000> freezing<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.690> like<00:03:14.810> this<00:03:14.959> makes

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
because when freezing it like this makes

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.190 
because when freezing it like this makes
it<00:03:15.410> a<00:03:15.470> lot<00:03:15.590> easier<00:03:16.100> to<00:03:16.580> to<00:03:17.480> work<00:03:17.690> with<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:18.080> get

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
it a lot easier to to work with to get

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:27.670 
it a lot easier to to work with to get
get<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.680> out<00:03:23.769> so<00:03:24.769> there<00:03:24.920> we<00:03:25.040> have<00:03:25.190> it<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:27.500> makes

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
get it out so there we have it it makes

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
get it out so there we have it it makes
it<00:03:27.800> easy<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:28.070> freeze<00:03:28.400> these<00:03:28.700> two<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.269> can<00:03:30.700> do

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
it easy to freeze these two you can do

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.460 
it easy to freeze these two you can do
individual<00:03:32.209> ones<00:03:32.390> okay<00:03:32.750> let's<00:03:32.959> get<00:03:33.110> this<00:03:33.260> out

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
individual ones okay let's get this out

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.470 
individual ones okay let's get this out
on<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.709> grill

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.270 

okay<00:03:39.480> let's<00:03:39.780> get<00:03:39.959> these<00:03:40.140> burgers<00:03:40.590> on<00:03:43.280> these

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
okay let's get these burgers on these

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.800 
okay let's get these burgers on these
square<00:03:44.670> burgers

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.440 

Wendy

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.540 

now<00:03:56.230> these<00:03:56.349> are<00:03:56.530> very<00:03:56.770> thin<00:03:56.830> so<00:03:57.099> this

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
now these are very thin so this

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.240 
now these are very thin so this
shouldn't<00:03:57.790> take<00:03:57.970> some<00:03:58.450> few<00:03:58.690> minutes<00:03:59.050> and<00:03:59.860> I

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
shouldn't take some few minutes and I

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.280 
shouldn't take some few minutes and I
did<00:04:00.489> not<00:04:00.670> salt-and-pepper<00:04:01.360> them<00:04:01.870> because

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
did not salt-and-pepper them because

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.760 
did not salt-and-pepper them because
Wendy's<00:04:03.130> doesn't<00:04:03.640> do<00:04:03.730> that<00:04:03.970> either

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
Wendy's doesn't do that either

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.040 
Wendy's doesn't do that either
