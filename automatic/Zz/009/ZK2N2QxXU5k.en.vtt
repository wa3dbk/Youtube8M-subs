I'm sorry convert to blank keyframes so
let<00:01:37.450> me<00:01:37.510> explain<00:01:37.750> what<00:01:38.020> a<00:01:38.050> keyframe<00:01:38.440> is<00:01:38.710> a<00:01:38.920> key

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
let me explain what a keyframe is a key

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.610 
let me explain what a keyframe is a key
frame<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:39.760> frame<00:01:40.090> that<00:01:40.360> will<00:01:40.720> allow<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.200> to

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
frame is a frame that will allow you to

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.180 
frame is a frame that will allow you to
change<00:01:42.520> from<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:42.940> previous<00:01:43.330> frame<00:01:43.570> so<00:01:44.560> all

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
change from the previous frame so all

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.950 
change from the previous frame so all
these<00:01:45.520> little<00:01:46.030> circles<00:01:46.270> right<00:01:46.540> here<00:01:46.780> are

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
these little circles right here are

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.570 
these little circles right here are
empty<00:01:47.440> keyframes<00:01:48.010> and<00:01:49.830> empty<00:01:50.830> keyframe<00:01:51.310> means

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
empty keyframes and empty keyframe means

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.180 
empty keyframes and empty keyframe means
nothing<00:01:52.030> has<00:01:52.240> been<00:01:52.270> drawn<00:01:52.810> in<00:01:53.050> it<00:01:53.500> at<00:01:53.710> all

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
nothing has been drawn in it at all

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.210 
nothing has been drawn in it at all
so<00:01:54.400> I'll<00:01:55.030> get<00:01:55.120> my<00:01:55.180> paintbrush<00:01:56.040> fill<00:01:57.040> it<00:01:57.159> out

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
so I'll get my paintbrush fill it out

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.670 
so I'll get my paintbrush fill it out
like<00:01:57.520> that<00:01:57.690> see<00:01:58.690> now<00:01:58.930> it's<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.350> filled<00:01:59.590> out

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
like that see now it's a filled out

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.660 
like that see now it's a filled out
circle<00:02:00.100> right<00:02:00.729> there<00:02:00.940> in<00:02:01.090> seven<00:02:02.049> empty<00:02:02.290> circle

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
circle right there in seven empty circle

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.390 
circle right there in seven empty circle
that<00:02:03.670> means<00:02:03.729> is<00:02:04.180> not<00:02:05.170> an<00:02:05.350> empty<00:02:05.560> keyframe<00:02:06.159> it

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
that means is not an empty keyframe it

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.109 
that means is not an empty keyframe it
has<00:02:06.760> some<00:02:07.270> artwork<00:02:07.780> in<00:02:07.930> it<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:09.129> I<00:02:09.250> can<00:02:09.429> control

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
has some artwork in it if I can control

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.199 
has some artwork in it if I can control
Z<00:02:10.420> well<00:02:11.010> control<00:02:12.010> Z<00:02:12.190> is<00:02:12.310> undo<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:12.879> you<00:02:12.940> can<00:02:13.060> get

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
Z well control Z is undo so you can get

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.000 
Z well control Z is undo so you can get
rid<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:16.480> let's<00:02:16.900> let's<00:02:17.500> just<00:02:17.590> make<00:02:17.980> a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
rid of that so let's let's just make a

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.429 
rid of that so let's let's just make a
short<00:02:18.159> little<00:02:18.549> animation<00:02:19.029> right<00:02:19.180> here<00:02:19.439> let's

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
short little animation right here let's

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.320 
short little animation right here let's
I<00:02:20.889> don't<00:02:21.519> know<00:02:21.579> it's<00:02:21.790> draw<00:02:22.060> face<00:02:22.299> I<00:02:22.480> guess

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
I don't know it's draw face I guess

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.640 
there are in a second this is 24 frames
per<00:04:55.550> second<00:04:55.910> so<00:04:56.390> I<00:04:56.870> would<00:04:57.200> need<00:04:57.320> a<00:04:57.380> lot<00:04:57.620> of

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
per second so I would need a lot of

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.470 
per second so I would need a lot of
frames<00:04:57.920> to<00:04:58.040> take<00:04:58.220> up<00:04:58.310> a<00:04:58.400> second<00:04:58.760> just<00:04:59.030> to<00:04:59.180> show

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
frames to take up a second just to show

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.830 
frames to take up a second just to show
you<00:04:59.540> this<00:05:00.170> I'm<00:05:01.010> gonna<00:05:01.340> go<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.670> 12

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
you this I'm gonna go to 12

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.080 
you this I'm gonna go to 12
let's<00:05:03.230> see<00:05:03.530> that<00:05:03.860> that's<00:05:04.670> still<00:05:04.880> gonna<00:05:04.970> be

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
let's see that that's still gonna be

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.050 
let's see that that's still gonna be
really<00:05:05.240> fast<00:05:06.190> yeah<00:05:07.190> a<00:05:07.430> little<00:05:07.700> bit<00:05:07.820> a<00:05:08.000> little

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
really fast yeah a little bit a little

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.800 
really fast yeah a little bit a little
bit<00:05:08.180> slower<00:05:08.990> though<00:05:09.230> let's<00:05:10.160> go<00:05:10.540> let's<00:05:11.540> try

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
bit slower though let's go let's try

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.780 
bit slower though let's go let's try
like<00:05:12.050> three<00:05:14.950> there<00:05:15.950> we<00:05:16.040> go<00:05:16.160> there's<00:05:16.400> our<00:05:16.550> nice

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
like three there we go there's our nice

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.120 
like three there we go there's our nice
little<00:05:17.000> transition<00:05:17.890> beautiful<00:05:20.080> so<00:05:21.130> the

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
little transition beautiful so the

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.610 
little transition beautiful so the
higher<00:05:22.460> FPS<00:05:22.700> you<00:05:23.090> have<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.870> longer<00:05:24.530> it's

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
higher FPS you have the longer it's

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.000 
higher FPS you have the longer it's
going<00:05:24.740> to<00:05:24.830> take<00:05:25.010> to<00:05:25.460> do<00:05:25.580> an<00:05:25.670> animation<00:05:26.560> but<00:05:27.560> the

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
going to take to do an animation but the

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.240 
going to take to do an animation but the
smoother<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:28.520> transitions<00:05:29.180> have<00:05:29.660> to<00:05:29.780> be<00:05:30.250> so

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
smoother the transitions have to be so

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.120 
smoother the transitions have to be so
take<00:05:31.580> longer<00:05:31.850> but<00:05:32.390> it<00:05:32.510> won't<00:05:32.690> jump<00:05:33.050> like<00:05:33.710> like

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
take longer but it won't jump like like

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.250 
take longer but it won't jump like like
this<00:05:34.310> one<00:05:34.460> it<00:05:34.610> won't<00:05:34.730> go<00:05:35.030> you'll<00:05:35.540> be<00:05:35.570> a<00:05:35.990> really

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
this one it won't go you'll be a really

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.340 
this one it won't go you'll be a really
smooth<00:05:36.530> transition<00:05:36.700> now<00:05:37.700> if<00:05:37.850> you<00:05:37.940> do<00:05:38.350> lower

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
smooth transition now if you do lower

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.590 
smooth transition now if you do lower
fps<00:05:39.860> you<00:05:41.590> doesn't<00:05:42.590> take<00:05:42.740> nearly<00:05:43.010> as<00:05:43.250> long<00:05:43.600> but

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
fps you doesn't take nearly as long but

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.220 
fps you doesn't take nearly as long but
it's<00:05:44.810> really<00:05:45.080> choppy<00:05:45.440> like<00:05:45.890> that<00:05:46.930> so<00:05:47.930> yeah

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
it's really choppy like that so yeah

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.860 
it's really choppy like that so yeah
that's<00:05:48.470> that's<00:05:49.040> like<00:05:49.460> some<00:05:50.030> basics<00:05:50.450> like

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
that's that's like some basics like

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.640 
that's that's like some basics like
that's<00:05:51.110> some<00:05:51.290> really<00:05:51.770> basic<00:05:52.010> stuff<00:05:53.350> um<00:05:54.350> other

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
that's some really basic stuff um other

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.920 
that's some really basic stuff um other
things<00:05:54.710> size<00:05:55.640> of<00:05:55.880> the<00:05:55.940> paper<00:05:56.150> I<00:05:56.510> could<00:05:56.630> change

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
things size of the paper I could change

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.890 
things size of the paper I could change
it<00:05:57.220> I'll<00:05:58.220> make<00:05:58.490> it<00:05:58.610> a<00:05:58.760> thousand<00:05:59.330> make<00:05:59.600> it<00:05:59.810> go

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
it I'll make it a thousand make it go

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.260 
it I'll make it a thousand make it go
that<00:06:00.110> way<00:06:00.320> a<00:06:00.350> little<00:06:00.530> bit<00:06:00.880> see<00:06:01.880> then<00:06:02.120> I<00:06:02.240> can

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
that way a little bit see then I can

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.240 
that way a little bit see then I can
make<00:06:02.540> this<00:06:02.750> whatever<00:06:03.940> seven<00:06:04.940> 100<00:06:05.570> and<00:06:06.100> make<00:06:07.100> it

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
make this whatever seven 100 and make it

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.810 
make this whatever seven 100 and make it
go<00:06:07.730> deeper<00:06:08.030> down<00:06:08.150> if<00:06:08.630> you<00:06:08.780> go<00:06:09.050> up<00:06:09.800> here<00:06:10.040> you're

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
go deeper down if you go up here you're

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.670 
go deeper down if you go up here you're
going<00:06:10.940> to<00:06:11.000> have<00:06:11.120> it<00:06:11.270> so<00:06:11.480> it<00:06:11.630> fits<00:06:12.170> your<00:06:12.350> screen

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
going to have it so it fits your screen

going to have it so it fits your screen
fit<00:06:13.550> your<00:06:13.670> window<00:06:13.810> so<00:06:14.810> then<00:06:14.960> you<00:06:15.020> can<00:06:15.110> have

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230 
fit your window so then you can have

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.870 
fit your window so then you can have
everything<00:06:15.530> and<00:06:15.950> you<00:06:16.250> know<00:06:16.280> you<00:06:16.640> can<00:06:16.790> do

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
everything and you know you can do

whatever you want over here
so<00:06:19.990> everything<00:06:20.990> has<00:06:21.139> dimensions<00:06:21.680> YouTube<00:06:22.069> has

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
so everything has dimensions YouTube has

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.950 
so everything has dimensions YouTube has
dimensions<00:06:22.729> for<00:06:22.940> animation<00:06:23.479> so<00:06:23.630> if<00:06:23.720> you<00:06:23.780> want

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
dimensions for animation so if you want

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.270 
dimensions for animation so if you want
to<00:06:24.020> do<00:06:24.080> an<00:06:24.169> animation<00:06:24.500> correctly<00:06:25.009> you<00:06:25.130> can

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
to do an animation correctly you can

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.779 
to do an animation correctly you can
look<00:06:25.850> up<00:06:26.030> the<00:06:26.060> resolution<00:06:27.020> for<00:06:27.560> YouTube<00:06:27.979> 720p

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
look up the resolution for YouTube 720p

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:32.290 
look up the resolution for YouTube 720p
and<00:06:29.120> type<00:06:29.870> that<00:06:30.050> in<00:06:30.310> but<00:06:31.310> I'm<00:06:31.550> honestly<00:06:32.090> not

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
and type that in but I'm honestly not

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.580 
and type that in but I'm honestly not
putting<00:06:32.539> that<00:06:32.660> much<00:06:32.840> effort<00:06:33.020> into<00:06:33.319> it<00:06:33.440> right

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
putting that much effort into it right

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.629 
putting that much effort into it right
now<00:06:34.509> so<00:06:35.509> yeah<00:06:35.840> that's<00:06:36.199> way<00:06:37.039> beginner<00:06:37.340> stuff

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
now so yeah that's way beginner stuff

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.339 
now so yeah that's way beginner stuff
I'm<00:06:37.910> going<00:06:38.090> to<00:06:38.150> be<00:06:38.270> doing<00:06:38.419> some<00:06:38.660> stuff<00:06:39.110> later

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:39.349 
I'm going to be doing some stuff later

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
completely new to animation there you go

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.330 
completely new to animation there you go
there's<00:06:50.419> a<00:06:50.539> little<00:06:50.630> bit<00:06:50.990> and<00:06:51.259> I'll<00:06:51.979> see<00:06:52.220> you
