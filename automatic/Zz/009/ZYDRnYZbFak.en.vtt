00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
going to put a real iphone into it and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.100 
going to put a real iphone into it and
we're<00:00:32.579> just<00:00:32.700> going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.940> dip<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.270> into<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.780> sink

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
we're just going to dip it into the sink

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.110 
we're just going to dip it into the sink
of<00:00:34.260> water<00:00:34.290> one<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.430> things<00:00:35.610> i<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:35.940> trying

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
of water one of the things i was trying

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.790 
of water one of the things i was trying
to<00:00:36.180> figure<00:00:36.390> out<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.660> why<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.050> case<00:00:37.440> was<00:00:37.469> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
to figure out is why this case was a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.470 
to figure out is why this case was a
little<00:00:38.100> more<00:00:38.250> waterproof<00:00:38.550> than<00:00:38.910> others<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
little more waterproof than others and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.049 
little more waterproof than others and
as<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.829> tell<00:00:40.860> there<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.579> groove

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
as you can tell there is this groove

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.880 
as you can tell there is this groove
here<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> very<00:00:42.570> very<00:00:42.870> deep<00:00:43.140> groove<00:00:43.500> along<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
here a very very deep groove along the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.950 
here a very very deep groove along the
back<00:00:44.070> side<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.520> case<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.780> front

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
back side of the case and so the front

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.299 
back side of the case and so the front
cover<00:00:46.640> easily<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.910> slides<00:00:48.600> right<00:00:48.750> into<00:00:49.309> that

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
cover easily just slides right into that

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.250 
cover easily just slides right into that
groove<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.180> groove<00:00:51.420> now<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.809> very<00:00:52.050> very

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
groove and that groove now is very very

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.040 
groove and that groove now is very very
deep<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.910> now<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.210> case<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.660> fully

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
deep and so now the case is fully

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.130 
deep and so now the case is fully
installed<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.920> my<00:00:56.430> guess<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.910> because<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
installed and my guess is because the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.049 
installed and my guess is because the
water<00:00:58.379> pressure<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:59.070> actually<00:00:59.489> pushing<00:00:59.879> on

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
water pressure is actually pushing on

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.510 
water pressure is actually pushing on
the<00:01:00.090> side<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.719> case<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.020> because<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the side of the case and because the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.399 
the side of the case and because the
seal<00:01:02.940> isn't<00:01:03.180> actually<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> middle<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
seal isn't actually in the middle of the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.070 
seal isn't actually in the middle of the
case<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.159> provides<00:01:05.460> better<00:01:05.729> protection

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
case that it provides better protection

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.590 
case that it provides better protection
that's<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.350> only<00:01:07.740> reason<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.220> i<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.760> kind

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
that's the only reason that i can kind

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.870 
that's the only reason that i can kind
of<00:01:09.720> hypothesize<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.619> terms<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.130> why<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.460> case

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
of hypothesize in terms of why this case

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.490 
of hypothesize in terms of why this case
is<00:01:11.909> much<00:01:12.210> more<00:01:12.390> waterproof<00:01:12.689> than<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.110> lifeproof

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
is much more waterproof than a lifeproof

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.050 
is much more waterproof than a lifeproof
fre<00:01:13.650> or<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> new<00:01:14.400> tower<00:01:14.670> preserver<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.380> are

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
fre or a new tower preserver so we are

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.120 
fre or a new tower preserver so we are
going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.150> take<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.390> apart<00:01:18.600> again<00:01:18.890> got<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> real

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
going to take it apart again got a real

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.690 
going to take it apart again got a real
live<00:01:20.369> phone<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:21.330> turning<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:22.520> install<00:01:23.520> it

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
live phone it's turning on install it

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.789 
live phone it's turning on install it
and<00:01:24.150> we're<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.659> going<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.900> quickly<00:01:25.140> dump<00:01:25.619> it

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
and we're just going to quickly dump it

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.100 
and we're just going to quickly dump it
in<00:01:26.270> I'm<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.479> make<00:01:27.600> sure<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:30.110> case

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
in I'm going to make sure that the case

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.749 
in I'm going to make sure that the case
is<00:01:31.140> all<00:01:32.360> installed<00:01:33.360> properly<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> we've<00:01:35.460> got

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
is all installed properly so we've got

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.950 
is all installed properly so we've got
the<00:01:35.880> video<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.299> we're<00:01:36.630> not<00:01:36.750> actually

if you dropped into a grody a parking

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.990 
if you dropped into a grody a parking
lot<00:01:56.280> puddle<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.159> case<00:02:02.340> has<00:02:02.520> two<00:02:02.729> plugs

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
lot puddle so this case has two plugs

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.300 
lot puddle so this case has two plugs
one<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.750> them<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.020> for<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.560> Lightning<00:02:05.159> port

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
one of them is for the Lightning port

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.440 
one of them is for the Lightning port
connector<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.880> other<00:02:06.030> one<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
connector and the other one is for the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.449 
connector and the other one is for the
headphone<00:02:06.869> jack<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.290> their<00:02:07.560> water<00:02:08.160> seal

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
headphone jack and their water seal

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.100 
headphone jack and their water seal
plugs<00:02:08.729> according<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.330> their<00:02:09.479> documentation

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
plugs according to their documentation

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.410 
plugs according to their documentation
and<00:02:10.530> they're<00:02:11.520> actually<00:02:11.879> pretty<00:02:12.030> simple

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
and they're actually pretty simple

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.370 
and they're actually pretty simple
they're<00:02:12.690> not

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
they're not

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.590 
they're not
nothing<00:02:14.340> fancy<00:02:14.550> there's<00:02:14.850> no<00:02:14.970> screw<00:02:15.270> plugs<00:02:15.510> or

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
nothing fancy there's no screw plugs or

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.850 
nothing fancy there's no screw plugs or
anything<00:02:15.930> they<00:02:16.080> just<00:02:16.110> come<00:02:16.410> out<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:16.650> this

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
anything they just come out like this

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.400 
anything they just come out like this
and<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:17.970> as<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.420> can<00:02:18.540> tell<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.840> inside<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
and so as you can tell the inside of the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.330 
and so as you can tell the inside of the
case<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.980> not<00:02:20.330> wet<00:02:21.330> same<00:02:22.080> with<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.950> headphone

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
case is not wet same with the headphone

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.360 
case is not wet same with the headphone
jack<00:02:23.660> not<00:02:24.660> wet<00:02:24.840> at<00:02:24.960> all<00:02:25.050> it's<00:02:25.320> pretty<00:02:26.040> simple

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
jack not wet at all it's pretty simple

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.560 
jack not wet at all it's pretty simple
case<00:02:26.730> it's<00:02:27.210> fairly<00:02:27.570> expensive<00:02:28.110> this<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:28.680> a

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
case it's fairly expensive this is a

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.260 
case it's fairly expensive this is a
just<00:02:30.570> as<00:02:30.720> much<00:02:30.960> as<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.260> other<00:02:31.530> cases<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.850> I'm

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
just as much as the other cases so I'm

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.980 
just as much as the other cases so I'm
going<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.510> turn<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.810> phone<00:02:34.080> off<00:02:35.450> peel<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.600> back

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.060 

so<00:02:39.990> that's<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.410> groove<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:40.770> was<00:02:40.920> talking

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
so that's the groove that I was talking

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:50.270 
so that's the groove that I was talking
about<00:02:46.340> inside<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.580> case<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:49.280> don't

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
about inside of the case I don't

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.420 
about inside of the case I don't
actually<00:02:50.520> see<00:02:50.700> any<00:02:50.820> water<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:53.010> back<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.340> the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
actually see any water the back of the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.470 
actually see any water the back of the
case<00:02:54.530> looks<00:02:55.530> completely<00:02:55.860> dry<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:57.030> we<00:02:57.120> toss<00:02:57.270> it

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
case looks completely dry so we toss it

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.760 
case looks completely dry so we toss it
around<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:57.990> water<00:02:58.230> let's<00:02:58.500> go<00:02:58.650> outside

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
around to in the water let's go outside

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.980 
around to in the water let's go outside
and<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.310> drop<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.760> on<00:02:59.850> some<00:03:00.030> concrete<00:03:00.480> because

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
and a drop it on some concrete because

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.130 
and a drop it on some concrete because
that's<00:03:01.140> what<00:03:01.290> we<00:03:01.410> do<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:03.720> phone<00:03:03.960> actually

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
that's what we do the phone actually

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.700 
that's what we do the phone actually
moves<00:03:04.500> inside<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.010> case<00:03:06.410> it's<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.500> little

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
moves inside the case it's a little

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.950 
moves inside the case it's a little
annoying<00:03:08.030> alright<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.240> we're<00:03:09.390> outside<00:03:09.720> we're

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
annoying alright so we're outside we're

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.470 
annoying alright so we're outside we're
going<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.140> do<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.320> drop<00:03:10.560> test<00:03:11.150> got<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> camera

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
going to do the drop test got a camera

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.010 
going to do the drop test got a camera
there<00:03:12.780> we<00:03:13.560> have<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:14.130> iphone<00:03:14.970> 5s<00:03:15.020> recording

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
there we have a iphone 5s recording

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.820 
there we have a iphone 5s recording
slow-mo<00:03:16.500> that<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.550> tool<00:03:18.270> at<00:03:18.750> most<00:03:19.500> three

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
slow-mo that is a tool at most three

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.320 
slow-mo that is a tool at most three
case<00:03:20.130> that<00:03:20.430> we<00:03:20.550> are<00:03:20.730> currently<00:03:21.000> reviewing

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
case that we are currently reviewing

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.300 
case that we are currently reviewing
this<00:03:21.990> case<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.440> don't<00:03:22.620> think<00:03:22.800> is<00:03:22.890> going<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.160> come

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
this case I don't think is going to come

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.070 
this case I don't think is going to come
apart<00:03:23.640> just<00:03:24.060> because<00:03:24.150> how<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.690> wraps<00:03:24.840> around

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
apart just because how it wraps around

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.660 
apart just because how it wraps around
the<00:03:25.350> entire<00:03:25.410> back<00:03:25.920> of<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.160> case<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.520> don't

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
the entire back of the case I don't

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.910 
the entire back of the case I don't
think<00:03:26.880> there's<00:03:27.000> going<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.240> be<00:03:27.300> any<00:03:27.360> problem

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
think there's going to be any problem

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.870 
think there's going to be any problem
when<00:03:28.920> we're<00:03:29.070> not<00:03:29.160> going<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.340> have<00:03:29.430> any<00:03:29.580> problem

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
when we're not going to have any problem

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.720 
when we're not going to have any problem
with<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.060> case<00:03:30.300> coming<00:03:30.570> apart<00:03:31.610> it'll<00:03:32.610> be

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
with the case coming apart it'll be

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.010 
with the case coming apart it'll be
interesting<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:33.180> see<00:03:33.270> and<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.720> don't<00:03:33.930> even

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
interesting to see and I don't even

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.200 
interesting to see and I don't even
think<00:03:34.170> how<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.740> case<00:03:35.070> is<00:03:35.100> set<00:03:35.550> up<00:03:35.700> there<00:03:36.090> is

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
think how the case is set up there is

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.940 
think how the case is set up there is
that<00:03:36.420> sled<00:03:36.840> that<00:03:36.960> you<00:03:37.080> put<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.290> phone<00:03:37.620> in<00:03:37.800> and

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
that sled that you put the phone in and

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.250 
that sled that you put the phone in and
you<00:03:38.010> wrap<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.370> case<00:03:38.430> around<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.540> sled<00:03:39.810> wraps

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
you wrap this case around the sled wraps

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.960 
you wrap this case around the sled wraps
around<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.590> corners<00:03:40.950> of<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.190> iphone<00:03:41.550> so<00:03:41.790> be

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
around the corners of the iphone so be

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.910 
around the corners of the iphone so be
really<00:03:42.360> tough<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:43.020> break<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.470> iphone

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
really tough to it break the iphone

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.670 
really tough to it break the iphone
screen<00:03:44.220> as<00:03:44.370> well<00:03:44.580> i<00:03:44.640> think<00:03:44.820> so<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:46.230> know<00:03:46.350> this

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
screen as well i think so you know this

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.500 
screen as well i think so you know this
is<00:03:46.740> about<00:03:47.040> five<00:03:47.310> feet

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.770 

it<00:03:53.409> bounces<00:03:53.830> really<00:03:54.129> well<00:03:54.280> though<00:03:54.519> I<00:03:54.730> do<00:03:55.689> have

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
it bounces really well though I do have

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.550 
it bounces really well though I do have
to<00:03:56.080> make<00:03:56.230> a<00:03:56.470> note<00:03:56.680> about<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:59.049> quality<00:03:59.530> of

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
to make a note about the the quality of

I'm<00:05:12.370> a<00:05:12.729> little<00:05:13.000> annoyed<00:05:13.300> with<00:05:13.539> with<00:05:13.750> this<00:05:13.900> case

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
but in terms of protection I do think it

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.629 
but in terms of protection I do think it
will<00:05:15.940> suffice<00:05:16.440> the<00:05:17.440> screen<00:05:17.740> usability<00:05:18.190> is
