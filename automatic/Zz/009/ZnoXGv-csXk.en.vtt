each way you do a little bit more
rolling<00:00:48.930> then<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.890> don't<00:00:50.070> end<00:00:50.250> up<00:00:50.280> with<00:00:50.430> a

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
rolling then you don't end up with a

long thin strip more square bit which is

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.600 
long thin strip more square bit which is
a<00:00:54.690> bit<00:00:54.809> easier<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.170> work<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:56.309> want<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.520> do

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
a bit easier to work with you want to do

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.860 
a bit easier to work with you want to do
it<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.789> about<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> half<00:00:57.390> centimeters

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.700 
it to about one and a half centimeters
thick<00:00:59.120> then<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.480> use<00:01:00.660> your<00:01:00.809> circular<00:01:01.230> cookie

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
thick then you use your circular cookie

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.630 
thick then you use your circular cookie
cutter<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.579> cut<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.760> circle<00:01:03.059> out<00:01:04.460> that's<00:01:05.460> going

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
to be basics with your witches face we

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.600 
to be basics with your witches face we
don't<00:01:08.789> want<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> completely<00:01:09.479> round<00:01:10.020> face<00:01:10.399> so<00:01:11.399> if

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
don't want a completely round face so if

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.770 
don't want a completely round face so if
you<00:01:11.729> pinch<00:01:12.060> either<00:01:12.450> side<00:01:13.310> at<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> bottom<00:01:14.850> you

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
you pinch either side at the bottom you

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.760 
you pinch either side at the bottom you
can<00:01:15.840> sort<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.200> make<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.619> bit<00:01:16.800> of<00:01:16.830> an<00:01:17.039> ugly<00:01:17.399> chin

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
can sort of make a bit of an ugly chin

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.910 
can sort of make a bit of an ugly chin
and<00:01:19.770> then<00:01:20.159> with<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> little<00:01:20.700> bit<00:01:21.650> more<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
and then with a little bit more of the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.190 
and then with a little bit more of the
light<00:01:23.100> cream<00:01:23.750> you're<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> make<00:01:25.080> this

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
light cream you're going to make this

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.289 
light cream you're going to make this
into<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> no<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.130> she<00:01:26.189> not<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.430> sticky<00:01:26.939> on<00:01:27.060> those

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
into a no so she not I sticky on those

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.969 
into a no so she not I sticky on those
you<00:01:28.290> roll<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.619> into<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.860> ball<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:30.950> kind<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
you roll it into a ball and kind of

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.819 
you roll it into a ball and kind of
pinch<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.170> make<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> pyramid

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
pinch it so you make like a pyramid

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.450 
pinch it so you make like a pyramid
shape<00:01:36.710> now<00:01:37.710> I'm<00:01:37.770> going<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.009> stick<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.310> on

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
shape now I'm going to stick that on

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.679 
shape now I'm going to stick that on
there<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.790> make<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.119> little<00:01:39.210> bit<00:01:39.360> easier<00:01:39.659> to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
there to make it a little bit easier to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.630 
there to make it a little bit easier to
stick<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.799> you're<00:01:40.890> fingering<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.340> no<00:01:41.549> you

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
stick but you're fingering that no you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.980 
stick but you're fingering that no you
don't<00:01:41.820> need<00:01:41.939> much<00:01:42.180> water<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.780> put<00:01:42.900> your

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
don't need much water so just put your

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.160 
don't need much water so just put your
finger<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.909> dampen<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.060> little<00:01:45.180> bit<00:01:45.479> back<00:01:46.140> a

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
finger in dampen it a little bit back a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.980 
finger in dampen it a little bit back a
little<00:01:46.470> bit<00:01:46.649> where<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.920> want<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.159> nose<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.520> go

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
little bit where you want the nose to go

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.700 
little bit where you want the nose to go
and<00:01:48.990> push<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.380> together<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.880> kind<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.710> splurge

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
and push it together and kind of splurge

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.120 
and push it together and kind of splurge
it<00:01:52.890> around<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.369> little<00:01:53.399> bit<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:55.920> goes

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
it around a little bit so it all goes

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.399 
it around a little bit so it all goes
into<00:01:56.850> one

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
into one

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.080 
into one
rather<00:01:59.100> than<00:01:59.310> being<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.609> something<00:01:59.999> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
rather than being just something you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.279 
rather than being just something you
stock<00:02:00.299> up<00:02:00.329> because<00:02:00.509> if<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.780> don't<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.229> you

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
stock up because if you don't if you

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:02.630 
stock up because if you don't if you
don't<00:02:01.439> use<00:02:01.590> water<00:02:01.859> it<00:02:02.069> might<00:02:02.219> break<00:02:02.399> off<00:02:02.609> from

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
don't use water it might break off from

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.430 
don't use water it might break off from
you<00:02:02.850> cook

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.210 

now<00:02:11.659> the<00:02:12.659> math<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:13.140> use<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.500> right<00:02:13.709> so<00:02:14.159> we

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
now the math we use the right so we

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.220
