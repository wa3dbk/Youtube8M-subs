00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.540 
okay it's like a hardshell case kind of
like<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.750> ifrogz<00:02:13.590> looks<00:02:13.950> if<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.250> remember

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
like the ifrogz looks if you remember

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.610 
like the ifrogz looks if you remember
that<00:02:14.580> from<00:02:14.819> back<00:02:15.270> in<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.450> day<00:02:15.690> that's

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
that from back in the day that's

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.900 
that from back in the day that's
actually<00:02:16.950> what<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.130> case<00:02:17.310> feels<00:02:17.580> like<00:02:17.760> and

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
actually what this case feels like and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.699 
actually what this case feels like and
it's<00:02:18.030> actually<00:02:18.300> just<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.630> cover<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.470> goes<00:02:19.560> on

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
it's actually just a cover that goes on

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.370 
it's actually just a cover that goes on
the<00:02:19.800> back<00:02:19.950> it's<00:02:20.130> not<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.250> full-featured<00:02:20.850> case<00:02:21.090> I

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
the back it's not a full-featured case I

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.180 
the back it's not a full-featured case I
covers<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.500> front<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.770> everything<00:02:23.069> it's

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
covers the front and everything it's

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.309 
covers the front and everything it's
just<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.430> outer<00:02:23.640> shell<00:02:24.030> but<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.989> gives<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.230> a

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
just the outer shell but it gives it a

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.990 
just the outer shell but it gives it a
nice<00:02:25.470> little<00:02:25.709> look<00:02:26.040> as<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.610> see<00:02:26.730> right<00:02:26.790> there
