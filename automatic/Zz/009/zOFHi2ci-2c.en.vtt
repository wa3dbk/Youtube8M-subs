00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
 nowadays the global economic situation forced parents to work and in 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.059
 many cases children are left at home accompanied by television 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.259
 This is changing our culture and values ​​because we know that our 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.789
 experiences condition our way of thinking and seeing reality 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.280
 these children are making their first experiences through these 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.300
 media 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.050
 now 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.499
 Did you know 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:32.829
 that 75% of media advertising is paid by the fifty 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.970
 most powerful corporations 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.280
 these multi-million dollar figures 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.110
 make producers adapt their programs to the demands 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.080
 of these multinationals 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.590
 recently most of the television channels 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.910
 film producers 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.960
 daily radios and international magazines have been bought by 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.850
 these corporations 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.350
 first let's see how television affects us the more time you look at the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.680
 television more easily the brain enters a state called level 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.540
 alpha 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.380
 the characteristics of this state 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.880
 is when we relax and we remain conscious but as between asleep and 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.240
 awake 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.130
 this state allows a quick learning since it can be processed 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.930
 a lot of information efficiently 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.400
 images and suggestions are implanted directly in the mind without 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.540
 actively participate 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.160
 this produces a hypnotic effect on us 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
 spokespersons for these tasks 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.360
 On the other hand, violent images stimulate our fighting instinct and 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.360
 competition 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.570
 but since it does not make sense to react to the violence of the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.870
 television or the playlist edition the emotions provoked are suppressed 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.590
 thus entering a spiral of impulses 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.370
 that are repressed 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.420
 When the cycle ends there is a sensation of acceleration that leaves us 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.630
 restless and produces hyperactivity in children 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.020
 the images are combined and happening quickly maintaining 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.119
 our attention without pause 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.679
 this type of demand in our concentration is not usual 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.980
 when we pay it and we go back to reality 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.260
 we feel that everything is slower and in tedious cases 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.659
 but in addition to the violence 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.450
 the boys are constantly exposed to advertising that encourages them to want 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:34.169
 compulsively a series of unnecessary products thus generating a 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.409
 consumer generation unable to defend 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.469
 for not being aware of what they have been induced 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.480
 for a methodical and well-studied propaganda 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.679
 that excites them constantly 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:50.219
 also the values ​​are affected since in many cases the advertising 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.449
 highlights the value of a person just because of their sexual attractiveness 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.429
 and at an increasingly early age 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:59.589
 and all this so that they consume and spend fashion 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:03.319
 very strange and superficial concepts are presented 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.200
 about ways to relate sexuality romance and success as if they were guidelines 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.299
 normal 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.549
 in some cases it tries to tell us who we are and who we should 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.170
 be and children are not sufficiently protected against these 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:19.339
 messages 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:23.489
 the new generations are being bombarded with deceptive advertising 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.010
 to turn them into compulsive consumers 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.870
 in a world that is voting 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.870
 and polluting the remaining resources 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.189
 the lack of exercise that causes sitting for hours 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:49.219
 and the indiscriminate consumption of products with preservatives fat and sugar 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:54.370
 causes various health problems diabetes obesity and over excitement 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.389
 in cases the latter are medicated to calm them down 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:02.939
 please leave your comment with ideas on what can be done to 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:04.150
