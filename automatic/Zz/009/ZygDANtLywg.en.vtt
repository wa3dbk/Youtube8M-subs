00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
different time and the part that's

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.270 
different time and the part that's
interests<00:01:48.629> us<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.989> not<00:01:49.319> the<00:01:49.440> spiny<00:01:49.770> bits<00:01:50.039> which

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
interests us is not the spiny bits which

it's the yellow flowers which are
beautiful<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.349> this<00:01:56.280> time<00:01:56.429> of<00:01:56.550> year<00:01:56.729> we<00:01:57.479> have

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
beautiful and this time of year we have

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.990 
beautiful and this time of year we have
quite<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> lot<00:01:57.989> of<00:01:58.020> them<00:01:58.340> in<00:01:59.340> some<00:01:59.550> places<00:01:59.759> it

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
quite a lot of them in some places it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.729 
quite a lot of them in some places it
looks<00:02:00.149> like<00:02:00.239> a<00:02:00.270> complete<00:02:00.810> yellow<00:02:01.110> carpet<00:02:01.590> but

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:01.739 
looks like a complete yellow carpet but

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:03.619 
looks like a complete yellow carpet but
if<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.459> just<00:02:02.819> have<00:02:02.940> a<00:02:02.970> nibble<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:03.450> leaves

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:03.629 
if you just have a nibble on the leaves

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:08.660 
if you just have a nibble on the leaves
I<00:02:06.470> think<00:02:07.470> they<00:02:07.530> taste<00:02:07.709> like<00:02:07.830> almonds<00:02:08.429> some

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
I think they taste like almonds some

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.070 
I think they taste like almonds some
people<00:02:08.849> say<00:02:09.000> coconut<00:02:09.509> they've<00:02:09.750> got<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> really

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
people say coconut they've got a really

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.250 
people say coconut they've got a really
interesting<00:02:10.819> flavor<00:02:11.819> all<00:02:12.269> of<00:02:12.420> their<00:02:12.540> own

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.190 

we've<00:02:16.920> moved<00:02:17.129> away<00:02:17.310> from<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.819> sand<00:02:18.720> dune<00:02:18.900> area

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
we've moved away from the sand dune area

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.170 
we've moved away from the sand dune area
now<00:02:19.319> we're<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.680> an<00:02:19.800> area<00:02:19.980> that's<00:02:20.730> effectively

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
now we're in an area that's effectively

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.970 
now we're in an area that's effectively
salt<00:02:21.510> marsh<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.230> tide<00:02:22.409> comes<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:22.890> out

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
salt marsh so the tide comes in and out

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.979 
salt marsh so the tide comes in and out
not<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:23.909> much<00:02:24.120> once<00:02:24.510> or<00:02:24.659> twice<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.959> year

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
not so much once or twice a year

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.500 
not so much once or twice a year
probably<00:02:25.349> at<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.709> height<00:02:25.920> but<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.030> effect

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
probably at this height but the effect

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.119 
probably at this height but the effect
is<00:02:27.629> that<00:02:27.900> certain<00:02:28.260> plants<00:02:28.590> will<00:02:28.739> grow<00:02:28.890> here

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
is that certain plants will grow here

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.339 
is that certain plants will grow here
that<00:02:29.250> would<00:02:29.370> grow<00:02:29.610> anywhere<00:02:29.879> else<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:31.230> this

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
that would grow anywhere else and this

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.930 
that would grow anywhere else and this
is<00:02:31.409> one<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.739> best<00:02:31.950> examples<00:02:32.549> it's<00:02:32.760> called

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
is one of the best examples it's called

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.720 
is one of the best examples it's called
sea<00:02:33.150> beet<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.569> it's<00:02:34.560> actually<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.370> ancestor

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
sea beet and it's actually the ancestor

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.910 
sea beet and it's actually the ancestor
all<00:02:36.170> commercially<00:02:37.170> available<00:02:37.230> beets<00:02:37.739> so

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
all commercially available beets so

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.720 
all commercially available beets so
that's<00:02:38.099> beetroot<00:02:38.549> sugar<00:02:39.360> beet<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:41.549> root

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
that's beetroot sugar beet the root

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.550 
that's beetroot sugar beet the root
itself<00:02:42.030> snot<00:02:42.299> actually<00:02:42.540> worth<00:02:42.690> bothering

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
itself snot actually worth bothering

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.410 
itself snot actually worth bothering
with<00:02:43.590> but<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.459> leaves<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.879> like<00:02:45.000> spinach

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
with but the leaves that like spinach

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.819 
with but the leaves that like spinach
they're<00:02:45.629> really<00:02:45.840> good<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.470> if<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.680> want<00:02:46.799> to

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
they're really good so if you want to

00:02:46.829 --> 00:03:07.069 
they're really good so if you want to
have<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> try<00:02:47.159> of<00:02:47.280> one<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.489> those<00:02:47.579> I<00:03:05.660> think<00:03:06.660> this

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
have a try of one of those I think this

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.990 
have a try of one of those I think this
is<00:03:07.200> probably<00:03:07.470> one<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.859> the<00:03:08.370> nicest<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.849> all

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
is probably one of the the nicest of all

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.039 
is probably one of the the nicest of all
the<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.890> seashore<00:03:10.890> salt<00:03:11.310> marsh<00:03:11.579> plants<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:12.510> bit

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
the the seashore salt marsh plants a bit

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.300 
the the seashore salt marsh plants a bit
of<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.200> salty<00:03:13.530> flavor<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.010> but<00:03:14.129> it<00:03:14.190> goes

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
of a salty flavor to it but it goes

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.210 
of a salty flavor to it but it goes
really<00:03:14.489> well<00:03:14.579> with<00:03:14.730> fish<00:03:15.060> which<00:03:16.220> ideal

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
really well with fish which ideal

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.710 
really well with fish which ideal
because<00:03:17.459> if<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.730> go<00:03:17.849> fishing<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.209> can<00:03:18.299> pick

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
because if you go fishing you can pick

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.629 
because if you go fishing you can pick
some<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:19.109> on<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.560> way<00:03:19.680> back<00:03:19.859> you<00:03:20.549> like<00:03:21.150> it

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.430 

very<00:03:26.639> very<00:03:26.819> common<00:03:27.120> on<00:03:27.359> salt<00:03:27.690> marshes<00:03:27.989> places

useful plant tastes really good it's
going<00:05:03.910> to<00:05:03.970> be<00:05:04.169> strange<00:05:05.169> aniseed<00:05:05.740> flavor<00:05:06.040> to<00:05:06.280> it

and the leaves can be boiled as well and

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.040 
and the leaves can be boiled as well and
they<00:05:09.430> soften<00:05:09.760> up<00:05:09.850> one<00:05:10.000> there<00:05:10.210> when<00:05:10.750> they<00:05:10.840> cook
