00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
turret of the season I think that had

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.880 
turret of the season I think that had
the<00:02:10.580> team<00:02:10.960> played<00:02:11.960> more<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.380> his<00:02:12.530> own<00:02:12.710> when

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
the team played more of his own when

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.740 
the team played more of his own when
instead<00:02:13.130> of<00:02:13.220> playing<00:02:13.460> man<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.360> we<00:02:14.450> did<00:02:14.630> him

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
instead of playing man and we did him

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.020 
instead of playing man and we did him
more<00:02:14.990> they<00:02:15.950> should<00:02:16.250> have<00:02:16.370> went<00:02:16.520> for<00:02:16.730> gonna

ways<00:03:51.239> Bennington<00:03:52.109> come<00:03:52.650> on<00:03:53.659> can<00:03:54.659> also<00:03:54.780> he's

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
ways Bennington come on can also he's

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.050 
ways Bennington come on can also he's
probably<00:03:55.260> working<00:03:55.590> with<00:03:55.739> Troy<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:56.760> trained<00:03:57.000> a

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
probably working with Troy you trained a

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:45.320 
probably working with Troy you trained a
lot<00:03:57.150> of<00:03:57.209> athletes<00:04:43.310> so<00:04:44.310> I<00:04:44.340> think<00:04:44.490> only<00:04:44.940> contain

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
lot of athletes so I think only contain

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.760 
lot of athletes so I think only contain
work<00:04:45.539> one<00:04:45.690> is<00:04:45.810> gain<00:04:45.990> off<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.289> dribble<00:04:46.470> and

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
work one is gain off the dribble and

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.040 
work one is gain off the dribble and
