00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
here we've got everything else so oh

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.950 
here we've got everything else so oh
yeah<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.180> first<00:00:48.360> time<00:00:48.510> I've<00:00:48.780> seen

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
yeah this is a the first time I've seen

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.180 
yeah this is a the first time I've seen
this<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.260> their<00:00:49.440> motherboards<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:50.070> they've

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
this on their motherboards but they've

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.650 
this on their motherboards but they've
been<00:00:50.309> doing<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.789> video<00:00:51.059> cards<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:51.629> a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
been doing this on video cards for a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.590 
been doing this on video cards for a
couple<00:00:51.989> generations<00:00:52.320> now<00:00:52.710> military<00:00:53.670> class<00:00:54.000> so

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
couple generations now military class so

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.229 
couple generations now military class so
that<00:00:54.750> means<00:00:54.930> they<00:00:55.079> are<00:00:55.199> using<00:00:55.699> top<00:00:56.699> components

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that means they are using top components

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.479 
that means they are using top components
has<00:00:57.329> military<00:00:57.600> quality<00:00:58.260> whatever<00:00:59.010> so

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
has military quality whatever so

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.099 
has military quality whatever so
basically<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.120> means<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.660> they're<00:01:00.840> using

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
basically that means that they're using

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.759 
basically that means that they're using
only<00:01:01.500> military<00:01:02.280> grade<00:01:02.789> components<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:04.110> high<00:01:04.439> C

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
only military grade components so high C

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.350 
only military grade components so high C
CAP<00:01:05.040> eight<00:01:05.280> times<00:01:05.519> longer<00:01:05.670> lifespan<00:01:06.180> they're

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
CAP eight times longer lifespan they're

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.109 
CAP eight times longer lifespan they're
using<00:01:06.689> IC<00:01:07.080> Cho<00:01:07.290> 20<00:01:07.650> C<00:01:07.830> lower<00:01:08.430> temperatures<00:01:09.090> and

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
using IC Cho 20 C lower temperatures and

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.120 
using IC Cho 20 C lower temperatures and
then<00:01:09.450> all<00:01:09.630> solid<00:01:09.990> caps<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.409> 10-years<00:01:10.770> ultra

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
then all solid caps for 10-years ultra

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.870 
then all solid caps for 10-years ultra

long life time

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.490 
long life time
basically<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:12.630> they're<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
basically what they're going for is the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.710 
basically what they're going for is the
best<00:01:13.850> possible<00:01:14.850> stability<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.509> longevity

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
best possible stability and longevity

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.080 
best possible stability and longevity
with<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.530> motherboard<00:01:17.009> everything<00:01:17.939> there

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
with this motherboard everything there

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.060 
with this motherboard everything there
we've<00:01:18.270> already<00:01:18.450> covered<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.200> has<00:01:19.470> dr.<00:01:19.920> Moss

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
we've already covered it has dr. Moss

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.340 
we've already covered it has dr. Moss
and<00:01:20.430> MSI's<00:01:21.270> claim<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.869> haven't<00:01:22.200> seen

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
and MSI's claim and I haven't seen

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.929 
and MSI's claim and I haven't seen
anything<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.740> disprove<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.700> one

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
anything to disprove this is that one

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.179 
anything to disprove this is that one
phase<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.360> dr.<00:01:24.750> Moss<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.259> greater<00:01:25.860> than<00:01:26.070> or

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
phase of dr. Moss is greater than or

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.670 
phase of dr. Moss is greater than or
equal<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.640> four<00:01:27.060> standard<00:01:27.659> phases<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.229> MOSFETs

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
equal to four standard phases of MOSFETs

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.380 
equal to four standard phases of MOSFETs
so<00:01:29.280> they<00:01:29.460> switch<00:01:29.759> very<00:01:30.030> fast<00:01:30.329> they<00:01:31.020> are<00:01:31.400> I<00:01:32.400> just

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
so they switch very fast they are I just

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.890 
so they switch very fast they are I just
did<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.659> again

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
did it again

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.800 
did it again
oh<00:01:34.079> yeah<00:01:35.040> basically<00:01:35.610> dr.<00:01:36.090> Moss<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.540> really

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
oh yeah basically dr. Moss is really

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.940 
oh yeah basically dr. Moss is really
good<00:01:36.960> that's<00:01:37.350> what<00:01:37.500> they<00:01:37.619> say

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
good that's what they say

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.740 
good that's what they say
Vladdy<00:01:38.310> eight<00:01:38.490> pipe<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:39.299> radiating

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
Vladdy eight pipe that's radiating

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.870 
Vladdy eight pipe that's radiating
solution<00:01:40.439> oh<00:01:40.470> okay<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.070> basically<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.700> keeps

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
solution oh okay so basically it keeps

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.670 
solution oh okay so basically it keeps
the<00:01:42.000> heat<00:01:42.119> pipe<00:01:42.299> nice<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.720> low<00:01:42.840> profile<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:43.500> it

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the heat pipe nice and low profile as it

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.100 
the heat pipe nice and low profile as it
comes<00:01:44.070> along<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.399> motherboard<00:01:44.899> okay<00:01:45.899> let's

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
comes along the motherboard okay let's

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.810 
comes along the motherboard okay let's
get<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.350> opened<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.310> quick<00:01:47.549> look<00:01:47.729> at

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
get this opened up have a quick look at

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
plug the whole thing in as a brick to

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.400 
plug the whole thing in as a brick to
the<00:03:32.100> motherboard<00:03:32.370> very<00:03:32.790> neat<00:03:33.000> then<00:03:33.690> we<00:03:33.900> have<00:03:34.109> a

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
the motherboard very neat then we have a

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.349 
the motherboard very neat then we have a
crossfire<00:03:34.889> bridge<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:36.000> motherboard

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
crossfire bridge so this motherboard

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.410 
crossfire bridge so this motherboard
being<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.290> an<00:03:37.709> AMD<00:03:38.100> chips<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:38.850> motherboard

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
being a an AMD chips that motherboard

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.849 
being a an AMD chips that motherboard
890<00:03:40.230> FX<00:03:40.739> chip<00:03:41.010> set<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:41.700> not<00:03:42.389> SLI<00:03:43.170> compatible

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
890 FX chip set is not SLI compatible

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.640 
890 FX chip set is not SLI compatible
however<00:03:44.359> this<00:03:45.359> is<00:03:45.720> probably<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.440> coolest

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
however this is probably the coolest

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.830 
however this is probably the coolest
thing<00:03:47.069> about<00:03:47.250> this<00:03:47.730> motherboard<00:03:48.329> and<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:48.690> I'm

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
thing about this motherboard and so I'm

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.259 
thing about this motherboard and so I'm
gonna<00:03:48.959> skip<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.920> usual<00:03:50.430> stuff<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.030> show

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
gonna skip the usual stuff that I show

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.610 
gonna skip the usual stuff that I show
you<00:03:51.329> right<00:03:51.540> away<00:03:51.600> I'm<00:03:51.930> gonna<00:03:52.079> show<00:03:52.319> you<00:03:52.380> this

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
you right away I'm gonna show you this

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.949 
you right away I'm gonna show you this
right<00:03:53.099> off<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.340> bat<00:03:53.489> this<00:03:54.209> motherboard<00:03:54.599> is<00:03:54.930> a

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
right off the bat this motherboard is a

there<00:05:15.740> I<00:05:15.980> assure<00:05:16.400> you<00:05:16.430> it<00:05:16.640> is<00:05:16.760> okay<00:05:17.510> what<00:05:17.720> else

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
there I assure you it is okay what else

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.420 
there I assure you it is okay what else
do<00:05:18.020> we<00:05:18.050> have<00:05:18.140> I'm<00:05:18.500> gonna<00:05:18.680> see<00:05:18.860> if<00:05:18.950> I<00:05:19.040> can<00:05:19.220> find

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
do we have I'm gonna see if I can find

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.720 
do we have I'm gonna see if I can find
any<00:05:19.580> other<00:05:19.670> voltage<00:05:20.180> check<00:05:20.420> points<00:05:20.780> here<00:05:20.960> and

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
any other voltage check points here and

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.770 
any other voltage check points here and
I'm<00:05:22.730> just<00:05:22.910> gonna<00:05:23.000> put<00:05:23.240> this<00:05:23.360> down<00:05:23.540> on<00:05:23.750> the

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
I'm just gonna put this down on the

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.020 
I'm just gonna put this down on the
table<00:05:24.260> so<00:05:24.740> we<00:05:24.770> can<00:05:24.890> have<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.220> better<00:05:25.400> look<00:05:25.730> under

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
table so we can have a better look under

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.160

the<00:05:26.150> good<00:05:26.300> light<00:05:27.640> um-hmm<00:05:28.730> not<00:05:29.240> so<00:05:29.480> much<00:05:29.690> so<00:05:29.930> far

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
the good light um-hmm not so much so far

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.900 
the good light um-hmm not so much so far
well<00:05:30.440> I'm<00:05:31.010> not<00:05:31.160> gonna<00:05:31.310> worry<00:05:31.520> too<00:05:31.730> much<00:05:31.760> about

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
well I'm not gonna worry too much about

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.550 
well I'm not gonna worry too much about
that<00:05:32.150> for<00:05:32.540> now<00:05:32.570> why<00:05:32.840> don't<00:05:32.870> we<00:05:33.020> have<00:05:33.170> a<00:05:33.200> look<00:05:33.380> at

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
that for now why don't we have a look at

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.960 
that for now why don't we have a look at
what<00:05:33.710> else<00:05:33.860> this<00:05:34.010> board<00:05:34.280> has<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.610> offer

sensitive<00:06:19.760> buttons<00:06:19.820> the<00:06:20.240> first<00:06:20.450> time<00:06:20.600> I<00:06:20.630> saw

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
sensitive buttons the first time I saw

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.710 
sensitive buttons the first time I saw
this<00:06:21.080> was<00:06:21.620> on<00:06:21.770> the<00:06:21.890> p55<00:06:22.370> GD<00:06:22.910> 80<00:06:23.150> and<00:06:23.390> I'm<00:06:23.480> glad

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
this was on the p55 GD 80 and I'm glad

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.120 
this was on the p55 GD 80 and I'm glad
that<00:06:23.930> they're<00:06:24.080> continuing<00:06:24.440> to<00:06:24.860> do<00:06:24.980> this

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
that they're continuing to do this

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.260 
that they're continuing to do this
because<00:06:25.370> I<00:06:25.460> think<00:06:25.520> it's<00:06:25.730> so<00:06:25.880> cool

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
because I think it's so cool

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.870 
because I think it's so cool
then<00:06:26.630> we<00:06:26.780> have<00:06:26.930> a<00:06:26.960> little<00:06:27.230> OCD<00:06:27.380> dial<00:06:27.830> so<00:06:28.400> that

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
then we have a little OCD dial so that

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.820 
then we have a little OCD dial so that
seems<00:06:29.120> pretty<00:06:29.300> self-explanatory<00:06:29.530> plus<00:06:30.530> and

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
seems pretty self-explanatory plus and

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.060 
seems pretty self-explanatory plus and
minus<00:06:31.190> depending<00:06:31.490> on<00:06:31.790> how<00:06:31.970> fast<00:06:32.180> you<00:06:32.360> want<00:06:32.540> the

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
minus depending on how fast you want the

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.600 
minus depending on how fast you want the
CPP's<00:06:33.970> tip<00:06:34.290> cpu<00:06:35.290> to<00:06:35.410> go<00:06:35.560> then<00:06:36.040> there's<00:06:36.280> an<00:06:36.370> OC

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
CPP's tip cpu to go then there's an OC

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.130 
CPP's tip cpu to go then there's an OC
dial<00:06:36.790> button<00:06:37.000> I'm<00:06:37.150> guessing<00:06:37.480> that<00:06:37.570> enables<00:06:38.020> it

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
dial button I'm guessing that enables it

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.540 
dial button I'm guessing that enables it
and<00:06:38.320> then<00:06:38.530> we<00:06:38.650> have<00:06:38.800> their<00:06:39.040> green<00:06:39.310> power

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
and then we have their green power

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.570 
and then we have their green power
button<00:06:39.850> okay<00:06:40.630> then<00:06:40.810> we<00:06:40.960> have<00:06:40.990> three<00:06:41.590> USB<00:06:41.920> 2.0

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
button okay then we have three USB 2.0

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.090 
button okay then we have three USB 2.0
front<00:06:42.940> headers<00:06:43.270> we<00:06:43.750> have<00:06:44.020> firewire<00:06:44.650> two

firewire<00:06:45.970> front<00:06:46.300> headers<00:06:46.630> and<00:06:46.840> then<00:06:47.500> in

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
firewire front headers and then in

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.010 
firewire front headers and then in
addition<00:06:47.860> to<00:06:48.160> that<00:06:48.280> we<00:06:48.610> have<00:06:48.910> not<00:06:49.270> a<00:06:49.300> whole<00:06:49.690> lot

here<00:06:53.140> and<00:06:53.260> see<00:06:53.380> if<00:06:53.470> I<00:06:53.560> can<00:06:53.740> find<00:06:53.950> like<00:06:54.310> a<00:06:54.600> CPU

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
here and see if I can find like a CPU

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.570 
here and see if I can find like a CPU
voltage<00:06:55.810> readout<00:06:56.440> point<00:06:56.770> or<00:06:57.100> anything<00:06:57.280> like

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
voltage readout point or anything like

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.790 
voltage readout point or anything like
that<00:07:00.750> you<00:07:01.750> know<00:07:01.870> what<00:07:02.080> it<00:07:02.350> might<00:07:02.560> be<00:07:02.680> there

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
that you know what it might be there

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.620 
that you know what it might be there
somewhere<00:07:03.190> if<00:07:03.400> you<00:07:03.550> can<00:07:03.760> find<00:07:03.970> it<00:07:04.150> feel<00:07:04.420> free

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:04.630 
somewhere if you can find it feel free

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.180 
somewhere if you can find it feel free
to<00:07:04.660> leave<00:07:04.840> a<00:07:04.900> comment<00:07:05.350> on<00:07:05.440> my<00:07:05.590> video<00:07:05.830> and<00:07:06.070> let

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
to leave a comment on my video and let

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.950 
to leave a comment on my video and let
me<00:07:06.220> know<00:07:06.340> where<00:07:07.180> it<00:07:07.450> is

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
me know where it is

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.850 
me know where it is
let's<00:07:08.110> have<00:07:08.260> a<00:07:08.320> look<00:07:08.470> at<00:07:08.560> the<00:07:08.680> back<00:07:08.830> panel

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:08.860 
let's have a look at the back panel

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.160 
let's have a look at the back panel
connectors<00:07:09.580> oh<00:07:09.760> cameraman<00:07:10.510> wants<00:07:10.630> to<00:07:10.840> look<00:07:10.990> at

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.170 
connectors oh cameraman wants to look at

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.550 
connectors oh cameraman wants to look at
that

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 
that

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.700 
that
sweet<00:07:12.540> erm<00:07:13.540> the<00:07:13.780> Northbridge<00:07:14.260> cooling

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:14.710 
sweet erm the Northbridge cooling

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.770 
sweet erm the Northbridge cooling
solution<00:07:15.130> I<00:07:15.190> think<00:07:15.430> that<00:07:15.880> is<00:07:16.060> very<00:07:16.120> cool<00:07:16.570> I

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:16.780 
solution I think that is very cool I

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.630 
solution I think that is very cool I
really<00:07:16.840> like<00:07:17.290> it<00:07:17.470> actually<00:07:17.830> here<00:07:18.220> get<00:07:18.400> it<00:07:18.520> from

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:18.640 
really like it actually here get it from

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.830 
really like it actually here get it from
this<00:07:18.730> angle<00:07:18.880> from<00:07:19.330> this<00:07:19.480> angle

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 
this angle from this angle

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.010 
this angle from this angle
see<00:07:20.500> these<00:07:20.830> are<00:07:20.980> actually<00:07:21.490> wavy<00:07:21.910> in<00:07:22.540> order<00:07:22.900> to

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.020 
see these are actually wavy in order to

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.920 
see these are actually wavy in order to
give<00:07:23.170> it<00:07:23.320> slightly<00:07:23.890> more<00:07:24.280> surface<00:07:24.670> area<00:07:24.880> and<00:07:25.270> a

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:25.930 
give it slightly more surface area and a

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.420 
give it slightly more surface area and a
little<00:07:26.200> bit<00:07:26.320> better<00:07:26.500> turbulence<00:07:27.130> for<00:07:27.310> any

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:27.430 
little bit better turbulence for any

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.040 
little bit better turbulence for any
airflow<00:07:27.820> that<00:07:28.000> does<00:07:28.240> happen<00:07:28.450> to<00:07:28.720> go<00:07:28.840> through

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.050 
airflow that does happen to go through

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.220 
airflow that does happen to go through
there<00:07:29.200> very<00:07:29.410> cool<00:07:30.120> okay<00:07:31.120> oh<00:07:31.420> yeah<00:07:31.720> I<00:07:31.750> guess<00:07:32.080> the

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:32.230 
there very cool okay oh yeah I guess the

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.510 
there very cool okay oh yeah I guess the
rest<00:07:32.350> of<00:07:32.560> the<00:07:32.650> slots<00:07:32.890> I<00:07:33.040> didn't<00:07:33.220> even<00:07:33.340> talk

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 
rest of the slots I didn't even talk

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.850 
rest of the slots I didn't even talk
about<00:07:33.580> there's<00:07:34.210> one<00:07:34.390> more<00:07:34.510> PCIe<00:07:34.990> 1x<00:07:35.260> slot<00:07:35.680> and

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
about there's one more PCIe 1x slot and

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.190 
about there's one more PCIe 1x slot and
a<00:07:35.920> PCI<00:07:36.220> slot<00:07:36.610> as<00:07:36.730> if<00:07:36.850> anyone<00:07:37.060> cares<00:07:37.420> if<00:07:37.900> you<00:07:38.080> buy

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:38.200 
a PCI slot as if anyone cares if you buy

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.170 
a PCI slot as if anyone cares if you buy
this<00:07:38.260> motherboard<00:07:38.740> do<00:07:39.400> me<00:07:39.520> a<00:07:39.580> favor<00:07:39.820> and<00:07:40.030> load

this motherboard do me a favor and load

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.580 
this motherboard do me a favor and load
it<00:07:40.300> up<00:07:40.390> with<00:07:40.570> a<00:07:40.600> bunch<00:07:40.750> of<00:07:40.900> graphics<00:07:41.290> cards

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:41.590 
it up with a bunch of graphics cards

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.520 
it up with a bunch of graphics cards
because<00:07:41.770> that<00:07:41.980> is<00:07:42.250> what<00:07:42.520> it<00:07:42.700> is<00:07:42.730> for<00:07:43.530> okay
