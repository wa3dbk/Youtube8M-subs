00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.560 
they're just put a tiny six and a tiny
two<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:25.770> A<00:04:25.950> three<00:04:25.979> so<00:04:26.790> you<00:04:26.880> can<00:04:27.030> actually<00:04:27.210> fill

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
two and A three so you can actually fill

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.930 
two and A three so you can actually fill
it<00:04:27.660> up<00:04:27.780> with<00:04:27.840> all<00:04:28.289> of<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.650> numbers<00:04:28.800> but<00:04:29.760> that

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
it up with all of the numbers but that

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.129 
it up with all of the numbers but that
would<00:04:30.090> be<00:04:30.120> a<00:04:30.270> bit<00:04:30.419> pointless<00:04:31.380> cosmic

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
would be a bit pointless cosmic

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.379 
would be a bit pointless cosmic
I'm<00:04:34.139> going<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.350> change<00:04:34.560> that<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.680> it<00:04:34.830> too<00:04:35.010> I<00:04:35.389> no

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
I'm going to change that to it too I no

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.840 
I'm going to change that to it too I no
idea<00:04:36.660> how<00:04:36.750> well<00:04:36.930> I'm<00:04:37.050> doing<00:04:37.610> so<00:04:38.610> actually

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
idea how well I'm doing so actually

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.980 
idea how well I'm doing so actually
that's<00:04:38.940> let's<00:04:39.270> get<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:39.480> information<00:04:39.630> how<00:04:39.930> am

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
that's let's get the information how am

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.600 
that's let's get the information how am
i<00:04:40.050> doing<00:04:40.230> so<00:04:40.260> far<00:04:40.350> some<00:04:41.160> values<00:04:41.490> are

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
i doing so far some values are

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.480 
i doing so far some values are
duplicated<00:04:42.180> one<00:04:42.720> or<00:04:42.810> more<00:04:42.900> rows<00:04:43.110> columns<00:04:44.100> or

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
duplicated one or more rows columns or

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.580 
duplicated one or more rows columns or
blocks<00:04:44.820> contain<00:04:45.389> the<00:04:45.570> same<00:04:45.750> digit<00:04:46.110> twice<00:04:46.320> so

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
blocks contain the same digit twice so

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.530 
blocks contain the same digit twice so
I'm<00:04:46.650> not<00:04:46.770> doing<00:04:46.950> too<00:04:47.400> brilliantly<00:04:47.850> so<00:04:48.060> far<00:04:48.300> and

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
concept I think so if I put those in I

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.480 
concept I think so if I put those in I
don't<00:05:40.830> know<00:05:41.419> i'm<00:05:42.419> not<00:05:42.780> going<00:05:43.140> to<00:05:43.490> the

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.490 
a fan of playing sudoku this is a must
must<00:06:30.810> have<00:06:31.560> I<00:06:31.860> I<00:06:32.190> think<00:06:33.000> it<00:06:33.150> works<00:06:33.900> beautifully

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500

and<00:06:35.450> maybe<00:06:36.450> a<00:06:36.600> bit<00:06:36.750> expensive<00:06:37.050> but<00:06:37.440> I

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
and maybe a bit expensive but I

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.860 
and maybe a bit expensive but I
definitely<00:06:38.850> think<00:06:39.210> it'd<00:06:39.390> be<00:06:39.419> worth<00:06:39.690> it

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
definitely think it'd be worth it
