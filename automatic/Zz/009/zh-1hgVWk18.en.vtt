let's<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.970> say<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.360> theory<00:01:39.689> there<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.409> some

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
let's just say in theory there is some

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.100 
let's just say in theory there is some
meat<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.520> bone<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.180> story<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:42.810> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
meat on the bone of this story as a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.200 
meat on the bone of this story as a
former<00:01:43.560> quarterback<00:01:43.880> how<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> world

former quarterback how in the world
would<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.630> actually<00:01:46.079> pull<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.500> off<00:01:47.750> look

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
would you actually pull this off look

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.270 
would you actually pull this off look
I'm<00:01:48.930> kind<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.439> shaking<00:01:49.680> my<00:01:49.890> head<00:01:50.130> I'm

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
I'm kind of shaking my head I'm

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.980 
I'm kind of shaking my head I'm
wondering<00:01:50.700> how<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.909> pull<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.390> off<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.810> mean<00:01:51.960> I

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
wondering how you pull it off I mean I

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.899 
wondering how you pull it off I mean I
know<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.409> competitor<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.070> was<00:01:53.430> playing

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
know the competitor that I was playing

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.580 
know the competitor that I was playing
football<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.360> know<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.899> competitor<00:01:55.409> that

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
football I know that the competitor that

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.679 
football I know that the competitor that
Jameis<00:01:56.369> Winston<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.090> think<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.420> would<00:01:57.540> be

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
Jameis Winston is I think it would be

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.080 
Jameis Winston is I think it would be
extremely<00:01:58.320> hard<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.890> be<00:01:59.009> focused<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.880> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
extremely hard to be focused on that you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.660 
extremely hard to be focused on that you
know<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> friend<00:02:00.570> high<00:02:01.350> school<00:02:01.680> trying<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.130> get

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
know a friend high school trying to get

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.940 
know a friend high school trying to get
him<00:02:02.820> some<00:02:03.000> money<00:02:03.119> somehow<00:02:03.719> but<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.829> know

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
him some money somehow but you know

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.139 
him some money somehow but you know
you've<00:02:05.100> got<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.549> game<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.909> bigger

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
you've got that the game is bigger

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.550 
you've got that the game is bigger
there's<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.600> there's<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.930> much<00:02:07.110> out<00:02:07.380> there

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
there's so there's so much out there

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.199 
there's so there's so much out there
that<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.799> need<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.009> focus<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.789> would<00:02:08.970> find

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
that you need to focus on I would find

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.969 
that you need to focus on I would find
it<00:02:09.360> difficult<00:02:09.390> for<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.349> happen<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.770> mean<00:02:10.890> I

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
it difficult for this to happen I mean I

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.290 
it difficult for this to happen I mean I
agree<00:02:11.280> with<00:02:11.400> Dave<00:02:11.610> what'd<00:02:11.910> he<00:02:12.030> say

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
agree with Dave what'd he say

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.740 
agree with Dave what'd he say
there<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.570> just<00:02:12.870> think<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:14.040> know<00:02:14.190> it's

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
there I just think that you know it's

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.270 
there I just think that you know it's
you<00:02:15.750> know<00:02:15.870> it's<00:02:16.080> it's<00:02:16.350> something<00:02:16.710> though<00:02:17.010> that

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
you know it's it's something though that

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.160 
you know it's it's something though that
when<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.520> comes<00:02:17.730> up<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.180> it's<00:02:18.300> Jameis<00:02:18.690> Winston

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
when it comes up and it's Jameis Winston

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.170 
when it comes up and it's Jameis Winston
and<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:20.010> look<00:02:20.220> at<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.430> past<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.030> what's

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
and and you look at the past and what's

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.330 
and and you look at the past and what's
happened<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:22.440> know<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.620> kind<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.220> go

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
happened and you know you kind of go

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.300 
happened and you know you kind of go
geez<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.970> mean<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.470> could<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.560> be<00:02:25.680> true<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.190> you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
geez I mean it could it be true and you

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.150 
geez I mean it could it be true and you
make<00:02:26.460> us<00:02:26.640> all<00:02:26.790> wonder<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:28.170> know<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.290> from<00:02:29.130> a

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
make us all wonder and you know I from a

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.890 
make us all wonder and you know I from a
player's<00:02:29.640> perspective<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:30.330> think<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.660> would<00:02:30.780> be

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
player's perspective I think it would be

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.770 
player's perspective I think it would be
difficult<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:32.070> go<00:02:32.220> ahead<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.550> do<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.780> but

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
difficult to go ahead and do that but

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.830 
difficult to go ahead and do that but
again<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.920> kind<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.640> torn<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:36.000> mean<00:02:36.150> it's<00:02:36.390> it's

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
again I I kind of torn I mean it's it's

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.330 
again I I kind of torn I mean it's it's
like<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.230> know<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.410> look<00:02:37.680> at<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.860> character

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
like you know you look at the character

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.000 
like you know you look at the character
that<00:02:38.670> excuse<00:02:39.030> me<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.240> character<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:40.020> what

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
that excuse me the character of what

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.250 
that excuse me the character of what
Jameis<00:02:41.460> Winston<00:02:42.060> has<00:02:42.300> brought<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.930> table

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260

Winston again no matter how good he is

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.580 
Winston again no matter how good he is
because<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.880> what<00:03:27.030> he's<00:03:27.150> doing<00:03:27.480> off<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.350> field

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
because of what he's doing off the field

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.220 
because of what he's doing off the field
and<00:03:29.310> what<00:03:29.700> he's<00:03:29.850> bringing<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.390> their<00:03:30.750> team<00:03:31.020> in

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230

the university in college football in
the<00:03:32.940> Heisman<00:03:33.300> Trophy<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.170> think<00:03:34.620> that

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
the Heisman Trophy so I think that

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.130 
the Heisman Trophy so I think that
voters<00:03:35.220> are<00:03:35.640> in<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:36.030> position<00:03:36.209> now<00:03:36.570> to<00:03:36.720> start

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
voters are in a position now to start

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.370 
voters are in a position now to start
thinking<00:03:37.650> more<00:03:37.920> about<00:03:38.220> okay<00:03:38.910> who's<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.050> best

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
thinking more about okay who's the best

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.490 
thinking more about okay who's the best
player<00:03:40.800> on<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.700> field<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.239> also<00:03:42.840> who's<00:03:43.290> the

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.470 
player on the field and also who's the
best<00:03:43.770> player<00:03:43.980> off<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.430> field<00:03:44.880> when<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.300> comes

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
best player off the field when it comes
