was<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.450> couple<00:03:57.810> seconds<00:03:58.110> faster<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:59.069> know

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
was a couple seconds faster you know

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.770 
was a couple seconds faster you know
came<00:03:59.430> here<00:03:59.640> you<00:03:59.760> might<00:03:59.940> be<00:04:00.060> disappointed<00:04:00.180> and

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780

came here you might be disappointed and
is<00:04:00.900> an<00:04:01.620> end<00:04:01.890> result<00:04:02.130> but<00:04:02.550> I<00:04:02.610> think<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.300> overall

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
is an end result but I think the overall

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.510 
is an end result but I think the overall
results<00:04:04.170> really<00:04:04.680> good<00:04:04.920> for<00:04:05.190> him<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.550> know

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.690 
yeah I think they both left everything
