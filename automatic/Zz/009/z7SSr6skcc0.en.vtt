00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.830
 in 1919 cart framework worked 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.600
 selling canned milk in china it 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.250
 He proposed to learn all about milk 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.740
 from its nutritional properties 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.560
 up the natural processes for its 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.419
 production interested especially 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.910
 how nutrition affected the health of 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.249
 the dairy cows intrigued him to see 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.710
 that the animals with greater health were 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:34.410
 those who were fed only 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.500
 with honey or alfalfa as well as 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.510
 knows and water that was all and were the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.640
 best animals produced the greatest 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.890
 amount of milk gained the most 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.219
 amount of weight had the most beautiful 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.250
 fur and others and that intrigued him is 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.140
 really interesting I thought if you were 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.539
 ask people where it comes from the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.149
 Most milk calcium has no 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.429
 no idea the calcium really comes from 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.079
 the plant materials that cows 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.879
 ingest 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.220
 concluding that green plants are 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.490
 an important source of nutrients 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.160
 Carl started experimenting when he returned 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.390
 to the united states he spent seven years 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.980
 developing his first supplement 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.290
 food 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.090
 nutrilife continues looking for answers to 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.360
 the questions that carol had 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.480
 some years the concept of protein 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.300
 100% vegetable powder it born 7 years 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.340
 I have been working with 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.470
 scientists in china and with our group 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.410
 of concentrate scientists based 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.440
 in california to resume the philosophy 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.590
 from which he left car rehnborg 75 ago 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.660
 years so the concept of transforming 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.210
 our protein powder so that it was 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.630
 completely vegetable had a lot 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.910
 felt today every container of 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.100
 100% vegetable protein powder 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.710
 nutrilife is filled with the goodness of the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.540
 soybeans and wheat from farms 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.480
 quality in europe canada in north america 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.180
 as we know cart was going to an adventure 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.530
 that still does not end this is just the 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.509
 continuation of the trip 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.000
 and that trip is what he has done to 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.360
 nutrilife be clearly the leader in 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.819
 food supplements for more than 75 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.250
 years since the integration of alfalfa 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:25.510
 until the new formula of the protein in 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.030
 100% vegetable nutrilife powder continues the 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.160
 legacy of providing nature and science to 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.160
 please people from all over the world
