these<00:03:47.540> were<00:03:47.780> actually<00:03:48.410> I<00:03:48.680> think<00:03:49.190> like<00:03:50.200> 250<00:03:51.200> or

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
these were actually I think like 250 or

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.430 
these were actually I think like 250 or
maybe<00:03:51.769> less<00:03:52.130> each<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:53.120> I<00:03:53.269> think<00:03:53.450> I<00:03:53.510> paid<00:03:53.720> $14

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
maybe less each and I think I paid $14

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.620 
maybe less each and I think I paid $14
for<00:03:54.709> five<00:03:54.980> of<00:03:55.010> them<00:03:55.400> um<00:03:55.970> so<00:03:56.209> I<00:03:56.269> thought<00:03:56.480> that

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
for five of them um so I thought that

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.300 
for five of them um so I thought that
