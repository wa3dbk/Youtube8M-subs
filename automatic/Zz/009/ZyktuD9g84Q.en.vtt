00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.770
 how 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.340
 do not 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.830
 I'm going to come here to the area more light 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.190
 look now these two areas are good for me 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:59.080
 so you can see the complication 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:03.020
 we are in the area of mechanics understand 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.600
 how does this empathy work in 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.540
 us that in humans that 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.060
 we tell them in a complex culture 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.670
 It is very busy and if you are also 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.780
 professional help and care 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.420
 is more involved that's what has 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:25.590
 invited me to tell 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.330
 I'll tell you with a mirror neuron that 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.310
 I have managed to borrow in a 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.900
 important laboratory 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.590
 although in reality 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.710
 how 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.039
 there are many cuts I was told that of 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.750
 ask a serious laboratory that I have not 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.760
 gone to the Chinese who are next to me 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.310
 home 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.340
 that have given me a mirror neuron 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.290
 that's how you see connections 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:00.100
 with all the brain everywhere and 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:04.870
 it works and a voltage prix and it works 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:13.360
 as well, you observe from according to 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:16.320
 It reverberates something by you and I think you 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.320
 is that they have left me 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.790
 calm I come another equal 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.200
 is 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.220
 here 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.190
 let's go if something shocks you because you 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.470
 you get excited and affects up to you 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.960
 below and it is sent to all 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.840
 connections and also if you follow 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.290
 affecting things as everything you have 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.290
 it affects 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:52.990
 and you have to give of yourself and take care of more 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:56.569
 people will never, ever, ever 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:00.400
 up to where the success empathy 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.400
 this question will fall into the exam 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.519
 yes why 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:15.490
 each organism is each organism and has 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:19.030
 a give of himself to a point and then 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.090
 it ends and there is also a tendency to give 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.020
 not 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.950
 and recover 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:32.390
 who is informed of being informed 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:38.330
 about your ability to give of yourself and 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:43.220
 need to stop and give of not so this 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:47.060
 is the matter because if driven by the 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.160
 impulse from within or demanded by the 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.070
 circumstances that you get a job 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.900
 from eight in the morning to three in the afternoon 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.350
 you have to be with people in a 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.110
 urgency of hospital where comes what 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:04.730
 comes and each one is more moving than 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:10.510
 the other one because there is no human being designed 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.510
 so I can be 8 to 3 like this 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.359
 so as this is not at level 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.659
 earth 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:23.039
 then the negotiations of the 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:26.770
 organism and I'm still in the 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:30.250
 Mechanics department is interesting 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:34.900
 know that we are still talking about 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:38.139
 something that works with its operation 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.750
 and that self-regulates as it can and that 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.870
 hopefully 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.440
 soon you become aware of this not 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.950
 will it be that 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.740
 by the excessive abuse of giving of oneself to 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.750
 everything they sue you because if you also 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.200
 remains sensitive when going out to 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:00.260
 three that are waiting for others and like you 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.680
 you are also a person as god 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:07.439
 it is pointed to three ongs one 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:11.319
 foundation and something more 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:13.300
 when you want to realize it, he told you 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:16.960
 and your organism from top to bottom and 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.880
 ok I can not go to bed anymore 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.600
 but maybe you do not take it for 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.600
 aware 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.350
 how 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.380
 I do not 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.080
 i
