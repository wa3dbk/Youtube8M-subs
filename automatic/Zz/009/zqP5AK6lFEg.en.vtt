really light and minisode promise a
battery<00:01:42.479> life<00:01:42.689> or<00:01:43.549> ten<00:01:44.549> days<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:45.000> usage<00:01:45.420> 50

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
battery life or ten days for usage 50

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.710 
battery life or ten days for usage 50
days<00:01:46.049> for<00:01:46.409> standby<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.729> takes<00:01:48.030> about<00:01:48.149> two<00:01:48.479> to

pair<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.399> with<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.700> galaxy<00:01:54.090> s4<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.630> see<00:01:54.840> how

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
pair it with the galaxy s4 and see how

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.700 
pair it with the galaxy s4 and see how
it<00:01:55.110> works<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.829> opening<00:01:56.729> up<00:01:56.850> my<00:01:57.030> galaxy<00:01:57.479> s4
