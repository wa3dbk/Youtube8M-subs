00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.310
 Last year there were mainly about which for seven months spent on a government 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.320
 and geert wilders recently engaged in a movie 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.830
 They were all about virtually everything going to make it all much faster in the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.220
 scene in the minute and all play along but I am still looking for one 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.219
 area a history piece of the event 8 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.189
 we do to the final between May the men 8 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.679
 the historic moment for this event is still in it 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.599
 the first final at the ox 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.869
 but those people who were going to win watch TV 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.510
 this is very exciting, the votes have been counted 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.960
 I am thus the CEO 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.110
 region 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.540
 neither so far 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.910
 jamai if you win what are you going to do the guy posted 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.660
 I did a raid though that we are sponsoring again I think I'll be right inside 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.890
 where bruce lee 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.670
 the votes are counted that I already told that I now have a man in it 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.420
 buoys arkel 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.420
 the field with a 9 billion 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.530
 love clashed 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.630
 that's not it 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.720
 it is impossible to tell 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.730
 as someone here 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.119
 and the winner 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.299
 a standard like a job there will probably be a few more 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.310
 hello everyone exactly has to go to advertising then better 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.969
 now i really want to see this scene but in one 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.969
 the special movie stars on the market 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.530
 where are we going to view these now 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.530
 in horst 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.040
 Yes 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.470
 it was a shame but I have never had it so easy 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.750
 are typically counted 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.720
 know that your mobile phone employs people 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.779
 You can see this moment 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:13.219
 company in this period 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.280
 three years 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.599
 and so to drive 4 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.599
 Something grows out of you too 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.219
 no and now again 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:28.069
 only one goal 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.159
 a hearing in his country still there can go to the arena 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.150
 and finally I want an exciting emotion because I want an extreme 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.649
 emotion is unlikely 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:47.789
 sacha little 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.789
 would be unlikely 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.679
 what a shit 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:59.749
 clubs that way you had more neighbors who had back that 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:05.060
 haha nice the american yes dude 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.060
 I don't know when that is 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.139
 the votes have been counted 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.399
 yes I have to enable 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:16.999
 but if you are you are going to do protesters to go 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.569
 laura and the winner of but that is not really nice twice 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.569
 to win 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:36.989
 of course even more
