00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.390
 very good today I show you how simple 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.820
 what is to prepare these lemon powders 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.600
 they are so easy to make that even 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.860
 the smallest of the house can help 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.890
 they are very creamy and they are delicious 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.190
 We are going to need 525 grams of milk 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.190
 skimmed 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:28.230
 370 grams of condensed milk 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.960
 170 grams of fresh lemon juice 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.519
 squeezed 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.840
 and a mold for poles 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:38.620
 we started pouring the condensed milk 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.620
 in a bowl 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.900
 then we add half of the milk 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.900
 skimmed and mixed 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.740
 when it has been integrated let's pour the 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:58.270
 rest of the milk and we mix again 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.270
 we add in half the lemon juice 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.990
 and we remove 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.540
 we add the rest of the juice and mix 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.180
 a little more when we take the juice of 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.040
 lemon seems that the mixture is cut but 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.140
 in removing very well all the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.700
 ingredients come together again when 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.620
 all the ingredients have been 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.830
 integrated we will have a mixture 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.380
 slightly thick 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.860
 finally we fill our mold to 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.860
 poles 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.550
 and keep in the freezer at least 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.550
 about 4 hours 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.600
 and once frozen we can already 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.270
 enjoy and refresh with our 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.549
