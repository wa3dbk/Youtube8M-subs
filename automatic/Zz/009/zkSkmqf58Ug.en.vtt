like this ready to move ready to use

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.230 
like this ready to move ready to use
let's<00:01:11.310> also<00:01:11.520> look<00:01:11.729> at<00:01:12.300> how<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.810> works<00:01:14.030> in<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
let's also look at how it works in the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:53.899 
let's also look at how it works in the
back<00:01:15.450> here<00:01:16.369> these<00:01:17.369> two<00:01:17.610> legs<00:01:52.280> here<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.429> a<00:01:53.460> pisco

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
back here these two legs here is a pisco

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.419 
back here these two legs here is a pisco
foam<00:01:54.539> mattress<00:01:55.080> that's<00:01:55.289> memory<00:01:55.800> foam<00:01:56.069> and

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
foam mattress that's memory foam and

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.749 
foam mattress that's memory foam and
it's<00:01:57.210> got<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> beautiful<00:01:57.600> microfiber<00:01:58.530> cover<00:01:59.490> on

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
it's got a beautiful microfiber cover on

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.660 
it's got a beautiful microfiber cover on
it<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:01.560> mattress<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:02.340> very<00:02:03.240> comfortable<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
it the mattress is very comfortable and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.310 
it the mattress is very comfortable and
here's<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.759> key<00:02:06.060> thing<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.600> think<00:02:06.840> about<00:02:06.960> which

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
here's a key thing to think about which

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.889 
here's a key thing to think about which
is<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.649> economics<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.549> the<00:02:08.970> extra<00:02:09.269> bed<00:02:09.450> mobile

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
is the economics of the extra bed mobile

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.759 
is the economics of the extra bed mobile
wall<00:02:10.079> bed<00:02:10.940> when<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.060> consider<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
wall bed when you consider that the

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.069 
wall bed when you consider that the
mattress<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.579> not<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.850> separate<00:02:15.390> purchase<00:02:15.660> that

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
mattress is not a separate purchase that

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.759 
mattress is not a separate purchase that
you<00:02:16.200> have<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.440> go<00:02:16.560> out<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.829> buy<00:02:17.090> separately

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
you have to go out and buy separately

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.100 
you have to go out and buy separately
there's<00:02:19.769> no<00:02:20.010> cost<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.840> installation<00:02:21.840> or

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
there's no cost of installation or

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.620 
there's no cost of installation or
assembly<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.860> kind<00:02:23.220> since<00:02:23.519> there<00:02:24.030> isn't<00:02:24.269> any

it<00:02:25.410> actually<00:02:25.890> becomes<00:02:26.280> by<00:02:26.850> far<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.299> most

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
it actually becomes by far the most

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.920 
it actually becomes by far the most
economical<00:02:28.440> wall<00:02:28.680> bed<00:02:28.920> solution<00:02:29.609> as<00:02:29.790> well<00:02:30.660> as

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
economical wall bed solution as well as

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.500 
economical wall bed solution as well as
having<00:02:31.410> some<00:02:31.799> different<00:02:32.519> features<00:02:33.000> its

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
having some different features its

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.900 
having some different features its
mobility<00:02:34.079> that<00:02:34.859> make<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.250> different<00:02:35.489> from<00:02:35.790> a

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
mobility that make it different from a

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.810 
mobility that make it different from a
conventional<00:02:36.570> wall<00:02:36.780> bed<00:02:37.160> so<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.430> hope<00:02:38.609> that

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
conventional wall bed so I hope that

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.120 
conventional wall bed so I hope that
