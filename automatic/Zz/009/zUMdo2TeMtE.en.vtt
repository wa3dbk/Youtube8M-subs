00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 filthy son and I lodge forcing a 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.500
 new video all about the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.099
 lipsticks rather rises tus 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.620
 but do you dare this pure for an application 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.440
 perfect perfect 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.529
 so for starters I start 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.619
 always with a bob baum look good 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.580
 to the lips it's no roof bearing 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:31.099
 which but without colors I love 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.219
 the stick EIOPC their original bah 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.059
 here 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.520
 then me what I do I take the 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.790
 lipstick and if today I have the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.610
 arms 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.190
 the designers at mac is all 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.170
 new to me but it's a in 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.210
 colors that I've been charging since very 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.149
 very long I take the kills why 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.350
 and then I apply it but it's never 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.350
 perfect in my opinion 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.990
 and then I do that 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:23.090
 so saft is the first state then 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.640
 I take a year that I do not have what we 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:31.340
 said in French I forget to but we 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:35.320
 take this and then you shape yourself 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:39.040
 of your mouths to improve 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.040
 down the line 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:55.990
 then I take my brush 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.180
 correct to is still actors today 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.159
 I use that of che and art which is 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.060
 a waregem weapon that I admire a lot 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.250
 so we just take a tiny 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:13.200
 few correctors or not 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:16.989
 and then here and I do the same but it 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.650
 really perfect to operate the line and 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.950
 it gives a very nice effect for 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:29.130
 more launched his mouth to do it a 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.130
 little more obvious here 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:47.170
 in fact to avoid lipstick 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.540
 to donations I take in law I do that 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.659
 and that taste here is the red 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.359
 lips that will have arrived on the teeth you 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.909
 So here late last I do 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:04.090
 I use an arm powder like 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:07.390
 those of nars here and I take 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.489
 a brush I use that's where you 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.709
 can see that there is a little slack 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.819
 the lips same source has but we take 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:18.569
 we take the pulse dhr here you are 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.569
 and 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.560
 this is indeed very dull 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.830
 for lipstick if you prefer 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.280
 in luc different golos what you need 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.610
 to put the gloss down well after you 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.830
 do this but the powder is done 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.170
 really lipstick so that's it 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.760
 why do I do it then I hope that 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.080
 this video will have pleased you 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.080
