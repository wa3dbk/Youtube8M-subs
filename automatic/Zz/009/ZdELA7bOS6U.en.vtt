 check 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.010
 excellent for the peeping 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.330
 This is excellent also for 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.020
 bass 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.350

 bass thought cat and sometimes 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.220
 tubular 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.460
 this 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.460
 very good excellent 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.090
 pecan 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.820
 your communal demons eye 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.510
 seldom seabass 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.850
 of all but mostly the courts 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.880
 and seldom bass and demons like 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:14.049
 This is excellent also for 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.049
 windings for coil in medium distance 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.680
 This is specifically excellent for 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.570
 catch the red demons that is a fish 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.570
 ok brutal orange 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.070
 it was once good for the Turks 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.070
 ships 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.310
 this 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.370
 especially for the coil 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.540
 tucunaré bass and 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.540
 Red Demon 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.940
 this clear coil is priceless but 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.180
 It has to be when there is not much 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.970
 wind and the water is hot but the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.970
 this is good for the tucumán 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.940
 this is for the sea ​​bass 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.090
 for the long tail lobs 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.030
 of depth 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.510
 this is excellent to go fishing for water 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.760
 salty but I have used it also for 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:27.269
 the bass and for and for tubular 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.690
 weigh cat and there is a fish that is long but 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:34.080
 I do not I do not remember much of the name 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.400
 and also to fish soup in the water 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.600
 up here 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.600
 we can use excellent the lobs 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:51.270
 this is used by worms but they are a 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:54.560
 worm type the real earthworms the 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.690
 pitan the hide a hook 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.500
 like this like this 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.230
 not to the ground 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:08.410
 they hide it completely for all this 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.410
 and so an example too 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.390
 I can come and take the subway to catch 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.720
 a worm really catch one of these 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.540
 A) Yes 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.350
 I come 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.540
 the peak 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:27.230
 and this would be what I really 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.230
 would put one to a worm hook 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:34.939
 and this would remain, I come as it was a 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:37.510
 soil so this would be like this with a 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:39.800
 dark hook 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.040
 show how I would put it to do 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.209
 and I've already come to the ground 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.209
 how was a floor 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:55.550
 and burying 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.550
 this here so 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.760
 and burying and it stays that way there is 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.840
 perfect 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:11.709
 like this this I 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.709
 I put it like that 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.400
 a lot was in and this 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.400
 rossi 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.940
 A) Yes 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:37.770
 I put if this is how you want or also 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:41.080
 you can put this like this also puts a 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.560
 one I want to leave videos so 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.320
 you can also put this this very 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.460
 good also for the courts what 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:55.400
 they put like this and that's how it is 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:59.010
 and it is used very well with lead 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:02.030
 to fish bottom melting 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.030
 the truth 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:09.529
 this is then a demonstration how 

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:11.209
 you can put this here so it does not matter 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:13.639
 if they are the peoples declared this is one 

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:15.120
 Of course this is a dark that does not get 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.210
 same 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:23.310
 they are put like this by the same means as 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:25.610
 They carry the weights and carry it to the 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.610
 final 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.880
 yes 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.500
 the point is that they are taking little 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.640
 to little until the end 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:38.520
 in my case this time also used it 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.070
 that's for salt water where there's a lot 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.280
 depth that does not use the lake 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.280
 what 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.210
 in the command that is ideal because it is 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.490
 quite deep in the long it shows 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:54.560
 much 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:56.530
 ok this also is also with us 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.110
 true because it's brilliant 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:04.360
 excellent this 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:06.550
 that 's right, and that's for water picnics 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.010
 salty shut up because this also gets 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:12.100
 it can be that you can use it but it's not 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.230
 badly done a lot of power ok this too 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.129
 can be used for the courts 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:20.189
 red demons 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:22.589
 in any kind of weight ok the thing is 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:25.590
 that is a little impatient because big 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:31.320
 but it attracts 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:32.770
 and finally how would one put this 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.510
 would be 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:39.810
 It has two forms 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:43.610
 has two ways that 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.610
 we put it by the same means 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.150
 or yes 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:07:00.300
 teach them something you can also put 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:00.300
 so going by the same means 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.100
 crying 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.760
 after you finish there they left me 

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:18.320
 make the dry ones 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.320
 and what is left
