00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
welcome my name is the camping cam and I

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.800 
welcome my name is the camping cam and I
will<00:00:03.990> be<00:00:04.170> showing<00:00:05.009> you<00:00:05.160> today<00:00:05.400> how<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:06.270> build<00:00:06.509> a

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
will be showing you today how to build a

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.759 
will be showing you today how to build a
furnace<00:00:07.230> with<00:00:08.010> on<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.580> off<00:00:08.700> light<00:00:09.440> I<00:00:11.389> got<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
furnace with on and off light I got the

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.050 
furnace with on and off light I got the
idea<00:00:13.769> from<00:00:14.070> ethos<00:00:14.670> lab<00:00:15.080> but<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.220> is<00:00:17.220> his<00:00:17.609> version

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
idea from ethos lab but a is his version

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.140 
idea from ethos lab but a is his version
is<00:00:18.710> outdated<00:00:19.710> yet<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.490> still<00:00:20.670> works<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.029> his

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
is outdated yet it still works in his

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.950 
is outdated yet it still works in his
world<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.350> had<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:23.150> come<00:00:24.150> up<00:00:24.180> with<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:24.600> idea

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
world so I had to come up with this idea

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.480 
world so I had to come up with this idea
so<00:00:27.960> basically<00:00:28.320> what<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.650> does<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:29.220> when<00:00:29.429> you

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
so basically what it does is when you

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.590 
so basically what it does is when you
put<00:00:29.849> something<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.590> this<00:00:31.590> light<00:00:32.360> will<00:00:33.360> come<00:00:33.540> on

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
put something in this light will come on

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.190 
put something in this light will come on
when<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:34.770> smelting<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:36.390> can<00:00:36.540> also<00:00:36.690> hook<00:00:36.989> up

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
when it's smelting you can also hook up

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.540 
when it's smelting you can also hook up
like<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> note<00:00:37.800> block<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.370> something<00:00:38.629> to<00:00:40.520> make<00:00:41.520> a

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
like a note block or something to make a

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.389 
like a note block or something to make a
noise<00:00:41.850> when<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.840> when<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.559> done<00:00:43.770> or<00:00:44.160> when

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
noise when it's when it's done or when

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.350 
noise when it's when it's done or when
it's<00:00:44.550> um<00:00:45.680> when<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.770> started<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.910> basically

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
it's um when it started and so basically

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.240 
it's um when it started and so basically
if<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:49.079> take<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.829> out<00:00:50.100> when<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.090> flame<00:00:51.360> dies

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
if we take this out when the flame dies

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.450 
if we take this out when the flame dies
this<00:00:53.250> light<00:00:53.520> will<00:00:54.239> go<00:00:54.390> off<00:00:55.160> this<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
this light will go off this is the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.450 
this light will go off this is the
wiring<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.690> know<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.739> kind<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.160> big

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
wiring here I know it's it's kind of big

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.369 
wiring here I know it's it's kind of big
but<00:01:00.559> I<00:01:02.030> I<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.690> make<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.170> this

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
but I I have to make it like this

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.870 
but I I have to make it like this
because<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:06.350> in<00:01:07.350> my<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.799> my<00:01:07.920> survival<00:01:08.250> world<00:01:08.580> I

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
because I in my in my survival world I

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.710 
because I in my in my survival world I
have<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.810> furnace<00:01:10.140> room<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.619> I'll<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.420> a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
have a furnace room and I'll have this a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.899 
have a furnace room and I'll have this a
furnace<00:01:13.200> here<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> furnace<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.490> this

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
furnace here and like a furnace on this

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.499 
furnace here and like a furnace on this
block<00:01:15.119> here<00:01:15.619> so<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.159> one<00:01:17.729> wide<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.420> you

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
block here so it's just one wide so you

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.270 
block here so it's just one wide so you
can<00:01:18.689> put<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> bunch<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.290> them<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.590> row<00:01:20.030> but

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
can put a bunch of them in a row but

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.090 
can put a bunch of them in a row but
this<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.030> bud<00:01:24.780> switch<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.830> it's

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
this is this is a bud switch here it's

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.719 
this is this is a bud switch here it's
just<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.580> common<00:01:26.909> design<00:01:27.740> so<00:01:28.740> whenever<00:01:29.430> this

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
just a common design so whenever this

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.679 
just a common design so whenever this
flame<00:01:30.060> dies<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.600> should<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.930> any<00:01:31.439> second<00:01:31.890> now

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
flame dies it should be any second now

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.980 
flame dies it should be any second now
this<00:01:34.409> will<00:01:34.560> set<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> pulse<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.570> will

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
this will set out a pulse and this will

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.719 
this will set out a pulse and this will
post<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.299> go<00:01:39.420> down<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:40.729> and

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
post this I have to go down here and

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.350 
post this I have to go down here and
this<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.590> T<00:01:43.590> flip-flop<00:01:43.979> now<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.180> not<00:01:45.329> my

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
this is a T flip-flop now this is not my

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.100 
this is a T flip-flop now this is not my
design<00:01:45.979> I<00:01:46.979> got<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.850> from<00:01:48.270> someone<00:01:48.689> I'll<00:01:48.869> put

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
design I got it from someone I'll put

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.440 
design I got it from someone I'll put
the<00:01:49.439> link<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.460> channel<00:01:50.729> description<00:01:51.060> as

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the link to the channel description as

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.840 
the link to the channel description as
you<00:01:51.630> see<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.320> switch<00:01:52.860> switched<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
you see it just switch switched and the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.670 
you see it just switch switched and the
light<00:01:54.030> went<00:01:54.210> off

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.800 

so<00:01:58.680> yeah<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.460> basically<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:01.460> can<00:02:02.810> attempt

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
so yeah it's basically it I can attempt

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.270 
so yeah it's basically it I can attempt
at<00:02:03.930> showing<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.530> how<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.649> build<00:02:04.920> one<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.189> these

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
at showing you how to build one of these

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.470 
at showing you how to build one of these
things<00:02:06.799> except<00:02:07.799> any<00:02:07.950> difference<00:02:09.590> okay

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
things except any difference okay

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.220 
things except any difference okay
so<00:02:13.480> just<00:02:14.260> your<00:02:14.860> furnace<00:02:15.460> now<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.960> put<00:02:17.200> a

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
so just your furnace now you put a

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.140 
so just your furnace now you put a
normal<00:02:17.860> piston<00:02:18.070> here<00:02:19.410> block<00:02:20.410> under<00:02:20.800> it

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
normal piston here block under it

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:35.210 
normal piston here block under it
redstone<00:02:22.150> dust<00:02:23.160> another<00:02:24.160> block<00:02:26.220> some<00:02:27.220> torch

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.730 

my<00:02:36.220> bad<00:02:36.990> it's<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.880> sticky<00:02:40.360> piston

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
my bad it's this is the sticky piston

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.530 
my bad it's this is the sticky piston
and<00:02:41.740> that<00:02:42.070> is<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.430> regular<00:02:43.920> okay<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.330> what<00:02:46.510> I

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
and that is the regular okay so what I

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.010 
and that is the regular okay so what I
did

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
did

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.480 
did
oh<00:02:47.460> and<00:02:48.460> this<00:02:48.940> must<00:02:49.690> be<00:02:49.930> a<00:02:50.410> half<00:02:50.770> slab

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
oh and this must be a half slab

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.270 
oh and this must be a half slab
and<00:02:52.060> I'll<00:02:52.510> show<00:02:52.720> you<00:02:52.750> why<00:02:53.020> in<00:02:53.050> just<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.440> second

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:04.070 

this<00:02:57.540> just<00:02:58.540> line<00:02:59.320> this<00:02:59.530> up<00:02:59.800> to<00:03:01.260> redstone<00:03:02.260> torch

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
this just line this up to redstone torch

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:18.990 
this just line this up to redstone torch
dust<00:03:05.080> oh<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:07.890> always<00:03:08.890> do<00:03:09.130> that<00:03:16.740> okay<00:03:17.740> so<00:03:18.280> we<00:03:18.700> want

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
dust oh I always do that okay so we want

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.470 
dust oh I always do that okay so we want
the<00:03:19.180> light<00:03:19.420> not<00:03:19.720> here<00:03:20.230> but<00:03:20.530> here<00:03:21.660> grab<00:03:22.660> one

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
the light not here but here grab one

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.010 
the light not here but here grab one
we'll<00:03:25.480> put<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.750> here

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
we'll put it here

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.850 
we'll put it here
go<00:03:26.890> I<00:03:27.390> was<00:03:28.390> just<00:03:28.600> I<00:03:28.810> would<00:03:29.110> recommend<00:03:29.560> digging

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
go I was just I would recommend digging

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.450 
go I was just I would recommend digging
out<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:31.230> big<00:03:32.230> space<00:03:32.560> for<00:03:33.090> this<00:03:34.090> but<00:03:35.310> I'm<00:03:36.310> just

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
out a big space for this but I'm just

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.780 
out a big space for this but I'm just
trying<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.790> get<00:03:36.910> this<00:03:37.000> done<00:03:37.300> so<00:03:39.960> that<00:03:40.960> there<00:03:41.790> so

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
trying to get this done so that there so

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:50.940 
trying to get this done so that there so
now<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:43.410> think<00:03:46.110> yes<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:49.450> you<00:03:49.540> want<00:03:50.020> a<00:03:50.410> sticky

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
now I think yes so you want a sticky

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.200 
now I think yes so you want a sticky
piston<00:03:51.130> here<00:03:52.710> break<00:03:53.710> don't<00:03:54.400> wire<00:03:54.670> it<00:03:54.820> up<00:03:54.910> yet

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
piston here break don't wire it up yet

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.250 
piston here break don't wire it up yet
that<00:03:55.600> was<00:03:55.720> my<00:03:55.870> fault

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
that was my fault

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.030 
that was my fault
and<00:03:57.130> here<00:03:58.170> redstone<00:03:59.170> block<00:03:59.740> of<00:03:59.890> redstone

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
and here redstone block of redstone

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:08.550 
and here redstone block of redstone
there<00:04:01.410> block<00:04:02.410> there<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:07.120> like<00:04:07.480> that<00:04:07.690> and

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
there block there and that like that and

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.110 
there block there and that like that and
you<00:04:08.920> may<00:04:09.130> have<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:11.250> see<00:04:12.250> it's<00:04:12.400> on<00:04:12.640> but<00:04:12.970> there's

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
you may have to see it's on but there's

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.480 
you may have to see it's on but there's
nothing<00:04:13.420> in<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.570> furnace<00:04:13.900> here<00:04:14.140> let's<00:04:14.680> grab

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
nothing in the furnace here let's grab

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.880 
nothing in the furnace here let's grab
some<00:04:15.730> of<00:04:15.760> that<00:04:15.850> iron<00:04:16.270> that<00:04:16.390> was<00:04:16.510> in<00:04:16.630> here<00:04:16.890> so

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
some of that iron that was in here so

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.870 
some of that iron that was in here so
you<00:04:18.310> can<00:04:18.460> just<00:04:18.609> like<00:04:18.820> put<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.090> block<00:04:19.450> here<00:04:19.840> on

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
you can just like put a block here on

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.820 
you can just like put a block here on
top<00:04:21.880> of<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.120> furnace<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.770> mean<00:04:23.770> sorry<00:04:24.010> adjacent

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
top of the furnace I mean sorry adjacent

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.640 
top of the furnace I mean sorry adjacent
piston<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:26.030> they'll<00:04:26.180> swap<00:04:26.509> that<00:04:26.810> so<00:04:27.500> now

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
piston and they'll swap that so now

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.210 
piston and they'll swap that so now
whenever<00:04:27.949> you<00:04:28.129> put<00:04:28.340> that<00:04:28.490> in<00:04:28.720> light<00:04:29.720> comes<00:04:29.930> on

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
whenever you put that in light comes on

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.629 
whenever you put that in light comes on
and<00:04:31.220> if<00:04:31.699> you<00:04:31.819> wanted<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:34.719> get<00:04:35.719> a<00:04:35.780> note<00:04:36.080> block<00:04:36.639> if

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
and if you wanted to get a note block if

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.990 
and if you wanted to get a note block if
you<00:04:37.789> put<00:04:38.060> it<00:04:38.180> there

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.939 

every<00:04:44.000> time<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:44.210> updates<00:04:44.719> it'll<00:04:45.680> get<00:04:45.919> a

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
every time that updates it'll get a

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.980 
every time that updates it'll get a
don't<00:04:46.909> make<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.030> noise<00:04:48.699> so<00:04:49.699> I'll<00:04:50.449> just<00:04:50.750> show<00:04:50.930> you

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
don't make a noise so I'll just show you

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.619 
don't make a noise so I'll just show you
why<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.620> had<00:04:51.979> to<00:04:52.009> build<00:04:52.520> this<00:04:52.699> in<00:04:52.909> my<00:04:53.090> survival

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:53.629 
why I had to build this in my survival

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:56.740 
why I had to build this in my survival
world<00:04:53.930> before<00:04:54.710> we<00:04:55.069> move<00:04:55.280> on<00:04:55.460> to<00:04:55.639> my<00:04:56.150> survival

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
world before we move on to my survival

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.990 
world before we move on to my survival
and<00:04:56.870> I<00:04:56.930> forgot<00:04:57.319> to<00:04:57.440> show<00:04:57.620> you<00:04:57.650> why<00:04:58.009> this<00:04:58.520> block

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
and I forgot to show you why this block

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.510 
and I forgot to show you why this block
has<00:04:59.330> to<00:04:59.509> be<00:04:59.690> on<00:05:00.229> a<00:05:01.449> half<00:05:02.449> slab<00:05:02.659> so<00:05:03.530> basically

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.309 

here<00:05:07.520> let<00:05:08.090> me<00:05:08.180> go<00:05:08.389> over<00:05:08.479> here<00:05:10.750> it's<00:05:11.750> called

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:12.319 
here let me go over here it's called

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:17.830 
here let me go over here it's called
piston<00:05:12.860> quasi<00:05:13.520> physics<00:05:14.150> I<00:05:14.240> believe<00:05:14.979> but<00:05:15.979> um<00:05:16.840> if

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
piston quasi physics I believe but um if

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.149 
piston quasi physics I believe but um if
this<00:05:18.340> block<00:05:19.340> is<00:05:19.849> powered<00:05:20.500> all<00:05:21.500> right<00:05:21.740> let<00:05:22.069> me

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
this block is powered all right let me

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:28.749 
this block is powered all right let me
grab<00:05:22.400> a<00:05:22.430> lever<00:05:24.580> oops<00:05:27.099> if<00:05:28.099> this<00:05:28.310> block<00:05:28.520> is

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
grab a lever oops if this block is

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:34.930 
grab a lever oops if this block is
powered<00:05:30.819> in<00:05:32.080> that<00:05:33.080> piston<00:05:33.680> here<00:05:34.430> it<00:05:34.550> receives

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
powered in that piston here it receives

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:41.800 
powered in that piston here it receives
an<00:05:35.150> update<00:05:37.150> it'll<00:05:38.469> it'll<00:05:39.469> just<00:05:39.830> it'll<00:05:40.810> power

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
an update it'll it'll just it'll power

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:50.110 
an update it'll it'll just it'll power
itself<00:05:46.360> but<00:05:47.360> um<00:05:47.860> if<00:05:48.860> this<00:05:49.099> is<00:05:49.250> a<00:05:49.279> half<00:05:49.580> slab<00:05:49.879> if

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
itself but um if this is a half slab if

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.980 
itself but um if this is a half slab if
this<00:05:50.270> box<00:05:50.539> a<00:05:50.719> half<00:05:50.960> slab<00:05:52.330> that<00:05:53.330> that<00:05:53.750> doesn't

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
this box a half slab that that doesn't

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.350 
this box a half slab that that doesn't
work<00:05:56.830> so<00:05:57.830> if<00:05:58.190> you<00:05:58.339> just<00:05:58.610> like<00:05:58.789> place<00:05:59.029> a<00:05:59.060> block

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
work so if you just like place a block

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.260 
work so if you just like place a block
it'll<00:05:59.810> they<00:06:00.710> don't<00:06:00.889> mess<00:06:01.009> itself<00:06:01.370> up<00:06:01.550> and<00:06:01.789> you

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
it'll they don't mess itself up and you

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.290 
it'll they don't mess itself up and you
can't<00:06:02.539> get<00:06:02.810> it<00:06:02.930> to<00:06:03.050> retract<00:06:03.500> back<00:06:03.969> so<00:06:04.969> that's

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
can't get it to retract back so that's

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.589 
can't get it to retract back so that's
why<00:06:05.509> that<00:06:05.539> needs<00:06:06.080> to<00:06:06.349> be<00:06:06.379> a<00:06:06.589> half<00:06:07.069> slab<00:06:07.599> okay

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 
why that needs to be a half slab okay

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:10.959 
why that needs to be a half slab okay
here<00:06:08.870> we<00:06:08.960> are<00:06:08.990> my<00:06:09.319> survival<00:06:09.830> wound<00:06:09.979> so<00:06:10.520> this<00:06:10.789> is

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:10.969 
here we are my survival wound so this is

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:14.320 
here we are my survival wound so this is
my<00:06:11.930> room<00:06:11.990> with<00:06:12.349> my<00:06:12.889> furnaces<00:06:13.879> and<00:06:14.000> everything

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
my room with my furnaces and everything

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.350 
my room with my furnaces and everything
so<00:06:14.960> like<00:06:15.469> I<00:06:15.620> said<00:06:15.680> I<00:06:15.860> just<00:06:16.190> I<00:06:16.339> wanted<00:06:16.669> to<00:06:16.909> cram

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
so like I said I just I wanted to cram

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.350 
so like I said I just I wanted to cram
as<00:06:17.599> many<00:06:17.900> of<00:06:18.139> them<00:06:18.289> in<00:06:18.440> as<00:06:18.710> I<00:06:19.610> could<00:06:19.879> here<00:06:20.180> I

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
as many of them in as I could here I
