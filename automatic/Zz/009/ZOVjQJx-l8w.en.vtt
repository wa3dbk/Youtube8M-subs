 Hello friends, I am wind and the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.710
 episode iv comes thanks to the idea of 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.139
 a subscriber if they have suggestions or 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.360
 comments do not forget to leave it here in 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.639
 this video or in our social networks 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.710
 facebook or instagram we all love the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.380
 videogames but we know that 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.050
 unfortunately they are not perfect since 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.920
 there is something called click 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.110
 there are some very mysterious funny and 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.650
 until chilling here we have a 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.189
 toxic of glitches funny 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.189
 do not 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.400
 fifth, we bring you a list that 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.160
 it seems an epic game that according to many 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.190
 fans is the best in his zelda saga 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.470
 ocarina of time we know that clean 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.500
 defeat monsters control the time 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.510
 change the direction of the wind to turn 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.810
 of different animals and control 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.760
 elements but we did not know that also 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.810
 could be transformed into a rock with 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.510
 legs definitely that this ugly not 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.759
 he managed to steal Zelda's love 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.310
 next glitch that we bring them appears 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.770
 in one of the games that revolutionized the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.310
 world of may and nintendo and it's super 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.130
 Mario 64 remember that one of our 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.100
 previous videos we mentioned that mario 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.759
 Kills outs and apart from killing them 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.340
 they also eat them good in this video 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.160
 we can confirm once again that it is 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.520
 completely true will be a message 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.500
 Subliminal that mario this way 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.899
 suffers the side effects of 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.240
 mushrooms that you eat look at it with your 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.119
 own eyes and draw their conclusions 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.040
 in third place we have rose day 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.320
 garden that despite having been a 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.659
 success and one of the best in its class 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.149
 rpg action was not saved from the 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.009
 curse of clichés we know who 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.769
 fall into a stable file not 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.349
 I could eat mushrooms like mario since 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.660
 that is not the motion kilo but 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.610
 definitely got some other 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.000
 toxic substance with very strong effects 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.580
 Interesting 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.310
 in second position we have the new and 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.800
 long-awaited batman arkham night where 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.510
 we see that neither the bat man can 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.349
 sneak out of the lakers 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.200
 unfortunately our beloved 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.720
 Knight of the night does not know how to fly like 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.239
 superman since he can only plan with 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.700
 its layer from great heights without 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.300
 However, it does everything possible to 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.500
 learn and although he still needs a lot 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.959
 way to go 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.810
 First of all, the drums 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.760
 please 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.550
 we have one of the most titles 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.950
 important of the fighting games that 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.349
 is still in beta mode has not come out yet 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.300
 we are not so sure that it is a 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.780
 Lynch and he wants to show his opinion 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.170
 it's about street fighter 5 it all started in 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.400
 the e3 2015 when the fans notice a 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.950
 somewhat exaggerated and unusual movement in 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.220
 the breasts of chun-li on the screen 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.580
 verses the gamer community criticized this 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.310
 as an act of hypersexualization or a 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.380
 cynical advertising strategy according to 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.959
 capcom it was an error of 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.069
 programming better known as a 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:40.920
 cliché wait a beech is movement 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.890
 so circular and perfectly 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.580
 synchronized in the breasts of chun-li yes 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.440
 yes as not good cliché or not apparently 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.019
 it only happened on the right side of the 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.390
 second player and capcom ensured that 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.270
 would be corrected in the future and that was 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.640
 our top 5 of funny glitches 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.220
