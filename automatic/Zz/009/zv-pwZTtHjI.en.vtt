00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
that earlier when I'm looking for them

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.190 
that earlier when I'm looking for them
you<00:04:27.180> never<00:04:27.360> know<00:04:27.570> where<00:04:27.720> he's<00:04:27.840> going<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.080> be

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
you never know where he's going to be

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.540 
you never know where he's going to be
and<00:04:28.470> you<00:04:28.620> can<00:04:28.740> probably<00:04:28.950> catch<00:04:29.190> him<00:04:29.370> off<00:04:29.520> guard

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
and you can probably catch him off guard

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.659 
and you can probably catch him off guard
just<00:04:30.090> like<00:04:30.180> I<00:04:30.270> said<00:04:30.590> which<00:04:31.590> is<00:04:31.620> basically<00:04:32.460> how

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
just like I said which is basically how

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.070 
just like I said which is basically how
I<00:04:32.700> see<00:04:33.000> snd<00:04:33.330> is<00:04:33.419> catching<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.780> other<00:04:33.930> player

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
I see snd is catching the other player

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.530 
I see snd is catching the other player
off<00:04:34.260> guard<00:04:34.530> because<00:04:34.669> snd<00:04:35.669> oh<00:04:35.700> really<00:04:36.450> it's

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
off guard because snd oh really it's

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.920 
off guard because snd oh really it's
about<00:04:36.630> breakouts<00:04:37.139> and<00:04:37.380> then<00:04:37.710> just
