00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.570 
don't to go over there cuz i'll get shot
the<00:03:18.510> fuck<00:03:18.660> up<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.080> i'm<00:03:20.070> only<00:03:20.220> playing<00:03:20.490> with

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
the fuck up and i'm only playing with

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.960 
the fuck up and i'm only playing with
like<00:03:20.730> one<00:03:21.000> hand<00:03:21.030> right<00:03:21.330> now<00:03:21.390> so<00:03:22.880> yeah<00:03:23.880> I'm

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
like one hand right now so yeah I'm

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.420 
like one hand right now so yeah I'm
pretty<00:03:24.240> sure<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:24.840> proves<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.430> rendering

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
pretty sure this proves that rendering

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.810 
pretty sure this proves that rendering
video<00:03:26.820> with<00:03:27.180> my<00:03:27.330> FX<00:03:27.630> 6100<00:03:28.290> processor<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.750> um

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820

playing battlefield 3 is possible might

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.670 
playing battlefield 3 is possible might
not<00:03:35.250> be<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.610> best<00:03:35.850> FPS<00:03:36.120> not<00:03:37.050> my<00:03:37.260> beginning

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
not be the best FPS not my beginning

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.880 
not be the best FPS not my beginning
above<00:03:37.920> like<00:03:38.130> 30<00:03:39.120> all<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.720> time<00:03:39.930> nothing<00:03:40.590> might

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
above like 30 all the time nothing might

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.150 
above like 30 all the time nothing might
getting<00:03:41.220> above<00:03:41.610> 30<00:03:41.910> or<00:03:42.060> 40<00:03:42.450> all<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.660> time<00:03:42.840> but

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
getting above 30 or 40 all the time but

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.150 
getting above 30 or 40 all the time but
it<00:03:44.160> still<00:03:44.490> works<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:46.500> this<00:03:46.740> is<00:03:46.920> just<00:03:47.040> like

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
it still works and this is just like

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.280 
it still works and this is just like
very<00:03:47.460> crazy<00:03:47.940> intensive<00:03:48.750> map<00:03:48.960> if<00:03:49.140> you're

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
very crazy intensive map if you're

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.530 
very crazy intensive map if you're
looking<00:03:49.560> right<00:03:49.680> over<00:03:49.740> there<00:03:50.150> but<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.300> have<00:03:51.390> to

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
looking right over there but you have to

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.690 
looking right over there but you have to
render<00:03:51.720> everything<00:03:51.900> output<00:03:52.530> I<00:03:52.740> played<00:03:53.580> on

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
render everything output I played on

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.640 
render everything output I played on
metra<00:03:54.060> once<00:03:54.300> and<00:03:54.570> i<00:03:54.630> got<00:03:54.660> pretty<00:03:55.320> good<00:03:55.380> FPS

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
metra once and i got pretty good FPS

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.220 
metra once and i got pretty good FPS
i'll<00:03:56.190> also<00:03:56.340> be<00:03:56.550> putting<00:03:56.820> up<00:03:56.850> another<00:03:57.120> video<00:03:57.420> of

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
i'll also be putting up another video of

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.220 
i'll also be putting up another video of
um<00:03:58.650> I'll<00:03:59.610> be<00:03:59.820> filming<00:04:00.360> more<00:04:00.750> parts<00:04:01.050> of<00:04:01.260> them

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
um I'll be filming more parts of them

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.420 
um I'll be filming more parts of them
more<00:04:04.230> than<00:04:04.380> one<00:04:04.530> game<00:04:04.740> playing<00:04:05.010> at<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.250> same

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
more than one game playing at the same

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.630 
more than one game playing at the same
time<00:04:05.670> because<00:04:06.710> rendering<00:04:07.710> a<00:04:07.800> video<00:04:07.890> uses<00:04:08.460> like

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
time because rendering a video uses like

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.450 
time because rendering a video uses like
one<00:04:09.030> hundred<00:04:09.450> percent<00:04:09.480> of<00:04:10.050> all<00:04:10.170> my<00:04:10.350> cores<00:04:10.620> so

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
one hundred percent of all my cores so

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.190 
one hundred percent of all my cores so
playing<00:04:11.880> back<00:04:12.060> up<00:04:12.270> there<00:04:12.450> on<00:04:12.510> top<00:04:12.660> of<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:12.930> is

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
playing back up there on top of that is

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.660 
playing back up there on top of that is
pretty<00:04:13.500> intense<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:15.480> yeah<00:04:15.630> oh<00:04:16.370> yeah<00:04:17.370> almost

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
pretty intense so yeah oh yeah almost

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.780 
pretty intense so yeah oh yeah almost
forgot<00:04:17.850> to<00:04:18.060> show<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.270> that<00:04:18.510> out<00:04:18.720> it's<00:04:19.500> at

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
forgot to show you that out it's at

forgot to show you that out it's at
twenty-seven<00:04:20.790> percent<00:04:20.970> of<00:04:21.920> rendering<00:04:22.920> the

twenty-seven percent of rendering the

video while I am playing battlefield 3
up<00:04:27.810> there<00:04:28.200> so<00:04:28.850> you're<00:04:29.850> just<00:04:30.000> still<00:04:30.210> rendering

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
up there so you're just still rendering

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.120 
up there so you're just still rendering
but<00:04:30.660> I'm<00:04:30.750> going<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:30.960> cancel<00:04:31.320> that<00:04:31.620> now<00:04:31.830> because

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
but I'm going to cancel that now because

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.920 
but I'm going to cancel that now because
I'm<00:04:32.250> going<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.520> do<00:04:32.640> another<00:04:32.970> test

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.150 

alright<00:04:39.889> so<00:04:40.699> using<00:04:41.090> another<00:04:41.330> test<00:04:41.919> running<00:04:42.919> to

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
alright so using another test running to

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.249

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
and 3 at the same time um I have all the

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.659 
and 3 at the same time um I have all the
settings<00:04:50.570> on<00:04:50.810> dirt<00:04:51.050> 3<00:04:51.320> at<00:04:51.550> high<00:04:52.550> settings

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.650 

mainly<00:04:55.669> just<00:04:55.789> because<00:04:55.910> it's<00:04:56.389> not<00:04:56.539> my

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
mainly just because it's not my

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.100 
mainly just because it's not my
processor<00:04:57.229> that<00:04:57.350> can<00:04:57.530> handle<00:04:57.740> that's<00:04:58.100> only<00:04:58.280> it

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.950 

it's<00:05:03.110> like<00:05:03.650> being<00:05:04.430> used<00:05:04.699> seventy<00:05:05.270> percent<00:05:05.419> or

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
it's like being used seventy percent or

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.340 
it's like being used seventy percent or
so<00:05:06.340> but<00:05:07.340> uh<00:05:07.370> as<00:05:08.300> you<00:05:08.509> can<00:05:08.630> see<00:05:08.780> i'm<00:05:08.900> running<00:05:09.199> the

so but uh as you can see i'm running the

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:16.410 
so but uh as you can see i'm running the

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
they're both running very smooth you can

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.950 
they're both running very smooth you can

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
think steam let me run more than one

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.030 
think steam let me run more than one
game<00:05:59.640> I've<00:05:59.880> grant<00:06:00.180> the<00:06:00.300> final<00:06:00.570> four<00:06:00.750> but<00:06:01.040> every

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
game I've grant the final four but every

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.380 
game I've grant the final four but every
time<00:06:02.160> I<00:06:02.310> minimize<00:06:02.700> that<00:06:02.850> that<00:06:03.060> just<00:06:03.210> goes

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
time I minimize that that just goes

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.690 
time I minimize that that just goes
straight<00:06:03.570> to<00:06:03.840> something<00:06:04.110> else<00:06:04.200> so<00:06:04.580> but<00:06:05.580> i'm

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
straight to something else so but i'm

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.920 
straight to something else so but i'm
pretty<00:06:05.850> sure<00:06:06.000> you<00:06:06.150> get<00:06:06.240> the<00:06:06.360> point<00:06:06.570> my

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
pretty sure you get the point my

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.480 
pretty sure you get the point my
processor<00:06:07.620> can<00:06:07.740> handle<00:06:08.960> you<00:06:09.960> know<00:06:10.110> to<00:06:10.740> very

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
processor can handle you know to very

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.240 
processor can handle you know to very
high<00:06:11.700> graphic<00:06:12.150> games<00:06:12.360> running<00:06:12.810> how<00:06:13.800> i<00:06:13.830> can

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
high graphic games running how i can

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.730 
high graphic games running how i can
handle<00:06:14.400> more<00:06:14.790> if<00:06:15.120> my<00:06:16.430> my<00:06:17.430> little<00:06:17.760> sick<00:06:18.650> 6870<00:06:19.650> in

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
handle more if my my little sick 6870 in

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.400 
handle more if my my little sick 6870 in
there<00:06:19.860> can<00:06:20.040> handle<00:06:20.400> it<00:06:20.720> but<00:06:21.720> mainly<00:06:22.050> at<00:06:22.260> this

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
there can handle it but mainly at this

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:33.160 
there can handle it but mainly at this
point<00:06:22.680> it's<00:06:22.830> just<00:06:24.830> it's<00:06:25.830> just<00:06:25.980> um<00:06:30.470> GPU

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
point it's just it's just um GPU

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:38.330 
point it's just it's just um GPU
bottlenecking<00:06:34.170> now<00:06:34.500> for<00:06:35.190> this<00:06:35.990> so<00:06:36.990> yeah<00:06:37.340> hope

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
bottlenecking now for this so yeah hope

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.910 
bottlenecking now for this so yeah hope
you<00:06:38.460> guys<00:06:38.580> enjoyed
