you call you can see here is a cow the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.100 
you call you can see here is a cow the
special<00:02:10.619> one

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
special one

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.280 
special one
you<00:02:13.110> know<00:02:13.200> it's<00:02:13.380> max<00:02:13.650> help<00:02:15.080> movement<00:02:16.080> speed

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
you know it's max help movement speed

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.860 
you know it's max help movement speed
and<00:02:16.500> polo<00:02:16.800> range<00:02:17.360> is<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.570> most<00:02:19.940> so<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.270> guess

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
and polo range is the most so I guess

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:44.800 
and polo range is the most so I guess
you<00:02:22.020> achieve<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.410> that's<00:02:22.950> pretty<00:02:23.160> cool<00:02:42.830> for

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
you achieve that that's pretty cool for

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.560 
you achieve that that's pretty cool for
mom<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:46.080> be<00:02:46.320> able<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.560> see<00:02:46.680> you

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
mom to be able to see you

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.150 
mom to be able to see you
for<00:02:48.570> example<00:02:48.959> default<00:02:49.530> which<00:02:49.770> is<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:50.070> the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
for example default which is just the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.350 
for example default which is just the
base<00:02:51.080> for<00:02:52.080> this<00:02:52.140> count<00:02:52.440> 16<00:02:52.980> edit<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.209> it's

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
base for this count 16 edit that so it's

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.430 
base for this count 16 edit that so it's
