00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:28.830
 if you want to increase the amount 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:31.369
 existing years and now would have to 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.369
 get there 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:48.210
 and as you see we get to the store then 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:52.730
 there is a trick is that the inputs and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.730
 exits to the most tourist 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.620
 for example, some pavilions 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.079
 they only happen through the store 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.049
 what does it mean it means you 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.200
 what is impossible what is it if you drive 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.090
 come on interesting to interesting places 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.310
 get through the store or go away 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.810
 leave clear i start i leave very 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.030
 loves 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.130
 think about what you can do right 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.869
 now so that your customers 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:29.409
 found with your store online or in 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.829
 online closing your back so they 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.829
 got into 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.869
 my operatorâ€™s closed door to 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.909
 they got to not just leave 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.450
 from your sites or from your stores 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:50.470
 so that they are definitely something else and that 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.080
 it was not possible that it was 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.149
 impossible my 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.840
 here is a simple but very effective piece 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.840
 use 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.760
 noname
