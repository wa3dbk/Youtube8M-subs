00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
the purpose of answering that question

things like that next up we have the map
size<00:02:11.290> now<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.650> have<00:02:11.890> discussed<00:02:12.400> this<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.700> few

size now I have discussed this and a few
videos<00:02:13.060> before<00:02:13.180> where

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930

videos before where
Johnathan<00:02:14.349> Morin<00:02:14.469> has<00:02:14.680> talked<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.040> little<00:02:15.129> bit

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
Johnathan Morin has talked a little bit

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.490 
Johnathan Morin has talked a little bit
about<00:02:15.489> in<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.909> map<00:02:16.060> size<00:02:16.269> and<00:02:16.510> wash<00:02:16.629> dogs<00:02:16.900> now

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
about in the map size and wash dogs now

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.979 
about in the map size and wash dogs now
it<00:02:17.739> is<00:02:17.859> a<00:02:17.890> smaller<00:02:18.370> map<00:02:18.700> than<00:02:19.000> GTA<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.540> believe

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
it is a smaller map than GTA I believe

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.170 
it is a smaller map than GTA I believe
however<00:02:20.799> Ubisoft<00:02:21.430> have<00:02:21.609> said<00:02:21.879> they<00:02:22.000> don't

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
however Ubisoft have said they don't

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.910 
however Ubisoft have said they don't
really<00:02:22.269> need<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.659> make<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.989> massive<00:02:23.290> map<00:02:23.709> with

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
really need to make a massive map with

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.920 
really need to make a massive map with
loads<00:02:24.159> of<00:02:24.280> space<00:02:24.519> to<00:02:25.060> be<00:02:25.150> able<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.329> fly<00:02:25.540> jets

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
loads of space to be able to fly jets

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.599 
loads of space to be able to fly jets
and<00:02:26.109> planes<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.469> things<00:02:26.709> because<00:02:27.069> we're<00:02:27.489> not

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
and planes and things because we're not

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:28.860 
and planes and things because we're not
gonna<00:02:27.700> be<00:02:27.790> able<00:02:27.909> to<00:02:27.969> fly<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.180> check<00:02:28.719> some

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
gonna be able to fly to check some

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.509 
gonna be able to fly to check some
planes<00:02:29.079> and<00:02:29.319> watch<00:02:29.530> dogs<00:02:29.829> it's<00:02:30.250> what<00:02:30.400> they've

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
planes and watch dogs it's what they've

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:31.770 
planes and watch dogs it's what they've
done<00:02:30.639> is<00:02:30.790> they've<00:02:30.939> kind<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.150> compacted

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
done is they've kind of compacted

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.539 
done is they've kind of compacted
condense<00:02:32.469> the<00:02:32.709> city<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.040> that<00:02:33.250> when<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.519> are

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
condense the city so that when you are

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.330 
condense the city so that when you are
in<00:02:33.879> the<00:02:34.000> city<00:02:34.209> of<00:02:34.450> watchdogs<00:02:35.349> it's<00:02:36.040> gonna<00:02:36.159> feel

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
in the city of watchdogs it's gonna feel

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.740 
in the city of watchdogs it's gonna feel
a<00:02:36.370> lot<00:02:36.519> more<00:02:36.549> dynamic<00:02:36.819> it's<00:02:37.329> gonna<00:02:37.450> it's<00:02:37.659> gonna

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
a lot more dynamic it's gonna it's gonna

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.780 
a lot more dynamic it's gonna it's gonna
be<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.930> lot<00:02:38.049> more<00:02:38.260> happening<00:02:38.739> in<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.430> smaller

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
be a lot more happening in that smaller

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.250 
be a lot more happening in that smaller
area<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:40.329> that's<00:02:40.420> why<00:02:40.629> the<00:02:40.689> map<00:02:40.930> size<00:02:41.079> is<00:02:41.230> a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
area so that's why the map size is a

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.750 
area so that's why the map size is a
little<00:02:41.439> bit<00:02:41.530> smaller<00:02:41.769> is<00:02:42.219> to<00:02:42.370> really<00:02:42.549> make<00:02:42.730> a

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
little bit smaller is to really make a

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.209 
little bit smaller is to really make a
big<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.239> big<00:02:43.569> more<00:02:43.810> thriving<00:02:44.469> city<00:02:44.829> if<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.099> guys

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:45.219 
big a big more thriving city if you guys

you<00:04:25.330> can<00:04:25.450> have<00:04:25.570> people<00:04:25.719> infiltrate<00:04:26.469> in<00:04:26.620> your

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
you can have people infiltrate in your

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.870 
you can have people infiltrate in your
session

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
session

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.550 
session
so<00:04:28.030> they<00:04:28.360> cut<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.780> kind<00:04:28.990> of<00:04:29.080> multiplayer<00:04:29.470> and

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
so they cut the kind of multiplayer and

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.710 
so they cut the kind of multiplayer and
singleplayer<00:04:30.040> are<00:04:30.100> very<00:04:30.280> intertwined<00:04:30.790> so

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
singleplayer are very intertwined so

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.940 
singleplayer are very intertwined so
when<00:04:31.870> I<00:04:31.930> was<00:04:32.020> at<00:04:32.140> the<00:04:32.260> watchdog's<00:04:32.680> event

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
when I was at the watchdog's event

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.410 
when I was at the watchdog's event
actually<00:04:33.310> they'd<00:04:33.430> play<00:04:33.640> quite<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:33.970> few<00:04:34.270> hours

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
actually they'd play quite a few hours

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.330 
actually they'd play quite a few hours
of<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.930> multiplayer<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:35.830> obviously<00:04:36.190> there

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
of the multiplayer and obviously there

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.130 
of the multiplayer and obviously there
are<00:04:36.490> six<00:04:36.940> different<00:04:37.120> confirmed<00:04:37.720> multiplayer

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
are six different confirmed multiplayer

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.170 
are six different confirmed multiplayer
modes<00:04:38.410> so<00:04:39.040> there's<00:04:39.220> tailing<00:04:39.640> where<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:40.000> can

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
modes so there's tailing where you can

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.670 
modes so there's tailing where you can
infiltrate<00:04:40.510> into<00:04:40.840> somebody's<00:04:41.140> game<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:41.530> just

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
infiltrate into somebody's game and just

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.380 
infiltrate into somebody's game and just
kind<00:04:41.830> of<00:04:41.890> watch<00:04:42.070> them<00:04:42.280> spy<00:04:42.640> on<00:04:42.700> them<00:04:42.940> and<00:04:43.300> it

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
kind of watch them spy on them and it

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.580 
kind of watch them spy on them and it
kind<00:04:43.540> of<00:04:43.570> gives<00:04:43.660> that<00:04:43.780> feeling<00:04:43.870> that<00:04:44.320> you<00:04:44.530> know

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
kind of gives that feeling that you know

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.170 
kind of gives that feeling that you know
you<00:04:44.680> could<00:04:44.830> always<00:04:45.010> be<00:04:45.220> walked<00:04:45.490> watch<00:04:45.970> real

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
you could always be walked watch real

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.250 
you could always be walked watch real
hell<00:04:46.300> you're<00:04:46.420> playing<00:04:46.630> waters<00:04:46.900> dogs

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
hell you're playing waters dogs

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.470 
hell you're playing waters dogs
then<00:04:48.100> there's<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.400> hacking<00:04:48.730> contract<00:04:49.180> where

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
then there's the hacking contract where

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.880 
then there's the hacking contract where
you<00:04:49.630> can<00:04:49.780> infiltrate<00:04:50.050> into<00:04:50.410> somebody's<00:04:50.740> game

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
you can infiltrate into somebody's game

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.710 
you can infiltrate into somebody's game
for<00:04:51.160> just<00:04:51.400> for<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.610> sole<00:04:51.790> purpose<00:04:51.820> of<00:04:52.300> hacking

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
for just for the sole purpose of hacking

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.930 
for just for the sole purpose of hacking

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
them decryption which is a team versus

kind<00:04:57.580> of<00:04:57.640> have<00:04:57.790> to<00:04:57.820> decrypt<00:04:58.300> a<00:04:58.510> file<00:04:59.020> and<00:04:59.260> both

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
kind of have to decrypt a file and both

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.680 
kind of have to decrypt a file and both
teams<00:05:00.160> are<00:05:00.430> working<00:05:00.550> to<00:05:00.910> keep<00:05:01.210> a<00:05:01.300> hold<00:05:01.540> of<00:05:01.660> that

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
teams are working to keep a hold of that

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.270 
teams are working to keep a hold of that
file<00:05:01.990> for<00:05:02.140> as<00:05:02.230> long<00:05:02.350> as<00:05:02.500> possible<00:05:02.620> to<00:05:02.920> decrypt

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.940 
file for as long as possible to decrypt
it<00:05:03.490> then<00:05:04.450> there's<00:05:04.630> also<00:05:04.780> multiplayer<00:05:05.560> racing

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
it then there's also multiplayer racing

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.800 
it then there's also multiplayer racing
we<00:05:06.070> could<00:05:06.250> race<00:05:06.460> against<00:05:06.970> other<00:05:07.060> players<00:05:07.360> to

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
we could race against other players to

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.630 
we could race against other players to
the<00:05:07.960> I<00:05:08.110> guess<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:08.440> finish<00:05:08.680> line<00:05:08.830> and<00:05:09.010> then

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
the I guess the finish line and then

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.680 
the I guess the finish line and then
there's<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:09.940> game<00:05:10.090> ward<00:05:10.330> where<00:05:10.480> you<00:05:10.570> can

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
there's the game ward where you can

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.480 
there's the game ward where you can
battle<00:05:11.110> head-to-head<00:05:11.350> against<00:05:12.100> somebody

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
battle head-to-head against somebody

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.280 
battle head-to-head against somebody
that's<00:05:12.520> using<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.030> watchdog's<00:05:13.420> app<00:05:13.630> so

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
that's using the watchdog's app so

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.420 
that's using the watchdog's app so
they'll<00:05:14.500> be<00:05:14.590> sending<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:14.920> police<00:05:15.010> after<00:05:15.340> you

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
they'll be sending the police after you

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.710 
they'll be sending the police after you
and<00:05:15.580> using<00:05:15.820> hacks<00:05:15.970> against<00:05:16.360> you<00:05:16.450> and<00:05:16.630> you'll

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
and using hacks against you and you'll

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.030 
and using hacks against you and you'll
have<00:05:16.870> to<00:05:16.990> basically<00:05:17.140> race<00:05:17.560> to<00:05:17.770> our<00:05:17.830> finish

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
have to basically race to our finish

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.190 
have to basically race to our finish
line<00:05:18.250> and<00:05:18.490> then<00:05:19.240> last<00:05:19.480> of<00:05:19.600> all<00:05:19.720> we<00:05:19.900> have<00:05:20.050> the

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
line and then last of all we have the

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.900 
line and then last of all we have the
free<00:05:20.470> roam<00:05:20.710> now<00:05:20.950> we<00:05:21.010> have<00:05:21.220> seen<00:05:21.430> time<00:05:21.730> and<00:05:21.850> time

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
free roam now we have seen time and time

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.610 
free roam now we have seen time and time
again<00:05:22.060> this<00:05:22.450> free<00:05:22.690> roam<00:05:22.900> being<00:05:23.410> kinda

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
again this free roam being kinda

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.200 
again this free roam being kinda
referred<00:05:23.920> to<00:05:24.040> as<00:05:24.100> a<00:05:24.190> bonus<00:05:24.550> you<00:05:24.730> know<00:05:24.760> it's

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
referred to as a bonus you know it's

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.390 
referred to as a bonus you know it's
almost<00:05:25.360> called<00:05:25.600> a<00:05:25.660> bonus<00:05:26.020> free<00:05:26.260> roam<00:05:26.470> and<00:05:26.680> I

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
almost called a bonus free roam and I

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.070 
almost called a bonus free roam and I
get<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.670> feeling<00:05:27.790> that<00:05:27.940> the<00:05:28.270> free<00:05:28.540> roam<00:05:28.750> isn't

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
get the feeling that the free roam isn't

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.290 
get the feeling that the free roam isn't
really<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.380> main<00:05:29.590> focus<00:05:30.130> of<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.850> multiplayer

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
really the main focus of the multiplayer

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.390 
really the main focus of the multiplayer
and<00:05:31.510> watchdogs<00:05:31.960> and<00:05:32.260> comparing<00:05:32.860> this<00:05:32.950> to<00:05:33.010> GT

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
and watchdogs and comparing this to GT

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.100 
and watchdogs and comparing this to GT
online<00:05:33.610> since<00:05:34.120> as<00:05:34.240> the<00:05:34.510> purpose<00:05:34.870> of<00:05:34.990> this
