understand what do you expect with a six
month<00:02:01.500> old<00:02:01.680> engine<00:02:02.070> with<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.310> know<00:02:03.380> 140<00:02:04.380> saw

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
month old engine with you know 140 saw

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.730 
month old engine with you know 140 saw
hours<00:02:05.150> yeah<00:02:06.150> when<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:06.479> put<00:02:06.660> it<00:02:06.750> back<00:02:06.870> together

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
hours yeah when we put it back together

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.010 
hours yeah when we put it back together
of<00:02:09.070> course<00:02:09.370> we<00:02:09.520> started<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.090> in<00:02:10.240> my

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
of course we started it in my

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.310 
of course we started it in my
luck<00:02:11.200> none<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.400> years<00:02:12.640> worth<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:14.020> we<00:02:14.140> took

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
luck none of the years worth so we took

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.080 
luck none of the years worth so we took
the<00:02:14.470> engine<00:02:14.800> back<00:02:14.950> yard<00:02:15.250> set<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.700> back<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:16.000> the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
the engine back yard set it back to the

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.710 
the engine back yard set it back to the
shop<00:02:17.250> angle<00:02:18.250> them<00:02:18.460> to<00:02:18.760> our<00:02:18.940> reassembling

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
shop angle them to our reassembling

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.540 
shop angle them to our reassembling
correctly<00:02:20.350> I<00:02:20.560> mean<00:02:20.800> I'm<00:02:20.890> assuming<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.400> did

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
correctly I mean I'm assuming I did

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.040 
correctly I mean I'm assuming I did
something<00:02:21.760> wrong<00:02:21.970> with<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.210> gear<00:02:22.420> set<00:02:22.720> on<00:02:22.870> the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
something wrong with the gear set on the

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.710 
something wrong with the gear set on the
ship<00:02:23.290> or<00:02:23.530> ship<00:02:24.130> travel<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:25.210> there's<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:25.660> many

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
ship or ship travel and there's so many

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.870 
ship or ship travel and there's so many
 pieces<00:02:26.470> on<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.040> engine<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.610> really

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
 pieces on that engine I really

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.400 
 pieces on that engine I really
don't<00:02:28.030> know<00:02:28.090> what<00:02:28.300> we<00:02:28.420> did<00:02:28.570> wrong<00:02:28.600> but<00:02:29.230> it

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
don't know what we did wrong but it

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.890 
don't know what we did wrong but it
right<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.970> was<00:02:30.970> riding<00:02:31.300> along<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.570> other<00:02:31.690> day

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
right I was riding along the other day

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.870 
right I was riding along the other day
and<00:02:32.110> then<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.260> motor<00:02:32.590> Schmidt<00:02:33.430> bang

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
and then the motor Schmidt bang

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.240 
and then the motor Schmidt bang
and<00:02:34.300> I<00:02:34.390> had<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:35.080> much<00:02:35.110> vibration<00:02:35.650> in<00:02:36.220> the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
and I had so much vibration in the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.470 
and I had so much vibration in the
steering<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:36.850> thought<00:02:37.030> something<00:02:37.270> got

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
steering I thought something got

is another problem still I heard the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.380 
is another problem still I heard the
noise<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.400> knew<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.879> wasn't<00:02:57.030> going<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.330> be

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
noise I knew that it wasn't going to be

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.780 
noise I knew that it wasn't going to be
something<00:02:57.629> minor<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.409> I<00:02:58.980> could<00:02:59.280> hear<00:02:59.489> that

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
something minor and I could hear that

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.869 
something minor and I could hear that
the<00:03:00.629> engine<00:03:00.840> just<00:03:01.110> had<00:03:01.409> so<00:03:01.680> much<00:03:01.709> vibration<00:03:02.220> in

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
the engine just had so much vibration in

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.569 
the engine just had so much vibration in
it<00:03:03.379> that<00:03:04.379> something<00:03:04.860> was<00:03:04.980> definitely<00:03:05.129> me<00:03:05.430> know

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
it that something was definitely me know

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:06.920 
it that something was definitely me know
initially<00:03:05.879> I<00:03:06.150> thought<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.629> it<00:03:06.750> definitely

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
initially I thought that it definitely

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.399 
initially I thought that it definitely
would<00:03:07.230> have<00:03:07.260> been<00:03:07.470> here<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:08.599> cam<00:03:09.599> chain<00:03:10.019> cam

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
would have been here on cam chain cam

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.229 
would have been here on cam chain cam
chain<00:03:10.680> tensioner<00:03:10.709> something<00:03:11.610> on<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.970> side

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
chain tensioner something on that side

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.059 
chain tensioner something on that side
here's<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.260> video<00:03:13.470> of<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.650> noise<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:13.980> was

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
here's a video of the noise it was

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:32.890 
here's a video of the noise it was
making<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:28.220> you<00:03:29.220> can<00:03:29.400> see<00:03:29.640> the

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.740 

counterbalance<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:33.989> shaft<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.440> spitting<00:03:35.750> on

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
counterbalance the shaft is spitting on

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.780 
counterbalance the shaft is spitting on
its<00:03:36.959> own<00:03:37.140> so<00:03:37.349> I<00:03:37.590> mean<00:03:37.829> you<00:03:38.159> hear<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.549> noise

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
its own so I mean you hear that noise

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.630 
its own so I mean you hear that noise
and<00:03:39.209> first<00:03:39.989> off<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.530> don't<00:03:40.769> know<00:03:40.859> I<00:03:40.890> thought<00:03:41.489> it

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
and first off I don't know I thought it

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.330 
and first off I don't know I thought it
had<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:42.030> know<00:03:42.060> deaf<00:03:42.329> people<00:03:42.540> something<00:03:43.340> chain

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
had you know deaf people something chain

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.949 
had you know deaf people something chain
related<00:03:44.790> but<00:03:44.879> it<00:03:45.000> turns<00:03:45.209> out<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:45.480> once<00:03:45.780> we

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
related but it turns out that once we

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.809 
related but it turns out that once we
should<00:03:46.170> strip<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.620> left<00:03:46.859> let's<00:03:47.250> case<00:03:47.549> of<00:03:47.760> the

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
should strip the left let's case of the

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.150 
should strip the left let's case of the
mohawk

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
mohawk

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.250 
mohawk
but<00:03:49.370> how<00:03:49.940> balanced<00:03:50.390> a<00:03:50.480> chopper<00:03:50.750> just

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
but how balanced a chopper just

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.679 
but how balanced a chopper just
it<00:03:52.799> was<00:03:52.980> just<00:03:53.159> spinning<00:03:53.370> on<00:03:53.549> its<00:03:53.580> own<00:03:53.849> if<00:03:54.150> you

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
it was just spinning on its own if you

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.300 
it was just spinning on its own if you
know<00:03:54.810> we'd<00:03:55.019> sign<00:03:55.290> that<00:03:55.500> with<00:03:55.620> our<00:03:55.709> head<00:03:55.950> and

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
know we'd sign that with our head and

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.910 
know we'd sign that with our head and
the<00:03:56.790> crank<00:03:57.060> wasn't<00:03:57.450> going<00:03:57.659> with<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:57.930> no<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.680> was

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
the crank wasn't going with it no I was

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.230 
the crank wasn't going with it no I was
 furious

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240
