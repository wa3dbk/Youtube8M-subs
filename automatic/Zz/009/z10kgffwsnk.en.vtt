that you actually learned but uh you
will<00:02:11.489> improve<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.299> lot<00:02:12.690> faster<00:02:13.140> in<00:02:13.230> call<00:02:13.410> of

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
will improve a lot faster in call of

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.720 
will improve a lot faster in call of
duty<00:02:13.560> if<00:02:13.799> you<00:02:13.890> look<00:02:14.040> at<00:02:14.130> your<00:02:14.250> mistakes<00:02:14.579> and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
duty if you look at your mistakes and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.490 
duty if you look at your mistakes and
figure<00:02:15.000> out<00:02:15.090> what<00:02:15.750> can<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.019> do<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.230> make

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
figure out what can you do to make

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.780 
figure out what can you do to make
yourself<00:02:16.590> better<00:02:16.920> what<00:02:17.220> can<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.459> done<00:02:17.670> in

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
yourself better what can you done in

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.090 
yourself better what can you done in
that<00:02:17.880> situation<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:19.019> you<00:02:19.079> don't<00:02:19.650> do<00:02:19.859> it<00:02:20.010> again

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
that situation so you don't do it again

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.620 
that situation so you don't do it again
and<00:02:20.310> that's<00:02:20.459> really<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.820> thought<00:02:21.090> process<00:02:21.329> that

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
and that's really a thought process that

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.720 
and that's really a thought process that
helps<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.410> lot<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.859> gamers<00:02:23.250> out<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.519> they<00:02:23.579> want

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
like i said is a triple nuke with the

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.289 
like i said is a triple nuke with the
mp5k<00:02:28.739> not<00:02:29.130> using<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.430> silencer<00:02:29.640> on<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.030> because

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
mp5k not using a silencer on it because

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.520 
mp5k not using a silencer on it because
i<00:02:30.390> feel<00:02:30.570> like<00:02:30.600> in<00:02:30.840> ground<00:02:31.079> war<00:02:31.230> it's<00:02:31.350> not

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
i feel like in ground war it's not

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.550 
i feel like in ground war it's not
really<00:02:31.769> needed<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.570> FMJ<00:02:33.570> just<00:02:33.900> seems<00:02:34.169> to<00:02:34.410> do

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
really needed and FMJ just seems to do

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.750 
really needed and FMJ just seems to do
the<00:02:34.590> job<00:02:34.889> a<00:02:34.919> lot<00:02:35.160> more<00:02:35.459> because<00:02:35.579> you're

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
the job a lot more because you're

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
the job a lot more because you're
spraying<00:02:36.060> through<00:02:36.329> multiple

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
spraying through multiple

people<00:02:37.140> I'm<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.530> spawn<00:02:37.800> all<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.190> time<00:02:38.430> so

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
people I'm in the spawn all the time so

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.980 
people I'm in the spawn all the time so
that<00:02:38.819> extra<00:02:39.209> bullet<00:02:39.480> damage<00:02:39.600> when<00:02:39.930> I'm

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
that extra bullet damage when I'm

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.660 
that extra bullet damage when I'm
shooting<00:02:40.170> through<00:02:40.410> others<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:41.340> definitely

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
shooting through others it definitely

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.190 
shooting through others it definitely
helps<00:02:42.060> out<00:02:42.240> quite<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.600> lot<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.900> may<00:02:43.020> not<00:02:43.140> think

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
helps out quite a lot you may not think

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.410 
helps out quite a lot you may not think
it<00:02:43.440> does<00:02:43.590> but<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.010> be<00:02:44.130> honest<00:02:44.430> FMJ<00:02:44.850> is<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.060> very

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
it does but to be honest FMJ is a very

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.880 
it does but to be honest FMJ is a very
effective<00:02:45.569> perk<00:02:46.140> especially<00:02:46.650> on<00:02:46.709> some

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
effective perk especially on some

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.800 
effective perk especially on some
machine<00:02:47.160> guns<00:02:47.370> um<00:02:47.520> it<00:02:48.120> doesn't<00:02:48.330> get<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.600> high

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
machine guns um it doesn't get that high

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.270 
machine guns um it doesn't get that high
damage<00:02:49.080> when<00:02:49.380> shooting<00:02:49.530> through<00:02:49.800> walls<00:02:49.830> so

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
damage when shooting through walls so

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.790 
damage when shooting through walls so
having<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.670> extra<00:02:50.790> wall<00:02:51.209> damage<00:02:51.420> is

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
having the extra wall damage is

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.830 
having the extra wall damage is
definitely<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:52.830> really<00:02:53.370> helpful<00:02:53.640> thing<00:02:54.239> but<00:02:54.660> uh

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
definitely a really helpful thing but uh

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.780 
definitely a really helpful thing but uh
I<00:02:55.500> kind<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.069> wanted<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.400> talk<00:02:56.550> about<00:02:56.580> something
