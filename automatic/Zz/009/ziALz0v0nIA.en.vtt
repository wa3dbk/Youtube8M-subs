00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
reviews and stuff you know that I well I

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.660 
reviews and stuff you know that I well I
really<00:00:49.970> think<00:00:50.230> s60<00:00:51.230> is<00:00:51.440> just<00:00:51.710> incredibly

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
really think s60 is just incredibly

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.979 
really think s60 is just incredibly
functional<00:00:53.060> and<00:00:53.450> there's<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:53.660> much<00:00:53.750> you<00:00:53.840> can

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
functional and there's so much you can

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.260 
functional and there's so much you can
do<00:00:54.140> with<00:00:54.290> it<00:00:54.500> I<00:00:54.680> really<00:00:55.250> think<00:00:55.520> it<00:00:55.670> needs<00:00:56.090> an

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
do with it I really think it needs an

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.990 
do with it I really think it needs an
overhaul<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:56.899> terms<00:00:57.200> of<00:00:57.410> its<00:00:57.559> user<00:00:58.370> interface

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
overhaul in terms of its user interface

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.750 
overhaul in terms of its user interface

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
and just the way that I just there are

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
and just the way that I just there are

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
so I will get this fired up it wants us

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:50.430 
so I will get this fired up it wants us
a<00:04:46.770> they<00:04:47.770> never<00:04:47.980> have<00:04:48.220> Oakland<00:04:48.700> so<00:04:49.240> we<00:04:50.170> just<00:04:50.290> got

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
a they never have Oakland so we just got

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.770 
a they never have Oakland so we just got
San<00:04:50.590> Francisco<00:04:51.010> that's<00:04:51.160> fine<00:04:51.450> today<00:04:52.450> is

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
San Francisco that's fine today is

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.490 
San Francisco that's fine today is
actually<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:54.370> orders<00:04:54.850> at<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.000> 7th<00:04:55.510> yes

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
actually the orders at the 7th yes

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:04.980 
actually the orders at the 7th yes
indeed<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:58.470> it<00:04:59.470> is<00:04:59.650> to<00:05:02.040> hey<00:05:03.040> now<00:05:03.220> it<00:05:03.880> is<00:05:04.090> 219

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
indeed and it is to hey now it is 219

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:12.530 
indeed and it is to hey now it is 219
p.m.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.380 

so<00:05:13.320> it's<00:05:13.410> kind<00:05:13.560> of<00:05:13.590> a<00:05:13.680> more<00:05:13.830> basic<00:05:14.130> AT&amp;T<00:05:15.060> screen

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
so it's kind of a more basic AT&amp;T screen

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.080 
so it's kind of a more basic AT&amp;T screen
here<00:05:15.660> kind<00:05:15.930> of<00:05:15.990> interesting<00:05:16.580> if<00:05:17.580> we<00:05:17.670> go<00:05:17.880> back

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
here kind of interesting if we go back

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.360 
here kind of interesting if we go back
you<00:05:18.120> can<00:05:18.450> see<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.720> AT&amp;T<00:05:19.200> Navigator<00:05:19.410> shortcut

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
you can see the AT&amp;T Navigator shortcut

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.000 
you can see the AT&amp;T Navigator shortcut
is<00:05:20.550> pre-loaded<00:05:21.120> there<00:05:21.440> I'll<00:05:22.440> fire<00:05:22.680> up<00:05:22.830> here's

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
is pre-loaded there I'll fire up here's

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.410 
is pre-loaded there I'll fire up here's
the<00:05:23.100> e63<00:05:23.610> I'll<00:05:23.970> show<00:05:24.120> you<00:05:24.210> a<00:05:24.240> little

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
the e63 I'll show you a little

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:30.429 
the e63 I'll show you a little
comparison<00:05:24.900> fire<00:05:25.530> this<00:05:25.710> one<00:05:25.890> up

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:30.439 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:34.089 

so<00:05:31.309> here's<00:05:31.729> the<00:05:31.849> e63<00:05:32.330> on<00:05:32.659> the<00:05:32.779> left<00:05:33.080> at<00:05:33.349> east<00:05:33.619> 71

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
so here's the e63 on the left at east 71

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.009 
so here's the e63 on the left at east 71
X<00:05:34.429> on<00:05:34.819> the<00:05:34.969> right<00:05:35.179> and<00:05:35.389> I'll<00:05:35.509> under<00:05:35.719> have<00:05:35.869> the

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:36.019 
X on the right and I'll under have the

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:38.529 
X on the right and I'll under have the
unlock<00:05:36.319> to<00:05:36.469> e<00:05:36.499> 71<00:05:37.069> but<00:05:37.819> software-wise

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
unlock to e 71 but software-wise

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.329 
unlock to e 71 but software-wise
basically<00:05:38.989> save<00:05:39.289> and<00:05:39.469> you<00:05:39.529> can<00:05:39.709> see<00:05:39.979> you<00:05:40.219> know

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:40.339 
basically save and you can see you know

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.269 
basically save and you can see you know
difference<00:05:40.879> in<00:05:41.089> terms<00:05:41.389> of<00:05:41.599> the<00:05:41.860> the<00:05:42.860> basic

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:43.279 
difference in terms of the the basic

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:44.769 
difference in terms of the the basic
view<00:05:43.580> here<00:05:43.939> I'm<00:05:44.119> gonna<00:05:44.239> see<00:05:44.330> how<00:05:44.419> much<00:05:44.509> I<00:05:44.659> can

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:44.779 
view here I'm gonna see how much I can

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.379 
view here I'm gonna see how much I can
go<00:05:44.929> into<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.319> e<00:05:45.349> 71<00:05:45.889> X<00:05:46.129> and<00:05:46.429> try<00:05:47.029> to<00:05:47.089> find<00:05:47.300> out

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
go into the e 71 X and try to find out

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.939 
go into the e 71 X and try to find out
what<00:05:47.539> eighteens<00:05:47.839> he's<00:05:48.080> changed<00:05:48.529> on<00:05:48.649> it<00:05:48.679> and

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
what eighteens he's changed on it and

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.249 
what eighteens he's changed on it and
what<00:05:49.099> I<00:05:49.129> can<00:05:49.429> tweak<00:05:49.759> in<00:05:50.059> terms<00:05:50.719> of<00:05:50.869> the<00:05:50.959> act<00:05:51.080> of

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259 
what I can tweak in terms of the act of

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:52.779 
what I can tweak in terms of the act of
standby<00:05:51.529> settings<00:05:51.949> and<00:05:52.069> that<00:05:52.159> kind<00:05:52.369> of<00:05:52.399> thing

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
standby settings and that kind of thing

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.540 
standby settings and that kind of thing
hardware<00:05:53.689> wise<00:05:53.809> you<00:05:53.959> can<00:05:54.080> see<00:05:54.199> the<00:05:54.349> e<00:05:54.379> 71<00:05:54.949> X<00:05:55.249> is

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
hardware wise you can see the e 71 X is

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.249 
hardware wise you can see the e 71 X is
a<00:05:55.580> plastic<00:05:56.209> kind<00:05:56.389> of<00:05:56.479> thicker<00:05:56.689> version<00:05:56.959> of
