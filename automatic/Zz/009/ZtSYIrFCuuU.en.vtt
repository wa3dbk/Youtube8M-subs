00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.240
 Peter came out of the match against FC Groningen unscathed 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.340
 we got that without you I got the song above 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.169
 but in general it is not too bad 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.410
 so ignore it we do not train today not with the group but 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.439
 tackle how is he 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.199
 yes that the the division has just started again so that it will last longer 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.050
 required 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.029
 but tomorrow morning for the cup against Noordwijk 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.029
 against a top class amateur club Saturday what can we expect 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.290
 So 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.290
 not yet the ten countries with bullying 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.990
 yes you never know what happens that it should be as good as a team 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.990
 fight well they made a few goals land 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.570
 sirte 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.719
 and says if a pack makes oss 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.870
 against clubs like that is often not difficult if you don't do it quickly 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.649
 scores that you also saw such a problem in the previous round against the church 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.510
 tomorrow evening 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.710
 rutte 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.290
 yes we do not know clearly how it fits in our game 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.380
 there sees cell and the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.370
 yes we should not have done what we want before the game and did 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.000
 she had a daughter 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.730
 both very common 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.670
 ride on the jacob and 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.750
 yes and at the same time the first goal was made 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.320
 what is of plow 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.090
 yes team that this season did not start so well last week one 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.110
 good result achieved 0 3 against hardenberg 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.660
 it is an opponent for which you have little respect but I think 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.610
 yet that we, as vitesse, simply have to go from our own strength 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.910
 play and 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.960
 have to go from the beginning of the next act to break the opponent in that way 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.730
 play 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.730
 it is best to compare it with the past few weeks 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.480
 normal there that was a big league this is a top class normally this would be 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.130
 level is to be higher 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.030
 and also there we saw that it is really not that easy when 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.450
 play the team well compact 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.530
 and watch the counter then you will have to play at a high pace 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.960
 stuck for that matter the fact that we can play at home on our field that 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.600
 makes it a little easier there than mister aart plays 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.200
 last year vitesse played okay at home for the cup, it was a very high score 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.529
 then the expected spectators and you think again 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.529
 two got the spectators expect but each game is different 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.909
 and we will try to make the defeat at the game especially it 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.909
 high level is the last few weeks with vitesse to hold it 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.529
 and for that, every player must be sharply focused 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:28.819
 And for traffic chose the strongest team, man has so strong 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.239
 possible team to draw some trainer ciro ferrara plays a nice 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.119
 opportunity for boys who are close to it to play 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:36.499
 how do you stand now 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.489
 I had that I always want to play with the best players and 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.499
 so we are going to play with the best players again tomorrow and they will 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.779
 also what other boys can be that have several good players
