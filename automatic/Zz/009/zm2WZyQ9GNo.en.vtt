workshop<00:00:19.220> it's<00:00:20.220> big<00:00:20.430> one<00:00:20.640> for<00:00:20.820> example<00:00:20.910> I've

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
workshop it's big one for example I've

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.750 
workshop it's big one for example I've
just<00:00:21.750> put<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.080> bit<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.230> pipe<00:00:22.470> on<00:00:22.680> there<00:00:22.949> talk<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
just put a bit of pipe on there talk and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.029 
just put a bit of pipe on there talk and
get<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.029> into<00:00:24.269> it's<00:00:24.869> look<00:00:25.080> some<00:00:25.320> crevices<00:00:25.859> and

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
get it into it's look some crevices and

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.060 
get it into it's look some crevices and
that<00:00:26.430> can<00:00:26.580> go<00:00:26.730> into<00:00:26.910> gearbox<00:00:27.630> filler<00:00:27.960> caps<00:00:28.320> it

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
that can go into gearbox filler caps it

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.160 
that can go into gearbox filler caps it
can<00:00:29.250> go<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.609> into<00:00:29.939> little<00:00:30.060> prices<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.900> can't

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170

your Forks let's assume these folks take
200<00:00:39.809> cc's<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.680> oil<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.430> you've<00:00:41.790> got<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> little

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
200 cc's of oil and you've got a little

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.000 
200 cc's of oil and you've got a little
tiny<00:00:42.480> filler<00:00:42.899> cap<00:00:43.110> at<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> top<00:00:43.590> which<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.860> can

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
tiny filler cap at the top which you can

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.260 
tiny filler cap at the top which you can
undo<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.670> don't<00:00:44.789> want<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.969> take<00:00:45.120> all<00:00:45.239> your

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
got perfectly balanced fork legs using

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.760 
got perfectly balanced fork legs using
that<00:01:08.700> tools<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.090> say<00:01:09.299> gearbox<00:01:10.110> oil<00:01:10.290> anything

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770

couple of quid the other syringe looks a
little<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.509> gotta<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.720> careful<00:01:18.930> with<00:01:19.140> this

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
little you gotta be careful with this

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.120 
little you gotta be careful with this
because<00:01:19.290> obviously<00:01:19.500> I've<00:01:19.740> got<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> needle

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
because obviously I've got a needle

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.550 
because obviously I've got a needle
attached<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:21.509> whole<00:01:21.780> point<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.439> it's

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
attached the whole point is that it's

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.719 
attached the whole point is that it's
got<00:01:22.710> some<00:01:22.920> oil<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.310> there

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
got some oil in there

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.520 
got some oil in there
I'm<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.240> lubricate<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.750> cable<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.380> it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
I'm going to lubricate a cable with it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.950 
I'm going to lubricate a cable with it
the<00:01:26.130> needle<00:01:26.520> well<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.210> whole<00:01:27.420> point<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the needle well the whole point of the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.140 
the needle well the whole point of the
needle<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.920> when<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> get<00:01:29.189> my<00:01:29.579> cable<00:01:30.000> on

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
needle is that when I get my cable on

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.510 
needle is that when I get my cable on
this<00:01:30.540> case<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> throttle<00:01:31.229> cable<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:32.159> pull

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
this case a throttle cable I can pull

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.039 
this case a throttle cable I can pull
against<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> slide<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.450> carburetor<00:01:33.960> to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
against the slide in the carburetor to

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.980 
against the slide in the carburetor to
expose<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.650> actual<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.159> Bowden<00:01:35.579> cable<00:01:36.000> pull

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
expose the actual in a Bowden cable pull

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.749 
expose the actual in a Bowden cable pull
the<00:01:37.110> outer<00:01:37.290> over<00:01:37.680> slightly<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.070> expose<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> hole

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the outer over slightly to expose a hole

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.120 
the outer over slightly to expose a hole
then<00:01:39.479> we're<00:01:39.570> going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.720> insert<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.770> needle

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
then we're going to insert the needle

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.719 
then we're going to insert the needle
into<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.790> hole<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.680> slowly<00:01:43.680> push<00:01:44.040> down<00:01:44.310> now
