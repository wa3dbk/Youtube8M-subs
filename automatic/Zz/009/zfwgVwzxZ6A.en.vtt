00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
sounds like the door lock is trying to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.130 
sounds like the door lock is trying to
engage<00:01:10.909> but<00:01:11.299> it's<00:01:11.510> not<00:01:11.810> happening<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:14.140> any

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
moment or so I think we're going to see

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.209 
moment or so I think we're going to see
an<00:01:17.630> F<00:01:17.869> DL<00:01:18.350> error<00:01:19.280> code<00:01:19.610> appear<00:01:19.969> in<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.149> window

an F DL error code appear in the window

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:26.499 
an F DL error code appear in the window
there<00:01:22.219> it<00:01:22.369> is<00:01:22.520> f<00:01:22.820> DL<00:01:23.829> failure<00:01:24.829> door<00:01:25.640> lock<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:26.329> D

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
there it is f DL failure door lock to D

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.170 
there it is f DL failure door lock to D
l<00:01:26.659> stands<00:01:27.049> for<00:01:27.140> door<00:01:27.409> lock<00:01:27.649> so<00:01:28.490> we've<00:01:28.880> got<00:01:29.060> to

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
l stands for door lock so we've got to

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
l stands for door lock so we've got to
find<00:01:29.420> out<00:01:29.630> why<00:01:30.259> the<00:01:30.320> door<00:01:30.890> lock<00:01:31.130> doesn't<00:01:31.460> work

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
find out why the door lock doesn't work

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.420 
find out why the door lock doesn't work
incidentally<00:01:33.200> is<00:01:33.259> that<00:01:33.439> our<00:01:33.560> experience<00:01:34.250> and

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
incidentally is that our experience and

incidentally is that our experience and
the<00:01:34.520> times<00:01:34.759> that<00:01:34.909> we've<00:01:35.060> worked<00:01:35.270> on<00:01:35.450> these

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
the times that we've worked on these

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.690 
the times that we've worked on these
things<00:01:35.899> in<00:01:36.109> the<00:01:36.229> past<00:01:36.409> it's<00:01:36.829> usually<00:01:37.009> not<00:01:37.460> at

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
things in the past it's usually not at

things in the past it's usually not at
the<00:01:37.820> door<00:01:37.969> lock<00:01:38.270> but<00:01:38.630> we<00:01:39.289> leave<00:01:39.500> out<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:40.070> be

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
the door lock but we leave out it to be

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
is on a little diaphragm switch inside

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.190 
is on a little diaphragm switch inside
of<00:02:25.190> there<00:02:25.340> of<00:02:26.060> course<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.480> master<00:02:26.840> control

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
of there of course the master control

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.680 
of there of course the master control
unit<00:02:27.230> this<00:02:28.190> is<00:02:28.250> what<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.610> suspect<00:02:29.330> is<00:02:29.480> going<00:02:29.569> to

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
unit this is what I suspect is going to

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.370 
unit this is what I suspect is going to
be<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.900> problem

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
be the problem

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.470 
be the problem
we're<00:02:30.560> probably<00:02:30.800> looking<00:02:31.459> at<00:02:31.610> just<00:02:32.030> dirty

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
we're probably looking at just dirty

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.330 
we're probably looking at just dirty
connectors<00:02:32.990> so<00:02:33.680> we're<00:02:33.860> going<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.010> go<00:02:34.130> through

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
connectors so we're going to go through

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.770 
connectors so we're going to go through
all<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.459> these<00:02:34.640> connectors<00:02:35.180> make<00:02:35.420> sure<00:02:35.540> that

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
all of these connectors make sure that

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.980 
all of these connectors make sure that
they're<00:02:35.959> good<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:37.000> probably<00:02:38.000> most<00:02:38.540> important

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
they're good and probably most important

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.350 
they're good and probably most important
of<00:02:39.020> all<00:02:39.140> down<00:02:39.470> there<00:02:39.740> I<00:02:39.920> don't<00:02:40.700> think<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.209> can

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
of all down there I don't think you can

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.150 
of all down there I don't think you can
see<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.720> but<00:02:41.900> we're<00:02:42.050> looking<00:02:42.200> kind<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.740> towards

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
see it but we're looking kind of towards

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.310 
see it but we're looking kind of towards
the<00:02:43.250> front<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.880> washer<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.510> right<00:02:44.750> right

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
the front of the washer the right right

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.290 
the front of the washer the right right
front<00:02:45.620> side<00:02:45.709> of<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.070> washer<00:02:46.459> down<00:02:46.670> behind<00:02:47.120> it

front side of the washer down behind it
and<00:02:47.530> right<00:02:48.530> down<00:02:48.920> in<00:02:49.160> there<00:02:49.370> down<00:02:50.090> there<00:02:50.330> is

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
and right down in there down there is

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.820 
and right down in there down there is
where<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.050> door<00:02:51.260> lock<00:02:51.470> is<00:02:51.680> at<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:53.830> usually

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
where the door lock is at and usually

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.260 
where the door lock is at and usually
when<00:02:54.980> we<00:02:55.100> test<00:02:55.340> out<00:02:55.520> these<00:02:55.700> door<00:02:56.000> locks

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
when we test out these door locks

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.900 
when we test out these door locks
they're<00:02:56.930> fine<00:02:57.400> nothing<00:02:58.400> nothing<00:02:58.700> is<00:02:58.790> wrong

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
they're fine nothing nothing is wrong

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.760 
they're fine nothing nothing is wrong
with<00:02:58.970> them<00:02:59.209> I<00:02:59.300> take<00:02:59.480> em<00:02:59.660> out<00:02:59.780> I<00:02:59.810> test<00:03:00.200> them<00:03:00.440> they

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
with them I take em out I test them they

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.190 
with them I take em out I test them they
seem<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.130> be<00:03:01.250> fine<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:02.540> we're<00:03:02.810> going<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:02.989> take<00:03:03.140> a

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
seem to be fine so we're going to take a

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.990 
seem to be fine so we're going to take a
look<00:03:03.380> at<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.620> master<00:03:03.800> control<00:03:04.340> units<00:03:04.700> first

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
look at the master control units first

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.430 
look at the master control units first
before<00:03:05.239> we<00:03:05.540> go<00:03:05.660> chasing<00:03:06.200> after<00:03:06.320> our<00:03:06.530> door<00:03:06.830> lock

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
before we go chasing after our door lock

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.790 
before we go chasing after our door lock
well<00:03:09.440> I<00:03:09.769> was<00:03:10.489> right<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:12.050> door<00:03:12.260> lock<00:03:12.470> was

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
well I was right the the door lock was

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.790 
well I was right the the door lock was
not<00:03:13.100> at<00:03:13.280> fault<00:03:13.660> I've<00:03:14.660> had<00:03:14.900> enough<00:03:15.140> experience

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
not at fault I've had enough experience

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.979 
not at fault I've had enough experience
with<00:03:15.890> these<00:03:16.190> things<00:03:16.519> now<00:03:16.820> that<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:17.600> door<00:03:17.750> lock

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
with these things now that the door lock

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.830 
with these things now that the door lock
assembly<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:19.190> usually<00:03:19.580> what<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:19.790> don't<00:03:20.300> look<00:03:20.630> at

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
assembly is usually what I don't look at

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.500 
assembly is usually what I don't look at
first<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.640> problem<00:03:23.769> appeared<00:03:24.769> to<00:03:24.920> be<00:03:25.100> a

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
first the the problem appeared to be a

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.789 
first the the problem appeared to be a
clicking<00:03:26.510> relay<00:03:26.870> that<00:03:27.050> was<00:03:27.200> happening<00:03:27.590> at<00:03:27.680> the

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
clicking relay that was happening at the

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.759 
clicking relay that was happening at the
master<00:03:28.220> control<00:03:28.579> unit<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:30.440> master

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
master control unit and the master

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.240 
master control unit and the master
control<00:03:31.070> unit<00:03:31.100> itself<00:03:31.610> was<00:03:31.910> okay<00:03:32.329> but<00:03:33.140> what<00:03:34.130> we

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
control unit itself was okay but what we

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.130 
control unit itself was okay but what we
had<00:03:34.459> what<00:03:35.180> we<00:03:35.299> had<00:03:35.480> here<00:03:35.690> was<00:03:35.750> dirty

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
had what we had here was dirty

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.949 
had what we had here was dirty
connections<00:03:36.680> we<00:03:37.519> have<00:03:37.640> if<00:03:38.299> you're<00:03:38.540> having<00:03:38.720> a

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
connections we have if you're having a

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.020 
connections we have if you're having a
experiencing<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:40.010> door<00:03:40.220> lock<00:03:40.370> problem<00:03:40.880> with

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
experiencing a door lock problem with

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.750 
experiencing a door lock problem with
your<00:03:41.269> direct<00:03:41.690> unit<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:42.680> wire<00:03:42.890> harnesses<00:03:43.549> that

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
your direct unit the wire harnesses that

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.430 
your direct unit the wire harnesses that
you<00:03:43.880> want<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.180> pay<00:03:44.329> particular<00:03:44.570> attention<00:03:44.989> to

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
you want to pay particular attention to

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.590 
you want to pay particular attention to
it<00:03:45.920> would<00:03:46.280> be<00:03:46.459> these<00:03:47.440> this<00:03:48.440> here<00:03:49.329> this<00:03:50.329> one

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
it would be these this here this one

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.490 
it would be these this here this one
here<00:03:50.810> as<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.680> three<00:03:51.950> wires<00:03:52.250> on<00:03:52.579> it<00:03:52.760> okay<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:54.410> a

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
here as the three wires on it okay and a

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.949 
here as the three wires on it okay and a
band

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
band

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.209 
band
we're<00:03:55.349> also<00:03:55.560> going<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.040> pay<00:03:56.670> attention<00:03:56.969> to

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:58.219 
we're also going to pay attention to

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:03.380 
we're also going to pay attention to
these<00:03:59.219> two<00:03:59.659> wires<00:04:00.709> located<00:04:01.709> on<00:04:01.859> the<00:04:02.010> side<00:04:02.390> each

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
these two wires located on the side each

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.940 
these two wires located on the side each
of<00:04:03.569> these<00:04:03.719> things<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.319> whole<00:04:04.439> idea<00:04:04.650> is

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
of these things and the whole idea is

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.699 
of these things and the whole idea is
what<00:04:05.219> you<00:04:05.370> do<00:04:05.549> is<00:04:05.819> you<00:04:06.420> just<00:04:06.560> disconnect<00:04:07.560> each

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
what you do is you just disconnect each

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.089 
what you do is you just disconnect each
one<00:04:07.980> of<00:04:08.099> these<00:04:08.189> connectors<00:04:09.739> take<00:04:10.739> them<00:04:10.920> off

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
one of these connectors take them off

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.399 
one of these connectors take them off
make<00:04:11.700> sure<00:04:11.730> make<00:04:12.540> sure<00:04:12.599> of<00:04:12.870> course<00:04:13.109> you<00:04:13.230> don't

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
make sure make sure of course you don't

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.410 
make sure make sure of course you don't
mix<00:04:13.709> them<00:04:13.889> up<00:04:14.010> especially<00:04:14.370> these<00:04:14.760> two<00:04:14.819> because

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
mix them up especially these two because

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.840 
mix them up especially these two because
you<00:04:15.540> can<00:04:15.689> mix<00:04:15.840> these<00:04:16.049> up<00:04:16.259> and<00:04:16.669> you<00:04:17.669> just

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
you can mix these up and you just

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.080 
you can mix these up and you just
basically<00:04:18.449> well<00:04:18.959> I'll<00:04:19.049> just<00:04:19.229> do<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.410> for<00:04:19.709> you

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
basically well I'll just do it for you

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.520 
basically well I'll just do it for you
what<00:04:21.090> we<00:04:21.209> do<00:04:21.359> is<00:04:21.449> we<00:04:21.600> just<00:04:21.630> take<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.229> take

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
what we do is we just take the take

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:30.920 
what we do is we just take the take
connector<00:04:24.740> pull<00:04:25.740> it<00:04:25.889> out<00:04:27.139> and<00:04:29.750> we'll<00:04:30.750> just

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
connector pull it out and we'll just

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.450 
connector pull it out and we'll just
kind<00:04:31.080> of<00:04:31.199> go<00:04:31.259> back<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:31.650> forth<00:04:32.070> a<00:04:32.220> few<00:04:32.400> times

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
kind of go back and forth a few times

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.180 
kind of go back and forth a few times
just<00:04:33.229> keep<00:04:34.229> wiggling<00:04:34.500> it<00:04:34.830> back<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.310> forth

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
just keep wiggling it back and forth

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.810 
just keep wiggling it back and forth
things<00:04:38.190> don't<00:04:38.430> like<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.729> come<00:04:38.880> out<00:04:39.000> sometimes

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
things don't like to come out sometimes

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.939 
things don't like to come out sometimes
the<00:04:41.820> whole<00:04:42.000> idea<00:04:42.330> is<00:04:42.449> that<00:04:42.720> just<00:04:43.259> by<00:04:43.410> sliding

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
the whole idea is that just by sliding

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.379 
the whole idea is that just by sliding
them<00:04:44.250> back<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.669> forth<00:04:44.880> back<00:04:45.120> and<00:04:45.150> forth

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
them back and forth back and forth

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.689 
them back and forth back and forth
you're<00:04:45.720> cleaning<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.259> contacts<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.190> you're

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
you're cleaning the contacts and you're

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.210 
you're cleaning the contacts and you're
scraping<00:04:48.000> away<00:04:48.330> any<00:04:48.599> oxides<00:04:49.199> which<00:04:50.039> has

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
scraping away any oxides which has

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.980 
scraping away any oxides which has
probably<00:04:50.610> been<00:04:50.849> formed<00:04:51.240> on<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.509> electrical

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
probably been formed on the electrical

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.279 
probably been formed on the electrical
contacts<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:53.690> put<00:04:54.690> it<00:04:54.780> all<00:04:54.900> back<00:04:54.930> together

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
contacts and put it all back together

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.770 
contacts and put it all back together
again<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:55.889> it<00:04:56.009> starts<00:04:56.460> working<00:04:56.639> and<00:04:57.180> machines

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
again and it starts working and machines

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.339 
again and it starts working and machines
going<00:04:58.520> going<00:04:59.520> great<00:04:59.820> guns<00:05:00.020> no<00:05:01.020> parts

going going great guns no parts

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:12.100 
going going great guns no parts
necessary<00:05:01.560> for<00:05:02.070> this<00:05:02.190> one
