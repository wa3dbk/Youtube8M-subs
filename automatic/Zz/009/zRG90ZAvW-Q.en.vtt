bottom<00:04:46.570> right<00:04:46.870> now<00:04:47.010> is<00:04:48.010> right<00:04:48.970> below<00:04:49.560> this

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
bottom right now is right below this

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.709 
bottom right now is right below this
blue<00:04:50.890> band<00:04:51.450> right<00:04:52.450> here

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:55.719 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:59.629 

right<00:04:56.289> right<00:04:56.860> between<00:04:57.459> these<00:04:57.939> two<00:04:58.239> and

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
right right between these two and

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:06.029 
right right between these two and
remember<00:05:00.639> no<00:05:01.449> one<00:05:01.479> tickets<00:05:02.019> up<00:05:04.829> Michael<00:05:05.829> can't

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
remember no one tickets up Michael can't

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.479 
remember no one tickets up Michael can't
reach<00:05:06.189> I'm<00:05:06.339> going<00:05:06.489> to<00:05:06.549> tilt<00:05:07.389> it<00:05:07.599> but<00:05:08.589> there's

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:09.489 
reach I'm going to tilt it but there's

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:25.510 
reach I'm going to tilt it but there's
water<00:05:09.729> almost<00:05:09.999> definitely<00:05:10.299> going<00:05:10.389> down

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.339 

I<00:05:25.550> think<00:05:26.270> you<00:05:26.360> can<00:05:26.509> tell<00:05:26.660> it<00:05:26.810> and<00:05:26.900> swallow<00:05:27.169> and

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
I think you can tell it and swallow and

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.249 
I think you can tell it and swallow and
for<00:05:27.500> real<00:05:27.620> and<00:05:29.080> the<00:05:30.080> water<00:05:30.349> is<00:05:30.620> maybe<00:05:31.340> halfway

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:32.259 
for real and the water is maybe halfway

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.409 
for real and the water is maybe halfway
between<00:05:33.430> before<00:05:34.430> you<00:05:34.580> can<00:05:34.729> barely<00:05:34.940> see<00:05:35.210> the

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
between before you can barely see the

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.020 
between before you can barely see the
water<00:05:35.629> here<00:05:36.199> at<00:05:36.710> all<00:05:36.979> it<00:05:37.280> was<00:05:37.400> completely<00:05:37.729> like

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
water here at all it was completely like

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.659 
water here at all it was completely like
right<00:05:38.690> in<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:38.960> blue<00:05:39.289> top<00:05:39.740> we've<00:05:39.949> been<00:05:40.099> when<00:05:40.550> I

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
right in the blue top we've been when I

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.939 
right in the blue top we've been when I
you<00:05:40.759> can<00:05:40.879> see<00:05:40.909> that<00:05:41.300> it's<00:05:41.509> about<00:05:41.889> just<00:05:42.889> a

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
you can see that it's about just a

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:45.399 
you can see that it's about just a
little<00:05:42.979> bit<00:05:43.220> above<00:05:43.490> this<00:05:43.789> dark<00:05:44.210> blue<00:05:44.419> band<00:05:44.629> so

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
little bit above this dark blue band so

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:46.990 
little bit above this dark blue band so
you<00:05:45.440> can<00:05:45.620> see<00:05:45.740> the<00:05:45.860> water<00:05:46.039> level<00:05:46.250> square<00:05:46.669> going

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
you can see the water level square going

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.059 
you can see the water level square going
down<00:05:47.300> and<00:05:47.900> it's<00:05:48.020> not<00:05:48.169> that<00:05:48.349> obvious<00:05:48.530> we<00:05:48.860> drop

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:49.069 
down and it's not that obvious we drop

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:51.430 
down and it's not that obvious we drop
but<00:05:49.400> you<00:05:49.520> can<00:05:49.699> tell<00:05:49.909> that<00:05:50.419> there<00:05:51.259> was<00:05:51.409> a

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
but you can tell that there was a

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.170 
but you can tell that there was a
difference<00:05:51.830> when<00:05:52.129> it<00:05:52.220> started<00:05:52.550> up<00:05:52.699> here<00:05:53.030> to

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
difference when it started up here to

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.619 
difference when it started up here to
begin<00:05:53.300> with<00:05:53.539> and<00:05:54.159> I<00:05:55.159> think<00:05:56.060> I<00:05:56.210> don't<00:05:56.300> know<00:05:56.479> why

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:56.629 
begin with and I think I don't know why

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:59.920 
begin with and I think I don't know why
you<00:05:56.690> wouldn't<00:05:56.990> trust<00:05:57.199> it<00:05:58.449> also<00:05:59.449> delicious

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
you wouldn't trust it also delicious

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.309 
you wouldn't trust it also delicious
snack<00:06:00.259> until<00:06:00.860> Isis<00:06:01.130> worse

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
snack until Isis worse

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:07.120 
snack until Isis worse
