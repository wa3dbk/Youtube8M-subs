00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
your hopper see people with halo bees

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.890 
your hopper see people with halo bees
and<00:04:39.620> velocities<00:04:40.220> they<00:04:40.430> do<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:40.699> and<00:04:40.880> it<00:04:41.750> looks

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
and velocities they do it and it looks

really nice I don't know if you can do
with<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.370> rotor<00:04:43.580> because<00:04:43.880> it's<00:04:44.180> like<00:04:44.300> a

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
with the rotor because it's like a

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.080 
with the rotor because it's like a
different<00:04:44.570> type<00:04:44.780> of<00:04:44.930> plastic<00:04:45.350> that's<00:04:45.470> a

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
different type of plastic that's a

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.520 
different type of plastic that's a
second<00:04:47.090> it<00:04:47.210> took<00:04:47.389> a<00:04:47.449> kind<00:04:47.960> of<00:04:48.020> like<00:04:48.199> a<00:04:48.229> matte

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
second it took a kind of like a matte

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.840 
second it took a kind of like a matte
finish<00:04:48.770> I<00:04:49.160> don't<00:04:49.310> know<00:04:49.370> if<00:04:49.460> it's<00:04:49.580> different

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
finish I don't know if it's different

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
I'm pretty sure it's a different plastic

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.439 
I'm pretty sure it's a different plastic
but<00:04:51.560> I<00:04:51.770> don't<00:04:52.550> know<00:04:52.610> maybe<00:04:52.850> she<00:04:53.090> look<00:04:53.240> it<00:04:53.330> up

on<00:05:00.650> an<00:05:00.740> ion<00:05:01.070> body<00:05:01.340> to<00:05:01.580> sense<00:05:01.850> through<00:05:02.060> plastic

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
on an ion body to sense through plastic

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.710 
on an ion body to sense through plastic
so<00:05:03.860> you<00:05:04.370> can<00:05:04.550> take<00:05:05.030> a<00:05:05.060> little<00:05:05.240> patch<00:05:05.419> of<00:05:05.449> some

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
so you can take a little patch of some

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.890 
so you can take a little patch of some
bend<00:05:05.930> in<00:05:06.080> and<00:05:06.289> put<00:05:06.470> on<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.710> ion<00:05:07.389> so<00:05:08.389> this<00:05:08.750> is

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
bend in and put on the ion so this is

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.610 
bend in and put on the ion so this is
