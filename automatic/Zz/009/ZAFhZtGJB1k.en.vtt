00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.640 
okay and as you see it's pretty detailed
in<00:02:08.700> there<00:02:09.410> for<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.500> art<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.800> figure

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
in there for the art to figure

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.789 
in there for the art to figure
on<00:02:12.519> all<00:02:12.790> of<00:02:13.030> them<00:02:13.290> this<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.409> what<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.650> looks

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
on all of them this is what it looks

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.229 
on all of them this is what it looks
like<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:16.599> reverse<00:02:16.989> side<00:02:17.819> okay<00:02:18.819> gives<00:02:19.180> you

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
like on the reverse side okay gives you

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.410 
like on the reverse side okay gives you
an<00:02:19.299> idea<00:02:19.360> how<00:02:19.920> how<00:02:20.920> deep<00:02:21.310> they<00:02:21.579> go<00:02:22.680> okay<00:02:24.420> so

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
an idea how how deep they go okay so

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.940 
an idea how how deep they go okay so
they're<00:02:25.569> not<00:02:25.689> going<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.959> be<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.140> big<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.860> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
they're not going to be that big and the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.839 
they're not going to be that big and the
small<00:02:27.040> ones<00:02:27.370> are<00:02:27.400> gonna<00:02:27.549> be<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.670> big<00:02:29.609> but<00:02:30.609> the

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
small ones are gonna be that big but the

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.280 
small ones are gonna be that big but the
larger<00:02:31.090> one<00:02:31.359> will<00:02:31.450> be<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.569> good<00:02:31.780> size<00:02:31.989> you<00:02:32.019> can

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
larger one will be a good size you can

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.740 
larger one will be a good size you can
put<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.620> in<00:02:32.680> like<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.010> larger<00:02:34.000> cup<00:02:34.269> or<00:02:34.540> in<00:02:34.659> a

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
put that in like a larger cup or in a

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.140 
put that in like a larger cup or in a
pitcher<00:02:35.470> or<00:02:35.680> something<00:02:36.310> like<00:02:36.700> that<00:02:36.760> these

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
pitcher or something like that these

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.360 
pitcher or something like that these
will<00:02:37.299> sit<00:02:37.510> in<00:02:37.540> small<00:02:37.840> glasses<00:02:38.170> rocks<00:02:38.890> classes

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
will sit in small glasses rocks classes

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.390 
will sit in small glasses rocks classes
or<00:02:39.459> whatnot<00:02:39.609> so<00:02:40.049> so<00:02:41.049> that's<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.319> r21<00:02:43.319> there

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
or whatnot so so that's the r21 there

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:54.559 
or whatnot so so that's the r21 there
and<00:02:45.400> then<00:02:45.609> here<00:02:46.090> is<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:48.190> Han<00:02:48.430> Solo<00:02:49.180> frozen

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:02.220 

frozen<00:02:55.590> get<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:56.889> carbonite<00:02:58.139> okay<00:03:01.230> okay

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
frozen get it in carbonite okay okay

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
in carbonite i stray made of the same

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.780 
in carbonite i stray made of the same
silicon<00:03:11.470> as<00:03:11.939> are<00:03:12.939> too<00:03:13.209> so<00:03:13.510> it's<00:03:13.629> very<00:03:13.750> flexible

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
silicon as are too so it's very flexible

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.930 
silicon as are too so it's very flexible
okay<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:17.590> then<00:03:17.709> here<00:03:17.949> it<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.099> so<00:03:18.669> as<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:18.849> can

okay and then here it is so as you can

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.949 
okay and then here it is so as you can
see<00:03:19.120> again<00:03:19.829> get<00:03:20.829> some<00:03:20.980> pretty<00:03:21.190> good<00:03:21.400> detail<00:03:21.959> on

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
see again get some pretty good detail on

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.099 
see again get some pretty good detail on
that<00:03:23.169> console<00:03:23.949> character<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:25.840> know<00:03:25.870> we're

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109

this one gives you six small han Solo

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.439 
this one gives you six small han Solo
figures<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.079> one<00:03:38.260> large<00:03:38.669> okay<00:03:39.669> you<00:03:40.090> can<00:03:40.239> see

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
figures and one large okay you can see

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:41.969 
figures and one large okay you can see
this<00:03:40.659> is<00:03:40.840> just<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:41.049> stand<00:03:41.349> but<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.650> can<00:03:41.769> see

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:41.979

this is just a stand but you can see
here<00:03:42.400> that's<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.329> depth<00:03:43.629> of<00:03:43.840> how<00:03:44.199> deep

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
here that's the depth of how deep

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.009 
here that's the depth of how deep
they're<00:03:44.680> going<00:03:44.829> to<00:03:44.889> be<00:03:45.569> so<00:03:46.569> this<00:03:46.720> was<00:03:46.840> going<00:03:46.959> to

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019
