 bids at the time according to evans having lunch 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.590
 the breakdowns a good defenses 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.850
 It's also the noodle so it's the day after 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.299
 to stay a little and that I was not 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.590
 using rondon who i am broadcasts 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:14.130
 that I was using the same as that 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:18.119
 the weak defender of ti ti himself and is 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.280
 of business when osborne played like this 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:26.070
 It may be I do not remember very well but the guy 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.950
 is the prosecutor does not pronounce themselves cheer up the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.759
 10 and oh, I'm not sure I think 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.939
 which it was only for which it exposes so it is not 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.189
 high even though ranger is 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.049
 really sensational much better than 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.850
 that the Socrates but only remains very good 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.250
 cheap option and I liked it a lot 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.610
 the noia also for sure with the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.590
 one of the best actually the best 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.590
 to welcome the second-rate German 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.380
 I did not say good people, it's not okay then 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.630
 name is better that the wing did not know there 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.280
 decided at the beginning of the game the future is 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.619
 in the middle chicken here in the bathroom 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:12.370
 there al aswad look that was the version of the 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.080
 priest showed who is this tal de paulo 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.210
 li 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.970
 when they play 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.090
 so here you will quickly there the team 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.640
 is one of the big highlights are the dogs 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.100
 bad team lewandoski howl or hobby 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.930
 the conventional ones reaching the 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.370
 I almost made a dribbling goal 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.590
 The fun is the whole team . But 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.190
 unfortunately it was on the beam and you guys are going 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.160
 realize kind very very boring leave 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.280
 they finished stamping the beam was very intense 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.500
 I just tried to make it more beautiful 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.480
 what the giant google is talking about 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.580
 choose I think it 's much more 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.940
 interesting you see our beautiful 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.670
 beautiful pass also that only a few of 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.720
 cross heads then we forget the 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.580
 fifth phase because this picture is expensive has 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.070
 exactly the ribery I really found 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.090
 questioned the guy plays a lot constitutes 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.750
 closed from d 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.580
 I loved it is also one of the great 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.770
 Team highlights here I already have and 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.170
 still use it is Diego really think 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.700
 he's sensational he's awesome part 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.610
 and you'll see I even think he made a 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.840
 goal at the end of the bids 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:31.270
 I do not know if you use it too, I say you 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.190
 confess that Diego is a guy that I do not 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.420
 I put because the scheme that uses the team 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.580
 German does not allow them to have if you 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.800
 are looking for an attacking midfielder is 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.989
 cheap and very good may not be 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.630
 imported into German when a 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.090
 Brazilian or of sensational evolution I 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.489
 I liked it very much and the people respond. 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.440
 is there a fucking have nothing to say 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.370
 same face really very very good 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.430
 and I know many of you after that 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.590
 many of you will use or use fans 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.120
 From the saga like cd me when the people 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.630
 I really think this is a big mistake. 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.690
 it's much more 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.840
 Alike because of the midfielder by 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.030
 cause of the indication indication 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.080
 offensive and defensive of elisson 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.020
 two of them 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.510
 yes, actually, it's going to come out, it can be 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.160
 used with cdm but will depend on how 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.930
 You arrange the rest of your team. 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.480
 I see a lot of people using them and 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.010
 must comfort me the great seat of the 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.810
 These things like that. 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.490
 I do not like this idea, it's getting too much. 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.030
 very offensive but if you get the 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.260
 rest of the team in a not so 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.120
 centered was a little bit more 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.130
 balanced until project as the first 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.870
 yes year in the zone is my favorite option 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.230
 in the bundesliga team and how they came 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.230
 in this team is the half van tio luiz gustavo 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:54.590
 the really sensational guy very much 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.840
 very good is steering wheel too 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.060
 Brazilian team is but everyone is staying 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.230
 really sensational is that the 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.560
 hurry up fast 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.230
 you saw that goal that resulted after 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.070
 of a fault charge and why you see 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.260
 the levels 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.000
 Then talk about lack of the team is 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.640
 really very loud and I also say the 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.340
 he who was with the highest level 90 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:21.830
 the free kick and Ribery and Robben 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.690
 and I also think I was 87 out of 85 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.270
 and 89 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:31.760
 so really, team is not lacking with 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:33.410
 collectors and the quake forcing this 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.800
 team that I do not know but very much the 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:39.440
 that speak because everyone knows how to dribble there 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:44.360
 in front the quite complete team half 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:48.920
 field is very solid and I used the diego de 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.590
 half camper even says amy but I do not know 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:54.830
 if it hurt so much because 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.620
 it is the 4 3 3 2 formation that has a steering wheel 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:01.090
 and two mid-campers and there in the middle 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:05.020
 field diego fans of the saga and 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.880
 what is the slave then was already well 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.889
 solid defensively 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.250
 the rate is just that people would like you 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:14.560
 like these team 's bids is that 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.479
 Ok folks, it's worth hitching here. 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.430
 Marrazzo consistency if you are not 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.590
 subscribed to the channel please do not 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.610
 I decided not to write about adding your 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.570
 favorite videos 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.570
 that's it, that's ok
