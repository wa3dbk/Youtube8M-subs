00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello thank you thank you for being in the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.460
 through the study recommends the day of 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.890
 today in easy kitchen for those who do not 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.070
 I'll teach you how to make a 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.019
 egg arepa with trick is not the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.849
 traditional is not the traditional technique 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.350
 but it is very very tasty this is for 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.750
 all those who are 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.480
 makes it difficult to do the arepa of 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.369
 egg in a traditional way this one knows 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.710
 very very good easy cooking for those who 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.519
 cook it look at this egg arepa in 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.199
 a jiffy and error-proof what 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.829
 what are we going to do is the following 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.420
 we're just going to take one of these 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.760
 Miren balls are balls of dough 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.340
 what have I done with bread flour I'm going to 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.960
 put them inside a bag to give 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.120
 the shape of arepa 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.010
 this base some of the charges I do not know if 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.620
 call arepa or sweet egg salt 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.269
 as you want, although what we are going 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.739
 to do is the following simply take 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:59.110
 a dish and I give it the shape of arepitas 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.970
 right look what happens there we have it 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.040
 very well this is the first of our 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.479
 Arepitas I am going to use a structure 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.390
 we connect a structure like this 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.920
 some plastic something you can have with 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.020
 such edges to suspend the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.960
 games then look what I'm going to do 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.420
 with him I'll take the repeat and I'll 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.390
 put 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.090
 but the edges like that so when 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.880
 let's say later, do not leave us and 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.950
 we look good this is basically what 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.799
 what are we doing with the second 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.299
 part that would be another ball of which 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.850
 I have made with bread flour following the 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:38.399
 instructions as they are there 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.780
 in the bag ok ok and here I have the 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.299
 second part of birds so 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.759
 just what I'm going to do is 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:49.100
 deposit an egg there right there 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.100
 is our new and a little salt 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.830
 and above we get the causes of pitas that 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.340
 we were going to cover it then we're going to close 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.870
 very carefully the edges remember 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.470
 that this is not a traditional war 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.030
 I'm just trying to 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.450
 present them a shape will be from the egg to 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.989
 all those who have written to me 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.810
 looking for a way that is a 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.540
 little easier to prepare 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.489
 because the others like the ones that you 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.000
 they saw hanging from the network has cost them 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:27.880
 a little work so we already have 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.200
 our line ready to go to the fire 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.720
 and now with the oil hot 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.880
 We are going to deposit our arepa there 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.860
 new 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.510
 and the time has come when it was already 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.880
 time to get my egg arepita is not 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.820
 the traditional one but anyone can 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.420
 do and that's the intention of this that 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.170
 I am showing you today 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.250
 [Applause] 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:01.560
 crispy golden brown and with everything a 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.560
 good repeat of eggs may need 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.009
