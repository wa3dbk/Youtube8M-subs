in<00:01:19.910> defense<00:01:20.660> form<00:01:23.050> whereas<00:01:24.050> if<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.500> was<00:01:24.619> an

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
in defense form whereas if it was an

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.600 
in defense form whereas if it was an
attack<00:01:24.979> phone

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:38.130 

it<00:01:30.610> would<00:01:30.880> be<00:01:35.910> 39<00:01:36.910> and<00:01:37.210> 24<00:01:37.720> so<00:01:37.930> it's<00:01:38.050> a

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
it would be 39 and 24 so it's a

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.950 
it would be 39 and 24 so it's a
significant<00:01:38.830> drop<00:01:39.160> whereas<00:01:40.120> and<00:01:40.510> his<00:01:40.630> attack

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
significant drop whereas and his attack

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.110 
significant drop whereas and his attack
speed<00:01:41.080> increased<00:01:41.530> significantly<00:01:42.430> as<00:01:42.640> well<00:01:42.670> of

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
speed increased significantly as well of

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.290 
speed increased significantly as well of
200<00:01:44.020> knife<00:01:44.229> was<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.500> tap<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:45.040> his<00:01:45.880> special

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
200 knife was a tap and his special

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.680 
200 knife was a tap and his special
attack<00:01:46.540> is<00:01:46.570> now<00:01:47.229> injured<00:01:47.680> in<00:01:47.770> there<00:01:48.479> d6l<00:01:49.479> so<00:01:49.660> I
