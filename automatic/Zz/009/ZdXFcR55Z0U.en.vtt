00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.610
 video at the beginning the simple simple wanted 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.880
 do three things that I'm going to do a 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.029
 product made of bottles I wanted to make 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.400
 a beach cleanup campaign and a 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.710
 art show I am irene hotmail and 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.900
 I am the founder of life of this club 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.220
 which is a social enterprise that is dedicated 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.790
 to raise awareness about pollution 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.790
 plastic 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.110
 loop in English means a circle that 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.880
 it always turns waste more than 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.230
 visualized as waste that serves 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.600
 as an input for a new product 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.600
 that's how I decided to create this company 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:25.560
 everything starts with a trip I lived in 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.970
 canada them then and I came to Lima and I 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.619
 I found that supermarkets had 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.270
 a lot of plastic bags the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.490
 plastic bags are pharmacies 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.000
 for a pack of three pills one 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.040
 ridiculous I did not work an NGO like 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.280
 associate researcher and we made a 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.490
 couple of events together me from the NGO 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.409
 for more than the contribution that we are going 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.110
 to do as an organization is currently 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.940
 minimum at least we know that something 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.220
 we are remedying then we can 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.280
 say that in the first 20 months of the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.119
 company we have already recycled we have added 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.850
 value to more than 252 thousand bottles that has 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.009
 been reused that have been processed 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.450
 to create a new product and have 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.789
 a longer life 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.759
 again we stay in this notion of 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.170
 keep giving it life 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.170
 it's the same product 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.219
 when we clean on the beach 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.560
 what we do is raise a space 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.510
 which is normally 500 meters we have 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.999
 had the opportunity to collect half 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.999
 tonne up to one tonne in the 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:37.889
 Lima beaches do not and that makes it impact 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:41.380
 a lot in the people who go so much to 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:44.260
 voluntary like people who find out 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.630
 the fact of taking a small action does not 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.240
 use containers that are 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:54.520
 disposable and makes there a waste - 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.750
 on the beach if it starts to others that 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.980
 do it the first thing you have to do 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.980
 is to do everything 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.540
 Y 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.540
 the 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.580
 yes 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.680
 initially I did not know what to expect 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.410
 I did not know how to wait to see how people 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.930
 was going to capture the message the change of 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.480
 attitude of adopting less habits 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.040
 it really is a generational process and 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.200
 I think that for us is the most 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.030
 difficult is not to lose the strength to 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.700
 keep sending the message follow 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.530
 communicate the importance of and sometimes 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.390
 nor is recycling, it's simply not 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.160
 throw garbage to the street in the 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.410
 experience that I have had in fact the 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.810
 children are the ones who absorb the most 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.910
 information that you give for adults 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.520
 it's a concept too new it's like 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.760
 because I carried a bag because I was a 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.370
 tomato or there is no space or portfolio that 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.930
 space my car every Lima walk with your 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.560
 reusable bag that would be serious 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.590
 easy way to really generate a 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.110
 great benefit 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.239
 we are a group of friends worried about 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.220
 a subject that we are taking action 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.319
 in front of them I would like people 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.950
 that he listens to us or that he knows about the 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.900
 concept that we handle feel able or 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.239
 you feel zentiva or to be a leader and 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.820
 manage them their own movement is 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.550
 a movement is a concept not to be 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.919
 aware of your plastic consumption and 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.260
 of your impact on the environment is 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.009
 something that identifies both me and 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.259
 to irene 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.939
 a way of life that we have decided to live 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.939
 and decided to proclaim also
