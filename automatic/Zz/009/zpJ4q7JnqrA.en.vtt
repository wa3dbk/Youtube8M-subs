camera but this time we thought since

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.420

give<00:00:44.890> an<00:00:45.010> idea<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.870> what<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.289> base<00:00:47.440> cards<00:00:47.829> look

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
give an idea is what the base cards look

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.920 
give an idea is what the base cards look
like<00:00:48.219> they're<00:00:48.550> Zenon<00:00:48.910> Konopka<00:00:49.180> they

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
like they're Zenon Konopka they

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.770 
like they're Zenon Konopka they
obviously<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:52.030> a<00:00:52.059> little<00:00:52.239> deeper<00:00:52.449> into

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
obviously go a little deeper into

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.830 
obviously go a little deeper into
rosters<00:00:53.379> than<00:00:53.649> certain<00:00:54.129> higher-end<00:00:54.789> sets<00:00:55.120> so

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
rosters than certain higher-end sets so

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.590 
rosters than certain higher-end sets so
you'll<00:00:55.989> see<00:00:56.230> some<00:00:56.440> stars<00:00:56.800> and<00:00:57.399> you'll<00:00:58.210> see

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
well the design very clean nice typical

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.779

from<00:01:07.810> donruss<00:01:08.320> when<00:01:09.070> they<00:01:09.190> used<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.610> make

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
from donruss when they used to make

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.870 
from donruss when they used to make
cards<00:01:10.270> back<00:01:10.539> in<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:11.440> 90s<00:01:12.100> for<00:01:12.340> hockey<00:01:12.520> and

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
cards back in the 90s for hockey and

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.910 
cards back in the 90s for hockey and
then<00:01:13.660> they<00:01:13.810> disappeared<00:01:14.320> for<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.619> little<00:01:14.740> while

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
then they disappeared for a little while

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.309 
then they disappeared for a little while
another<00:01:15.340> back<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:18.119> also<00:01:19.119> in<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:19.539> box<00:01:19.720> each<00:01:19.990> box

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:20.319 
another back so also in the box each box

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:24.330 
another back so also in the box each box
comes<00:01:21.039> with<00:01:21.220> a<00:01:21.810> checklist<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.860> that's<00:01:24.039> quite

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
comes with a checklist so that's quite

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.059 
comes with a checklist so that's quite
handy<00:01:26.399> gives<00:01:27.399> you<00:01:27.550> an<00:01:27.610> ID<00:01:27.759> of<00:01:27.910> all<00:01:28.240> the

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
handy gives you an ID of all the

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.960 
handy gives you an ID of all the
potential<00:01:30.069> poles<00:01:30.720> from<00:01:31.720> your<00:01:31.959> box<00:01:32.970> much

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
potential poles from your box much

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.820 
potential poles from your box much
easier<00:01:34.479> than<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.250> panini<00:01:36.250> website<00:01:36.789> which<00:01:37.030> the

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
easier than the panini website which the

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.740 
easier than the panini website which the
checklist<00:01:38.849> isn't<00:01:39.849> necessarily<00:01:40.539> the<00:01:40.690> easiest

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
checklist isn't necessarily the easiest

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.719 
checklist isn't necessarily the easiest
to<00:01:41.200> navigate<00:01:41.679> through<00:01:41.920> there's<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:42.220> lots<00:01:42.399> of

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
to navigate through there's a lots of

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.609 
to navigate through there's a lots of
drop-down<00:01:43.420> menu<00:01:43.869> so<00:01:44.080> it's<00:01:44.200> nice<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.530> have

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
drop-down menu so it's nice to have

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.729 
drop-down menu so it's nice to have
actual<00:01:45.099> a<00:01:45.810> nice<00:01:46.810> hard<00:01:47.110> copy<00:01:47.380> of<00:01:47.739> the<00:01:48.580> checklist

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:49.739 
actual a nice hard copy of the checklist

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:54.240 
actual a nice hard copy of the checklist
in<00:01:50.739> review<00:01:51.459> there<00:01:52.360> are<00:01:52.450> 24<00:01:52.810> packs<00:01:53.050> and<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:53.950> I

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
in review there are 24 packs and and I

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.479 
in review there are 24 packs and and I
think<00:01:54.580> 21<00:01:55.179> packs<00:01:55.690> there<00:01:56.080> was<00:01:56.229> something<00:01:57.099> more

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:57.489 
think 21 packs there was something more

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:03.869 
think 21 packs there was something more
than<00:01:57.640> base<00:01:59.039> we<00:02:00.039> I<00:02:00.789> think<00:02:01.629> we<00:02:01.750> got<00:02:01.780> about<00:02:02.550> six<00:02:03.550> or

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:03.879 
than base we I think we got about six or

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:10.949 
than base we I think we got about six or
so<00:02:04.890> decoys<00:02:07.770> one<00:02:08.770> per<00:02:09.009> box<00:02:09.280> we<00:02:09.700> believe<00:02:10.030> we<00:02:10.810> got

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
so decoys one per box we believe we got

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.949 
so decoys one per box we believe we got
a<00:02:11.200> proof<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:12.270> Semyon<00:02:13.270> Varlamov<00:02:13.860> numbered<00:02:15.540> 99<00:02:16.540> 2

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
a proof of Semyon Varlamov numbered 99 2

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.150 
a proof of Semyon Varlamov numbered 99 2
of<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.379> hundred<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:20.080> only<00:02:20.290> trouble<00:02:20.739> I<00:02:20.950> had<00:02:21.129> with

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
of a hundred the only trouble I had with

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.209 
of a hundred the only trouble I had with
this<00:02:21.430> card<00:02:21.819> was<00:02:22.359> that<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.890> might<00:02:24.099> have<00:02:24.189> just

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:24.219 
this card was that it might have just

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.090 
this card was that it might have just
been<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:24.640> card

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
been this card

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.760 
been this card
own<00:02:25.190> but<00:02:25.820> proof<00:02:26.120> was<00:02:26.390> difficult<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:26.870> see<00:02:27.140> as<00:02:27.470> it

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
own but proof was difficult to see as it

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.640 
own but proof was difficult to see as it
was<00:02:27.890> right<00:02:28.490> when<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:29.030> on<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.630> crossbar<00:02:30.170> the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
was right when the on the crossbar the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.800 
was right when the on the crossbar the
numbering<00:02:30.950> as<00:02:31.130> well<00:02:31.340> was<00:02:31.580> hard<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.480> pick<00:02:32.690> out

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
numbering as well was hard to pick out

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.100 
numbering as well was hard to pick out
as<00:02:32.990> well<00:02:33.230> buried<00:02:34.190> in<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.400> netting<00:02:34.760> but<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.990> was

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
as well buried in the netting but it was

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.260 
as well buried in the netting but it was
nice<00:02:36.290> nice<00:02:37.160> area<00:02:37.490> down<00:02:37.640> at<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.820> bottom<00:02:38.000> that

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
nice nice area down at the bottom that

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.800 
nice nice area down at the bottom that
