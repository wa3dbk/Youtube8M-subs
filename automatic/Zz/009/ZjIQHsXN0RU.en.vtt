 it's good because we're going to revisit 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.090
 one of the lightest dishes cooking 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.130
 French because for once cdg 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.210
 elsewhere gingham carrots then 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.560
 the origin and who enriched was 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.720
 really cooked carrots with a 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.699
 very little gingham water a nut 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.410
 butter and a little bit of salt to 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.230
 the army we will steam them you see 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.730
 it's very simple we cut 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.660
 carrots in thin strips 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.520
 a little ambitious like that here we are 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.120
 the slate of course comes our dish 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.190
 steam you're going to put a little 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.190
 pinch of light light sugar 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.730
 this is just to bring a 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.110
 best to break eggs sometimes 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.850
 bring them an even bigger side 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.160
 greedy fortunately a small cellar 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.780
 lemon zest 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.780
 it's an adaptation of the kills and when 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.519
 they arnal t stock cube and we shall 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.850
 rap and you'll see on it so 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.360
 just not that it's going these areas is 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:21.710
 and is located or poultry 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:23.189
 broth do not see need to heat 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.750
 melt it 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.790
 go you go to the oven me I'm a guarantor 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.829
 louvre the fort if there is a small 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.630
 pipette that will fit inside 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.740
 and make sure the steam chain and 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.270
 the practical aspect with this background is 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.650
 that we have a dual reality allows you 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.090
 to steam down and 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.920
 a more classic vision to tiff it's 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.880
 funny to go it's fifteen minutes and 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:47.869
 so we say carrots are cooked 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:51.060
 go and there you lift the lid 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.140
 beautiful steam help you understand that this 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.759
 dish is perhaps not the best 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.680
 vegetable world dish but by cons 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.210
 at master level this man is a dish 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.210
