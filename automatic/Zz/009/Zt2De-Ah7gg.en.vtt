there<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.620> what<00:03:15.860> I<00:03:15.920> think<00:03:16.100> happens<00:03:16.760> because

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
there so what I think happens because

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.130 
there so what I think happens because
this<00:03:17.150> has<00:03:17.270> happened<00:03:17.600> every<00:03:17.840> time<00:03:17.870> I've

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
this has happened every time I've

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.050 
this has happened every time I've
attempted<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.590> do<00:03:18.740> it<00:03:18.860> is<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.700> when<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:19.940> go

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
attempted to do it is that when you go

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.540 
attempted to do it is that when you go
to<00:03:20.120> stab<00:03:20.450> someone<00:03:20.750> will<00:03:20.959> use<00:03:21.050> the<00:03:21.200> mele<00:03:21.650> mele

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
to stab someone will use the mele mele

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.590 
to stab someone will use the mele mele
not<00:03:23.030> merely<00:03:23.330> the<00:03:23.690> melee<00:03:24.820> went<00:03:25.820> when<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.270> enemy

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
not merely the melee went when the enemy

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.720 
not merely the melee went when the enemy
is<00:03:26.630> facing<00:03:27.140> you<00:03:27.230> they<00:03:27.380> reverse<00:03:27.770> it<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.130> kill

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.570 
you I get it I get that melee and stuff
like<00:03:33.590> that<00:03:33.650> when<00:03:34.010> you're<00:03:34.040> when<00:03:34.490> you're

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
like that when you're when you're

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.800 
like that when you're when you're
actually<00:03:34.730> trying<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.120> fight<00:03:35.360> each<00:03:35.480> other<00:03:35.600> as

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
actually trying to fight each other as

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.449 
actually trying to fight each other as
annoying<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.500> cheap<00:03:36.770> and<00:03:36.980> stuff<00:03:37.220> like<00:03:37.400> that

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
annoying and cheap and stuff like that

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.150 
annoying and cheap and stuff like that
but<00:03:38.090> my<00:03:38.240> issue<00:03:38.390> is<00:03:38.600> it's<00:03:39.290> appropriate<00:03:39.470> when

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
but my issue is it's appropriate when

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.980 
but my issue is it's appropriate when
the<00:03:40.400> enemy<00:03:40.790> expects<00:03:41.360> you<00:03:41.480> to<00:03:41.600> do<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:41.840> when

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
the enemy expects you to do it when

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.690 
the enemy expects you to do it when
they're<00:03:42.020> reloading<00:03:42.530> or<00:03:42.890> they<00:03:43.100> can't<00:03:43.340> see<00:03:43.580> you

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
they're reloading or they can't see you

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.490 
they're reloading or they can't see you
very<00:03:43.940> well<00:03:44.150> or<00:03:44.420> stuff<00:03:44.750> like<00:03:44.900> that<00:03:44.959> then<00:03:45.320> you're

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
very well or stuff like that then you're

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.800 
very well or stuff like that then you're
reloading<00:03:45.860> why<00:03:46.640> can't<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:47.060> stab<00:03:47.330> them<00:03:47.510> from<00:03:47.720> the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
reloading why can't I stab them from the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.080 
reloading why can't I stab them from the
front<00:03:48.080> this<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.290> ridiculous<00:03:49.160> it's<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:49.640> stupid

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
front this is ridiculous it's a stupid

front this is ridiculous it's a stupid
gimmick<00:03:50.720> that<00:03:51.020> sucks<00:03:51.500> and<00:03:51.800> is<00:03:51.920> annoying<00:03:52.310> and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
gimmick that sucks and is annoying and

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.350 
gimmick that sucks and is annoying and
makes<00:03:52.880> no<00:03:53.150> sense<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:53.810> not<00:03:54.320> code<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.709> very<00:03:54.890> well

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
makes no sense and not code it very well

makes no sense and not code it very well
why<00:03:56.360> does<00:03:56.570> this<00:03:56.660> happen<00:03:56.840> every<00:03:57.050> time<00:03:57.350> I<00:03:57.680> try

why does this happen every time I try

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.690 
why does this happen every time I try

smaller maps and in the buildings and

in and one way to get out and it just

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.879 
in and one way to get out and it just
feels<00:05:17.110> lazy<00:05:17.380> and<00:05:17.770> it's<00:05:18.100> it's<00:05:18.669> pointless<00:05:19.889> that

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
feels lazy and it's it's pointless that

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.680 
feels lazy and it's it's pointless that
you<00:05:21.130> know<00:05:21.700> there's<00:05:21.880> not<00:05:22.060> different<00:05:22.419> routes

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
you know there's not different routes

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.969 
you know there's not different routes
and<00:05:22.870> stuff<00:05:22.990> that<00:05:23.229> you<00:05:23.290> can<00:05:23.410> take<00:05:23.530> to<00:05:23.590> get<00:05:23.770> any

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
and stuff that you can take to get any

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.320 
and stuff that you can take to get any
other<00:05:24.130> buildings<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:24.669> it<00:05:24.729> traps<00:05:24.970> you<00:05:25.150> and

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
other buildings and it traps you and

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.730 
other buildings and it traps you and
stuff<00:05:25.510> like<00:05:25.660> that<00:05:25.720> and<00:05:25.930> it's<00:05:26.139> just<00:05:26.260> ridiculous

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
stuff like that and it's just ridiculous

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.260 
stuff like that and it's just ridiculous
i<00:05:26.800> think<00:05:26.950> it's<00:05:27.070> just<00:05:27.130> bad<00:05:27.520> map<00:05:27.760> design<00:05:27.970> on

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
i think it's just bad map design on

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.900 
i think it's just bad map design on
their<00:05:28.389> part<00:05:28.630> but<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:29.740> streets<00:05:30.010> are<00:05:30.130> cool<00:05:30.340> this

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
their part but the streets are cool this

their part but the streets are cool this

think i'll be picking it up on the

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.969 
think i'll be picking it up on the
current<00:05:43.330> generation<00:05:43.419> of<00:05:43.810> consoles<00:05:44.110> i'd<00:05:44.320> wait

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
current generation of consoles i'd wait

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.310 
current generation of consoles i'd wait
and<00:05:45.160> see<00:05:45.460> how<00:05:45.729> it<00:05:45.880> is<00:05:46.120> on<00:05:46.150> next-gen<00:05:47.020> because

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
and see how it is on next-gen because

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.659 
and see how it is on next-gen because
I'm<00:05:47.470> still<00:05:47.680> convinced<00:05:47.860> dice<00:05:48.280> well<00:05:48.520> it<00:05:48.580> will

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669
