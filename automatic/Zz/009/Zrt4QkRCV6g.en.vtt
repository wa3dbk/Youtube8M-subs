core set this may seem like a sneaky
trick<00:00:18.710> to<00:00:18.920> get<00:00:19.039> you<00:00:19.130> to<00:00:19.220> shell<00:00:19.400> out<00:00:19.550> more<00:00:19.700> money

for<00:00:20.180> something<00:00:20.420> you<00:00:20.630> already<00:00:20.780> have<00:00:21.140> but<00:00:22.010> it's

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
for something you already have but it's

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.220 
for something you already have but it's
well<00:00:22.340> worth<00:00:22.369> picking<00:00:23.119> this<00:00:23.420> expansion<00:00:23.810> up<00:00:24.050> for

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
well worth picking this expansion up for

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.859 
well worth picking this expansion up for
two<00:00:24.349> reasons<00:00:24.740> first<00:00:25.090> the<00:00:26.090> x-wing<00:00:26.480> is<00:00:26.509> widely

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
two reasons first the x-wing is widely

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.660 
two reasons first the x-wing is widely
considered<00:00:27.140> to<00:00:27.470> be<00:00:27.619> one<00:00:27.890> of<00:00:28.039> the<00:00:28.130> best<00:00:28.310> ships

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
considered to be one of the best ships

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.579 
considered to be one of the best ships
in<00:00:28.789> the<00:00:28.880> game<00:00:29.060> and<00:00:29.330> second<00:00:30.170> you<00:00:30.289> get<00:00:30.410> some

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
in the game and second you get some

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.679 
in the game and second you get some
really<00:00:30.740> good<00:00:30.949> new<00:00:31.160> cards<00:00:31.640> to<00:00:31.849> use<00:00:32.090> with<00:00:32.540> your

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
really good new cards to use with your

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.350 
really good new cards to use with your
squadron<00:00:33.020> builds<00:00:33.640> we<00:00:34.640> looked<00:00:34.820> at<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:35.000> x-wings

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
x-wings have solid movement options

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.000 
x-wings have solid movement options
although<00:00:41.390> they're<00:00:41.690> not<00:00:41.719> as<00:00:41.960> agile<00:00:42.200> or<00:00:42.680> speedy

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.430 
although they're not as agile or speedy

as the Imperial TIE fighters they've got

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.049 
as the Imperial TIE fighters they've got
a<00:00:45.469> good<00:00:45.680> selection<00:00:45.860> of<00:00:46.219> turning<00:00:46.579> and<00:00:46.730> banking

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
a good selection of turning and banking

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.729 
a good selection of turning and banking
movements<00:00:47.570> as<00:00:47.690> well<00:00:47.719> as<00:00:47.989> a<00:00:48.020> K<00:00:48.260> turn<00:00:48.500> at<00:00:48.710> a

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
movements as well as a K turn at a

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.619 
movements as well as a K turn at a
distance<00:00:49.129> of<00:00:49.250> four<00:00:49.520> which<00:00:50.120> is<00:00:50.149> their<00:00:50.449> only

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
distance of four which is their only

distance of four which is their only
read<00:00:51.020> maneuver<00:00:52.090> although<00:00:53.090> where<00:00:53.180> x-wing

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
read maneuver although where x-wing

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.810 
read maneuver although where x-wing
pilots<00:00:54.050> included<00:00:54.500> in<00:00:54.590> this<00:00:54.739> expansion<00:00:55.070> have

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
pilots included in this expansion have

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.029 
pilots included in this expansion have
the<00:00:55.940> same<00:00:56.120> base<00:00:56.359> stats<00:00:56.660> which<00:00:57.469> in<00:00:57.620> turn<00:00:57.800> are

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
the same base stats which in turn are

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:59.770 
the same base stats which in turn are
the<00:00:58.219> same<00:00:58.460> as<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.850> pilots<00:00:59.210> in<00:00:59.300> the<00:00:59.329> core<00:00:59.570> set

the same as the pilots in the core set
this<00:01:00.350> is<00:01:00.440> a<00:01:00.469> big<00:01:00.710> reason<00:01:00.920> why<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:01.280> x-wing<00:01:01.940> is<00:01:02.090> a

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
this is a big reason why the x-wing is a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.630 
this is a big reason why the x-wing is a
