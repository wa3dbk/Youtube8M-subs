my<00:01:41.520> god<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.420> thought<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.990> was<00:01:43.110> part<00:01:43.350> of

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
my god that I thought that was part of

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.660 
my god that I thought that was part of
the<00:01:43.500> background<00:01:43.740> because<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the background because it's like the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.670 
the background because it's like the
same<00:01:44.850> thing<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.360> was<00:01:45.659> freaking<00:01:45.990> weird<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.470> just

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
blew my mind you blew my mind in an odd

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.410 
blew my mind you blew my mind in an odd
direction<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> right<00:01:50.490> because<00:01:50.939> that's

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
direction to the right because that's

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.730 
direction to the right because that's
the<00:01:51.600> only<00:01:51.720> way<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.170> go<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.530> level
