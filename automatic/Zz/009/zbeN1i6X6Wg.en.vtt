00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
okay you're binding ledge cut right

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.210 
okay you're binding ledge cut right
there<00:00:53.089> problem<00:00:53.989> is<00:00:54.640> finding<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:55.879> we<00:00:56.059> have<00:00:57.220> is

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
there problem is finding that we have is

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.380 
there problem is finding that we have is
great<00:00:58.550> oh<00:01:00.879> it's<00:01:01.879> great<00:01:02.210> for<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:02.900> lower<00:01:03.619> side

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
great oh it's great for the lower side

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.230 
great oh it's great for the lower side
but<00:01:05.390> for<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:05.869> raised<00:01:06.080> center<00:01:06.770> section<00:01:07.460> it's<00:01:08.180> a

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
but for the raised center section it's a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.530 
but for the raised center section it's a
little<00:01:08.510> short<00:01:08.869> you<00:01:10.119> can<00:01:11.119> see<00:01:11.270> it's<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.450> little

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
little short you can see it's a little

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.250 
little short you can see it's a little
short<00:01:11.869> there<00:01:15.820> so<00:01:16.820> what<00:01:17.360> I've<00:01:17.600> decided<00:01:17.720> to<00:01:18.049> do

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
short there so what I've decided to do

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.160 
short there so what I've decided to do
is<00:01:18.530> get<00:01:19.310> some<00:01:19.520> very<00:01:19.700> thin<00:01:20.260> black<00:01:21.260> binding<00:01:21.860> and

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
is get some very thin black binding and

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.940 
is get some very thin black binding and
mate<00:01:24.170> that<00:01:24.619> with<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.759> Roy<00:01:26.750> binding<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:27.470> it'll

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
mate that with the Roy binding and it'll

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.429 
mate that with the Roy binding and it'll
give<00:01:28.070> it<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.250> nice<00:01:28.369> look<00:01:28.810> just<00:01:29.810> kind<00:01:30.020> of<00:01:30.110> you

give it a nice look just kind of you
know<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:30.740> little<00:01:31.040> different<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:32.560> going<00:01:33.560> ahead

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
know a little different so going ahead

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.490 
know a little different so going ahead
and<00:01:33.950> laminating<00:01:34.520> that<00:01:34.730> together<00:01:35.000> with<00:01:35.930> this

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
and laminating that together with this

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.260 
and laminating that together with this
jig<00:01:36.770> that<00:01:37.010> I'm<00:01:37.160> about<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.460> show<00:01:37.610> this<00:01:38.030> little

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
jig that I'm about to show this little

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.399 
jig that I'm about to show this little
jig<00:01:38.570> here<00:01:40.420> will<00:01:41.420> hold<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.810> binding<00:01:42.230> together

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
jig here will hold the binding together

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.750 
jig here will hold the binding together
you<00:01:42.980> can<00:01:43.130> see<00:01:43.400> here's<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.480> laminations<00:01:45.140> there

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
you can see here's the laminations there

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.580 
you can see here's the laminations there
and<00:01:49.360> all<00:01:50.360> you<00:01:50.510> do<00:01:50.659> is<00:01:50.870> you<00:01:51.050> go<00:01:51.170> ahead<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:51.530> you

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
and all you do is you go ahead and you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.620 
and all you do is you go ahead and you
put<00:01:51.920> your<00:01:52.040> you<00:01:52.520> put<00:01:52.700> your<00:01:52.790> binding<00:01:53.180> in<00:01:53.300> the<00:01:53.390> jig

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
put your you put your binding in the jig

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.020 
put your you put your binding in the jig
and<00:01:53.870> you<00:01:53.990> brush<00:01:54.230> on<00:01:54.440> some<00:01:54.470> acetone<00:01:55.430> or<00:01:55.729> Mac

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
and you brush on some acetone or Mac

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.360 
and you brush on some acetone or Mac
which<00:01:56.330> is<00:01:56.479> methyl<00:01:56.810> ethyl<00:01:56.960> ketone<00:01:57.290> and<00:01:58.010> that's

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
which is methyl ethyl ketone and that's

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.100 
which is methyl ethyl ketone and that's
fun<00:01:58.790> to<00:01:58.940> say<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.150> that's<00:01:59.450> what<00:01:59.600> I<00:01:59.690> like<00:01:59.720> to<00:01:59.870> use

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
fun to say so that's what I like to use

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.600 
fun to say so that's what I like to use
and<00:02:00.290> then<00:02:00.710> now<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:00.950> go<00:02:01.130> ahead<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.430> run<00:02:01.490> it

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
and then now you go ahead and run it

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.969 
and then now you go ahead and run it
through<00:02:01.640> a<00:02:01.790> jig<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:02.270> we'll<00:02:03.170> go<00:02:03.260> ahead<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.500> do<00:02:03.950> a

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
through a jig so we'll go ahead and do a

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:24.790 
through a jig so we'll go ahead and do a
little<00:02:04.159> bit<00:02:04.310> of<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:04.490> right<00:02:04.700> now

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.100 

so<00:02:25.790> that's<00:02:25.910> basically<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.360> gist<00:02:26.630> of<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.900> you

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
so that's basically the gist of it you

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.110 
so that's basically the gist of it you
keep<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.860> binding<00:02:28.220> nice<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.610> flat<00:02:28.820> in<00:02:29.030> the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
keep the binding nice and flat in the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.550 
keep the binding nice and flat in the
bottom<00:02:29.270> of<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.600> jig<00:02:29.810> as<00:02:29.990> you're<00:02:30.140> pulling<00:02:30.470> it

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
bottom of the jig as you're pulling it

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.430 
bottom of the jig as you're pulling it
through<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.550> acetone<00:02:32.060> or<00:02:32.300> your<00:02:32.540> Mac<00:02:32.780> will

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
through and the acetone or your Mac will

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.370 
through and the acetone or your Mac will
go<00:02:33.590> ahead<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.220> soften<00:02:35.120> up<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.690> two<00:02:35.840> bindings

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
go ahead and soften up the two bindings

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.130 
go ahead and soften up the two bindings
that<00:02:36.590> are<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.740> be<00:02:36.860> joined<00:02:37.100> together<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:38.140> works

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
that are to be joined together and works

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.050 
that are to be joined together and works
pretty<00:02:39.350> quickly<00:02:39.650> forms<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.250> pretty<00:02:40.640> quick<00:02:40.820> bond

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
pretty quickly forms a pretty quick bond

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.160 
pretty quickly forms a pretty quick bond
and<00:02:41.270> then<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.450> just<00:02:41.600> got<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.780> let<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:41.930> sit<00:02:42.140> here

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
and then you just got to let it sit here

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.640 
and then you just got to let it sit here
for<00:02:42.470> let<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.160> sit<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:43.730> cure<00:02:44.300> for<00:02:44.690> about<00:02:44.960> six

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
for let it sit and cure for about six

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.000 
for let it sit and cure for about six
hours

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
hours

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.480 
hours
so<00:02:46.580> that's<00:02:47.240> pretty<00:02:47.360> much<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.690> for<00:02:47.840> now<00:02:47.960> and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
so that's pretty much that for now and

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.730 
so that's pretty much that for now and
more<00:02:49.490> later
