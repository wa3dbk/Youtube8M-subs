previous<00:03:02.579> said<00:03:02.819> ok<00:03:04.879> so<00:03:05.879> I<00:03:06.359> like<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.019> say<00:03:07.760> not

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
previous said ok so I like to say not

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.640 
previous said ok so I like to say not
training<00:03:09.209> failure<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.689> working<00:03:10.139> smart<00:03:10.439> not

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
training failure is working smart not

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.490 
training failure is working smart not
hard<00:03:10.680> ok<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.489> personally<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.510> trained<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.170> about

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
hard ok I personally I trained to about

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.550 
hard ok I personally I trained to about
a<00:03:13.530> nine<00:03:13.920> nine<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.609> a<00:03:14.639> half<00:03:14.669> RP<00:03:15.359> scale<00:03:15.720> meaning

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
a nine nine and a half RP scale meaning

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.309 
a nine nine and a half RP scale meaning
i<00:03:16.889> have<00:03:17.280> one<00:03:17.879> left<00:03:18.209> one<00:03:18.569> rep<00:03:18.840> left<00:03:19.230> in<00:03:19.409> the<00:03:19.590> tank

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
i have one left one rep left in the tank

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.929 
i have one left one rep left in the tank
ok<00:03:22.319> one<00:03:23.310> half<00:03:23.970> half<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.659> rep<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.870> 11<00:03:25.859> rep<00:03:26.639> in<00:03:26.909> the

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939 
ok one half half a rep to 11 rep in the

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.740 
ok one half half a rep to 11 rep in the
tank<00:03:27.239> ok<00:03:28.019> so<00:03:28.079> you're<00:03:28.290> saving<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.970> ok<00:03:29.970> that

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
tank ok so you're saving it ok that

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.309 
tank ok so you're saving it ok that
means<00:03:30.959> let's<00:03:31.799> say<00:03:31.889> you're<00:03:32.040> doing<00:03:32.280> benchpress

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
means let's say you're doing benchpress

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.539 
means let's say you're doing benchpress
225<00:03:34.319> two<00:03:34.739> plates<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.659> you're<00:03:36.659> going<00:03:36.959> for<00:03:37.549> you

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
225 two plates and you're going for you

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.000 
225 two plates and you're going for you
know<00:03:38.669> ten<00:03:39.030> reps<00:03:39.560> you're<00:03:40.560> going<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.769> find<00:03:40.919> that

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
know ten reps you're going to find that

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.740 
know ten reps you're going to find that
weight<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.400> matches<00:03:41.729> that<00:03:41.760> best<00:03:42.180> on<00:03:42.419> an<00:03:42.599> RP

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
weight that matches that best on an RP

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.250 
weight that matches that best on an RP
scale<00:03:43.139> of<00:03:43.229> nine<00:03:43.470> or<00:03:44.099> nine<00:03:44.760> nine<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.239> half<00:03:45.269> ok

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
scale of nine or nine nine and a half ok

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.939 
scale of nine or nine nine and a half ok
so<00:03:46.829> you're<00:03:47.159> going<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:48.900> know<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.079> got<00:03:49.349> one

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
so you're going and you know you got one

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.229 
so you're going and you know you got one
left<00:03:50.220> in<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.459> tank<00:03:50.699> that's<00:03:50.909> when<00:03:51.120> you're

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
left in the tank that's when you're

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.640 
left in the tank that's when you're
going<00:03:51.329> to<00:03:51.419> stop<00:03:51.690> that's<00:03:52.139> your<00:03:52.650> set<00:03:53.449> ok<00:03:54.650> so

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
going to stop that's your set ok so

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.729 
going to stop that's your set ok so
that's<00:03:57.349> avoiding<00:03:58.349> failure<00:03:59.449> ok<00:04:00.449> I<00:04:00.659> used<00:04:01.620> to

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
that's avoiding failure ok I used to

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.589 
that's avoiding failure ok I used to
think<00:04:01.949> that<00:04:02.069> training<00:04:02.549> a<00:04:02.639> failure<00:04:03.090> was<00:04:03.359> the

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
think that training a failure was the

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.210 
think that training a failure was the
best<00:04:03.870> you're<00:04:04.169> you're<00:04:04.349> killing<00:04:04.829> it<00:04:04.919> you<00:04:04.979> know

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
best you're you're killing it you know

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.640 
best you're you're killing it you know
you're<00:04:05.430> you're<00:04:05.609> you're<00:04:06.229> you're<00:04:07.229> just

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
you're you're you're you're just

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.649 
you're you're you're you're just
destroying<00:04:08.310> your<00:04:08.879> muscles<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:09.359> that's<00:04:09.540> how

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
destroying your muscles and that's how

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.240 
destroying your muscles and that's how
you're<00:04:09.840> going<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:10.049> grow<00:04:10.319> that's<00:04:11.010> how<00:04:11.099> you're

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
you're going to grow that's how you're

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.539 
you're going to grow that's how you're
going<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.430> progress<00:04:11.989> ok<00:04:13.519> progression<00:04:14.519> comes

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
going to progress ok progression comes

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.680 
going to progress ok progression comes
from<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.739> believe<00:04:17.090> that<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.209> principal

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
from I believe that the principal

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.860 
from I believe that the principal
progressive<00:04:19.229> overload<00:04:19.349> meaning<00:04:20.870> you're

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
progressive overload meaning you're

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.279 
progressive overload meaning you're
making<00:04:22.320> progress<00:04:23.750> by<00:04:24.750> adding<00:04:25.110> more

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
making progress by adding more

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.529 
making progress by adding more
resistance<00:04:26.039> more<00:04:26.280> weight<00:04:26.580> ok<00:04:27.270> that's<00:04:27.449> how

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
resistance more weight ok that's how

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:28.610 
resistance more weight ok that's how
your<00:04:27.690> muscles<00:04:27.780> grow<00:04:28.169> that's<00:04:28.409> how<00:04:28.500> your

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
your muscles grow that's how your

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.600 
your muscles grow that's how your
muscles<00:04:30.229> progress<00:04:31.229> you're<00:04:32.159> adding<00:04:32.460> more

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
muscles progress you're adding more

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.170 
muscles progress you're adding more
weight<00:04:33.240> each<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.470> know<00:04:34.560> you<00:04:34.620> come<00:04:35.190> in<00:04:35.370> you<00:04:36.060> do

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
weight each you know you come in you do

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.420 
weight each you know you come in you do
a<00:04:36.210> certain<00:04:36.449> weight<00:04:36.750> and

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.150 

you<00:04:41.390> do<00:04:41.510> a<00:04:41.540> certain<00:04:41.750> amount<00:04:41.840> of<00:04:42.020> reps<00:04:42.230> the<00:04:42.830> next

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
you do a certain amount of reps the next

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.910 
you do a certain amount of reps the next
week<00:04:43.370> you're<00:04:43.610> going<00:04:43.730> to<00:04:43.820> try<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.530> improve<00:04:45.530> by

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
week you're going to try to improve by

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.160 
week you're going to try to improve by
doing<00:04:46.700> the<00:04:46.760> same<00:04:46.880> amount<00:04:47.000> of<00:04:47.180> reps<00:04:47.360> but<00:04:47.600> more

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
doing the same amount of reps but more

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.370 
doing the same amount of reps but more
weight<00:04:48.490> that's<00:04:49.490> pretty<00:04:50.030> much<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.540> principle

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
weight that's pretty much the principle

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.720 
weight that's pretty much the principle
of<00:04:51.410> progressive<00:04:52.070> overload<00:04:52.300> okay<00:04:53.890> if<00:04:54.890> you're

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
of progressive overload okay if you're

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.360 
of progressive overload okay if you're
training<00:04:55.940> to<00:04:56.120> failure<00:04:56.630> each<00:04:57.380> set<00:04:57.800> every<00:04:58.160> day

training to failure each set every day
you're<00:04:58.760> not<00:04:58.910> going<00:04:59.090> to<00:04:59.150> be<00:04:59.240> able<00:04:59.270> to<00:04:59.450> improve

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
you're not going to be able to improve

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.350 
you're not going to be able to improve
on<00:05:00.170> your<00:05:00.230> weight<00:05:00.680> that<00:05:01.340> next<00:05:01.760> set<00:05:01.940> you're<00:05:02.150> just

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
on your weight that next set you're just

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.390 
on your weight that next set you're just
going<00:05:02.480> to<00:05:02.540> be<00:05:02.630> more<00:05:02.840> you<00:05:03.620> know<00:05:03.650> more<00:05:03.770> fatigue

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
going to be more you know more fatigue

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.950 
going to be more you know more fatigue
and<00:05:04.640> you're<00:05:05.120> going<00:05:05.240> to<00:05:05.300> have<00:05:05.390> to<00:05:05.510> drop<00:05:05.780> the

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
and you're going to have to drop the

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.710 
and you're going to have to drop the
weight<00:05:08.290> okay<00:05:09.290> so<00:05:10.220> look<00:05:10.760> at<00:05:10.880> it<00:05:10.970> this<00:05:11.030> way<00:05:11.210> you

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
weight okay so look at it this way you

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.480 
weight okay so look at it this way you
got<00:05:12.100> two<00:05:13.100> guys<00:05:13.280> same<00:05:13.850> weight<00:05:14.120> same<00:05:14.360> strength

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
got two guys same weight same strength

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.530 
got two guys same weight same strength
they're<00:05:16.490> going<00:05:16.610> to<00:05:16.670> do<00:05:16.760> the<00:05:16.880> same<00:05:16.910> workout

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
they're going to do the same workout

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.510 
they're going to do the same workout
okay<00:05:18.020> one<00:05:18.380> guy<00:05:18.560> trains<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:18.980> failure<00:05:19.280> every

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
okay one guy trains the failure every

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.510 
okay one guy trains the failure every
set<00:05:20.320> one<00:05:21.320> guy<00:05:21.530> stops<00:05:22.280> at<00:05:22.550> a<00:05:22.610> RP<00:05:23.360> scalp<00:05:23.690> nine

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
set one guy stops at a RP scalp nine
