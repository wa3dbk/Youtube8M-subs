so let's go ahead right now and check it

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.700 
so let's go ahead right now and check it
out<00:00:17.570> well<00:00:18.570> here's<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.869> car<00:00:19.080> itself<00:00:19.439> in

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
out well here's the car itself in

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.460 
out well here's the car itself in
question<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.369> we've<00:00:20.730> got<00:00:21.050> an<00:00:22.050> array<00:00:22.439> of

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
question and we've got an array of

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.140 
question and we've got an array of
lighting<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.310> particular<00:00:23.640> vehicle<00:00:23.939> we

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
lighting on this particular vehicle we

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.269 
lighting on this particular vehicle we
haven't<00:00:24.539> gone<00:00:24.630> over<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.050> top<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.769> objective

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
haven't gone over the top the objective

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.179 
haven't gone over the top the objective
being<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.420> make<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.810> efficient<00:00:28.349> as<00:00:28.769> far<00:00:28.830> as

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
being is to make it efficient as far as

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.370 
being is to make it efficient as far as
the<00:00:29.310> lighting<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.170> let's

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the lighting that we have on it so let's

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.319 
the lighting that we have on it so let's
go<00:00:31.529> ahead<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.800> first<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.309> all<00:00:32.460> turn<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.059> some

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
go ahead and first of all turn on some

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.430 
go ahead and first of all turn on some
of<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> lighting<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:33.960> if<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.200> go<00:00:34.320> ahead

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
of the lighting so if we can go ahead

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.319 
of the lighting so if we can go ahead
and<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:35.309> some<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> lighting<00:00:35.820> turned<00:00:36.149> on

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
and have some of the lighting turned on

actually<00:01:19.890> going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.670> be<00:01:20.850> with<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.390> ion<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.650> as

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
actually going to be with the ion so as

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.859 
actually going to be with the ion so as
you<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.159> see<00:01:23.369> here<00:01:23.790> I'm<00:01:24.330> holding<00:01:24.689> two

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
you can see here I'm holding two

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.960 
you can see here I'm holding two
products<00:01:25.259> together<00:01:25.549> essentially<00:01:26.549> there<00:01:26.820> is

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
products together essentially there is

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.850 
products together essentially there is
difference<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.810> difference<00:01:28.170> being<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.680> is

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
difference the difference being this is

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.100 
difference the difference being this is
the<00:01:28.890> new<00:01:29.100> model<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> old<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.840> it

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the new model this is the old one and it

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.330 
the new model this is the old one and it
just<00:01:31.140> happened<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.680> where<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> vehicle

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
just happened to be where the vehicle

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.240 
just happened to be where the vehicle

looking<00:02:34.860> at<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:34.980> camera<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.400> guess<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.790> then

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
looking at the camera I guess and then

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.930 
looking at the camera I guess and then
of<00:02:36.480> course<00:02:36.540> we've<00:02:36.810> got<00:02:36.990> an<00:02:37.110> amber<00:02:37.560> ta<00:02:38.550> function

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
of course we've got an amber ta function

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.440 
of course we've got an amber ta function
built<00:02:39.360> into<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:40.280> total<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.370> six<00:02:41.640> diodes<00:02:42.150> are

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
built into this total of six diodes are

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.690 
built into this total of six diodes are
actually<00:02:42.900> mounted<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:43.530> each<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.280> modules

actually mounted in each of the modules
that<00:02:44.850> are<00:02:45.060> in<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.300> back<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:45.870> inner<00:02:46.470> edge

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
that are in the back of this inner edge

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.990 
that are in the back of this inner edge
on<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.370> rear<00:02:47.550> deck<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:48.000> vehicle<00:02:49.850> now<00:02:50.850> one

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
on the rear deck of this vehicle now one

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.190 
on the rear deck of this vehicle now one
other<00:02:51.120> feature<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.570> we've<00:02:51.720> done<00:02:51.870> with<00:02:52.080> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
other feature that we've done with the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.810 
other feature that we've done with the
brake<00:02:52.380> lights<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:52.830> we've<00:02:52.980> actually<00:02:53.160> put<00:02:53.640> a

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
brake lights is we've actually put a

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.310 
brake lights is we've actually put a
pair<00:02:54.270> of<00:02:54.300> white<00:02:55.430> vertexes<00:02:56.490> in<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:57.540> back<00:02:57.720> up

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
pair of white vertexes in the back up

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.260 
pair of white vertexes in the back up
light<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:58.920> when<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.220> put<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.700> vehicle<00:02:59.730> into

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
light so when you put the vehicle into

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.780 
light so when you put the vehicle into
reverse<00:03:00.590> they'll<00:03:01.590> actually<00:03:01.800> come<00:03:02.160> on<00:03:02.220> steady

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
reverse they'll actually come on steady

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.990 
reverse they'll actually come on steady
burn<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.810> give<00:03:03.990> additional<00:03:04.350> visibility<00:03:05.250> to

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
burn to give additional visibility to
