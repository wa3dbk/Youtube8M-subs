00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.379
 hey very good attitude to wanted that 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.029
 commenting and I bring you a nuclear with 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:07.289
 a new dragon camouflage with the is 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.760
 karachi you are seeing that it is a part and 

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:11.070
 start at the one we 're losing so 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.150
 touches come back to take a nuclear and 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.530
 Well, as always, I tell you what 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.720
 better way to show you a camouflage 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.920
 that with a nuclear in this example 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.090
 well it's pretty short I'll talk 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.710
 also of something else that has been 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.690
 happened related to the dual with the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.770
 slow that we have pending out there and 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.360
 good as you are seeing is a job 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.710
 that we will start fully butt 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.110
 I go directly to your restaurant 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.100
 massacre them as we like so much to 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.470
 you as me to take measures 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.000
 nuclear then here when they kill me and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.640
 the nuclear streak begins if I do not 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.770
 I mistake a streak of 38 that you are going to see 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.090
 that quite frenetic there is a play 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.200
 which I think is the best moves that 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.079
 I have done in my life which also 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.059
 more luck I have because you'll see 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.100
 super hurry pm av come to me for all 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.530
 sides I can make a knife I do not know 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.780
 if you get out of these as it's called furious 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.309
 some of that I do not know if 6 or 7 the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.230
 truth is that a one overrun of play 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.790
 pretty lucky by the way as I have 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.530
 said and good as you are seeing 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.539
 camouflage buys me the two is worth me 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.460
 you asked for nuclear yesterday came out the 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.840
 camouflage yesterday afternoon on xbox are 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.250
 always 600 too and well I bought myself 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.030
 thanks to the two points that gave me 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.940
 you are right 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.140
 Personal code box and good as always 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.369
 I tell you what is the discretion to 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.950
 pass or yes you need any 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.690
 code any points or whatever and 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.580
 good a pretty nice camouflage that 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.500
 it's the darkness you are not seeing that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.119
 it has like dragon blood running 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.830
 between the scales that the truth that is 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.210
 a pretty nice effect and then like 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.909
 You are particularly looking at the faces 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.130
 that has a piece of gun that looks 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.540
 like as bright not that blood that you 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.520
 it said it looks like a weapon of the day software not 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.110
 of the typical camouflages that shine 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.670
 a lot but with those roads that are 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.930
 very cool also buys me as he said 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.420
 the cyborg although he speaks in addition to the other 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.619
 of him in another gameplay and that is to say is that 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.880
 that cyborg camouflage is a bit 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.530
 songs or to play green because it is 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.390
 it illuminated the darkness so good and 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.710
 we'll talk a little about the subject 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.780
 here you have then that you have asked me and 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.369
 I have been making up 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.340
 how many games with this camouflage 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.050
 testing weapons and such and it has cost me 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.789
 a few games in exchange for nuclear 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.890
 better a few gusts to 20 something 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.560
 also one of them has been very funny 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.060
 because the train of this has killed me 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.319
 then it is when almost without volume and 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.490
 I accidentally run over it so good 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.250
 I also frei that a streak 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.410
 of 21 or something like that but good here at last 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.640
 I have the nuclear as I said and I'm going to 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.840
 I am going to take advantage of speaking to you 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.030
 little bit of the idea that I know 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.459
 hey is talking this morning with a 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.680
 snow club mate with a 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.360
 mickey roster mate and good 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.010
 I came up with the idea of starting a 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.510
 series that would be doing duals with people 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.160
 of competitive this I will also speak 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.650
 of tomorrow's employment of competitive vale 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.879
 because I think that maybe it will have more 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.920
 welcome for people who see me playing 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.349
 competitive but this is the play that 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.849
 I used to tell you what the luck was 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.290
 I have either here I'm going to throw 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.200
 why do I say too much in fact 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.310
 I'm leaving here I hide a little bit and 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.110
 ends with is the only one who was 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.030
 dissipating to the bottom but good as os 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.769
 I said I plan to make a series not 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.819
 I know how much how much it will be but for 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.200
 example the catching people from 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.130
 competitive and do a dual with them 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.420
 to help them with their morale of 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.190
 competitive and here for you 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.170
 You also know more channels of 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.549
 competitive is because obviously I 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.650
 I am a competitive player but not 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.090
 I am the most top that there is worth my intention 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.209
 it is for example with the show with 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.860
 mickey if you want some methods some 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.690
 player for example stiller or if he has or 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.340
 continue with the YouTube channel I do not know 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.260
 help all those with plays of 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.780
 competitive they also upload videos to 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.069
 youtube so you can also see 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.489
 gameplays on their channels since 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.840
 I really think that they do not have 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.590
 much better content with four 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.239
 competitive 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.530
 you go through the channels also for 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.769
 that you also know as I tell you others 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.310
 players and how they play and all that 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.450
 so as I say I do not know every control 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.800
 of the series I have to contract with 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.260
 people at the moment because they are willing to 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.879
 do it or mickey I'm alejandro like 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.200
 He wants to call and in that when 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.819
 we will also enter to speak with me 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.500
 touch with some more out there that you want 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.060
 well, grow a little on youtube 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.430
 also with its competitive games 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.049
 and good in terms of competitive 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.140
 tell you that yesterday we had a very problem 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.940
 big with him with the rival club what 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.380
 you have the intuition description of which 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.910
 I wrote and I do not feel like telling now 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.040
 everything I will tell more tomorrow in the 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.410
 competitive gameplay but a problem 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.220
 pretty fat a lot of lack of 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.680
 sportsmanship 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.420
 meanwhile putting a connection of 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.459
 two one or two or three bars of giving 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.549
 you have constantly but good you have 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.110
 everything about that thing or not is what 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.060
 what happened in the description if crisis 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.739
 to know it is an article a 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.239
 quite long twitlonger but that I 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.430
 I took my time to write it and I think that 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.560
 everything is well explained and 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.239
 from respect always not like those of the 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.949
 club into a rival that started to 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.950
 insult and all those things all the 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.080
 We're going to do the usual things 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.610
 and without more I'm not going to eat the jar there 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.100
 many more opportunities to get to 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.200
 the final cap really better than this 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.000
 kind of people go to the next round 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.620
 not because we do not pass ourselves but 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.720
 because these people do not deserve to go with 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.460
 traps and with sizes because it does not deserve 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.990
 pity they continue because they really do not 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.240
 they will get to nothing but good if they 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.400
 They want to get this far, because I'm going to 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.780
 away or if they make a top 3 the final here 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.340
 Well, those balls 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.870
 obviously this sarcasm not because 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.600
 with that connection shit they carry 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.730
 posting because then as they explain to 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.310
 toulon gere put in the video game 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.930
 decent for then because we were going to 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.880
 claim him if he really was going to 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.200
 missing the connection so well do not I 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.610
 roll more with the subject if you want to know 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.650
 more about this then you have it in the 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.150
 description as I tell you in a few 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.490
 days I'm from a nuclear with the 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.750
 cyborg camouflage I do not know with what weapon 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.160
 surely with your possible to carry 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.420
 going a little bit because how good is this 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.950
 has been exploited with a rifle gun 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.510
 assault and the truth that I have to say 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.130
 that this camouflage shines very well 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.140
 with the m8 it is a camouflage that remains 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.090
 super good with that of 94 also remains 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.070
 pretty nice with submachine guns maybe 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.870
 no but the rifles and they are very very 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.220
 beautiful with this camouflage the rifles 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.620
 I like more to wear them with camouflage 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.820
 this one as it is called cyborg so 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.130
 as I say, you worry because 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.920
 of a camouflage involved in that camouflage 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.360
 new and baixa also fixed that I have 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.410
 left the death chamber trying 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.510
 get also the death chamber 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.430
 so you can see the title below as it is 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.780
 a title in motion is to say an eye 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.310
 of a dragon with fire the truth yes that 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.690
 He was super cool and more with the emblem that 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.090
 I have the emblem of nuclear 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.520
 so without more kids they liked it 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.890
 this gameplay then leave as always 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.880
 like favorites and subscribe for more 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.880
 goodbye
