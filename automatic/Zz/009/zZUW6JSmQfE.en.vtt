from<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.259> ground<00:01:22.470> up<00:01:22.680> because<00:01:23.369> clearly

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
from the ground up because clearly

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.880 
from the ground up because clearly
ocelots<00:01:24.509> been<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.900> oh<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.140> don't<00:01:25.439> know<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> few

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
ocelots been and oh I don't know a few

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.569 
ocelots been and oh I don't know a few
games<00:01:27.290> but<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.409> was<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.799> was<00:01:28.920> great<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.490> able

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
games but it was it was great to be able

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.710 
games but it was it was great to be able
to<00:01:29.700> again<00:01:30.150> bring<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.570> back<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:32.720> scale

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
to again bring it back and and scale

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.990 
to again bring it back and and scale
everything<00:01:34.020> down<00:01:34.200> because<00:01:34.770> he's<00:01:34.950> not<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
everything down because he's not the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.789 
everything down because he's not the
same<00:01:36.210> Ocelot<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.900> we've<00:01:36.990> seen<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.590> other

so<00:01:38.810> understanding<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.520> simplicity<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:42.509> can

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
so understanding the simplicity that can

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.050 
so understanding the simplicity that can
still<00:01:43.259> come<00:01:43.470> across<00:01:43.590> as<00:01:43.979> complex<00:01:44.369> oh<00:01:44.670> no<00:01:44.939> I'm

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
still come across as complex oh no I'm

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.219 
still come across as complex oh no I'm
really<00:01:45.090> getting<00:01:45.479> into<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:45.780> now<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.170> just

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
really getting into it but now it's just

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.649 
really getting into it but now it's just
two<00:01:46.409> totally<00:01:46.680> different<00:01:46.710> experiences<00:01:47.340> and

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
two totally different experiences and
