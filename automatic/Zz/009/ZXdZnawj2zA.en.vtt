00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
Bears which are very much very kind of

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.939 
Bears which are very much very kind of
site<00:01:03.090> terrain<00:01:03.450> which<00:01:04.049> all<00:01:04.259> three<00:01:04.470> teams<00:01:04.739> other

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
site terrain which all three teams other

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.270 
site terrain which all three teams other
teams<00:01:05.250> are<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.579> there<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:05.729> now<00:01:07.159> with<00:01:08.159> all

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.630 
teams are in there right now with all
that<00:01:08.430> being<00:01:08.640> said<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:09.210> think<00:01:10.079> if<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:11.340> manage

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
that being said I think if the manage

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.760 
that being said I think if the manage
somewhat<00:01:11.970> they<00:01:12.150> can<00:01:12.299> blanket<00:01:12.900> up<00:01:13.049> Larry

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
somewhat they can blanket up Larry

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.539 
somewhat they can blanket up Larry
Fitzgerald

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
Fitzgerald

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.550 
Fitzgerald
I<00:01:14.580> don't<00:01:15.360> think<00:01:15.420> Arizona's<00:01:16.049> running<00:01:16.260> game<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
I don't think Arizona's running game to

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.350 
I don't think Arizona's running game to
get<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.799> done<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.370> that<00:01:17.400> against<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.000> defense

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
get it done on that against that defense

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.940 
get it done on that against that defense
I<00:01:18.510> think<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.990> soggy<00:01:19.290> sandwich<00:01:19.500> sent<00:01:19.799> him<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
I think if a soggy sandwich sent him a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.700 
I think if a soggy sandwich sent him a
bacon<00:01:20.280> keep<00:01:21.110> Larry<00:01:22.110> Fitzgerald<00:01:22.380> from

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
bacon keep Larry Fitzgerald from

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.320 
bacon keep Larry Fitzgerald from
having<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.100> big<00:01:23.220> day<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.610> think<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.970> Eagles<00:01:24.060> can

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
having a big day I think the Eagles can

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.800 
having a big day I think the Eagles can
win<00:01:24.450> together

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
win together

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.539 
win together
blitzing<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.650> they'll<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.130> way<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.520> way

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
blitzing that they'll be the way the way

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.070 
blitzing that they'll be the way the way
you<00:01:26.700> keep<00:01:26.970> Fitzgerald<00:01:27.450> from<00:01:27.510> having<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.900> big

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
you keep Fitzgerald from having a big

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.760 
you keep Fitzgerald from having a big
day<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:29.150> that's<00:01:30.150> that's<00:01:30.420> no<00:01:31.049> quarterback<00:01:31.590> in

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.420 
year this year now I think if they if
they<00:02:03.119> Eagles<00:02:03.900> can<00:02:04.049> manufacture<00:02:04.229> drives<00:02:04.799> thank

they Eagles can manufacture drives thank

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.940 
they Eagles can manufacture drives thank
time-consuming<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.540> know<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.320> we're<00:02:07.799> done

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
time-consuming you know and we're done

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.949 
time-consuming you know and we're done
their<00:02:08.159> defense<00:02:08.579> you<00:02:08.879> know<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> West<00:02:09.720> Coast

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
their defense you know like a West Coast

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.149 
their defense you know like a West Coast
offense<00:02:10.289> where<00:02:10.500> they're<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:10.769> doing<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.039> quick

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.159 
offense where they're just doing a quick

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.800 
offense where they're just doing a quick
outs<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.579> Westbrook<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.239> tight<00:02:12.510> ends

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
outs to Westbrook to the tight ends

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.170 
outs to Westbrook to the tight ends
short<00:02:13.530> passes<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.129> they<00:02:14.189> come<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.610> darlings

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
short passes and they come in darlings

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.640 
short passes and they come in darlings
being<00:02:15.450> mobile<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:15.930> they<00:02:16.290> can

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
being mobile and they can

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.140 
being mobile and they can
down<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.920> field<00:02:17.129> and<00:02:17.400> give<00:02:17.579> that<00:02:17.730> defensive

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
down the field and give that defensive

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.729 
down the field and give that defensive
fit<00:02:18.329> then<00:02:18.689> I<00:02:18.780> think<00:02:18.989> they<00:02:19.079> can<00:02:19.260> probably<00:02:19.530> name

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
fit then I think they can probably name

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.860 
fit then I think they can probably name
if<00:02:20.010> they<00:02:20.280> fall<00:02:20.579> behind<00:02:20.610> with<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> Cardinals

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
if they fall behind with the Cardinals

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.869 
if they fall behind with the Cardinals
and<00:02:22.079> something<00:02:22.950> they<00:02:23.040> start<00:02:23.310> going<00:02:23.430> vertical

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
and something they start going vertical

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.309 
and something they start going vertical
on<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.060> Eagles<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.510> for<00:02:24.780> some<00:02:24.959> reason<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
on the Eagles and for some reason the

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.679 
on the Eagles and for some reason the
Eagles<00:02:25.590> let<00:02:25.829> the<00:02:26.280> receivers<00:02:27.180> get<00:02:27.329> behind<00:02:27.450> them

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
Eagles let the receivers get behind them

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.000 
Eagles let the receivers get behind them
they<00:02:27.840> give<00:02:27.989> up<00:02:28.079> a<00:02:28.170> lot<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.319> points<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.680> think<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
they give up a lot of points I think the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.770 
they give up a lot of points I think the
Eagles<00:02:29.129> gonna<00:02:29.400> be<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.209> could<00:02:30.599> be<00:02:30.750> a

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
Eagles gonna be that could be a

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.300 
Eagles gonna be that could be a
problem<00:02:31.140> because<00:02:31.349> I<00:02:31.620> mean<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.980> car<00:02:32.159> the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
problem because I mean the car the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.190 
problem because I mean the car the
Cardinals<00:02:32.670> will<00:02:32.790> built<00:02:33.000> built<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.629> play<00:02:33.810> ahead

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
Cardinals will built built to play ahead

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.030 
Cardinals will built built to play ahead
just<00:02:34.409> like<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.650> cold
