yes<00:00:28.100> I've<00:00:28.250> got<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:28.580> two<00:00:28.730> frames<00:00:29.060> made<00:00:29.420> I<00:00:29.450> use

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
yes I've got the two frames made I use

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.350 
yes I've got the two frames made I use
three<00:00:30.110> inch<00:00:30.290> Prime<00:00:30.710> Guard<00:00:31.010> screws<00:00:31.490> in<00:00:32.090> the

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
three inch Prime Guard screws in the

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.330 
three inch Prime Guard screws in the
corners<00:00:33.400> we've<00:00:34.400> got<00:00:34.580> our<00:00:34.670> width<00:00:34.940> is<00:00:35.890> 25<00:00:36.890> and

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
corners we've got our width is 25 and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.290 
corners we've got our width is 25 and
3/4<00:00:38.470> actually<00:00:39.470> 25<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.070> 5/8<00:00:40.520> so<00:00:40.760> maybe<00:00:40.940> 1/8

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
3/4 actually 25 and 5/8 so maybe 1/8

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.049 
3/4 actually 25 and 5/8 so maybe 1/8
heavy<00:00:41.629> but<00:00:42.379> it'll<00:00:42.590> work<00:00:42.800> for<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.670> skylight

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
heavy but it'll work for the skylight

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.360 
heavy but it'll work for the skylight
that<00:00:44.090> we're<00:00:44.330> doing<00:00:44.660> we've<00:00:45.290> got<00:00:45.470> the<00:00:45.590> 49<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:46.309> a

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
that we're doing we've got the 49 and a

00:00:46.370 --> 00:02:28.120 
that we're doing we've got the 49 and a
half<00:00:46.550> in<00:00:46.760> this<00:00:46.910> direction<00:00:47.590> exactly

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.190 

jingles<00:02:29.130> up<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.690> bottom<00:02:30.870> row<00:02:31.170> is

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
jingles up so that the bottom row is

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.960 
jingles up so that the bottom row is
exposed<00:02:31.739> underneath<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.430> going<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.820> be<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
exposed underneath is going to be the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.420 
exposed underneath is going to be the
flashing<00:02:33.480> we've<00:02:33.989> installed<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:35.070> ice<00:02:35.220> and

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
flashing we've installed the ice and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.430 
flashing we've installed the ice and
water<00:02:35.580> shield<00:02:35.730> up<00:02:36.239> around<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.630> bottom<00:02:36.780> and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
water shield up around the bottom and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.860 
water shield up around the bottom and
now<00:02:37.590> we<00:02:37.650> have<00:02:37.920> our<00:02:38.070> aluminum<00:02:38.360> bottom<00:02:39.360> pan<00:02:39.570> for

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
now we have our aluminum bottom pan for

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.160 
now we have our aluminum bottom pan for
the<00:02:39.959> for<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.500> flashing

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.200

flashing this pan actually extends to
about<00:03:48.790> right<00:03:49.030> here<00:03:49.269> we've<00:03:49.540> cut<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:49.810> so<00:03:50.080> that

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
about right here we've cut it so that

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
we've also extended an eye here so that

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.110 
we've also extended an eye here so that
we<00:04:04.840> can<00:04:04.959> rock<00:04:05.140> wrap<00:04:05.799> this<00:04:05.980> top<00:04:06.220> edge<00:04:06.489> up<00:04:06.879> over

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
we can rock wrap this top edge up over

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.809 
we can rock wrap this top edge up over
the<00:04:07.209> back<00:04:07.360> of<00:04:07.420> the

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.819 

all<00:04:16.660> right<00:04:16.810> well<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.019> skylights<00:04:17.470> are<00:04:17.620> done

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
all right well the skylights are done

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.300 
all right well the skylights are done
the<00:04:18.160> custom<00:04:18.609> herbs<00:04:19.479> are<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.959> exact<00:04:20.320> lining

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
the custom herbs are the exact lining

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.140 
the custom herbs are the exact lining
it<00:04:23.210> came<00:04:23.389> out<00:04:23.570> nice<00:04:23.810> because<00:04:24.260> every<00:04:24.500> problems

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
it came out nice because every problems

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.890 
it came out nice because every problems
nice<00:04:26.150> and<00:04:26.389> clean<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:28.510> think<00:04:29.510> it's<00:04:29.660> a<00:04:29.750> good

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
nice and clean I think it's a good
