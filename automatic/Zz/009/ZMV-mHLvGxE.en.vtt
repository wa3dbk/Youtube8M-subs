00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.989
 Y 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.520
 hello that such friends as they are 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.309
 Welcome to this new video tutorial 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.379
 more from photoshop cs 6 my name is iván 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.960
 graphic and it's a pleasure to be here with you 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.690
 again to bring you this effect 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.570
 photographic that I have called sunlight 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.730
 since we will be applying an enhancement of 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.370
 light to our images to our 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.290
 photographs that have been taken in a day 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.780
 gray on a cloudy day on a dark day 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.820
 and what we want is to give a boost 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.129
 light to our images that are seen with 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.829
 more luminosity and look much more 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.460
 happy as in this case here I am going to 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.769
 put the before and this is the after 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.010
 our original image if we look at the 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:51.289
 before we noticed a dark image with 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.659
 a cloudy day that does not indicate joy 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.059
 but on the contrary denotes sadness and 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.699
 time to apply our light effect 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.100
 solar we observe how it has higher 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.589
 luminosity and denotes much more joy 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.110
 in our good image well to be able 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.300
 create this effect we will be 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.310
 using what are layers of filler 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.680
 and we will be using what they are 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.270
 five steps nothing more and then to 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.390
 below I'll explain how 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.090
 create this photographic effect titled 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.700
 good sunlight I'm going to erase here 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.250
 our effect our group where they are 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.160
 all the layers of our effect for 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.080
 so start from scratch the first thing that 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.900
 you have to obviously do is open a 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.820
 image and establish who in your 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.500
 workspace will be the 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.650
 image to which you are going to apply this 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.590
 effect the first thing we will do is go to 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.190
 the icons below fill layers and 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.050
 we will apply curves the processes we will do 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.880
 here at the corner of the tip of this 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.229
 first box 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:58.659
 and we will put the following values ​​here 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.659
 in entrance we will put 48 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.880
 and in exit we will put 62 so we leave it 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.110
 be here we are going to go here 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.569
 to this corner of this second box and 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.170
 what we will do is in entrance we are going to 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.710
 put 105 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.650
 105 and on exit 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.650
 let's put 150 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.379
 150 very well 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.959
 and now we are going to position ourselves here in 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.439
 the following is tip of the following 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.430
 box and we're going to put the following 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:46.120
 proportions 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:50.489
 in entrance we are going to put 191 and in exit 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.489
 let's put 235 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.560
 once we did this simply 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.030
 here we close 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.510
 Now the next thing we want 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.640
 let's go to the icons below and we'll put 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.430
 we will select exposure with the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.849
 down layers of fill exposure here 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.240
 we will default to and on exposure 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:16.100
 we will put the following 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:19.530
 - 0.44 we would put here 0.44 in 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:24.060
 displacement we will put 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.970
 here we will put 0 point 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.120
 12 11 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:35.430
 in gamma 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:39.549
 we will put 0.75 0 point 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.319
 75 we close and the next thing we'll do 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.650
 we go again and I met down 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:48.620
 fill layers we select levels 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:54.790
 and we are going to put here in the first 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.790
 box let's put 68 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:04.940
 in the 2 here in the second I'll put in the 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:09.470
 half we will put 1.74 1.74 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:12.050
 and in the third we're going to put 255 so 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.690
 we will leave closed and the next thing that 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.580
 we will do is we go again icons 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.010
 of low layers of filler and 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.250
 we will select color balance to 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:27.410
 who environment we will put halftones and 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:31.250
 in xian and red we will put more 31 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:38.080
 here we have 61 here in green magenta 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:38.080
 we will put minus 14 we will put here less 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:50.190
 14 well here we're going to put minus 14 in 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:53.190
 yellow blue let's put minus 27 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.190
 27 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.090
 there it is and we are closing we are going to go 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.180
 again and I met under layers of 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:10.750
 fill and we will select intensity in 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:15.810
 intensity we will put 47 plus 47 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.810
 and in saturation we will put more 21 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:27.799
 and good friends then with all these 

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:30.349
 steps we have finished our effect of 

00:05:27.799 --> 00:05:33.469
 sunlight as you will observe as we did 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:35.509
 practically the result of the start 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:37.399
 from the tutorial to the presentation and it is 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:39.189
 a very simple effect and you do not 

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:40.999
 it took more than a few minutes 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:43.009
 we were practically based on 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:45.709
 filling layers in intensity of 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:48.229
 exposure levels curves of 

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:50.029
 intensity and so on and so we achieved 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.829
 doing a few minutes is an effect that 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:54.050
 It can be used for your photographs to 

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:55.999
 that you give a different aspect to your 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.739
 images that as I told you the start 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:06:00.409
 have on a gray day on a cloudy day 

00:05:57.739 --> 00:06:03.949
 etc and so you give it a much more appearance 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.809
 I live to your photographs, good friends, 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:09.050
