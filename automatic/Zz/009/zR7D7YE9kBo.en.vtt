00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.050 
it be told even though I really like the
minifigure<00:05:42.379> the<00:05:43.159> whole<00:05:43.339> reasoning<00:05:43.729> for

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
minifigure the whole reasoning for

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.610 
minifigure the whole reasoning for
getting<00:05:44.360> this<00:05:44.479> was<00:05:44.750> more<00:05:44.990> so<00:05:45.169> for<00:05:45.289> the<00:05:45.409> movie

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
getting this was more so for the movie

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.490 
getting this was more so for the movie
so<00:05:45.649> this<00:05:46.189> is<00:05:46.430> just<00:05:46.550> a<00:05:46.669> nice<00:05:46.819> little<00:05:46.849> add-on<00:05:47.500> his

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
so this is just a nice little add-on his

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.719 
so this is just a nice little add-on his
articulation<00:05:48.830> would<00:05:49.219> be<00:05:49.279> the<00:05:49.370> same<00:05:49.550> as

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
articulation would be the same as

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.389 
articulation would be the same as
