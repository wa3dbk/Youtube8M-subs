00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.550
 I use a clear film company 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.710
 lomond 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:46.700
 A4 format a3 printer films 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.460
 exxon a3 format 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:55.160
 embedded pigment ink 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.160
 black, that's how they look 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:09.140
 Iâ€™ll show you a closer look 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.140
 look buy 200 milligrams 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.010
 I fill with all black shadows 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.990
 let's set up print output and 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:23.130
 print out our shared raster 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.869
 images on 4 films using film 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.760
 special for inkjet printing 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.540
 printers 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.700
 the company also sells film for printing on 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.650
 laser printers 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.040
 so when buying pay for it 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.270
 attention one surface a little 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.600
 rough second side 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.460
 absolutely smooth we need to insert in 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.610
 printer so that printing is done 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.920
 exactly on the rough on this rough 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.280
 surface look at each film 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.630
 one corner is the bottom left corner cut off 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.530
 semicircle when you insert the film in 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.760
 printer tray 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:09.269
 you have this edge should always 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.190
 be left below so as not to 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.200
 to confuse 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.250
 on which surface the seals are inserted into 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.580
 Printer 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:26.730
 how do we add here under a3 format then 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:29.210
 have four days for the reservation all include 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.210
 Printer 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:38.370
 so now let's set up prints that 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:44.329
 he gave us a good density 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:49.920
 print for this go to file print 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:52.859
 choose printer epson t1100 not 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.989
 open properties go to tab 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.870
 the main thing 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:03.419
 exhibiting 1 and the best photos 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:08.329
 necessarily for the best photo of this type 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:12.030
 a4 matte paper 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:15.449
 go further advanced settings 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.969
 photo put the best photos 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:20.299
 although it is immediately on the first page when 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:24.120
 expose it is duplicated here 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:26.969
 Now color weight management such 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.689
 tab color correction go to 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:30.530
 construction site 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:34.879
 sliders as you can see everything is completely 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:38.519
 translate to the right position on + 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:42.590
 click ok more and more no settings 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:45.919
 don't do can save you 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.959
 pursuing the output already had settings 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:53.419
 click on save we call the file there 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.419
 for example film output 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.080
 and save 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.370
 all next time you type 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.610
 open the badges and here is your film output 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:15.740
 set up nothing else 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:24.310
 choose the first page print range 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:24.310
 skip this design right from 2 to 5 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:34.390
 then go choose the size of the paper on 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:41.560
 this setting is no longer needed 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:45.100
 press the ok print on film 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.100
 went print 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.750
 so the first film printed let's 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.320
 let's look at the print density 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:10.070
 on the lumen of the monitor and see two black 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.290
 places nothing shines through it 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.080
 says that screen printed 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:20.170
 the form will turn out quality easily 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:25.570
 manifested so now let's see 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.570
 see black color perfect 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:33.290
 is highlighted if you have 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:36.860
 shine through the black places you have 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:39.470
 will produce a flare in the future of these 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:44.770
 places and it will be very difficult to wash 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:47.290
 stencil now I did tests here 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:53.480
 drawing density now show you 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:56.570
 how should i look at this 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.570
 armor can be seen so it should not be because 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.330
 what is it showing through well here is the density 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:12.610
 good ones here in this tight series 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:16.760
 we expose at a conclusion of films well so everything 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:21.880
 printed out a green image on 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:25.700
 film now we need one design 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:28.220
 print on white paper choose 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:32.390
 design where most items but 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.930
 for example covering color and what is it for 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.460
 need to 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.460
 you will learn in the following lessons
