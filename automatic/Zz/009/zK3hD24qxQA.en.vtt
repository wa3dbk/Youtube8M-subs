up<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.180> go<00:02:12.300> down<00:02:12.420> slow<00:02:12.810> down<00:02:13.140> slow<00:02:14.989> fashion

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
up so you go down slow down slow fashion

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.059 
up so you go down slow down slow fashion
if<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.230> do<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.470> perhaps<00:02:16.590> you're<00:02:16.800> not<00:02:16.830> doing

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
if you do it perhaps you're not doing

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.320 
if you do it perhaps you're not doing
your<00:02:17.220> setting<00:02:17.459> gravity<00:02:17.760> cool<00:02:17.940> down<00:02:18.150> if<00:02:18.270> you

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
your setting gravity cool down if you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.250 
your setting gravity cool down if you
will<00:02:18.420> slow<00:02:18.630> your<00:02:18.720> apps<00:02:18.870> are<00:02:18.989> working<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
will slow your apps are working the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.530 
will slow your apps are working the
muscle<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:20.489> that's<00:02:20.520> how<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.790> get<00:02:21.209> on<00:02:21.270> for<00:02:21.450> your

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
muscle so that's how you get on for your

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.809 
muscle so that's how you get on for your
bison<00:02:21.630> spare<00:02:22.190> that's<00:02:23.190> actually<00:02:23.310> advanced

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
bison spare that's actually advanced

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.390 
bison spare that's actually advanced
technique<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.530> said<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.890> can<00:02:26.069> use<00:02:26.100> if<00:02:26.310> you

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
technique so I said you can use if you

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.490 
technique so I said you can use if you
use<00:02:26.580> 30<00:02:26.850> pounds<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.300> work<00:02:27.780> your<00:02:27.900> biceps<00:02:27.989> nice

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
use 30 pounds to work your biceps nice

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.130 
use 30 pounds to work your biceps nice
40<00:02:28.830> 45<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:29.489> you<00:02:29.519> can't<00:02:29.610> really<00:02:29.850> do<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:31.050> you

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
40 45 so you can't really do it so you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.059 
40 45 so you can't really do it so you
can't<00:02:31.319> you<00:02:31.380> don't<00:02:31.470> want<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.709> go<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:31.860> pull<00:02:31.980> it

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
can't you don't want to go to pull it

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.710 
can't you don't want to go to pull it
back<00:02:32.190> up<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.610> want<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.850> use<00:02:32.970> help<00:02:33.239> report<00:02:33.630> back

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
back up you want to use help report back

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.410 
back up you want to use help report back
up<00:02:33.930> which<00:02:34.560> one<00:02:34.739> fall<00:02:34.950> slowly<00:02:35.250> eight<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.239> ten

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
up which one fall slowly eight to ten

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.670 
up which one fall slowly eight to ten
seconds<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.900> it's<00:02:36.989> falling<00:02:39.500> another<00:02:40.500> one

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
seconds and it's falling another one

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.589 
seconds and it's falling another one
that's<00:02:40.830> really<00:02:40.920> good<00:02:42.260> this<00:02:43.260> thing

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.420 

that's<00:02:47.599> really<00:02:47.750> good

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
that's really good

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.449 
that's really good

biceps you start off like this down so
let's<00:04:04.720> placing<00:04:04.959> this<00:04:05.020> way<00:04:05.200> you<00:04:05.800> bring<00:04:05.980> it<00:04:06.130> up

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
let's placing this way you bring it up

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.220 
let's placing this way you bring it up
and<00:04:06.450> you<00:04:07.450> turn<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.770> bring<00:04:08.920> it<00:04:08.980> up<00:04:09.190> go<00:04:10.000> down

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
and you turn it you bring it up go down

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:19.340 
and you turn it you bring it up go down
turn<00:04:11.230> it<00:04:11.320> back<00:04:11.910> up<00:04:12.910> turn<00:04:13.690> boom<00:04:15.840> just<00:04:16.840> like<00:04:16.930> that

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.220 

that<00:04:20.350> really<00:04:20.890> really<00:04:21.430> works<00:04:22.110> right<00:04:23.110> in

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
that really really works right in

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.260 
that really really works right in
between<00:04:23.350> here<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:24.610> your<00:04:24.640> bicep<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.090> course

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
between here and your bicep of course
