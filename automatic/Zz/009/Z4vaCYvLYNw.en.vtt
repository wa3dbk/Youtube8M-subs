00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.180 

right<00:00:08.910> now<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.929> plane<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.290> heaviest<00:00:10.860> for

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
right now the plane is the heaviest for

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.820 
right now the plane is the heaviest for
this<00:00:11.309> ever<00:00:11.550> bit<00:00:12.259> because<00:00:13.259> we<00:00:13.559> have<00:00:13.679> it

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
this ever bit because we have it

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.260 
this ever bit because we have it
something<00:00:14.070> cool<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:16.880> is<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:18.750> remote<00:00:19.320> operated

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
something cool that is a remote operated

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.660 
something cool that is a remote operated
bombe<00:00:21.270> we<00:00:22.080> have<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.560> single<00:00:22.920> servo<00:00:23.369> there

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
bombe we have the single servo there

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.359 
bombe we have the single servo there
which<00:00:23.939> goes<00:00:24.150> down<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:25.019> which<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.949> control

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
which goes down to that which is control

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.880 
which goes down to that which is control
horn<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.150> bottom<00:00:27.420> door<00:00:27.779> which<00:00:28.439> will<00:00:28.619> allow

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
horn on the bottom door which will allow

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.849 
horn on the bottom door which will allow
the<00:00:28.949> door<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.369> be<00:00:29.760> opened<00:00:30.269> from<00:00:30.720> mid<00:00:31.080> air<00:00:31.349> you

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the door to be opened from mid air you

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.610 
the door to be opened from mid air you
see<00:00:31.890> here<00:00:32.279> we<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.969> locking<00:00:33.899> servos<00:00:34.380> that

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
see here we have the locking servos that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.170 
see here we have the locking servos that
have<00:00:34.739> little<00:00:35.040> bars<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.430> go<00:00:35.460> across<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.090> they

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
have little bars that go across and they

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.630 
have little bars that go across and they
hold<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.450> door<00:00:36.600> shut<00:00:37.100> when<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.190> flip<00:00:38.460> the

that'll knocks the door lock they open
it<00:00:47.690> once<00:00:48.690> they're<00:00:48.899> open<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.320> flip<00:00:49.500> this

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
it once they're open you flip this

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.910 
it once they're open you flip this
switch<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.629> you<00:00:51.629> open<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> whole<00:00:52.140> Bay<00:00:52.410> which

this<00:02:46.530> plane<00:02:46.769> does<00:02:47.129> not<00:02:47.310> like<00:02:47.720> left-hand<00:02:48.720> turns

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.270 

okay<00:03:01.209> so<00:03:01.270> on<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.660> test<00:03:01.959> flight<00:03:02.380> landing<00:03:03.160> we

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
okay so on the test flight landing we

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.150 
okay so on the test flight landing we
had<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.490> bit<00:03:03.700> of<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.910> issue<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:05.650> landing<00:03:06.010> was<00:03:06.100> a

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
had a bit of a issue the landing was a

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.730 
had a bit of a issue the landing was a
little<00:03:06.490> hard<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:06.970> we<00:03:07.300> used<00:03:08.140> more<00:03:08.410> shock<00:03:08.709> than

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
little hard and we used more shock than

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.610 
little hard and we used more shock than
the<00:03:09.490> allotted<00:03:09.760> ground<00:03:10.150> clearance<00:03:10.390> that<00:03:11.290> broke

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
the allotted ground clearance that broke

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
the allotted ground clearance that broke
the<00:03:11.800> little<00:03:12.040> arm<00:03:12.340> in<00:03:12.819> this<00:03:13.090> servo<00:03:13.870> horn<00:03:14.580> so<00:03:15.580> we

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
the little arm in this servo horn so we

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.360 
the little arm in this servo horn so we
no<00:03:15.760> longer<00:03:15.819> had<00:03:16.180> door<00:03:16.510> control<00:03:17.370> paperclip

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
no longer had door control paperclip

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.390 
no longer had door control paperclip
replaced<00:03:18.819> the<00:03:19.030> pin<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:20.260> all<00:03:20.410> works<00:03:20.680> good<00:03:20.950> the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
replaced the pin it all works good the

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.280 
replaced the pin it all works good the
guy<00:03:21.520> has<00:03:21.730> been<00:03:21.880> loaded<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.600> we're<00:03:23.140> going<00:03:23.260> to

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
guy has been loaded and we're going to

jettison the guy it's quite windy so had
to<00:06:50.900> jettison

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
to jettison

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.090 
to jettison
our<00:06:52.790> GI<00:06:53.150> Joe<00:06:53.450> in<00:06:53.780> mid-flight<00:06:54.200> before<00:06:54.680> we<00:06:54.980> were

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.100 
our GI Joe in mid-flight before we were

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.330 
our GI Joe in mid-flight before we were
actually<00:06:55.370> at<00:06:55.460> the<00:06:55.580> altitude<00:06:55.940> we<00:06:56.030> needed<00:06:56.300> and

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
actually at the altitude we needed and

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.910 
actually at the altitude we needed and
unfortunately<00:06:58.340> the<00:06:58.640> reason<00:06:58.790> jettison<00:06:59.360> in<00:06:59.450> him

00:06:59.910 --> 00:06:59.920 
unfortunately the reason jettison in him

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.780 
unfortunately the reason jettison in him
because<00:07:00.920> it<00:07:01.010> was<00:07:01.100> too<00:07:01.220> windy<00:07:01.340> and<00:07:01.580> the<00:07:01.640> plane

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:01.790 
because it was too windy and the plane

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.150 
because it was too windy and the plane
couldn't<00:07:02.030> maintain<00:07:02.620> forward<00:07:03.620> motion<00:07:04.010> it<00:07:04.100> was

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 
couldn't maintain forward motion it was

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.650 
couldn't maintain forward motion it was
basically<00:07:04.460> flying<00:07:04.670> like<00:07:04.880> this<00:07:05.120> which<00:07:05.390> you<00:07:05.510> saw

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 
basically flying like this which you saw

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.250 
basically flying like this which you saw
in<00:07:05.690> the<00:07:05.780> video

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.260 
in the video

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.100 
in the video
my<00:07:07.250> executive<00:07:07.700> decision<00:07:08.330> to<00:07:08.360> jettison<00:07:09.020> the

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110 
my executive decision to jettison the

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.770 
my executive decision to jettison the
payload<00:07:09.530> to<00:07:09.830> allow<00:07:10.010> the<00:07:10.070> plane<00:07:10.310> to<00:07:10.460> fly<00:07:10.780> toss

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:11.780 
payload to allow the plane to fly toss

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.760 
payload to allow the plane to fly toss
the<00:07:11.990> payload<00:07:12.290> to<00:07:12.320> fly<00:07:12.650> really<00:07:13.610> far<00:07:14.030> away<00:07:14.650> so<00:07:15.650> we

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
the payload to fly really far away so we

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.310 
the payload to fly really far away so we
got<00:07:15.920> to<00:07:16.010> go<00:07:16.070> get<00:07:16.220> him

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.320 
got to go get him

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.100 
got to go get him
so<00:07:18.320> we<00:07:18.620> can<00:07:18.770> come<00:07:19.070> back<00:07:19.750> and<00:07:20.750> do<00:07:20.840> this<00:07:20.930> again

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.110 
so we can come back and do this again

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.630 
so we can come back and do this again
