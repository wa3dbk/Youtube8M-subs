00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.320 
teaching how to swap two by two Rubik's
Cube<00:00:06.319> it<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.740> easiest<00:00:08.340> puzzle<00:00:08.970> ever<00:00:09.690> um

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
Cube it is the easiest puzzle ever um

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.829 
Cube it is the easiest puzzle ever um
actually<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.630> lied<00:00:12.900> well<00:00:13.590> it's<00:00:13.740> not<00:00:13.920> as<00:00:14.099> easy<00:00:14.250> as

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
actually I lied well it's not as easy as

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.930 
actually I lied well it's not as easy as
the<00:00:15.839> one<00:00:16.199> by<00:00:16.320> one<00:00:16.529> Q<00:00:16.920> but<00:00:17.279> there's<00:00:17.490> pretty<00:00:17.880> much

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
the one by one Q but there's pretty much

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.510 
the one by one Q but there's pretty much
nothing<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.350> one<00:00:19.500> by<00:00:19.650> one<00:00:19.890> Cuban<00:00:20.400> don't

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
nothing to the one by one Cuban don't

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.720 
nothing to the one by one Cuban don't
have<00:00:20.670> someone<00:00:20.910> possible<00:00:21.420> combination<00:00:22.080> anyway

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
have someone possible combination anyway

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.439 
have someone possible combination anyway
so<00:00:25.130> today<00:00:26.130> I'm<00:00:26.490> going<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:26.970> teaching<00:00:27.210> you

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
so today I'm going to be teaching you

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.849 
so today I'm going to be teaching you
how<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.630> solve<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.080> two<00:00:28.230> light<00:00:28.380> suburban

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
how to solve the two light suburban

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.099 
how to solve the two light suburban
school<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.279> won't<00:00:29.849> be<00:00:29.939> going<00:00:30.179> over<00:00:30.420> notation

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
school I won't be going over notation

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.560 
school I won't be going over notation
for<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> 2<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.130> 2<00:00:32.250> cubed<00:00:32.790> because<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.420> is

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
for the 2 I 2 cubed because it is

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.060 
for the 2 I 2 cubed because it is
exactly<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.440> same<00:00:34.710> as<00:00:34.820> 3<00:00:35.820> by<00:00:36.000> 3<00:00:36.320> so<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.350> will

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
exactly the same as 3 by 3 so I will

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.430 
exactly the same as 3 by 3 so I will
just<00:00:38.309> explain<00:00:39.000> nothing<00:00:39.390> about<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.840> notation

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
just explain nothing about a notation

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.400 
just explain nothing about a notation
okay<00:00:41.309> now<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:43.789> you<00:00:44.789> are<00:00:45.030> ready<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.780> learn<00:00:45.809> how

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
okay now that you are ready to learn how

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:59.930 
okay now that you are ready to learn how
to<00:00:46.680> salta<00:00:47.100> two<00:00:47.250> by<00:00:47.370> two<00:00:47.430> let's<00:00:48.030> scramble<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.230> up

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.160 

scrambled<00:01:02.850> I'll<00:01:03.850> choose<00:01:04.300> the<00:01:04.510> white<00:01:04.720> side

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
scrambled I'll choose the white side

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.200 
scrambled I'll choose the white side
because<00:01:05.830> it<00:01:05.979> is<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.250> color<00:01:06.490> that<00:01:06.580> stands<00:01:07.150> out

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
because it is the color that stands out

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.870 
because it is the color that stands out
the<00:01:07.420> most<00:01:07.450> one<00:01:07.840> to<00:01:07.930> scramble<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.409> add<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:08.950> just

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
the most one to scramble to add to just

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.260 
the most one to scramble to add to just
like<00:01:10.090> we<00:01:10.390> start<00:01:10.750> with<00:01:11.380> white<00:01:12.070> on<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.850> three<00:01:13.090> by

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
like we start with white on the three by

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.420 
like we start with white on the three by
three<00:01:13.600> okay<00:01:14.140> so<00:01:14.200> what<00:01:14.770> we<00:01:14.920> are<00:01:14.950> going<00:01:15.190> to<00:01:15.250> want

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
three okay so what we are going to want

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.040 
three okay so what we are going to want
to<00:01:15.550> do<00:01:15.700> is<00:01:15.910> um<00:01:16.920> once<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:18.400> have<00:01:18.820> like<00:01:19.240> here's

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
to do is um once you have like here's

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.530 
to do is um once you have like here's
one<00:01:20.410> corner<00:01:20.920> well<00:01:21.670> pickle<00:01:21.970> corners<00:01:22.360> are

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
one corner well pickle corners are

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.080 
one corner well pickle corners are
starting<00:01:22.990> form<00:01:23.259> you<00:01:23.860> can<00:01:25.650> get<00:01:26.650> a<00:01:26.680> pair<00:01:27.190> of<00:01:27.490> two

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
starting form you can get a pair of two

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.230 
starting form you can get a pair of two
pieces<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:30.159> that<00:01:30.190> it<00:01:30.610> should<00:01:30.850> be<00:01:31.000> pretty

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
pieces like that it should be pretty

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.170 
pieces like that it should be pretty
easy<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:32.170> do<00:01:32.380> that<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:32.890> now<00:01:33.580> once<00:01:33.850> you<00:01:34.000> have

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
easy to do that and now once you have

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.590 
easy to do that and now once you have
your<00:01:34.600> pair<00:01:34.990> of<00:01:35.140> two<00:01:35.350> pieces<00:01:35.950> um<00:01:36.300> you're<00:01:37.300> going

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
your pair of two pieces um you're going

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.680 
your pair of two pieces um you're going
to<00:01:37.720> want<00:01:37.930> to<00:01:38.520> i'm<00:01:39.520> going<00:01:39.580> to<00:01:39.910> bring<00:01:40.060> this<00:01:40.450> piece

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
to want to i'm going to bring this piece

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.190 
to want to i'm going to bring this piece
up<00:01:40.750> here<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.759> algorithm<00:01:42.759> for<00:01:43.090> this<00:01:43.300> is<00:01:43.570> our

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
up here the algorithm for this is our

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.040 
up here the algorithm for this is our
prime<00:01:45.039> D<00:01:45.729> prime<00:01:46.149> our<00:01:46.570> d<00:01:48.240> ok<00:01:49.240> now<00:01:49.539> this<00:01:49.720> course

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
prime D prime our d ok now this course

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.359 
prime D prime our d ok now this course
is<00:01:50.759> oriented<00:01:51.759> wrong<00:01:52.000> but<00:01:52.539> we<00:01:52.929> do<00:01:53.140> our<00:01:53.410> prime<00:01:53.890> D

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
is oriented wrong but we do our prime D

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.540 
is oriented wrong but we do our prime D
prime<00:01:54.850> AR<00:01:55.270> D<00:01:55.869> and<00:01:56.140> there<00:01:56.710> is<00:01:57.179> now<00:01:59.190> it<00:02:00.190> will<00:02:00.520> take

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
prime AR D and there is now it will take

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.660 
prime AR D and there is now it will take
up<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.929> five<00:02:02.320> times<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:03.100> will<00:02:03.159> take<00:02:03.340> either<00:02:03.490> one

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
up to five times it will take either one

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.060 
up to five times it will take either one
three<00:02:04.299> or<00:02:04.450> five<00:02:04.780> times<00:02:05.049> to<00:02:05.380> get<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.650> corner<00:02:06.009> up

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
three or five times to get the corner up

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.719 
three or five times to get the corner up
there<00:02:06.130> okay<00:02:07.119> now<00:02:07.869> i<00:02:07.930> have<00:02:08.140> known<00:02:08.410> step<00:02:09.160> one<00:02:09.399> is

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
there okay now i have known step one is

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.729 
there okay now i have known step one is
the<00:02:09.940> first<00:02:09.970> side<00:02:10.570> of<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.899> cube<00:02:11.079> now<00:02:11.410> to<00:02:11.470> move

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
the first side of the cube now to move

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.820 
the first side of the cube now to move
on<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.070> step<00:02:12.280> two

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
on to step two

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.350 
on to step two
ok<00:02:14.820> step<00:02:15.210> two<00:02:15.920> is<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.980> solve<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.850> first<00:02:18.120> layer

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
ok step two is to solve the first layer

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.230 
ok step two is to solve the first layer
so<00:02:18.870> what<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.230> want<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.530> find<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.550> pair<00:02:20.880> of

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
so what you want to find is a pair of

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.700 
so what you want to find is a pair of
blue<00:02:21.600> pieces<00:02:22.160> like<00:02:23.160> these<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.850> our<00:02:23.880> blues<00:02:24.240> and

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
blue pieces like these to our blues and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.850 
blue pieces like these to our blues and
want<00:02:25.710> to<00:02:25.860> hold<00:02:26.520> these<00:02:27.060> pieces<00:02:27.540> on<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.260> back<00:02:28.500> I

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
want to hold these pieces on the back I

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.010 
want to hold these pieces on the back I
need<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.940> swap<00:02:30.300> these<00:02:30.600> two<00:02:31.050> pieces<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:33.660> swap

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
need to swap these two pieces to swap

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.710 
need to swap these two pieces to swap
these<00:02:34.350> two<00:02:34.410> pieces<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.880> following<00:02:36.210> algorithm

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720
