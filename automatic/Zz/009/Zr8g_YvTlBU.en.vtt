00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.340
 that will be the hammer I knew 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.560
 not that a great rocket anyway 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:31.720
 sentence is missing only the top and 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:43.239
 finished mist has fallen down try 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:45.489
 normal yes but now that can indeed 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.590
 do not work the thing is yes 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.940
 below round typical op 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.850
 There he has scraped himself again 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.930
 let those who turn to scrap 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.530
 nabu 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.940
 the condition always falls down naturally 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.120
 that must be so too 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.239
 and why she can not handle it 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.979
 her little smart ass clear as well as the 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.740
 swing that for half a year 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:14.289
 want to repair or that's it 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.660
 something completely different this rocket here 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:20.680
 I constructed for the 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.290
 planets stupid 04.04 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.500
 that's a pretty small one 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.240
 planet at the end of the milky way so you 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.080
 The milk road is always straight ahead 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.630
 and so after 200 300 planets comes left 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.390
 a telephone booth is overlooked easily 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.060
 In any case you have to turn there and 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.070
 then comes after about three light years 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.770
 left the planet stupid 04 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.400
 clearly and you are probably with 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.320
 this rocket then feeling and you 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.160
 but no idea and even only the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.470
 half so i was with rhine at the time 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.080
 on the way to repair the moon 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.600
 some back giant from the giant 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.950
 galaxy had a mess piece 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.869
 bitten off the ear 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.789
 now the moon did not make any more at night 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.830
 enough light for us sailors and 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.320
 There was no full moon anymore 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.280
 I bit a murder piece from the mouth 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.980
 we think we should have a doctor for opel 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.100
 definitely have me stupid 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.590
 stop over 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.170
 Stupid hurdle is the milk road to me 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.560
 Toll in the reason a simple 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.840
 Thing 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.680
 You pay a fee and drive on 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.480
 but the stupid diane are so stupid that 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.470
 they believe each of them would have the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.900
 to collect tolls 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.110
 Hardly was the first one with our money gone 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.410
 came the next company and 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.410
 the next a giant snake stood there 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.120
 in front of us because of stupid is as barren as 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.950
 they have nothing else to do but 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.080
 Immediately back up 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.510
 there wait for bankruptcy broke 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.640
 but anyway, no money anyway 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.799
 For these rip-offs I had them 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.019
 distract somehow otherwise they would have us 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.430
 do not fly away 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.070
 that's why one and I have one of these 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.320
 rockets and so that the 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.320
 pointed repeatedly falls off the 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.049
 stupid diana are really that stupid that 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.090
 she does not get it but 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:18.090
 since then they always have something to do because 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.610
 the thing is never finished so it is me 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.850
 thanks to that meanwhile without 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.620
 toll can drive past stupid and pure 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.200
 Anyway, I'll be moving on quickly 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.750
 to the moon sure and I like synonymous 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.820
 times just fixed fast but right 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.300
 You know that I'm not a guy of the likes 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.950
 to you 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.520
 we only had a few nails and something 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.230
 adhesive may be that the moon 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.540
 does not last forever and if he does not 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.330
 died then he still dizzy 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.850
 Today yes captain huts quickly we 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.740
 have to go back what's up 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.740
 na because times look up
