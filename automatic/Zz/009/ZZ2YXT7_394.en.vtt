00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello girls today I bring you the recipe 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.990
 kitkat cake and good is very easy and 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.180
 simple and very rich and good then here 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.420
 is what we are going to need for the 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.400
 cake you need 2 boxes of cake 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.470
 chocolate you can follow in the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.360
 back the instructions that is 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.850
 what he asks 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.830
 and hey, he only asked for oil 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.320
 vegetable eggs and water and that was it 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.020
 then add the chocolate flour 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.700
 to a container 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.700
 we add the eggs 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.649
 Water 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.670
 and finally the vegetable oil 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.760
 after we have added everything very 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.039
 well let's beat it 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.530
 I'm going to use a shovel because 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.539
 unfortunately I do not have a blender 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.570
 but if you have it then I do not know 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.340
 complicate life and better use that 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.670
 the shovel because if you take here your 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.220
 time and we're going to beat everything very well very 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.560
 well so that there is no group left 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.770
 you can spend some time moving around him 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.210
 moving him he would stay in the 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.130
 container that we are going to use for 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.700
 put it in the oven but it has a little 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.789
 of oil so that it does not stick 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.069
 we add the mixture and put it in 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.740
 oven you see how long is it 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:36.500
 who asks for your box since there are 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.229
 two cakes to one, we're going to 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.450
 cut the top part so that it does not 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.390
 let it be uneven when we put the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.880
 another cake up then only 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.760
 would that be like a little part of the 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.690
 above 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.690
 and so 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.100
 what we are going to need to decorate goes 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.580
 to be the next they are going to make bags of 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:05.300
 kitkat roughly like eight and two 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.940
 frost boats and here I'm missing some of 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.509
 less but it's also something to decorate 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.509
 the cake 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.010
 ok then let's start spreading everything 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:25.140
 the frosty on top of the 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:28.410
 cake that we cut and I say something 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.180
 this part is going to be very difficult to have 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.390
 to be done very carefully because 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.820
 how was the part that we cut come 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.550
 like the balls and then you have to 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.130
 be very soft so that you do not miss 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.860
 everything will come but the rest is already 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.660
 very very easy then this would be like 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.100
 the middle part because above it 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.100
 let's put the other cake 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.590
 already after we put the other cake 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.560
 we are going to anoint everything for everything for everything 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.780
 the cake girls forgive the relaxation but 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.240
 is that I was with the saturation is 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.070
 because the cake was for my husband 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.460
 then after around cake the 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.790
 let's put all the kid 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.200
 very well 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.200
 very easy with phrases 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.850
 and to finish we're going to put 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.310
 over the two weeks that gives a touch 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.569
 more beautiful and colorful and I added a 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.900
 bun and that would be the good result 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.970
 girls I hope it works for them and 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.690
 really put it into practice it makes me 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:42.330
 Very nice cheap and very rich we are 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.330
 the next girls bye rain of kisses
