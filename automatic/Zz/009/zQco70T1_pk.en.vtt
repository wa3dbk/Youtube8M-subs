remote has three different modes ABC so
you<00:00:16.949> can<00:00:17.070> have<00:00:17.160> three<00:00:17.400> different<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.760> these

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
you can have three different of these

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.200 
you can have three different of these
helicopters<00:00:18.210> fly<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.810> same<00:00:18.990> room<00:00:20.090> you<00:00:21.090> get

the lighter weight smaller little
smaller<00:00:46.890> blades<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:48.030> lets<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.420> fly<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> little

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
smaller blades that lets it fly a little

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.510 
smaller blades that lets it fly a little
longer<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.440> got<00:00:49.829> about<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> four<00:00:50.340> minute

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
this if it starts to rotate you just

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.640 
this if it starts to rotate you just
this<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.729> it'll<00:01:35.850> make<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> stable<00:01:36.659> flight<00:01:36.900> this

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
this and it'll make a stable flight this

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.080 
this and it'll make a stable flight this
has<00:01:37.829> another<00:01:38.130> thing<00:01:38.400> that's<00:01:38.490> not<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> big<00:01:38.909> deal

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
has another thing that's not a big deal

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.420 
has another thing that's not a big deal
but<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:39.360> got<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> on/off<00:01:40.020> switch<00:01:40.250> you<00:01:41.250> see

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
but it's got the on/off switch you see

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.499 
but it's got the on/off switch you see
this<00:01:41.549> front<00:01:41.820> light<00:01:42.439> it's<00:01:43.439> not<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> big<00:01:43.890> deal<00:01:44.040> but

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
this front light it's not a big deal but

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.090 
this front light it's not a big deal but
you<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:45.630> turn<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.350> off<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.680> front<00:01:46.890> light

you can turn on and off the front light
that's<00:01:47.670> pretty<00:01:47.909> cool<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.119> guess

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
that's pretty cool I guess

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.350 
that's pretty cool I guess
alright<00:01:50.399> yeah<00:01:50.670> that's<00:01:50.939> good<00:01:51.119> little

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
alright yeah that's good little

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.060 
alright yeah that's good little
helicopter<00:01:51.810> I'd<00:01:52.409> probably<00:01:52.649> say<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.040> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
helicopter I'd probably say it's a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.160 
helicopter I'd probably say it's a
little<00:01:53.250> bit<00:01:53.369> better<00:01:53.490> than<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.790> SOL<00:01:54.090> 7<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:55.110> a

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
little bit better than the SOL 7 it's a

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.990 
little bit better than the SOL 7 it's a
little<00:01:55.320> more<00:01:55.409> stable<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:56.009> little<00:01:56.670> smoother

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
little more stable a little smoother

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.950 
little more stable a little smoother
flying<00:01:58.880> I'll<00:01:59.880> show<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.240> how<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.420> looks<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
flying I'll show you how it looks in the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:23.470 
flying I'll show you how it looks in the
