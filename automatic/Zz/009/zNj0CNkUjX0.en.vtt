00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
so that's the riff he actually would

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.160 
so that's the riff he actually would
preach<00:01:25.980> it<00:01:26.190> all<00:01:26.580> through<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> song<00:01:27.300> sometimes

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
he does some small variations because in

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.770 
he does some small variations because in
original<00:01:31.560> sing<00:01:31.770> song<00:01:32.250> there's<00:01:32.730> also<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
women sometimes talking but we won't

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.230 
women sometimes talking but we won't
take<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.880> into<00:01:39.150> account<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.730> first<00:01:42.000> part

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
take that into account so the first part

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.920 
take that into account so the first part
he<00:01:43.050> plays<00:01:43.290> actually<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.860> course<00:01:44.750> which<00:01:45.750> is
