00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
here i actually play around with it a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.830 
here i actually play around with it a
bit<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.350> i<00:00:40.559> saw<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.510> if<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.719> actually

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
bit and i saw that if you actually

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.080 
bit and i saw that if you actually
unscrew<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.739> studs<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.610> i'll<00:00:44.700> just<00:00:44.760> show<00:00:45.059> you

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
unscrew the studs so i'll just show you

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.610 
unscrew the studs so i'll just show you
here<00:00:45.649> just<00:00:46.649> quickly<00:00:47.210> i<00:00:48.210> looked<00:00:49.170> because<00:00:49.410> i

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
here just quickly i looked because i

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.529 
here just quickly i looked because i
thought<00:00:49.829> at<00:00:49.980> first<00:00:50.250> would<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.520> best<00:00:51.210> to

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
thought at first would be best to

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.139 
thought at first would be best to
actually<00:00:52.410> take<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> studs<00:00:53.370> out<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.910> leave

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
actually take the studs out and leave

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.720 
actually take the studs out and leave
the<00:00:54.300> food<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.289> however<00:00:56.039> as<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the food just like that however as I

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.090 
the food just like that however as I
actually<00:00:56.910> looked<00:00:57.390> closer<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.620> actually

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
actually looked closer in I actually

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.389 
actually looked closer in I actually
believe<00:00:59.609> that<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.989> worse<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.890> take<00:01:02.190> off

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
believe that it's worse if you take off

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.789 
believe that it's worse if you take off
the<00:01:02.699> metal<00:01:02.940> studs<00:01:03.239> because<00:01:04.019> I'm<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.500> sure<00:01:04.710> if

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the metal studs because I'm not sure if

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.800 
the metal studs because I'm not sure if
you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:04.979> see<00:01:05.100> very<00:01:05.519> well<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.970> think<00:01:06.180> that

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
you can see very well but I think that

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.260 
you can see very well but I think that
is<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.260> whole<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.619> actually<00:01:07.950> open<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.610> don't

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
is the whole is actually open I don't

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.270 
is the whole is actually open I don't
think<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:11.010> solid<00:01:11.460> hole<00:01:11.700> or<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.689> solid

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
think that it is a solid hole or a solid

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.249 
think that it is a solid hole or a solid
actual<00:01:14.280> place<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.090> put<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.200> a

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
actual place to put it in so I have a

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.320 
actual place to put it in so I have a
feeling<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.710> water<00:01:17.070> will<00:01:17.280> go<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.820> there<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
feeling that water will go in there and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.660 
feeling that water will go in there and
screw<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.350> inside<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> shoe<00:01:20.070> so

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
screw up the inside of the shoe so

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.429 
screw up the inside of the shoe so
because<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.479> reckon<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.259> I'm

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
because of that I reckon that I'm

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.770 
because of that I reckon that I'm
actually<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> try<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.549> wash<00:01:24.240> them<00:01:24.479> with

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
actually going to try and wash them with

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.020 
actually going to try and wash them with
the<00:01:24.990> studs<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.590> guys<00:01:26.159> now<00:01:26.460> what<00:01:26.670> you're<00:01:26.850> going

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.359 
the studs in guys now what you're going
to<00:01:27.090> want<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.299> do<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:28.170> quickly<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:29.040> clean

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
to want to do is just quickly just clean

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.399 
to want to do is just quickly just clean
off<00:01:29.400> some<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> mud<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> boot<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.320> you

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
off some of the mud on the boot so you

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.810 
off some of the mud on the boot so you
can<00:01:31.530> see<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> left<00:01:32.159> boot<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.579> still

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
can see that the left boot is still

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.359 
can see that the left boot is still
pretty<00:01:33.090> muddy<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.710> right<00:01:34.920> boot<00:01:35.189> I

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
pretty muddy and on the right boot I

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.789 
pretty muddy and on the right boot I
have<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.820> quickly<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.840> taken<00:01:37.200> off<00:01:37.320> some<00:01:37.740> of

have just quickly just taken off some of
the<00:01:37.920> mud<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.520> doesn't<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.880> be

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the mud so it doesn't have to be

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
actual nike scan up looks a lot better

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.530 
actual nike scan up looks a lot better

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
now on the left boot which is where i

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.710 
now on the left boot which is where i
had<00:04:18.260> most<00:04:19.070> of<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.430> problems<00:04:19.640> you<00:04:20.269> can<00:04:20.450> still

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
had most of the problems you can still

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.560 
had most of the problems you can still
see<00:04:21.109> that<00:04:21.620> it<00:04:21.739> is<00:04:22.070> a<00:04:22.280> bit<00:04:22.550> dirty<00:04:22.850> you<00:04:23.180> can<00:04:23.330> still

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
see that it is a bit dirty you can still

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.170 
see that it is a bit dirty you can still
see<00:04:23.840> that<00:04:24.350> it<00:04:24.530> didn't<00:04:24.920> magically<00:04:25.250> just<00:04:25.970> turn

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
see that it didn't magically just turn

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.990 
see that it didn't magically just turn
it<00:04:26.330> back<00:04:26.540> to<00:04:26.570> look<00:04:26.960> brand<00:04:27.260> new<00:04:27.410> but<00:04:28.220> it<00:04:28.669> I

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
it back to look brand new but it I

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.390 
it back to look brand new but it I
reckon<00:04:29.510> it<00:04:29.630> actually<00:04:30.169> did<00:04:30.530> help<00:04:30.860> quite<00:04:31.250> a<00:04:31.280> bit

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
reckon it actually did help quite a bit

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.600 
reckon it actually did help quite a bit
so<00:04:32.270> again<00:04:33.080> if<00:04:33.290> I<00:04:33.800> don't<00:04:33.890> think<00:04:34.250> it's<00:04:34.370> a<00:04:34.430> bad

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
so again if I don't think it's a bad

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.340 
so again if I don't think it's a bad
thing<00:04:34.640> if<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.030> want<00:04:35.180> to<00:04:35.240> do<00:04:35.390> if<00:04:35.660> you<00:04:35.870> want<00:04:36.110> to

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
thing if you want to do if you want to

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.560 
thing if you want to do if you want to
put<00:04:36.620> your<00:04:36.740> super<00:04:37.070> flies<00:04:37.250> in<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:38.240> washing

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
put your super flies in the washing

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.150 
put your super flies in the washing
machine<00:04:38.600> I<00:04:39.020> think<00:04:39.380> that<00:04:39.500> it's<00:04:39.620> something<00:04:39.800> that

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
machine I think that it's something that

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.659 
machine I think that it's something that
actually<00:04:40.400> does<00:04:41.090> work<00:04:41.680> with<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.830> insoles<00:04:43.370> I

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
actually does work with the insoles I

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.120 
actually does work with the insoles I
don't<00:04:44.300> think<00:04:44.419> that<00:04:44.990> it<00:04:45.110> did<00:04:45.320> anything<00:04:45.560> but<00:04:45.890> it

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
don't think that it did anything but it

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.400 
don't think that it did anything but it
will<00:04:46.700> definitely<00:04:46.850> smell<00:04:47.450> better<00:04:47.660> now<00:04:47.780> so<00:04:48.320> if

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
will definitely smell better now so if

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.490 
will definitely smell better now so if
you<00:04:48.560> have<00:04:48.940> if<00:04:49.940> you<00:04:50.210> if<00:04:50.540> your<00:04:50.930> shoes<00:04:51.169> really

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
you have if you if your shoes really

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.830 
you have if you if your shoes really
smell<00:04:51.890> quite<00:04:52.100> a<00:04:52.160> bit<00:04:52.430> then<00:04:52.850> this<00:04:53.240> is<00:04:53.540> also

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
smell quite a bit then this is also

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.150 
smell quite a bit then this is also
another<00:04:54.050> way<00:04:54.380> to<00:04:54.890> get<00:04:55.070> rid<00:04:55.250> of<00:04:55.280> that<00:04:55.400> smell<00:04:56.080> so

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
another way to get rid of that smell so

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.380 
another way to get rid of that smell so
I'm<00:04:58.160> actually<00:04:58.310> might<00:04:58.610> try<00:04:58.880> this<00:04:58.940> with<00:04:59.360> a

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
I'm actually might try this with a

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.540 
I'm actually might try this with a
couple<00:05:00.110> of<00:05:00.169> my<00:05:00.290> other<00:05:00.320> shoes<00:05:00.830> and<00:05:01.100> see<00:05:01.250> how<00:05:01.400> it

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
couple of my other shoes and see how it

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.390 
couple of my other shoes and see how it
goes<00:05:01.790> but<00:05:02.510> right<00:05:03.440> that's<00:05:03.770> pretty<00:05:04.040> much<00:05:04.130> it<00:05:04.190> for

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
goes but right that's pretty much it for

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.180 
goes but right that's pretty much it for
the<00:05:04.580> video<00:05:04.820> you<00:05:05.480> can<00:05:05.600> see<00:05:05.870> here<00:05:06.169> that<00:05:06.200> it<00:05:06.980> does

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
the video you can see here that it does

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.550 
the video you can see here that it does
look<00:05:07.460> a<00:05:07.640> lot<00:05:07.940> better<00:05:08.240> I<00:05:08.600> don't<00:05:08.990> think<00:05:09.080> that<00:05:09.410> it

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
look a lot better I don't think that it

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.100 
look a lot better I don't think that it
it<00:05:09.860> doesn<00:05:10.580> t<00:05:10.610> magic<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.360> shoes<00:05:11.600> but<00:05:11.870> it

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
it doesn t magic to the shoes but it

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.170 
it doesn t magic to the shoes but it
does<00:05:12.350> give<00:05:12.650> it<00:05:12.770> a<00:05:12.919> bit<00:05:13.280> of<00:05:13.310> a<00:05:13.490> of<00:05:13.730> a<00:05:13.940> better

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
does give it a bit of a of a better

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.600 
does give it a bit of a of a better
clean<00:05:14.510> then<00:05:14.750> you<00:05:14.870> could<00:05:15.169> do<00:05:15.410> with<00:05:15.980> just<00:05:16.460> a
