have the same aluminum cam lock buckles
that<00:00:44.589> we<00:00:44.769> see<00:00:44.920> in<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.100> 2.1<00:00:45.519> key<00:00:46.180> differences

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
that we see in the 2.1 key differences

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.829 
that we see in the 2.1 key differences
is<00:00:46.870> that<00:00:47.199> our<00:00:47.680> that<00:00:47.949> the<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.909> 2.1<00:00:49.360> is<00:00:49.570> going<00:00:49.780> to

boot there's no inner bootie here and

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.020 
boot there's no inner bootie here and
the<00:00:53.170> 2.1<00:00:53.710> is<00:00:53.920> also<00:00:54.339> going<00:00:54.489> to<00:00:54.610> have<00:00:54.729> the<00:00:54.820> full

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
the 2.1 is also going to have the full

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.910 
the 2.1 is also going to have the full
torsion<00:00:55.479> control<00:00:55.809> system<00:00:56.199> which<00:00:56.589> guards

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
torsion control system which guards

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.829 
torsion control system which guards
against<00:00:57.250> twisting<00:00:57.699> of<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:57.879> foot<00:00:58.120> that<00:00:58.570> we<00:00:58.659> see

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
against twisting of the foot that we see

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.869 
against twisting of the foot that we see
on<00:00:58.930> all<00:00:59.170> of<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.470> more<00:00:59.650> aggressive<00:00:59.949> TCX<00:01:00.640> boots

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
on all of the more aggressive TCX boots

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.759 
on all of the more aggressive TCX boots
this<00:01:01.420> actually<00:01:01.900> has<00:01:02.049> a<00:01:02.080> torsion<00:01:02.470> control

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
this actually has a torsion control

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.560 
this actually has a torsion control
system<00:01:03.100> but<00:01:03.220> it's<00:01:03.339> dual<00:01:03.580> jointed<00:01:04.059> vs.<00:01:04.390> quad

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
system but it's dual jointed vs. quad

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.210 
system but it's dual jointed vs. quad
jointed<00:01:05.170> so<00:01:05.470> what<00:01:05.560> you're<00:01:05.650> having<00:01:05.770> is<00:01:05.979> two

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
jointed so what you're having is two

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.710 
jointed so what you're having is two
tongue<00:01:06.460> and<00:01:06.610> grooves<00:01:06.820> on<00:01:06.940> each<00:01:07.090> side<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:07.600> a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
back for rigidity now if we look at the

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.500 
back for rigidity now if we look at the
aggressive<00:01:12.250> style<00:01:12.520> of<00:01:12.670> this<00:01:12.820> boot<00:01:13.060> is<00:01:13.390> the
