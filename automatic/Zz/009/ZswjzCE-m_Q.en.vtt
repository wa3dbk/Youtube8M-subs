00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.219
 68 went to the alge and telling them where they are going 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.150
 need installed 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.180
 This is not going to work the site I 'm going to 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.210
 video discussions that the average fire that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.210
 It's more reliable, but I'm going down here 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:45.930
 after downloaded 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:47.790
 you open it looking here my that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.650
 The team where you take the cearÃ¡ opened the 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.650
 download and it will be like this 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:02.659
 there you will have to create a folder that 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:08.820
 do not know is the so new right mouse 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:16.940
 paste in the middle to silva extract for 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:19.290
 that folder you created the ifa throws 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.130
 just click here 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.130
 668 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:34.290
 the game will open no effect will go 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.670
 to function perfectly which is one thing 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.789
 important that the 6 will set up are 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:52.380
 memory trajectory that is Spanish 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:56.520
 then I put here will open the scoring and out 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.210
 and come back to play 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.509
 the process will not have to create another 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.609
 memory card are you going to meet me? 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.609
 marked that you created the same folder 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:25.310
 perfectly saved from beginning memory 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.310
 that I have to salivate 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.290
 What thing I know how to play the most is 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.660
 so he has to tie humanity to 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.660
 be a little lost but it's full screen 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:55.440
 the buttons are xsa and joseph 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:55.440
 directional and shift the little legal and 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.690
 I do not know 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.690

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.070
