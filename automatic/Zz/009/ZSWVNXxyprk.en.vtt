00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.179
 And then folks, I 'm here in the depths. 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.349
 abyssals which is a map that lies within 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.139
 from bashir 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.619
 bashir which is a map of the eastern kingdoms 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.720
 this map who stays here at sea and in this 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.730
 video show how of the creeping mage 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.760
 spectral than a rare helper to 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.609
 hunters would be the spiritual beast type 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.730
 so you have to come down here, you 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.859
 here on this map and here in the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.260
 abyssal depths you can see here 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.960
 this red route on the map 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.760
 This is the route that makes him go. 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.309
 and coming back on this route 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.410
 and it's good that you've already done it 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.780
 less the first missions this map 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.969
 because if you do the first 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.129
 missions you receive a bank that allows 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.070
 that you breathe underwater only 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.710
 in itself a map and also a mission that gives 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.600
 this seahorse for you then 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.160
 I recommend that you have done the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.199
 initial conditions because you do not have 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.890
 problems of drowning 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.979
 but if you did not do the missions it's just 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.650
 question whether you use any booth or 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.810
 some portion of breathing underwater 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.689
 It is speculated that the time to respond 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.330
 rare between 6 and 24 hours 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.090
 he does not have an exact vestal time 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.549
 then it's just speculation about 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.250
 You come here to look for him you have to 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.790
 take care of the next he gets 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.820
 appearing and disappearing it remains for 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.810
 a few seconds visible that is the moment 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.909
 where you can start taking it but 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.340
 it will disappear from time to time 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.250
 time and when it disappears it will 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.340
 the good invisible seconds it gets more 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.189
 ten seconds without appearing 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.899
 you are just passing here that 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.720
 map to take a look if it is there 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.270
 and you do not find him do not leave already 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.520
 immediately stay there for at least 15 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.390
 minutes trying to find him because 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.340
 maybe it is invisible and so the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.390
 its the bus indicating warned 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.790
 so do not get off too fast from the map 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.040
 try to find him for some 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.959
 others because maybe he's there 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.209
 just be invisible 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.890
 But there's no way you can take it from him. 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.390
 invisible, for example, can not 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:28.049
 use the beacon to draw 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.359
 So one way is for you to get lucky. 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.980
 find him when he is 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.290
 visible 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.459
 I suggest you use the add-ons 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.980
 mp6 show location on map 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.799
 of his route and also the silver dragon 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.480
 which is similar to nbc scan 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.060
 I also recommend that you use a 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.549
 crawler target machine 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.099
 spectral for you to keep pressing 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.409
 this macula to be able to turn it into the 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.250
 fast as possible and also recommend that 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:01.230
 you mark it on your mini map in the magnifying glass 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.909
 check the beasts tracking because so 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.909
 you can see me and also in their mini 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:09.389
 map and here in this area we do not have 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:12.299
 beast type bugs so if you see one 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:15.030
 yellow dot kill me you already know 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.229
 which is then I will be running the 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.489
 edge of the sea and as soon as possible 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:22.280
 before he was unpredictable then this 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.720
 then you 'll only find there 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.829
 use restraint if you are level 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.870
 down and tame the beast he does not accept the 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.150
 freezing trap then no use 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.769
 use and this is it 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.010
 I hope you have enjoyed it and even 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.010
 next
