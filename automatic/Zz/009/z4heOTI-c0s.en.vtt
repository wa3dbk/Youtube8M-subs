00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
about it this run will count there's

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.180

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
to be another fielder's choice I would

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.959 
to be another fielder's choice I would
think<00:00:55.350> because<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.739> play<00:00:56.250> was<00:00:56.460> pretty<00:00:56.699> close

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
think because the play was pretty close

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.970 
think because the play was pretty close
I<00:00:57.180> don't<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.510> if<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.899> call<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.559> an<00:00:58.800> error

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
I don't know if you can call it an error

I don't know if you can call it an error
there's<00:00:59.730> no<00:00:59.940> doubt<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.480> run<00:01:00.690> should<00:01:00.930> have

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
there's no doubt the run should have

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.119 
there's no doubt the run should have
scored<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.649> would<00:01:01.829> think

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
scored and I would think

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.780 
scored and I would think
Clayton<00:01:02.699> Hamm<00:01:02.879> would<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.210> seen<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:04.790> now

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
nonetheless again it all gets back to

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.020 
nonetheless again it all gets back to
the<00:03:27.310> point<00:03:27.340> he's<00:03:27.760> absolutely<00:03:28.210> right<00:03:30.030> been

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
the point he's absolutely right been

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.870 
the point he's absolutely right been
trying<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.690> in<00:03:31.990> my<00:03:32.230> mind<00:03:32.620> trying<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.190> determine

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
trying to in my mind trying to determine

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.000 
trying to in my mind trying to determine
because<00:03:33.970> remember<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.900> three<00:03:35.200> umpires<00:03:35.620> got

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
because remember the three umpires got

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.390 
because remember the three umpires got
together<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.760> talked<00:03:37.120> this<00:03:37.420> over<00:03:38.400> before

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
together and talked this over before

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.400 
together and talked this over before
coming<00:03:39.970> up<00:03:40.120> with<00:03:40.300> what<00:03:40.720> appears<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.170> be<00:03:41.290> a

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
coming up with what appears to be a

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.910 
coming up with what appears to be a
horrible<00:03:41.890> decision<00:03:43.230> what<00:03:44.230> goes<00:03:44.530> through<00:03:44.560> my

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
horrible decision what goes through my

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.790 
horrible decision what goes through my
mind<00:03:45.040> is<00:03:45.490> this<00:03:45.820> clearly<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.930> ball<00:03:47.290> was<00:03:47.560> in

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
mind is this clearly the ball was in

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.190 
mind is this clearly the ball was in
Maxwell's<00:03:48.610> glove<00:03:49.030> just<00:03:49.360> for<00:03:49.510> an<00:03:49.570> instant<00:03:49.630> only

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
Maxwell's glove just for an instant only

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.750 
Maxwell's glove just for an instant only
for<00:03:50.530> an<00:03:50.590> instant<00:03:50.920> but<00:03:51.010> it<00:03:51.160> really<00:03:51.490> looked<00:03:51.670> on

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
for an instant but it really looked on

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.790 
for an instant but it really looked on
the<00:03:51.880> tag<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.450> ball<00:03:52.690> came<00:03:52.959> right<00:03:53.230> out<00:03:53.260> and

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
the tag the ball came right out and

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.940 
the tag the ball came right out and
again<00:03:54.790> exactly<00:03:55.630> what<00:03:55.840> any<00:03:56.080> of<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.620> all

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
again exactly what any of the and all

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.280 
again exactly what any of the and all
three<00:03:57.520> guys<00:03:57.820> had<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.330> have<00:03:58.450> agreed<00:03:58.810> on<00:03:58.959> this<00:03:59.140> or

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
three guys had to have agreed on this or

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.240 
three guys had to have agreed on this or
said<00:03:59.500> they<00:03:59.680> didn't<00:03:59.950> see<00:04:00.100> any<00:04:00.250> differently<00:04:01.200> and

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
said they didn't see any differently and

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.460 
said they didn't see any differently and
and<00:04:03.250> again<00:04:03.820> it<00:04:04.000> was<00:04:04.180> just<00:04:04.450> instantaneous<00:04:05.260> so

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
and again it was just instantaneous so

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.110 
and again it was just instantaneous so
that's<00:04:05.770> just<00:04:06.070> that<00:04:06.340> that's<00:04:06.610> three<00:04:06.910> guys

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
that's just that that's three guys

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.709 
that's just that that's three guys
making<00:04:07.570> an<00:04:07.690> awful<00:04:08.200> decision
