how<00:00:00.329> I<00:00:00.359> solve<00:00:00.870> the<00:00:01.050> edges<00:00:01.319> for<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.100> five<00:00:02.280> by

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
how I solve the edges for the five by

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.200 
how I solve the edges for the five by
five<00:00:04.040> this<00:00:05.040> is<00:00:05.190> obviously<00:00:05.339> just<00:00:05.609> after

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
five this is obviously just after

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.350 
five this is obviously just after
matching<00:00:07.140> up<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.500> center's<00:00:08.059> and<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.150> look<00:00:09.330> down

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
matching up the center's and I look down

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.959 
matching up the center's and I look down
the<00:00:09.690> first<00:00:09.900> thing<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.170> see<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.429> red<00:00:11.849> and

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
the first thing I see is the red and

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.419 
the first thing I see is the red and
greens<00:00:12.269> right<00:00:12.570> here<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.620> scan<00:00:14.009> as<00:00:14.219> quickly

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
greens right here so I scan as quickly

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.970 
greens right here so I scan as quickly
as<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.759> can<00:00:14.820> around<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.929> cube<00:00:16.199> for<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:16.710> piece

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
as I can around the cube for that piece

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.849 
as I can around the cube for that piece
and<00:00:17.279> it's<00:00:17.400> actually<00:00:17.670> right<00:00:18.090> there<00:00:18.560> so<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.650> read

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
and do this are to placing piece here

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.269 
and do this are to placing piece here
and<00:00:23.609> here<00:00:24.000> easy<00:00:24.750> replace<00:00:25.760> and<00:00:26.760> match<00:00:27.660> up<00:00:27.960> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
all horizontal the same way so I slice

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.740 
all horizontal the same way so I slice
with<00:01:12.890> replace<00:01:14.270> okay<00:01:15.270> right<00:01:15.479> as<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.720> was

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
notice there is green and white so I

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.390 
notice there is green and white so I
scan<00:02:21.459> find<00:02:22.459> green<00:02:22.700> white<00:02:22.940> here<00:02:24.220> replace<00:02:25.220> that

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
scan find green white here replace that

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.990 
scan find green white here replace that
group<00:02:26.230> match<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.500> up<00:02:27.709> for<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.670> green<00:02:28.849> and

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
group match that up for the green and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.509 
group match that up for the green and
white<00:02:29.060> center<00:02:29.510> which<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:29.900> here<00:02:31.870> replace<00:02:33.519> okay

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
white center which is here replace okay

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.509 
white center which is here replace okay
now<00:02:35.450> i<00:02:35.480> notice<00:02:35.989> that<00:02:36.140> when<00:02:36.680> i'm<00:02:37.069> going<00:02:37.430> to

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
now i notice that when i'm going to

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.640 
now i notice that when i'm going to
replace<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:38.060> green<00:02:38.299> and<00:02:38.450> white<00:02:38.510> center<00:02:38.930> i'm

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
replace this green and white center i'm

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.199 
replace this green and white center i'm
going<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.040> solve<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.610> red<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:40.879> white<00:02:40.940> group

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
going to solve the red and white group

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.460 
going to solve the red and white group
at<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.420> same<00:02:41.659> time<00:02:42.010> okay<00:02:43.010> there<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:45.230> go

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
at the same time okay there so I go

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.530 
at the same time okay there so I go
ahead<00:02:45.590> just<00:02:45.739> replace<00:02:46.160> these<00:02:46.730> are<00:02:46.879> my<00:02:46.970> last<00:02:47.000> two

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
ahead just replace these are my last two

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.670 
ahead just replace these are my last two
before<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:48.170> middle<00:02:48.349> layer<00:02:48.620> edges<00:02:50.560> flip<00:02:51.560> it

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
before the middle layer edges flip it

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.000 
before the middle layer edges flip it
over<00:02:51.799> and<00:02:51.950> replaces<00:02:52.609> this<00:02:52.760> group<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.620> then<00:02:54.620> I

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
over and replaces this group and then I

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.030 
over and replaces this group and then I
just<00:02:55.910> have<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.060> replace<00:02:56.480> all<00:02:56.720> my<00:02:56.780> centers<00:02:57.260> so

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
just have to replace all my centers so

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.190 
just have to replace all my centers so
now<00:02:58.160> I<00:02:58.190> have<00:02:58.310> eight<00:02:58.519> age<00:02:58.730> group<00:02:59.030> salt<00:02:59.390> in<00:02:59.660> just

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
now I have eight age group salt in just

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.800 
now I have eight age group salt in just
the<00:03:00.319> metals<00:03:00.700> so<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:02.000> go<00:03:02.239> ahead<00:03:02.359> and<00:03:02.450> scan<00:03:02.660> the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
the metals so I go ahead and scan the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.930 
the metals so I go ahead and scan the
cube<00:03:03.049> really<00:03:03.379> quickly<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.489> look<00:03:04.730> for

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
cube really quickly and I look for

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.400 
cube really quickly and I look for
anything<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.359> might<00:03:05.569> stand<00:03:05.870> out<00:03:06.049> is<00:03:06.230> being

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
anything that might stand out is being

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.979 
anything that might stand out is being
easy<00:03:06.739> which<00:03:07.519> in<00:03:07.670> this<00:03:07.790> case<00:03:07.849> there<00:03:08.690> is<00:03:08.810> already

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
easy which in this case there is already

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.860 
easy which in this case there is already
a<00:03:09.109> blue<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.129> orange<00:03:10.280> I<00:03:10.700> just<00:03:11.510> need<00:03:11.629> to<00:03:11.690> find

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
a blue and orange I just need to find

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.500 
a blue and orange I just need to find
the<00:03:12.049> edge<00:03:12.230> which<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.739> right<00:03:12.920> here<00:03:13.090> so<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:14.120> flip

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
the edge which is right here so I flip

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.300 
the edge which is right here so I flip
to<00:03:14.720> get<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:14.959> so<00:03:15.169> that<00:03:15.319> when<00:03:15.410> I<00:03:15.470> sliced<00:03:15.889> I'll<00:03:16.160> go

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
to get it so that when I sliced I'll go

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.000 
to get it so that when I sliced I'll go
here<00:03:16.810> but<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:17.840> also<00:03:18.049> want<00:03:18.319> to<00:03:18.470> be<00:03:18.590> sure<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:18.829> put

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
here but I also want to be sure and put

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.199 
here but I also want to be sure and put
a<00:03:19.250> broken<00:03:20.120> edge<00:03:20.299> group<00:03:20.660> up<00:03:20.840> in<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.139> top<00:03:21.349> layer

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
a broken edge group up in the top layer

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.089 
a broken edge group up in the top layer
okay<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:23.269> there's<00:03:23.690> my<00:03:23.900> working<00:03:24.319> edge<00:03:24.590> or

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
okay so there's my working edge or

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.580 
okay so there's my working edge or
working<00:03:25.459> group<00:03:25.819> i<00:03:25.970> guess<00:03:26.180> you'd<00:03:26.359> say<00:03:26.630> so<00:03:27.560> I

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
working group i guess you'd say so I

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.750 
working group i guess you'd say so I
slice<00:03:28.810> now<00:03:29.810> you<00:03:29.870> can<00:03:30.049> pay<00:03:30.230> attention<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.859> how

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
slice now you can pay attention to how

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.490 
slice now you can pay attention to how
this<00:03:31.970> is<00:03:32.090> what's<00:03:32.510> going<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.810> affect<00:03:33.169> this<00:03:33.319> edge

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
this is what's going to affect this edge

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.559 
this is what's going to affect this edge
group<00:03:33.709> when<00:03:33.829> I<00:03:33.919> slice<00:03:34.220> back<00:03:34.519> in<00:03:34.819> this<00:03:35.030> case<00:03:35.299> the

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
group when I slice back in this case the

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.720 
group when I slice back in this case the
center<00:03:35.900> is<00:03:36.079> blue<00:03:36.319> and<00:03:36.349> yellow<00:03:36.590> so<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.519> replaced

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
center is blue and yellow so I replaced

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.449 
center is blue and yellow so I replaced
so<00:03:38.269> that<00:03:38.450> when<00:03:38.660> I<00:03:38.959> bring<00:03:39.440> it<00:03:39.590> down<00:03:39.799> and<00:03:40.190> sliced

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
so that when I bring it down and sliced

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.750 
so that when I bring it down and sliced
my<00:03:40.669> centers<00:03:41.000> back<00:03:41.590> there<00:03:42.590> re<00:03:42.739> fixes<00:03:43.250> that<00:03:43.430> blue

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
my centers back there re fixes that blue

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.440 
my centers back there re fixes that blue
and<00:03:43.910> yellow<00:03:44.049> okay<00:03:45.049> so<00:03:45.919> at<00:03:46.549> this<00:03:46.760> point<00:03:47.060> this

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
and yellow okay so at this point this

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.659 
and yellow okay so at this point this
group<00:03:47.750> is<00:03:47.900> up<00:03:48.049> this<00:03:48.200> blue<00:03:49.190> and<00:03:49.310> yellow<00:03:49.370> piece

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
group is up this blue and yellow piece

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.000 
group is up this blue and yellow piece
is<00:03:49.819> all<00:03:49.970> ready<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.239> go<00:03:50.299> so<00:03:51.260> i<00:03:51.290> replaced<00:03:51.530> with

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
is all ready to go so i replaced with

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.240 
is all ready to go so i replaced with
the<00:03:52.190> other<00:03:52.370> center<00:03:53.680> okay<00:03:54.819> slice<00:03:55.819> and<00:03:56.260> then<00:03:57.260> put

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
the other center okay slice and then put

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.729 
the other center okay slice and then put
this<00:03:58.370> edge<00:03:58.579> group<00:03:58.849> into<00:03:59.120> place<00:03:59.389> just<00:04:00.139> just<00:04:00.560> to

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
this edge group into place just just to

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.659 
this edge group into place just just to
switch<00:04:00.950> it<00:04:01.099> out<00:04:01.629> and<00:04:02.629> slice<00:04:02.930> back<00:04:03.230> again<00:04:03.669> okay

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
switch it out and slice back again okay

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:11.800 
switch it out and slice back again okay
at<00:04:04.970> this<00:04:05.120> point<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.720> do<00:04:06.650> have<00:04:06.949> a<00:04:06.980> parody<00:04:07.720> so

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.470 

I<00:04:12.099> will<00:04:13.099> get<00:04:14.090> lost<00:04:14.300> for<00:04:14.660> a<00:04:14.720> second<00:04:15.170> and<00:04:15.290> then

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
I will get lost for a second and then

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.960 
I will get lost for a second and then
you<00:04:17.480> see<00:04:17.889> find<00:04:18.889> that<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.070> will<00:04:19.669> do<00:04:19.820> the

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
you see find that I will do the

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.400 
you see find that I will do the
algorithm<00:04:20.269> that<00:04:20.600> I've<00:04:20.720> already<00:04:20.900> sent<00:04:21.230> you

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
algorithm that I've already sent you

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:32.350 
algorithm that I've already sent you
which<00:04:21.560> is<00:04:21.590> this<00:04:28.990> okay<00:04:29.990> oops<00:04:30.530> one<00:04:31.040> okay<00:04:31.880> so<00:04:31.940> now

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
which is this okay oops one okay so now

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.330 
which is this okay oops one okay so now
this<00:04:32.540> is<00:04:32.600> already<00:04:33.050> all<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:33.950> edges<00:04:34.250> are

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
this is already all the edges are

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.070 
this is already all the edges are
finished<00:04:34.700> and<00:04:35.330> i'll<00:04:35.510> just<00:04:35.840> go<00:04:35.930> ahead<00:04:35.990> and
