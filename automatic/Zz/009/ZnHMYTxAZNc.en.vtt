00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
we're looking at the m4 17 the ACOG

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.209 
we're looking at the m4 17 the ACOG
along<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.020> foregrip<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.980> laser

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
along with the foregrip and the laser

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.950 
along with the foregrip and the laser
sight<00:00:38.550> now<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.210> first<00:00:39.420> thing<00:00:39.570> you'll<00:00:39.809> notice

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
sight now the first thing you'll notice

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.750 
sight now the first thing you'll notice
is<00:00:40.260> i'm<00:00:40.469> not<00:00:40.680> actually<00:00:40.890> using<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.579> laser

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
is i'm not actually using the laser

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.270 
is i'm not actually using the laser
sight<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.270> reason<00:00:42.629> being<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.050> because<00:00:43.129> as<00:00:44.129> you

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
sight the reason being is because as you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.369 
sight the reason being is because as you
see<00:00:44.460> I'm<00:00:44.550> playing<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.910> Tehran<00:00:45.180> highway<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.870> kept

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
see I'm playing on Tehran highway I kept

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.229 
see I'm playing on Tehran highway I kept
getting<00:00:46.559> spotted<00:00:47.039> over<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.579> over<00:00:47.670> again<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.210> I

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
getting spotted over and over again so I

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.299 
getting spotted over and over again so I
really<00:00:48.629> couldn't<00:00:48.809> use<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.129> pretty

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
really couldn't use it you can pretty

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.189 
really couldn't use it you can pretty
much<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> same<00:00:51.090> type<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.510> gameplay<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
much have the same type of gameplay the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.380 
much have the same type of gameplay the
only<00:00:52.469> difference<00:00:52.829> being<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.210> won't

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
only difference being is that you won't

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.819 
only difference being is that you won't
have<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> crosshairs<00:00:55.230> as<00:00:55.379> close<00:00:55.620> together

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
have the crosshairs as close together

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.590 
have the crosshairs as close together
but<00:00:56.219> you'll<00:00:56.370> get<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> gist<00:00:56.879> by<00:00:57.149> watching<00:00:57.360> this

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
but you'll get the gist by watching this

couple<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.670> stats<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.449> m4<00:01:00.809> 17<00:01:01.410> has<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
couple of stats of the m4 17 has a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.210 
couple of stats of the m4 17 has a
maximum<00:01:02.280> damage<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.910> 52<00:01:03.329> will<00:01:03.510> drop<00:01:03.719> off<00:01:03.870> of

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
maximum damage of 52 will drop off of

37.5 at long range with a vertical
recoil<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.680> 1.15<00:01:08.520> now<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.780> pretty

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
recoil of 1.15 now that is pretty

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.990 
recoil of 1.15 now that is pretty
significant<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.010> too<00:01:11.189> significant<00:01:11.880> and

sight the problem with these three is
I'll<00:01:23.159> go<00:01:23.310> over<00:01:23.640> them<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.970> second<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.509> I

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
I'll go over them in a second but I

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.420 
I'll go over them in a second but I
would<00:01:24.900> not<00:01:25.049> choose<00:01:25.380> these<00:01:25.680> three<00:01:26.070> particular

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
would not choose these three particular

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.719 
would not choose these three particular
attachments<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.320> reason<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.979> ACOG

zooms<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> little<00:01:30.479> bit<00:01:30.600> too<00:01:30.780> much<00:01:30.990> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
zooms in a little bit too much and

covers too much of your screen you do
not<00:01:33.360> want<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.689> when<00:01:34.020> you're<00:01:34.170> sniping

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
not want that when you're sniping

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.649 
not want that when you're sniping
aggressively<00:01:35.400> well<00:01:35.880> that's<00:01:36.119> how<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
aggressively well that's how I like to

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.569 
aggressively well that's how I like to
start<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.079> semi-automatic<00:01:37.530> sniper<00:01:37.920> rifles

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
start with semi-automatic sniper rifles

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.580 
start with semi-automatic sniper rifles
you<00:01:38.700> may<00:01:38.850> like<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.060> snap<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> different<00:01:39.869> way<00:01:39.960> but

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
you may like to snap a different way but

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.289 
you may like to snap a different way but
my<00:01:40.770> personal<00:01:41.040> preference<00:01:41.430> would<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.030> use

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
my personal preference would be to use

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.480 
my personal preference would be to use
like<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> holographic<00:01:43.140> or<00:01:43.500> something<00:01:44.369> like

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
like a holographic or something like

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.039 
like a holographic or something like
that<00:01:44.549> something<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.420> see<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> screen

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
that something we can see the screen

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.020 
that something we can see the screen
just<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.380> little<00:01:46.649> bit<00:01:46.799> more<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.640> second

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
just a little bit more the second

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.609 
just a little bit more the second
attachment<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.689> recommended<00:01:49.200> was<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
attachment you recommended was the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.960 
attachment you recommended was the
foregrip<00:01:50.070> now<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.310> problem<00:01:50.520> with<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.759> ball

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
foregrip now the problem with the ball

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.690 
foregrip now the problem with the ball
grip<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.439> don't<00:01:52.799> see<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.100> point<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.490> it

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
grip is I just don't see the point in it

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.090 
grip is I just don't see the point in it
I<00:01:53.850> would<00:01:54.030> rather<00:01:54.210> use<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> bipod<00:01:55.439> or<00:01:55.740> maybe

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
I would rather use a bipod or maybe

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.100 
I would rather use a bipod or maybe
nothing<00:01:56.490> at<00:01:56.579> all<00:01:56.729> because<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.210> bipod<00:01:57.600> you'll

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
nothing at all because the bipod you'll

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.080 
nothing at all because the bipod you'll
be<00:01:58.229> stationary<00:01:58.770> more<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.250> you'll<00:01:59.729> be<00:01:59.880> our

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
be stationary more and you'll be our

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.749 
be stationary more and you'll be our
suspect<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.750> get<00:02:00.899> sniped<00:02:01.170> more<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.829> pretty

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
suspect to get sniped more so pretty

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.399 
suspect to get sniped more so pretty
much<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.060> would<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.420> go<00:02:03.540> with<00:02:03.689> nothing<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.229> all

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
much I would just go with nothing in all

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.469 
much I would just go with nothing in all
honesty<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.520> third<00:02:05.700> attachment<00:02:06.060> like

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
honesty and the third attachment like

you put is the laser sight the lace site

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.570 
you put is the laser sight the lace site
is<00:02:09.629> pretty<00:02:09.989> good<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.800> are<00:02:11.069> not<00:02:11.340> good<00:02:11.550> at

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
is pretty good if you are not good at

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.370 
is pretty good if you are not good at
aiming<00:02:11.879> if<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.629> like<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.959> hit

Aaron<00:02:13.650> spray<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:13.980> lot<00:02:14.220> with<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.460> with<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.060> m4

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
Aaron spray a lot with the with the m4

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.230 
Aaron spray a lot with the with the m4
17<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.050> does<00:02:16.410> work<00:02:16.680> pretty<00:02:16.710> well<00:02:17.040> but<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:18.090> my

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
17 it does work pretty well but in my

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.420 
17 it does work pretty well but in my
opinion<00:02:18.330> it's<00:02:18.840> not<00:02:19.080> really<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.440> best<00:02:19.740> what<00:02:20.400> I

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
opinion it's not really the best what I

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.670 
opinion it's not really the best what I
like<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.880> do<00:02:21.030> is<00:02:21.060> old<00:02:21.630> use<00:02:21.870> like<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.110> tack<00:02:22.440> light

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
like to do is old use like a tack light

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.380 
like to do is old use like a tack light
and<00:02:22.890> turn<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.430> on<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.700> off<00:02:23.820> so<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.090> can<00:02:24.240> take

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
and turn it on and off so I can take

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.630 
and turn it on and off so I can take
people<00:02:24.750> out<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:24.870> close<00:02:25.110> range<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.980> 50<00:02:26.400> damage

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
people out of close range that 50 damage

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.340 
people out of close range that 50 damage
at<00:02:26.910> close<00:02:27.090> range<00:02:27.360> with<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.600> tack<00:02:27.870> light<00:02:28.110> can

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
at close range with the tack light can

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.900 
at close range with the tack light can
really<00:02:28.800> drill<00:02:29.070> people<00:02:29.460> I<00:02:29.550> don't<00:02:29.790> normally

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
really drill people I don't normally

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.610 
really drill people I don't normally
recommend<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.600> tack<00:02:30.780> light<00:02:30.990> but<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.530> this

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
recommend the tack light but in this

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.320 
recommend the tack light but in this
situation<00:02:31.770> I<00:02:32.310> think<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.700> actually<00:02:32.820> kind<00:02:33.240> of

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
situation I think it actually kind of

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.750 
situation I think it actually kind of
works<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.900> use<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.380> particular<00:02:34.650> load<00:02:35.310> out<00:02:35.520> in

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
works I use this particular load out in

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.880 
works I use this particular load out in
two<00:02:35.970> different<00:02:36.180> modes<00:02:36.390> TDM<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.320> rush<00:02:37.590> it

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
two different modes TDM and rush it

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.190 
two different modes TDM and rush it
worked<00:02:38.430> well<00:02:38.880> pretty<00:02:39.210> much<00:02:39.420> for<00:02:39.690> both<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:40.050> them

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
worked well pretty much for both of them

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.690 
worked well pretty much for both of them
it<00:02:40.440> worked<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.890> little<00:02:41.010> better<00:02:41.220> for<00:02:41.490> rush

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
it worked a little better for rush

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.640 
it worked a little better for rush
because<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.210> got<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.600> set<00:02:42.810> up<00:02:42.900> my<00:02:42.930> gun<00:02:43.200> fights<00:02:43.470> a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
because I got to set up my gun fights a

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.770 
because I got to set up my gun fights a
little<00:02:43.980> bit<00:02:44.130> easier<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.760> saying<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.300> TDM

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
little bit easier and saying that TDM

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.150 
little bit easier and saying that TDM
you<00:02:45.930> can<00:02:46.050> set<00:02:46.230> up<00:02:46.320> your<00:02:46.350> gun<00:02:46.590> fights<00:02:46.830> as<00:02:46.980> well

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
you can set up your gun fights as well

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.010 
you can set up your gun fights as well
and<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:47.910> what<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:48.270> comes<00:02:48.510> all<00:02:48.690> about

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
and this is what this comes all about

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.110 
and this is what this comes all about
you<00:02:49.440> set<00:02:49.710> up<00:02:49.830> your<00:02:49.860> gun<00:02:50.160> fights<00:02:50.460> at<00:02:50.700> medium<00:02:51.030> a

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
you set up your gun fights at medium a

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.790 
you set up your gun fights at medium a
long<00:02:51.300> range<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.840> will<00:02:52.020> take<00:02:52.230> enemies<00:02:52.620> out

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
long range and will take enemies out

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.070 
long range and will take enemies out
even<00:02:53.490> at<00:02:53.580> close<00:02:53.700> range<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.390> will<00:02:54.570> work<00:02:54.810> pretty

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
even at close range it will work pretty

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.810 
even at close range it will work pretty
well<00:02:55.230> but<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.920> problem<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.310> if<00:02:56.490> someone's

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
well but the problem is if someone's

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.910 
well but the problem is if someone's
using<00:02:56.970> like<00:02:57.240> an<00:02:57.360> AEK<00:02:57.930> or<00:02:58.170> something<00:02:58.770> like<00:02:58.860> a

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
using like an AEK or something like a

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.460 
using like an AEK or something like a
faster<00:02:59.460> firing<00:02:59.640> weapon<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:00.690> will<00:03:00.930> lose<00:03:01.200> most

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
faster firing weapon you will lose most

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.710 
faster firing weapon you will lose most
gunfights<00:03:02.040> this<00:03:02.610> cut<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:02.850> actually<00:03:03.330> really

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
gunfights this cut is actually really

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.690 
gunfights this cut is actually really
good<00:03:04.020> and<00:03:04.200> don't<00:03:04.500> be<00:03:04.680> afraid<00:03:04.710> afraid<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.520> try

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
good and don't be afraid afraid to try

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.370 
good and don't be afraid afraid to try
it<00:03:05.760> because<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.210> is<00:03:06.390> actually<00:03:06.720> pretty<00:03:07.140> decent

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
it because it is actually pretty decent

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.290 
it because it is actually pretty decent
I<00:03:07.740> know<00:03:07.830> plenty<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.400> people<00:03:08.700> who<00:03:08.790> like<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.030> use

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
I know plenty of people who like to use

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.120 
I know plenty of people who like to use
