00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.110
 in the highly competitive small car segment 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.150
 hyundai has to stay competitive 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.950
 i20 missed a facelift 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.110
 the biggest changes were on the 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.550
 Frontpartie made here 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.759
 now a hexagonal grille 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.619
 as a striking brand symbol next to the 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.079
 Fresh optics became the i20 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.329
 designed economical fueled 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:34.520
 became the new diesel engine in hyundai 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.520
 development center in rüsselsheim 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.550
 the small diesel engine here in the hyundai 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:47.610
 i20 has only 1.1 liters of displacement and 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.810
 only three cylinders are called downsizing 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.330
 that in general 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:01:00.030
 this gives the engine an extreme 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:01:00.810
 robust sound but rich 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.580
 Thank you very much 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.710
 However, you expect a bit 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.750
 faster response on the gas 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.900
 lasts a long time until the engine 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.880
 sometimes on tours comes but chic 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.140
 small compact engine whether the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.619
 loading capacity of hyundai probably synonymous so 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:27.930
 compact is the trunk here in 20 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.300
 offers 295 liters of cargo volume in the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.280
 normal configuration if you have this for 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.440
 works and then invites under the roof 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.240
 after all, you get that on 1060 liters 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.369
 is already for a car of this size 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.100
 quite decent value not quite so 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.100
 Neat is the processing here in 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.070
 my eyes that could all here the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.399
 rear wall of the seats and also down here 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.360
 Covering the floor could do it all 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.020
 be a bit higher quality but it 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.020
 fulfills its purpose 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.039
 So let's take a look inside 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.569
 we have a steering wheel we have seats 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.780
 front and back 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.940
 you also sit comfortably the steering wheel 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.830
 feels good 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.630
 the dashboard yes yes that is 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.640
 actually a pity that sees from afar 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.490
 nice but we have somehow here 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.620
 so funny in this car 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.900
 I like the color differences 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.020
 not so good here now is the 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.190
 key and we have a lot of good even 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.060
 that means I just have to hit the start button 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.370
 press and then the little one starts 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.590
 to look at motörchen and we can 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.980
 finally look like the car because 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.980
 moves 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.050
 in 15 7 seconds accelerates the i20 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.280
 from 0 to 100 the top speed 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.140
 is at 158 km h reaches the consumption 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.060
 gives hyundai with 3.2 liters of fuel 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.490
 at 100 kilometers 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.740
 the realistic consumption at normal 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.160
 driving style is more likely to be 4 5 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.200
 liters 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.190
 compared to the competition still 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.190
 an acceptable result 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.530
 it's just me already 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.660
 said the engine needs pretty much 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.940
 long until he gets into mood 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.950
 really agile so off 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.230
 two and a half 2000 revolutions is that 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.140
 then and then it is ok you can 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.459
 of course, from a 55 kilowatt engine 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:38.030
 but not too big jumps expected 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:41.860
 it's enough for this little car 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:45.590
 Actually the circuit is nice 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.510
 relatively short switching paths can be precise 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.680
 you go through the courses six courses 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:56.599
 we have here in the i20 1.1 crd ii 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:59.180
 The steering is good but is 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.040
 not too hard so the steering is already 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.250
 designed to be in the city with it 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.660
 can still park comfortably depending on 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.569
 The jewish still offers equipment 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.209
 more relief when parking in the 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.130
 City is also the optional one 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.530
 rear view camera then the picture here 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.450
 at the top of the mirror you can see 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.910
 simply better than by the 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.590
 rear window how far you still have space 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.590
 to the car behind one 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.030
 I also like that you are here on 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:31.280
 the multifunction steering wheel all things 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.020
 that you need during the ride 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.669
 we have a cruise control we have here 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.500
 I can control the radio from here 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.419
 answer phone calls and again 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.520
 hang up 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.990
 that is very comfortable it 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.939
 everything works automatically their 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.620
 the light automatically 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:47.990
 wiper goes when it rains the 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.819
 automatically if I want that 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.080
 would be in a car a few years ago 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.389
 this class is not at all 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.560
 conceivable 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.740
 luckily they showed them 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.569
 by itself if you are by car 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.090
 a longer time on the road makes it 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.919
 everything is a good figure 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.139
 small shortcoming of the seat there's namely 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.330
 down here a cross brace and the 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.969
 keeps me in the back all the time 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:15.949
 so that sit here reasonably 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:19.099
 uncomfortable conclusion is therefore my conclusion 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:21.409
 to the hyundai i20 he certainly is not 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:24.650
 Rocket with the small 55 kilowatt 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:26.870
 diesel engine and really long 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.560
 I would ride with it too 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.389
 do not want 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.860
 but I do not think that car either 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.169
 built for that is more like that 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.629
 so that I can go to the city or 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.849
 live in a local place to work 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:39.919
 and can do my errands 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:46.180
 The trunk is indeed big enough 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:46.180
 and the car is really successful
