next trap video will be about so first

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.750 
next trap video will be about so first
the<00:00:20.609> cannon<00:00:21.619> get<00:00:23.029> any<00:00:24.029> amount<00:00:24.390> dirt<00:00:25.760> it

the cannon get any amount dirt it
basically<00:00:27.000> all<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.900> need<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.199> do<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.349> what<00:00:29.130> you

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
basically all you need to do is what you

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.610 
basically all you need to do is what you
see<00:00:29.990> so<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.050> make<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> rectangle<00:00:36.320> but<00:00:37.320> if<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
see so you make a rectangle but if you

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.220 
see so you make a rectangle but if you
I'm<00:00:38.070> only<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.520> make<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.870> little<00:00:39.870> weak

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
I'm only going to make a little weak

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.209 
I'm only going to make a little weak
weak<00:00:41.100> one<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.820> demonstrate<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.140> principle<00:00:43.500> of

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
weak one to demonstrate the principle of

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.760 
weak one to demonstrate the principle of
it<00:00:44.520> what<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.420> made<00:00:45.660> if<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.350> watch<00:00:46.530> some<00:00:46.739> of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
it what I have made if you watch some of

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.100 
it what I have made if you watch some of
my<00:00:46.860> other<00:00:46.950> videos<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.850> there<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.360> do<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.690> tutorial

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
my other videos I there I do it tutorial

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.049 
my other videos I there I do it tutorial
on<00:00:49.170> how<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.320> make<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> proper<00:00:50.280> big<00:00:50.730> cannon<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.980> I

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
on how to make a proper big cannon and I

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.979 
on how to make a proper big cannon and I
show<00:00:54.059> me<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.660> my<00:00:54.870> friend<00:00:56.750> playing<00:00:57.750> around

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
show me and my friend playing around

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.930 
show me and my friend playing around
with<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.910> an<00:00:59.910> SMP<00:01:00.210> server<00:01:00.920> or<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.280> his<00:01:02.520> SMB

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
with it on an SMP server or on his SMB

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.030 
with it on an SMP server or on his SMB
server<00:01:04.670> so<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:06.119> do<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:08.240> quite<00:01:09.240> long<00:01:09.479> and

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
server so you do it quite long and

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.340 
server so you do it quite long and
that's<00:01:11.040> probably<00:01:11.220> one<00:01:11.520> too<00:01:11.729> long

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
that's probably one too long

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.760 
that's probably one too long
domina<00:01:14.780> we<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.200> long<00:01:16.229> as<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.530> want

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
domina we can do it as long as you want

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.520 
domina we can do it as long as you want
pretty<00:01:17.520> much<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.750> would<00:01:22.200> have

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
pretty much so this one would have

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.719 
pretty much so this one would have
you'll<00:01:25.530> see<00:01:25.770> it's<00:01:26.220> pretty<00:01:26.640> simple<00:01:27.090> concept

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
you'll see it's pretty simple concept

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.249 
you'll see it's pretty simple concept
that<00:01:29.729> they're<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.659> then<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.899> put<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.110> water

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
that they're so then you put the water

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.480 
that they're so then you put the water
there<00:01:32.390> you<00:01:33.390> cannot<00:01:33.690> put<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.200> blog<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.250> you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
there you cannot put a blog but you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.580 
there you cannot put a blog but you
can't<00:01:35.700> put<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> block<00:01:36.149> of<00:01:36.270> TNT<00:01:36.690> in<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.259> so

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
can't put a block of TNT in there so

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.370 
can't put a block of TNT in there so
next<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.240> your<00:01:39.360> redstone<00:01:39.630> out<00:01:39.899> don't

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
next and get your redstone out don't

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.300 
next and get your redstone out don't
need<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> lot<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.740> redstone<00:01:41.039> for<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:43.619> you

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
need a lot of redstone for this and you

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.350 
need a lot of redstone for this and you
can<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.909> button<00:01:46.670> no<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.819> button<00:01:48.090> there

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
can have the button no the button there

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.590 
can have the button no the button there
if<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.990> wanted<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:50.149> nothing<00:01:51.149> stopping<00:01:51.509> you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
if you wanted to nothing stopping you

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.320 
if you wanted to nothing stopping you
from<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.520> then<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.880> your<00:01:53.909> first

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
from it and then you have your first

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.260 
from it and then you have your first
thing<00:01:54.899> going<00:01:55.860> along<00:01:56.069> this<00:01:56.220> side<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.759> when<00:01:57.149> you

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
thing going along this side and when you

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.649 
thing going along this side and when you
push<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.899> all<00:01:58.020> power<00:01:58.819> the<00:01:59.819> bottom<00:02:00.479> row

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
push that that all power the bottom row

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.160 
push that that all power the bottom row
of<00:02:01.310> TNT<00:02:02.310> then<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.240> also<00:02:03.390> want<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.750> going<00:02:04.259> up<00:02:05.060> so

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
of TNT then you also want it going up so

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
of TNT then you also want it going up so
simultaneously<00:02:07.250> not<00:02:08.869> simultaneously<00:02:10.190> power

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
simultaneously not simultaneously power

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.800 
simultaneously not simultaneously power
the<00:02:11.700> top<00:02:12.120> row<00:02:12.299> also<00:02:12.769> and<00:02:14.269> then<00:02:15.269> you<00:02:15.600> want<00:02:15.750> to

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
the top row also and then you want to

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.080 
the top row also and then you want to
add<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.140> second<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:18.019> too

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.830 

just<00:02:22.090> be<00:02:22.660> awesome<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:24.030> set<00:02:25.030> off<00:02:25.240> your<00:02:25.270> firing

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
just be awesome and set off your firing

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.450 
just be awesome and set off your firing
piece<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.290> TNT<00:02:28.920> meaning<00:02:32.100> your<00:02:33.100> pellet

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
piece of TNT meaning your pellet

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.540 
piece of TNT meaning your pellet
basically<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.180> think<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.690> song<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.110> called

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
basically I think that song is called

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.510 
basically I think that song is called
record<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:37.560> pallet<00:02:38.560> bullet<00:02:39.040> whatever<00:02:39.370> you

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
record that pallet bullet whatever you

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.230 
record that pallet bullet whatever you
want<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.730> call<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.990> then<00:02:41.980> they're<00:02:42.670> used

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
want to call it and then they're used

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.660 
want to call it and then they're used
exactly<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.780> amount<00:02:43.960> of<00:02:44.170> tunity<00:02:44.610> so<00:02:45.610> you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
exactly the amount of tunity so you

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.830 
exactly the amount of tunity so you
would<00:02:46.590> push<00:02:47.590> this<00:02:47.770> button<00:02:48.690> get<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:52.450> make<00:02:52.690> it

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
would push this button get to to make it

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.740 
would push this button get to to make it
live<00:02:53.050> and<00:02:53.550> then<00:02:54.550> about<00:02:54.760> three<00:02:55.060> seconds<00:02:55.540> or

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
live and then about three seconds or

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.080 
live and then about three seconds or
four<00:02:55.960> seconds<00:02:56.380> depending<00:02:56.560> how<00:02:56.920> far<00:02:57.190> you<00:02:57.850> then

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
four seconds depending how far you then

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.110 
four seconds depending how far you then
push<00:02:58.360> that<00:02:58.390> barn<00:02:58.870> which<00:02:59.620> would<00:02:59.860> load<00:03:00.550> that<00:03:00.730> TNT

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
push that barn which would load that TNT

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.550 
push that barn which would load that TNT
and<00:03:01.270> then<00:03:01.360> do<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:02.560> would<00:03:02.680> fire<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.810> there<00:03:05.350> is<00:03:05.530> a

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
and then do it would fire so there is a

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.310 
and then do it would fire so there is a
basic<00:03:06.310> cannon<00:03:06.640> if<00:03:06.820> you<00:03:06.910> want<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.120> see<00:03:07.240> a<00:03:07.320> bigger

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
basic cannon if you want to see a bigger

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.180 
basic cannon if you want to see a bigger
design<00:03:09.270> then<00:03:10.270> look<00:03:10.840> on<00:03:11.020> my<00:03:11.560> channel<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:14.190> next

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
design then look on my channel and next

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.410 
design then look on my channel and next
is<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:16.060> next<00:03:16.900> one<00:03:17.020> is<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.350> suppose<00:03:18.420> you

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
is the next one is I suppose you

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.110 
is the next one is I suppose you
wouldn't<00:03:19.570> guess<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:19.870> all<00:03:20.280> but<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.310> think<00:03:21.970> it's

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
wouldn't guess it all but I think it's

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.180 
wouldn't guess it all but I think it's
more<00:03:22.180> slightly<00:03:22.750> more<00:03:22.870> difficult

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.229 

yeah<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:30.520> next<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:32.170> want<00:03:32.319> to<00:03:32.470> get<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:33.060> bucket<00:03:34.060> of

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
yeah so next you want to get a bucket of

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.160 
yeah so next you want to get a bucket of
lava<00:03:34.420> that's<00:03:34.810> all<00:03:35.020> you<00:03:35.140> need<00:03:35.319> I<00:03:36.420> like<00:03:37.420> for

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
lava that's all you need I like for

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.190 
lava that's all you need I like for
Western<00:03:38.650> will<00:03:39.010> do<00:03:39.160> but<00:03:39.819> you've<00:03:39.970> gotta<00:03:40.239> pick<00:03:41.050> up

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
Western will do but you've gotta pick up

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.790 
Western will do but you've gotta pick up
your<00:03:41.380> lava

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.430 

now<00:03:46.460> it<00:03:46.820> is<00:03:46.850> very<00:03:47.330> your<00:03:47.570> placement<00:03:48.050> is<00:03:48.230> very

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
this dirt is a wooden block and I want

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.810 
this dirt is a wooden block and I want
to<00:04:05.060> set<00:04:05.360> that<00:04:05.600> woodham<00:04:08.470> yeah<00:04:09.470> see<00:04:09.830> since<00:04:10.340> blass

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
to set that woodham yeah see since blass

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.510 
to set that woodham yeah see since blass
so<00:04:11.780> don't<00:04:11.930> want<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.200> actually<00:04:12.380> but<00:04:12.860> let's<00:04:13.400> say

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.910 
so don't want to actually but let's say
that<00:04:13.700> glass<00:04:13.940> it's<00:04:14.330> alden<00:04:14.570> block<00:04:14.960> and<00:04:15.170> i<00:04:15.680> want

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
that glass it's alden block and i want

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.530 
that glass it's alden block and i want
to<00:04:16.040> burn<00:04:16.340> that<00:04:16.549> block<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:19.400> what<00:04:19.580> you<00:04:19.670> do<00:04:19.910> is<00:04:20.150> you

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
to burn that block so what you do is you

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.510 
to burn that block so what you do is you
have<00:04:20.840> your<00:04:22.780> decoy<00:04:23.780> door<00:04:24.530> button<00:04:25.300> or<00:04:26.300> whatever

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
have your decoy door button or whatever

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.700 
have your decoy door button or whatever
here<00:04:29.590> like<00:04:30.590> so<00:04:31.340> if<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:31.520> get<00:04:31.670> some<00:04:31.790> like<00:04:32.000> I'm

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
here like so if I get some like I'm

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.320 
here like so if I get some like I'm
rendering<00:04:33.730> something<00:04:34.730> on<00:04:35.300> doing<00:04:35.990> something

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
rendering something on doing something

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.570 
rendering something on doing something
yeah<00:04:38.830> transferring<00:04:39.830> some<00:04:39.950> files<00:04:40.010> and<00:04:40.490> all

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
yeah transferring some files and all

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.279 
yeah transferring some files and all
that<00:04:40.760> good<00:04:41.030> stuff

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.679 

so<00:04:43.979> I<00:04:44.249> hope<00:04:44.399> that<00:04:44.460> doesn't<00:04:44.729> catch<00:04:44.999> fire<00:04:45.029> in

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:45.689 
so I hope that doesn't catch fire in

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:48.709 
so I hope that doesn't catch fire in
fact<00:04:45.899> it<00:04:46.050> mine<00:04:46.289> or<00:04:46.319> something<00:04:46.800> I<00:04:47.569> love<00:04:48.569> using

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:48.719 
fact it mine or something I love using

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:52.389 
fact it mine or something I love using
gold<00:04:49.050> tools<00:04:49.289> that's<00:04:49.559> so<00:04:50.009> fast<00:04:50.610> it's<00:04:51.050> awesome

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:52.399 
gold tools that's so fast it's awesome

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:55.339 
gold tools that's so fast it's awesome
just<00:04:53.399> tip<00:04:53.939> man<00:04:54.509> i<00:04:54.539> need<00:04:54.719> to<00:04:54.899> take<00:04:55.050> those<00:04:55.139> two

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
just tip man i need to take those two

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:56.359 
just tip man i need to take those two
things<00:04:55.529> off<00:04:55.710> my<00:04:55.800> whole<00:04:56.039> pie<00:04:56.189> that<00:04:56.309> is

00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:56.369 
things off my whole pie that is

00:04:56.369 --> 00:05:04.879 
things off my whole pie that is
dangerous<00:05:00.559> dum-dum<00:05:01.559> ok<00:05:02.749> so<00:05:03.749> now<00:05:03.990> currently<00:05:04.589> if

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
dangerous dum-dum ok so now currently if

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.129 
dangerous dum-dum ok so now currently if
you<00:05:05.930> place<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.110> lava<00:05:08.210> you<00:05:09.210> have<00:05:09.419> no<00:05:09.930> control

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
you place the lava you have no control

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.230 
you place the lava you have no control
over<00:05:10.349> where<00:05:10.830> it<00:05:10.860> will<00:05:11.069> go<00:05:11.099> and<00:05:11.520> it<00:05:11.639> could<00:05:11.789> L

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
over where it will go and it could L

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.719 
over where it will go and it could L
probably<00:05:12.689> it<00:05:13.169> may<00:05:13.379> even<00:05:13.409> split<00:05:14.009> into<00:05:14.249> both<00:05:14.550> of

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
probably it may even split into both of

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:20.510 
probably it may even split into both of
them<00:05:15.529> yeah<00:05:17.330> so<00:05:18.330> to<00:05:18.389> gain<00:05:18.899> this<00:05:19.110> control<00:05:19.619> you

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
them yeah so to gain this control you

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.359 
them yeah so to gain this control you
want<00:05:20.729> to<00:05:20.879> make<00:05:21.149> a<00:05:21.209> canal<00:05:21.659> going<00:05:21.839> off<00:05:22.369> any

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:23.369 
want to make a canal going off any

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:24.889 
want to make a canal going off any
direction<00:05:23.759> it<00:05:24.209> could<00:05:24.360> also<00:05:24.479> be<00:05:24.599> in<00:05:24.779> that

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:24.899 
direction it could also be in that

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:27.439 
direction it could also be in that
direction<00:05:25.199> so<00:05:26.069> you<00:05:26.129> want<00:05:26.309> to<00:05:26.369> make<00:05:26.430> it<00:05:26.669> three

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
direction so you want to make it three

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.159 
direction so you want to make it three
or<00:05:27.689> four<00:05:28.080> long<00:05:28.759> preferably<00:05:29.759> three<00:05:30.029> and<00:05:30.270> then

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
or four long preferably three and then

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.649 
or four long preferably three and then
dig<00:05:31.439> down<00:05:31.709> this<00:05:32.399> is<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:32.669> club<00:05:32.819> of<00:05:32.999> it<00:05:33.119> or<00:05:33.270> this

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
dig down this is the club of it or this

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:37.670 
dig down this is the club of it or this
is<00:05:33.779> the<00:05:33.949> dodgy<00:05:34.949> physics<00:05:35.909> bit<00:05:36.089> dig<00:05:36.749> down<00:05:36.959> one

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
is the dodgy physics bit dig down one

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.899 
is the dodgy physics bit dig down one
and<00:05:40.279> block<00:05:41.279> out<00:05:41.399> any<00:05:41.639> other<00:05:41.909> hole<00:05:42.240> spur<00:05:43.199> then

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
and block out any other hole spur then

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:49.250 
and block out any other hole spur then
if<00:05:44.990> the<00:05:45.990> lava<00:05:46.289> should<00:05:46.619> flow<00:05:47.009> towards<00:05:47.430> her

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
if the lava should flow towards her

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.730 
if the lava should flow towards her
and<00:05:49.460> now<00:05:50.460> you<00:05:50.520> officially<00:05:51.090> have<00:05:51.740> controlled

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
and now you officially have controlled

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.570 
and now you officially have controlled
lover<00:05:53.690> so<00:05:54.690> next<00:05:55.050> one<00:05:55.290> I<00:05:55.320> implement<00:05:55.950> I<00:05:56.070> think

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
lover so next one I implement I think

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.340
