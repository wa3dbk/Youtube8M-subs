00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.429
 in November of 1967 the return of tandil 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.570
 it was the race that torino and hares 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.670
 showed that they were unbeatable in 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.310
 any scenario with the triumph of 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.010
 coppello and the arrival of 4 torinos in the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.910
 first places forced the etc to 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.949
 take action with a view to 1968 the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.340
 auto world magazine of November 14 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.880
 of 67 published a note written to see 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.219
 the glass called the vigorous tc of today and 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.649
 the morning the note raised the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.730
 need to make changes and to start 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.980
 of the note said 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.870
 ce act in the meetings continue 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.270
 to deal with the modifications to the current 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.000
 regulation of the category but to 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.040
 pilots who are at the same time leaders 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.500
 it's hard to agree and it's natural 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.360
 because the problem is very thorny full 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.670
 of edges and also includes the 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.460
 interests of each one being a leader and 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.010
 pilot at the same time has its implications and 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.720
 propose or throw a decision that will go on 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.580
 against your own interests 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.440
 it's a question to think about a lot 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.869
 in one of the last meetings 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.210
 carried out, a principle of 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.700
 agreement to authorize everyone to run 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.860
 those cars that are in the process of 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.229
 manufacture until December 31 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.360
 next and who wants to start 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.800
 build it after that date would have 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.170
 to adjust to the original measurements 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.240
 factory with the modifications of the 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.310
 trunk and tail but not all 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.619
 pilots agree with this theory 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.840
 Eduardo home is one of them and if I 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.570
 I want to become a car next year 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.100
 I can not if it has to be standard I choose 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.800
 the torino that is the one that has the best 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.140
 helmet I put a ford engine and ready 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.270
 but then the factory would not support me 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.979
 nor the commission of concessionaires 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.170
 I do not agree and who can 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.329
 denying him the reason can not be 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.670
 curtail the freedom to get a car 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.740
 as one wants if it has to be of 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.200
 series I make an occupy 38 that is 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.420
 short or with a coupe as is the estuary 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.490
 itself but you think we can go back 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.069
 to run with a 30-year coupe 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.920
 antiquity josé froilán gonzález does not believe 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.539
 that is the solution but what is the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.730
 problem is still serious what 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.310
 fundamental for the authorities of the htc 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.349
 is to eliminate the rare monstrosities those 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.510
 cars that appeared in the quiet 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.209
 panorama of the tc and they were named 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.130
 very light and shaped prototypes 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.980
 weird and they grab you in road courses 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.780
 and they give you a piece of paper, that's why the 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.030
 final solution will be given by 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.799
 scenarios where you run but neither 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.319
 we can continue as we go because there 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:38.620
 there is a car of 1800 kilos in the world 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.349
 that you walk at 240 kilometers per hour and that 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.079
 is an Argentine test with the minimum weight 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:47.230
 of 1,200 75 kilos in running order 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.840
 we will be in the weight quoted and that you eat 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.819
 and what brakes will serve seems it showed already 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.140
 is happening some of that we run 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.510
 during a whole morning 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.580
 220 kilometers per hour on average with 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.410
 more than a ton and a half of weight and 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.050
 on roads paved with potholes 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.690
 cuts and the impressive wells 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.090
 tire breaks are commonplace and 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.430
 riding without brakes is possible that 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.440
 no tire known in the world 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.200
 whole can withstand a requirement 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.930
 similar does not exist from the land of 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.790
 asphalt and from asphalt to gravel all in 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.390
 the same career and without taking into account 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.310
 if it rains and with 1800 kilos to 240 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.470
 kilometers per hour and tires and 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.290
 brakes are essential factors of 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.940
 sure how all this will end 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.459
 oil is believed that with series cars 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.489
 but if you run with serial cars it 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.320
 will benefit a single torino brand because 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.570
 it is the best helmet and because of agreement 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.180
 with the results also for now it's 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.860
 the best engine at least the one 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.930
 gives better results 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.080
 then run to everyone with 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.480
 torino can not be edge or believes that the 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.730
 category gt a is very cute and modern 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.579
 but I think it will serve to run 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.620
 only in the road courses in the 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.050
 roads will be needed in the cars that 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.450
 they have 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:06.140
 but with minimum weights to make them more 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.800
 insurance but that minimum weight will end 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.050
 for making them safer or more insecure 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.870
 that's another question add edged I think 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.840
 that we need two categories one the 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.640
 current ats and the other the gta but the test 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.950
 current is the litigation is a litigation 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.750
 caused by the pilots themselves and if 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.240
 let cars run under construction 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.470
 there will be a lot of pilots that will be 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.390
 in notorious disadvantage 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.570
 carmelo galbato will be a beneficiary 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.190
 because your new tc is very good and between 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.160
 That car and the carlos menditeguy 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.500
 there is a big difference but you can 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.780
 prevent the twenty cars from running 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.200
 which are currently under construction 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.570
 neither does the controversy continue and will continue 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.700
 for a while longer the solution is not 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.620
 simple and it is not in sight the 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.780
 There are many factors in conflict and 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.090
 interests also nobody runs for 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.460
 have fun like before winning is 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.890
 essential the only thing that the 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.050
 definitive change without further problems 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.640
 the least in the technical aspect would be the 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.930
 obligation to run in a scenario 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.330
 determined 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.789
 all the paved little circuits 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.820
 then you should do the car 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.530
 indicated for that if we keep doing it 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.229
 on roads of any type 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.600
 the problem will remain and then yes 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.940
 you will have to have two cars one for 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.470
 road and another for auto loins and 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.600
 how many can have two cars 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.030
 most race can hardly keep 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.949
 one and the ideal formula to be able to run 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.100
 on the road and on the road course but 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:36.470
 that is to go back to the beginning so we are and 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.360
 so we keep on that why the 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.669
 extraordinary assembly because no 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.150
 yet we know what the solution or 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:47.410
 how to get to it prototypes of cars 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.940
 series gta iv time passes and passes 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.580
 this was the beginning of the end of a 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.800
 stage the arrival of special cars and 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.349
 the speed achieved by these 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.419
 increasingly difficult to carry out a 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:01.639
 category that the development exceeded 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:05.000
 broadly the managerial capacity 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:07.849
 to be able to stop this train that took 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.710
 no doubt at the end of that 13 4 liters 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:11.710
 with its 30 years of history
