00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:11.860
 Hey, people, it's good, you guys are more 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:16.570
 a doubt plus a video and this time the 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:21.430
 Doubt is Obine Double Obine Simple is 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:24.550
 any difference between them is having me 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.769
 call Kalal he sent for me in hati 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.070
 zap he ordered to leave by any 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:33.670
 difference in double coil form 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:38.440
 simple female only questions is simple 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:42.219
 understands says to understand, but it is 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.680
 complex to go to explain in em 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.649
 formulas and everything else then making a 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.350
 The simplest way for you to get 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:54.000
 understand any difference new journey 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:57.129
 simple dual juvenile promphan 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.500
 this is fully connected to impedance 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.199
 this is fully connected one thing 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.300
 connected to the other 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:09.100
 double the advantage by touching the 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:12.280
 double coils were not watts not one is 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.860
 stronger is weaker this is myth is 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.760
 she has an advantage plus a way 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:22.390
 simple because if you catch the Flemish 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.210
 double oblation it has evident two 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.260
 coils have obina each side of the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:32.620
 talking on each side is a reel is cable 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.930
 for example and he has four men each 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.180
 coil 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.500
 if I take the positive from a coil and the 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.620
 positive of the other 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.450
 amend if i pick up negative matches 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.550
 negative in the other amendment I'm going to have 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.540
 two brigade attached as if it were a 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.570
 huh 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.730
 but if that is if that side was 4 11 the other 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.920
 side or four names I joining in 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.710
 parallel is not positive with positive 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:08.379
 The negative is the negative and 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:10.990
 in two men of 21 and beauty is only that 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.400
 the speaker either 4 + 4 double coil 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.189
 I can make calls 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.299
 the miner too then I get positive 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:20.920
 obine the negative of the other and 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:24.430
 automatically will remain positive and 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.829
 negative is not to transform into a source 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:32.650
 of 4 plus four in eight years 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:36.549
 so I get I have an advantage to 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.150
 more than two men if nothing of four 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.760
 men 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.840
 coil of two men if it does not 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.870
 how to change can only, for example, 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.690
 that plays to max ms 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.989
 there is to make the machine has the power 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:02.889
 amplifiers 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:03:05.650
 the guys are good they really are very 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:09.400
 good to have fought a lot here focus is on 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.230
 more hot sun full power cause I go 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.650
 put the institution that the colo colo 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.400
 line them down here 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.859
 the applicator has 1,000 watts rms and I 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.190
 even I want the bully a thousand watts rms 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:26.260
 Legal thousand speaker also a partner to 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.639
 power of your amplifier has 1,000 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.560
 watts and touches two men to the speaker 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.560
 he has to have 1,000 watts and touch 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.169
 two lots 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.629
 about fasteners tok hun names and 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:42.099
 Only power I told everyone just 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.340
 Tell us, you have to play, too. 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:48.250
 man but you will hardly find a 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.069
 subwoofer has a man but you think 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.599
 a lot of dodÃ´ subwoofer that has two 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.329
 coils of two men 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.989
 if you join two coils of two 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.090
 men 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.370
 You do them if you turn our 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.519
 two girls and a girl of 11 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.549
 understood then this is it, people 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:09.040
 simpler to try to make you 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.530
 understand doubt always illuminates the double 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.079
 difference advantage of the double cab has 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.579
 over the hand about beauty moves 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.349
 Big hug and until the next 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.320
 video there share our videos 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:23.050
 our channel lease our channel 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.500
 cars down and making way 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.230
 Good luck there do not sign up 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.660
 leave the application and also and we 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.370
 ours and shares our books 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.470
 So what are we doing? 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.730
 more and more personal beauty a great 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.730
 hug until the next video
