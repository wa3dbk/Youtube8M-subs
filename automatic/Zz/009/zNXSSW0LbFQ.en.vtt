00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.709 
because I can you have to use the
controller<00:00:34.660> to<00:00:34.810> do<00:00:34.930> this<00:00:35.079> so<00:00:36.180> let's<00:00:37.180> get<00:00:37.329> let's

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
controller to do this so let's get let's

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:43.830 
controller to do this so let's get let's
begin<00:00:40.679> all<00:00:41.679> right<00:00:41.940> make<00:00:42.940> sure<00:00:42.969> your<00:00:43.269> sensor<00:00:43.660> is

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
begin all right make sure your sensor is

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.189 
begin all right make sure your sensor is
2<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:44.379> 6<00:00:44.649> feet<00:00:44.859> from<00:00:45.399> the<00:00:45.550> floor<00:00:45.850> so<00:00:46.210> you're

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
2 to 6 feet from the floor so you're

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.020 
2 to 6 feet from the floor so you're
going<00:00:47.350> to<00:00:47.500> have<00:00:47.620> to<00:00:47.769> allocate<00:00:48.370> that<00:00:48.399> amount<00:00:48.969> of

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
going to have to allocate that amount of

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.509 
going to have to allocate that amount of
space<00:00:49.210> for<00:00:49.480> it<00:00:49.600> centered<00:00:50.410> above<00:00:51.010> or<00:00:51.339> below

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
space for it centered above or below

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.009 
space for it centered above or below
your<00:00:51.789> TV<00:00:52.120> so<00:00:52.390> you're<00:00:52.480> gonna<00:00:52.600> want<00:00:52.809> to<00:00:52.839> in<00:00:52.929> the

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
your TV so you're gonna want to in the

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.009 
your TV so you're gonna want to in the
center<00:00:53.289> right<00:00:53.829> now<00:00:54.070> my<00:00:54.999> Xbox<00:00:55.420> is<00:00:55.570> currently<00:00:55.870> in

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
center right now my Xbox is currently in

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:57.299 
center right now my Xbox is currently in
the<00:00:56.050> way<00:00:56.260> so<00:00:56.320> it's<00:00:56.769> not<00:00:56.829> going<00:00:57.100> to<00:00:57.219> be

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
the way so it's not going to be

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:58.799 
the way so it's not going to be
perfectly<00:00:57.670> centered<00:00:57.879> but<00:00:58.210> we'll<00:00:58.570> work<00:00:58.690> around

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
perfectly centered but we'll work around

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.049 
perfectly centered but we'll work around
that<00:00:59.140> laser<00:00:59.320> and<00:00:59.710> place<00:01:00.609> them<00:01:00.789> a<00:01:00.850> stable

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
that laser and place them a stable

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.819 
that laser and place them a stable
surface<00:01:01.359> so<00:01:01.659> if<00:01:01.719> you<00:01:01.809> have<00:01:01.989> a<00:01:02.019> Samsung<00:01:02.379> like

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
surface so if you have a Samsung like

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:03.869 
surface so if you have a Samsung like
this<00:01:03.039> and<00:01:03.280> it's<00:01:03.370> rounded<00:01:03.670> at<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.820> top

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
this and it's rounded at the top

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.580 
this and it's rounded at the top
probably<00:01:04.390> use<00:01:04.930> that<00:01:04.960> you're<00:01:05.199> gonna<00:01:05.320> blow<00:01:05.470> on

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
probably use that you're gonna blow on

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.870 
probably use that you're gonna blow on
the<00:01:05.680> table<00:01:06.070> or<00:01:07.320> somehow<00:01:08.320> a<00:01:08.770> shelf<00:01:09.160> maybe<00:01:09.430> late

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
do a little fiddling around with that to

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.360 
do a little fiddling around with that to

make sure that's what you know have that
set<00:03:03.610> up<00:03:03.730> at<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:03.940> moment<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.420> then<00:03:04.660> to

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
set up at the moment and then to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.660 
set up at the moment and then to
calibrate<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.800> then<00:03:05.920> once<00:03:06.400> you've<00:03:06.519> done<00:03:06.610> all

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
calibrate and then once you've done all

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.210 
calibrate and then once you've done all
that<00:03:06.790> for<00:03:06.970> an<00:03:07.269> ask<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.570> to<00:03:07.660> calibrate<00:03:07.959> it

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
that for an ask you to calibrate it

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.440 
that for an ask you to calibrate it
again<00:03:09.220> so<00:03:09.489> we're<00:03:09.760> gonna<00:03:09.850> calibrate<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.329> right

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
again so we're gonna calibrate it right

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.280 
again so we're gonna calibrate it right
now<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:13.150> it's<00:03:13.450> going<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:13.930> take<00:03:14.079> about<00:03:14.200> a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
now and it's going to take about a

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.140 
now and it's going to take about a
minute<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:14.799> hear<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.370> calibration<00:03:15.850> sounds

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
minute you hear the calibration sounds

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.930 
minute you hear the calibration sounds
twice<00:03:16.440> these<00:03:17.440> quiet<00:03:17.650> as<00:03:17.739> possible<00:03:17.799> to<00:03:18.370> notify

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
twice these quiet as possible to notify

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:26.430 
twice these quiet as possible to notify
to<00:03:19.000> sweep<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.850> back<00:03:25.000> out<00:03:25.209> of<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.440> calibrate

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
to sweep the back out of that calibrate

00:03:26.440 --> 00:04:37.159 
to sweep the back out of that calibrate
it<00:03:26.530> once<00:03:26.680> more<00:03:26.860> while<00:03:27.579> I'm<00:03:27.700> being<00:03:27.880> quiet

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.159 

all<00:04:37.680> right<00:04:37.819> so<00:04:38.819> I<00:04:38.849> took<00:04:38.969> a<00:04:39.150> little<00:04:39.599> bit<00:04:39.930> long

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
all right so I took a little bit long

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.279 
all right so I took a little bit long
but<00:04:40.849> you<00:04:41.849> know<00:04:41.879> hopefully<00:04:42.419> you<00:04:42.930> have<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.169> do

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
but you know hopefully you have to do

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.830 
but you know hopefully you have to do
that<00:04:43.409> again<00:04:43.610> unless<00:04:44.610> you<00:04:44.819> change<00:04:45.120> your<00:04:45.300> sound

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
that again unless you change your sound

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.909 
that again unless you change your sound
setup<00:04:46.439> so<00:04:47.840> your<00:04:48.840> calibration<00:04:49.199> is<00:04:49.439> complete<00:04:49.770> if

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
setup so your calibration is complete if

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.350 
setup so your calibration is complete if
you<00:04:49.979> try<00:04:50.129> to<00:04:50.189> finish<00:04:50.550> you<00:04:50.729> turn<00:04:50.969> up<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.210> volume

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
you try to finish you turn up the volume

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.959 
you try to finish you turn up the volume
you<00:04:51.840> can<00:04:51.960> turn<00:04:52.080> it<00:04:52.229> back<00:04:52.259> down<00:04:52.819> we're<00:04:53.819> not

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
you can turn it back down we're not

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.179 
you can turn it back down we're not
gonna<00:04:54.060> do<00:04:54.240> that<00:04:54.270> so<00:04:55.080> tonight<00:04:55.830> there's<00:04:56.009> a

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:56.189 
gonna do that so tonight there's a

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:58.399 
gonna do that so tonight there's a
built-in<00:04:56.610> microphone<00:04:56.849> for<00:04:57.419> chat<00:04:57.719> parties<00:04:58.199> you

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.679 
and also gives you the option to do it
off<00:05:03.330> so<00:05:03.779> and<00:05:04.379> your<00:05:05.219> Kinect<00:05:05.699> should<00:05:06.120> be<00:05:06.330> set<00:05:06.569> up

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:06.689 
off so and your Kinect should be set up

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.920 
off so and your Kinect should be set up
now<00:05:07.699> we're<00:05:08.699> gonna<00:05:08.819> see<00:05:09.090> how<00:05:09.180> this<00:05:09.330> works<00:05:09.599> and

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
now we're gonna see how this works and

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.779 
now we're gonna see how this works and
say<00:05:10.050> setting<00:05:10.409> up<00:05:10.529> connect<00:05:11.069> up<00:05:11.279> we're<00:05:11.430> not<00:05:11.460> done

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
say setting up connect up we're not done

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.600 
say setting up connect up we're not done
yet<00:05:11.819> folks<00:05:12.360> Oh

waiver<00:05:40.919> the<00:05:41.129> Kinect's<00:05:41.550> I<00:05:41.669> did<00:05:41.849> that<00:05:42.060> it's<00:05:42.210> good

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
waiver the Kinect's I did that it's good

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.740

can choose to go back I want I can

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:08.230 
can choose to go back I want I can
choose<00:06:04.620> to<00:06:04.770> continue<00:06:04.979> i'm<00:06:05.669> going<00:06:05.699> to<00:06:05.879> continue

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.179 

there's<00:06:09.240> my<00:06:09.839> guy<00:06:10.080> wearing<00:06:10.409> our<00:06:10.680> super<00:06:11.039> meat

so<00:06:14.939> that's<00:06:15.419> all<00:06:15.719> the<00:06:15.870> time<00:06:16.080> for<00:06:16.409> us<00:06:16.500> to<00:06:16.589> do<00:06:16.710> is

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
so that's all the time for us to do is

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.899 
so that's all the time for us to do is
to<00:06:16.979> continue<00:06:17.389> and<00:06:18.389> be<00:06:18.509> done<00:06:18.689> and<00:06:19.669> that<00:06:20.669> is<00:06:20.819> how

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:20.909 
to continue and be done and that is how

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:22.760 
to continue and be done and that is how
you<00:06:20.969> set<00:06:21.180> up<00:06:21.210> your<00:06:21.330> Microsoft<00:06:21.870> Kinect<00:06:22.169> all

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
you set up your Microsoft Kinect all

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.769 
you set up your Microsoft Kinect all
right<00:06:22.979> we<00:06:23.610> have<00:06:23.729> gone<00:06:23.939> through<00:06:23.969> the<00:06:24.300> Kinect

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:24.779 
right we have gone through the Kinect

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:26.929 
right we have gone through the Kinect
calibration<00:06:25.409> for<00:06:25.589> speech<00:06:26.099> recognition<00:06:26.490> twice

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:26.939 
calibration for speech recognition twice

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:29.629 
calibration for speech recognition twice
as<00:06:27.180> is<00:06:27.360> our<00:06:27.509> second<00:06:27.839> run<00:06:28.219> it's<00:06:29.219> giving<00:06:29.430> us<00:06:29.550> an

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
as is our second run it's giving us an

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.519 
as is our second run it's giving us an
option<00:06:30.060> to<00:06:30.300> do<00:06:30.479> that<00:06:31.020> we<00:06:31.110> didn't<00:06:31.289> get<00:06:31.379> last

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:31.529 
option to do that we didn't get last

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:33.529 
option to do that we didn't get last
time<00:06:31.680> which<00:06:31.979> is<00:06:32.129> then<00:06:32.490> the<00:06:32.849> Kinect<00:06:33.120> trying<00:06:33.419> to

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 
time which is then the Kinect trying to

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:35.659 
time which is then the Kinect trying to
hear<00:06:33.719> me<00:06:33.899> speak<00:06:34.229> so<00:06:34.770> I<00:06:34.800> did<00:06:35.069> not<00:06:35.189> do<00:06:35.339> that<00:06:35.520> last

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:35.669 
hear me speak so I did not do that last

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.719 
hear me speak so I did not do that last
time<00:06:35.990> swing<00:06:36.990> it<00:06:37.110> this<00:06:37.199> time<00:06:37.469> don't<00:06:38.399> know<00:06:38.580> what

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
time swing it this time don't know what

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.379 
time swing it this time don't know what
happened<00:06:39.270> there<00:06:39.710> I'm<00:06:40.710> gonna<00:06:40.830> test<00:06:41.069> it<00:06:41.129> out
