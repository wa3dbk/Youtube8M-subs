 Ministry of Defense or other security agencies 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.810
 but back to the civilian sector and 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.639
 especially where in our opinion the Finns 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.320
 budget problems can be solved with 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.150
 using not only money and not even 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.190
 so much money from common sense 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.619
 what to tell one story from my 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.930
 journalistic notebook being somehow 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.910
 back in 90 in the Arctic, I noticed 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.519
 what a huge amount there 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.099
 moored ships under the Russian flag in 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.230
 Norway and fish unloads repaired 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.539
 here is literally a few hours ode 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.759
 native Murmansk especially struck me 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.980
 the story of the captain 1 fresh painted 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.140
 trawler he told me that he was 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.120
 hate that the fate of cadillac is untidy and 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.680
 he decided to paint the rusted boards 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.510
 did but this when entering norway but 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.030
 when I tried to go to Murmansk 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.450
 customs officers wanted to take a tax on him 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.890
 the cost of paint they say it is import but also here 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.629
 no blessing without good fish now from 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.370
 Norway came under anti-sanctions 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.020
 and to the Russian trawler and 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.399
 unloaded in Russia federal 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.649
 government promise already this year 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.710
 finally solve the problem bottoms one of them 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.539
 the courts about what it all promises benefits and 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.210
 what is this sudan western 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.600
 Our staff correspondent Murmansk Dmitri stro my 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.910

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.630
 my folk fish came to the north 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.790
 always loved for cheap and extraordinary 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.070
 pleasant taste that looks like fresh 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.780
 cucumber even more than smelt in 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.520
 difference from no less popular cod 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.010
 which is caught throughout the year 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.000
 my can only be caught at the end of winter 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.130
 early spring 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.620
 so the residents of Murmansk have already managed 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:38.320
 to miss your favorite delicacy dish 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:42.550
 make her bake her with the metro not 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.960
 mayonnaise with onions taste like that from childhood 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.810
 our parents did it well, that's more accurate 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.790

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.010
 you are much less than it could be and that 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.140
 neighboring norway in norway which year 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.270
 there are dozens of Russian ships which 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.500
 way home ordered in the role of their 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.300
 among strangers turned out 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.670

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.160
 mechanic sergey agapov registration 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.080
 Russian but built it in indonesia 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.540
 what in the mess-rooms remind 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.260
 An exotic picture is your first 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.630
 flight to my 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.720
 he is preparing to leave Norwegian 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.030
 kirkenes addressed on all levels i am all 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.370
 still hoping for common sense but too 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.989
 slowly and here is new here and here we are already 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.269
 Soon we go fishing and probably 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.209
 after my you somewhere here again find myself 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:39.019
 Alas, I honestly very sorry what's the matter 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.910
 Now the answer in Russia on the route 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.220
 Murmansk activity Murmansk daily 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.660
 ply some buses almost on 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.580
 every flight you oblige 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.350
 meet Russian fishermen alone 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.750
 leave for work on the Russian 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.240
 to sudan in norway others return to 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.400
 homeland after labor watch at sea before 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.230
 Russian companies change their topic almost 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.100
 crews on the market because very 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.320
 much more expensive to drive the ship 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.390
 to change the crew of Murmansk to the port 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.430
 Murmansk and today attributed to about 300 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.740
 ships and a third of them are not western 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.900
 as the fishermen themselves called others 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.270
 in words they are built modernized 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.670
 either repaired outside of Russia 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.100
 and for this reason hit the tax 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.870
 nets for fish unloading in Murmansk 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.120
 owners of such trawlers will have to 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.180
 pay 5 percent of customs duty 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.160
 another 18 percent vat is a quarter of 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.110
 the cost of the vessel not to spend 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.600
 millions of dollars are much more profitable 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.100
 unload abroad 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.810
 show new ships with russian 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.720
 flags that have never been on 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.090
 Norwegians admire the motherland one more beautiful 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.100
 other all world-class stuffing 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.450
 reliable automated system 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.520
 work around the clock 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.620
 yes even fish chopping factory right on 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.870
 do you want canned food on board 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.530
 just frost production absolutely 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:59.410
 waste forest yourself from Zaporozhye sit 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:02.230
 mercedes steering obeys great 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.120
 beautiful handling only in Russia 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.760
 from all this beauty is still good 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.710
 It was much less than it could yet 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.110
 Murmansk and shipowners managed to convince 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.330
 regulatory authorities to introduce a special 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.430
 customs regime for at least a month 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.130
 at least one was not a sunset ship 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.440
 less seiner mechanics here for the first time in 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.140
 20 years unloaded on Murmansk raid 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.230
 more than 3000 tons were delivered to shore 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.110
 my fresh you temporarily mode was worth 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:32.500
 company 20 million rubles 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:35.560
 over 20 million rubles if this vessel 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.260
 would come and customs clearance would cost 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.600
 cost over 600 million rubles 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.670
 because of expensive customs clearance economy 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.840
 region loses annually to 5 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.730
 billion rubles 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.560
 of course there are problems worn out 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.210
 port infrastructure and all the same 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.850
 issue of customs checks and more 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.510
 sanitary still remains because they are also 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.500
 Lasts may be weeks since they have 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.260
 Norway according to sailors 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.170
 if in the morning the ship is brought fish in the evening 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.570
