I<00:01:41.909> think<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.600> xbox<00:01:42.930> 360<00:01:43.259> version<00:01:43.350> there's

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
I think on the xbox 360 version there's

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.100 
I think on the xbox 360 version there's
like<00:01:44.040> more<00:01:44.460> invisible<00:01:44.850> walls<00:01:45.329> around<00:01:45.750> more

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
like more invisible walls around more

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.649 
like more invisible walls around more
this<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> weird<00:01:47.509> detection<00:01:48.509> with<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
this is a weird detection with the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.969 
this is a weird detection with the
ladders<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.170> there's<00:01:49.350> more<00:01:49.470> invisible<00:01:49.710> walls

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
ladders and there's more invisible walls

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.190 
ladders and there's more invisible walls
around<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.060> can't<00:01:51.450> really<00:01:51.509> jump<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.079> it

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
around it so you can't really jump on it

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.780 
around it so you can't really jump on it
from<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.380> side<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.860> know<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.759> with

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
from the side I know it's like that with

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.069 
from the side I know it's like that with
the<00:01:53.970> pc<00:01:54.180> version<00:01:54.299> i<00:01:54.570> don't<00:01:54.750> think<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:54.990> not

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
the pc version i don't think it's not

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.289 
the pc version i don't think it's not
bad<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.920> yeah<00:01:56.070> as<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:56.850> see<00:01:57.060> i'm<00:01:57.149> going<00:01:57.180> to

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
bad so yeah as you can see i'm going to

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.910 
bad so yeah as you can see i'm going to
show<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> major<00:01:58.290> previously<00:01:58.710> last

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
show you like a major previously last

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.800 
show you like a major previously last
part<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.250> fail<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.790> then<00:02:00.210> i<00:02:00.329> show<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> route

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
part to fail and then i show the route

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.740 
part to fail and then i show the route
to<00:02:01.189> to<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.399> place<00:02:02.640> because<00:02:03.149> there's<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.540> in

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
to to that place because there's on in

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.480 
to to that place because there's on in
this<00:02:04.170> map<00:02:04.469> there's<00:02:04.740> actually<00:02:05.040> checked<00:02:05.310> poor

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
this map there's actually checked poor

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.889 
this map there's actually checked poor
in<00:02:05.579> size<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:05.939> see<00:02:06.119> before<00:02:06.479> i<00:02:06.509> open<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
in size you can see before i open the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.830 
in size you can see before i open the
door<00:02:07.250> this<00:02:08.250> check<00:02:08.489> put<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:08.789> when<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:08.970> fail<00:02:09.179> you

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
door this check put so when you fail you

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.220 
door this check put so when you fail you
go<00:02:10.050> back<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.319> spawn<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> new

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
go back to spawn a new

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.070 
go back to spawn a new
just<00:02:12.590> you<00:02:12.980> know<00:02:13.099> you<00:02:14.030> export<00:02:14.510> have<00:02:15.050> a

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
just you know you export have a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.690 
just you know you export have a
checkpoint<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.769> then<00:02:15.980> go<00:02:16.280> back<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.459> where<00:02:16.670> you

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
checkpoint and then go back to where you

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.680 
checkpoint and then go back to where you
are<00:02:16.909> it's<00:02:17.480> pretty<00:02:17.870> good<00:02:18.080> may<00:02:18.799> have<00:02:18.920> taken<00:02:19.069> well

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
are it's pretty good may have taken well

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.000 
are it's pretty good may have taken well
actually<00:02:20.690> doesn't<00:02:21.200> take<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.319> long<00:02:21.470> time<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.709> do

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
actually doesn't take a long time to do

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.500 
actually doesn't take a long time to do
this<00:02:22.280> but<00:02:22.670> I'm<00:02:22.970> having<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.629> think<00:02:24.290> of<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.709> map

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
this but I'm having to think of the map

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.479 
this but I'm having to think of the map
again<00:02:26.510> on<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.840> long<00:02:26.989> time<00:02:27.170> but<00:02:27.379> as<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:28.250> as<00:02:28.459> a

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
again on a long time but as you as a

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.300 
again on a long time but as you as a
haze<00:02:28.760> on<00:02:29.000> deck<00:02:29.390> 60<00:02:29.989> version<00:02:30.290> not<00:02:30.709> much<00:02:30.860> can<00:02:31.250> be

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
haze on deck 60 version not much can be

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.640 
haze on deck 60 version not much can be
done<00:02:31.459> right<00:02:32.090> now<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.450> this<00:02:32.599> was<00:02:32.810> done<00:02:33.049> prior

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
done right now and this was done prior

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.460 
done right now and this was done prior
before<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.250> end<00:02:34.459> was<00:02:34.700> added<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.989> edit<00:02:36.200> dragon

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
before the end was added to edit dragon

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.460 
before the end was added to edit dragon
so<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.519> maybe<00:02:38.390> prior<00:02:38.690> before<00:02:39.079> that<00:02:39.260> even

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
so and maybe prior before that even

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.710 
so and maybe prior before that even
before<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:40.099> last<00:02:40.489> two<00:02:40.760> patches<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.299> yeah<00:02:41.480> I

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
before the last two patches so yeah I

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.750 
before the last two patches so yeah I
expect<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.260> guys<00:02:42.409> who<00:02:42.560> made<00:02:42.590> this<00:02:42.739> and<00:02:43.250> yes

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
expect the guys who made this and yes

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.789 
expect the guys who made this and yes
really<00:02:43.970> good<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.690> then<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:45.019> can<00:02:45.170> fact<00:02:45.410> that<00:02:45.620> up

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
really good and then I can fact that up

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.259 
really good and then I can fact that up
to<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.129> bit<00:02:46.370> when<00:02:46.519> i<00:02:46.579> post<00:02:46.819> that<00:02:47.000> stupid

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
at this way they actually made sure that

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.849 
at this way they actually made sure that
the<00:02:55.579> flint<00:02:55.819> and<00:02:55.970> tinder<00:02:56.060> was<00:02:56.599> actually<00:02:57.260> thin

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
the flint and tinder was actually thin

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.190 
the flint and tinder was actually thin
steel<00:02:58.129> into<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.879> the<00:02:59.329> flint<00:02:59.569> and<00:02:59.660> steel<00:02:59.810> was

I'm<00:03:00.829> just<00:03:01.819> right<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:02.599> that<00:03:02.629> you<00:03:02.900> can<00:03:03.049> actually

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
I'm just right so that you can actually

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.860 
I'm just right so that you can actually
burn<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.650> stuff<00:03:03.940> with<00:03:04.940> thank<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.540> can<00:03:05.720> you

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
burn the stuff with thank you can you

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.390 
burn the stuff with thank you can you
burn<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.170> wood<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:06.620> just<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:06.950> case<00:03:07.099> burn

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
burn the wood and just the case burn

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.130 
burn the wood and just the case burn
again<00:03:07.819> just<00:03:08.269> make<00:03:08.299> it<00:03:08.480> go<00:03:08.540> faster<00:03:09.260> um<00:03:09.910> but<00:03:11.140> the

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
again just make it go faster um but the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.199 
again just make it go faster um but the
problem<00:03:12.319> was<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.680> wood<00:03:12.920> wooden<00:03:13.220> burns<00:03:13.489> for

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
problem was the wood wooden burns for

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.750 
problem was the wood wooden burns for
psych<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.660> took<00:03:14.840> time<00:03:15.109> and<00:03:15.170> I<00:03:15.709> just<00:03:16.190> felt<00:03:16.639> that

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
psych it took time and I just felt that

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.640 
psych it took time and I just felt that
okay<00:03:17.209> i'm<00:03:17.419> gonna<00:03:17.599> have<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:17.900> break<00:03:18.019> it<00:03:18.440> with<00:03:18.500> my

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
okay i'm gonna have to break it with my

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.920 
okay i'm gonna have to break it with my
fist<00:03:18.859> because<00:03:19.130> it's<00:03:19.430> taken<00:03:19.790> too<00:03:20.000> long<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.750> I

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
fist because it's taken too long and I

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.479 
fist because it's taken too long and I
couldn't<00:03:21.200> just<00:03:21.260> stay<00:03:21.560> here<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:21.799> watch<00:03:22.010> it<00:03:22.310> so

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
couldn't just stay here and watch it so

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.009 
couldn't just stay here and watch it so
you<00:03:22.609> as<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:22.849> can<00:03:22.970> see<00:03:23.060> false<00:03:23.329> forwarded<00:03:23.720> it's

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
you as you can see false forwarded it's

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.129 
you as you can see false forwarded it's
still<00:03:24.500> long<00:03:24.709> so<00:03:25.519> that's<00:03:26.269> something<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.720> I

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
still long so that's something that I

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.110 
still long so that's something that I
think<00:03:27.620> has<00:03:28.010> been<00:03:28.160> fixed<00:03:28.340> if<00:03:28.549> not<00:03:28.730> then<00:03:29.000> that's

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
think has been fixed if not then that's

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.559 
think has been fixed if not then that's
something<00:03:29.319> the<00:03:30.319> people<00:03:30.440> who<00:03:30.680> made<00:03:30.859> the

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
something the people who made the

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.420 
something the people who made the
version<00:03:32.569> of<00:03:32.630> Minecraft<00:03:33.079> have<00:03:33.889> to<00:03:34.040> fix<00:03:34.190> like

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
version of Minecraft have to fix like

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.220 
version of Minecraft have to fix like
make<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:34.849> fire<00:03:35.060> spread<00:03:35.359> a<00:03:35.389> bit<00:03:35.510> move<00:03:35.690> faster

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
make the fire spread a bit move faster

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.620 
make the fire spread a bit move faster
burn<00:03:36.889> things<00:03:37.099> with<00:03:37.250> more<00:03:37.370> faster<00:03:37.760> like<00:03:38.000> it's

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
burn things with more faster like it's

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.210 
burn things with more faster like it's
just<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:39.019> way<00:03:39.139> fireworks<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.919> think<00:03:40.099> that's

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
just the way fireworks I think that's

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.370 
just the way fireworks I think that's
the<00:03:40.280> way<00:03:40.430> is<00:03:40.609> it<00:03:40.760> on<00:03:40.880> in<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:43.359> pc<00:03:44.359> version<00:03:44.389> but

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
the way is it on in the pc version but

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.620 
the way is it on in the pc version but
like<00:03:45.919> in<00:03:46.340> this<00:03:46.489> version<00:03:46.760> you<00:03:47.000> can<00:03:47.120> turn<00:03:47.299> on<00:03:47.359> and

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
like in this version you can turn on and

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.720 
like in this version you can turn on and
off<00:03:47.720> um<00:03:47.959> but<00:03:48.799> i'm<00:03:48.919> not<00:03:49.040> sure<00:03:49.220> if<00:03:49.280> I<00:03:49.370> wanders<00:03:49.639> off

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
off um but i'm not sure if I wanders off

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.750 
off um but i'm not sure if I wanders off
an<00:03:49.880> initial<00:03:50.359> amazon<00:03:51.079> no<00:03:51.380> I<00:03:51.410> wasn't<00:03:51.799> that<00:03:52.489> I<00:03:52.549> was

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
an initial amazon no I wasn't that I was

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.670 
an initial amazon no I wasn't that I was
off<00:03:52.940> actually<00:03:53.260> that<00:03:54.260> may<00:03:54.440> have<00:03:54.560> been<00:03:54.590> the

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
off actually that may have been the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.909 
off actually that may have been the
reason<00:03:54.970> fire<00:03:55.970> spread<00:03:56.239> may<00:03:56.389> have<00:03:56.510> enough

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
reason fire spread may have enough

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.319 
reason fire spread may have enough
simply<00:03:57.919> because<00:03:58.160> that<00:03:58.340> fire<00:03:58.579> was<00:03:58.790> burning<00:03:59.090> on

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
simply because that fire was burning on

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.420 
simply because that fire was burning on
my<00:03:59.450> block<00:03:59.720> and<00:03:59.930> yeah<00:04:00.739> I<00:04:00.799> don't<00:04:00.950> know<00:04:01.129> I'm<00:04:01.190> doing

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
my block and yeah I don't know I'm doing

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.670 
my block and yeah I don't know I'm doing
it<00:04:01.549> I<00:04:01.669> actually<00:04:01.910> saw<00:04:02.359> the<00:04:02.389> world<00:04:02.810> right<00:04:03.530> when

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
it I actually saw the world right when

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.849 
it I actually saw the world right when
they<00:04:03.769> entered<00:04:03.980> this<00:04:04.099> checkpoint<00:04:04.930> 56<00:04:05.930> now<00:04:06.109> yeah

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
they entered this checkpoint 56 now yeah

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:08.949 
they entered this checkpoint 56 now yeah
I<00:04:06.889> actually<00:04:07.250> saw<00:04:07.639> the<00:04:07.669> world<00:04:08.030> right<00:04:08.269> there<00:04:08.569> so

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
I actually saw the world right there so

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.809 
I actually saw the world right there so
do<00:04:09.079> I<00:04:09.109> just<00:04:09.379> decided<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.220> check<00:04:10.340> out<00:04:10.519> the<00:04:10.609> water

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
do I just decided to check out the water

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.839 
do I just decided to check out the water
stream<00:04:11.090> first<00:04:11.829> be<00:04:12.829> a<00:04:12.859> witness<00:04:13.010> for<00:04:13.129> the<00:04:13.280> dub<00:04:13.489> to

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
stream first be a witness for the dub to

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.339 
stream first be a witness for the dub to
the<00:04:14.030> blocks<00:04:14.359> in<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.569> chest<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:14.870> was<00:04:14.989> like<00:04:15.079> okay

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
the blocks in the chest I was like okay

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.779 
the blocks in the chest I was like okay
it's<00:04:15.530> gonna<00:04:16.190> this<00:04:16.579> is<00:04:16.910> easy<00:04:17.060> just<00:04:18.579> like<00:04:19.579> make

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
it's gonna this is easy just like make

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.039 
it's gonna this is easy just like make
sure<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.030> water<00:04:20.180> just<00:04:20.359> goes<00:04:20.510> over<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.930> logo

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
sure the water just goes over the logo

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.760 
sure the water just goes over the logo
done<00:04:22.390> but<00:04:23.650> like<00:04:24.650> it's

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
done but like it's

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.040 
done but like it's
problem<00:04:26.039> is<00:04:26.160> is<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.819> cost<00:04:27.240> tens<00:04:27.569> it

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
problem is is that the cost tens it

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.400 
problem is is that the cost tens it
tends<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:29.099> get<00:04:29.220> easier<00:04:29.639> like<00:04:30.479> first<00:04:30.870> off<00:04:31.110> first

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
tends to get easier like first off first

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.930 
tends to get easier like first off first
pause<00:04:31.800> was<00:04:31.979> on<00:04:32.069> that<00:04:32.190> you<00:04:32.340> die<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:32.550> can<00:04:32.819> die

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
pause was on that you die you can die

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.640 
pause was on that you die you can die
instantly<00:04:33.539> of<00:04:33.660> this<00:04:33.780> I<00:04:33.960> think<00:04:34.409> they'd<00:04:34.500> rather

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
instantly of this I think they'd rather

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.320 
instantly of this I think they'd rather
have<00:04:34.800> ideas<00:04:35.159> I<00:04:35.370> think<00:04:35.669> they<00:04:35.849> could<00:04:36.120> have<00:04:36.150> done

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
have ideas I think they could have done

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.460 
have ideas I think they could have done
this<00:04:36.360> in<00:04:36.539> the<00:04:36.569> beginning<00:04:36.720> they<00:04:37.050> could<00:04:37.349> have

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
this in the beginning they could have

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.510 
this in the beginning they could have
switch<00:04:37.620> it<00:04:37.740> possible<00:04:38.009> i<00:04:38.039> think<00:04:38.250> they<00:04:38.310> couldn't

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
switch it possible i think they couldn't

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.700 
switch it possible i think they couldn't
be<00:04:38.580> bothered<00:04:38.729> to<00:04:38.849> move<00:04:39.060> it<00:04:39.210> cuz<00:04:40.020> I'm<00:04:40.199> they<00:04:40.560> got

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
be bothered to move it cuz I'm they got

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.670 
be bothered to move it cuz I'm they got
really<00:04:41.069> easier<00:04:41.400> then<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:42.289> what<00:04:43.289> I<00:04:43.319> try<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.500> do

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
really easier then and what I try to do

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.020 
really easier then and what I try to do
by<00:04:43.800> breaking<00:04:44.099> the<00:04:44.159> dirt<00:04:44.310> blocks<00:04:44.550> we<00:04:44.759> just<00:04:44.940> came

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
by breaking the dirt blocks we just came

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.670 
by breaking the dirt blocks we just came
back<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.419> book<00:04:45.629> but<00:04:45.840> I<00:04:46.020> going<00:04:46.349> to<00:04:46.409> be<00:04:46.470> bothered

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
back the book but I going to be bothered

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.080 
back the book but I going to be bothered
to<00:04:46.710> walk<00:04:46.860> back<00:04:47.009> to<00:04:47.159> streamers<00:04:47.520> too<00:04:47.699> long<00:04:47.879> and

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
to walk back to streamers too long and

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.059 
to walk back to streamers too long and
yeah<00:04:48.240> I<00:04:48.449> just<00:04:49.110> wanna<00:04:49.289> check<00:04:49.440> before<00:04:49.770> Alicia

adds to the challenge you can't just go
to<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:59.039> next<00:04:59.220> part<00:04:59.580> like<00:05:00.120> you<00:05:00.630> can't<00:05:00.810> go<00:05:00.900> to

to the next part like you can't go to

the slow method but no I change running
at<00:05:59.430> the<00:05:59.520> end<00:05:59.639> but<00:05:59.789> never<00:06:00.000> worked<00:06:00.210> but<00:06:01.169> this<00:06:01.289> is

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
at the end but never worked but this is

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.070 
at the end but never worked but this is
actually<00:06:01.529> really<00:06:01.740> good<00:06:02.659> it's<00:06:03.659> that<00:06:03.870> file
