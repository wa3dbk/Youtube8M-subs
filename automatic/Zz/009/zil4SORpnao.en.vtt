00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
strider i've ever had but when I started

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.729 
strider i've ever had but when I started
I<00:00:38.350> started<00:00:38.829> filming<00:00:39.280> and<00:00:39.489> got<00:00:39.730> it<00:00:39.880> out<00:00:40.739> kinda

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
I started filming and got it out kinda

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.470 
I started filming and got it out kinda
having<00:00:41.980> to<00:00:42.070> change<00:00:42.280> an<00:00:42.489> opinion<00:00:43.000> a<00:00:43.120> little<00:00:43.360> bit

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
having to change an opinion a little bit

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.350 
having to change an opinion a little bit
on<00:00:43.630> the<00:00:43.840> the<00:00:44.350> PT<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:48.309> my<00:00:48.489> current<00:00:48.820> status<00:00:48.970> is<00:00:49.329> I

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
on the the PT in my current status is I

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.729 
on the the PT in my current status is I
tend<00:00:49.630> to<00:00:49.690> like<00:00:49.840> the<00:00:50.140> Sebenza<00:00:50.910> better<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:55.739> you

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
tend to like the Sebenza better but you

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.530 
tend to like the Sebenza better but you
know<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:56.920> PTL<00:00:57.370> ative<00:00:57.670> to<00:00:57.880> this<00:00:58.059> have<00:00:58.239> been<00:00:58.360> too

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
know the PTL ative to this have been too

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.240 
know the PTL ative to this have been too
small<00:00:59.040> not<00:01:00.040> too<00:01:00.219> bad<00:01:00.430> both<00:01:01.300> of<00:01:01.570> them<00:01:01.780> are

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
small not too bad both of them are

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.880 
small not too bad both of them are
immensely<00:01:03.250> sharp<00:01:03.820> so<00:01:04.299> that<00:01:04.509> that's<00:01:04.899> they're

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
immensely sharp so that that's they're

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.980 
immensely sharp so that that's they're
equally<00:01:06.219> as<00:01:06.369> sharp<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:08.020> one<00:01:08.289> has<00:01:08.950> s30v<00:01:09.990> this

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
equally as sharp this one has s30v this

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.010 
equally as sharp this one has s30v this
one<00:01:11.200> has<00:01:11.639> s35vn<00:01:12.639> so<00:01:12.969> just<00:01:13.179> happens<00:01:13.749> to<00:01:13.810> be<00:01:13.899> a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
one has s35vn so just happens to be a

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.249 
one has s35vn so just happens to be a
slightly<00:01:14.380> newer<00:01:15.240> steel<00:01:16.240> on<00:01:16.479> this<00:01:16.659> Sebenza

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
slightly newer steel on this Sebenza

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.069 
slightly newer steel on this Sebenza
let's<00:01:18.130> flip<00:01:18.459> them<00:01:18.700> over<00:01:20.069> both<00:01:21.069> of<00:01:21.100> them<00:01:21.549> have

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
let's flip them over both of them have

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.429 
let's flip them over both of them have
titanium<00:01:23.079> so<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.590> PT<00:01:24.549> has<00:01:25.109> titanium<00:01:26.109> on<00:01:26.229> this

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
titanium so the PT has titanium on this

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.769 
titanium so the PT has titanium on this
side<00:01:26.649> flamed<00:01:27.069> titanium<00:01:27.639> and<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:31.420> if<00:01:31.539> we're<00:01:31.719> in

00:01:31.769 --> 00:01:31.779 
side flamed titanium and see if we're in

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:36.809 
side flamed titanium and see if we're in
frame<00:01:32.109> here<00:01:34.200> okay<00:01:35.229> and<00:01:35.529> then<00:01:35.770> g10<00:01:36.189> on<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.490> PT

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
frame here okay and then g10 on the PT

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.620 
frame here okay and then g10 on the PT
up<00:01:36.939> top<00:01:37.179> I<00:01:38.700> still<00:01:39.700> happen<00:01:40.090> to<00:01:40.179> like<00:01:40.359> the

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
up top I still happen to like the

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.690 
up top I still happen to like the
Sebenza<00:01:41.079> here<00:01:41.499> in<00:01:41.770> this<00:01:41.950> class<00:01:42.249> of<00:01:42.490> knives

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
Sebenza here in this class of knives

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.899 
Sebenza here in this class of knives
better<00:01:43.289> because<00:01:44.289> it<00:01:44.469> has<00:01:44.529> the<00:01:44.889> longer<00:01:45.310> cutting

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
better because it has the longer cutting

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.529 
better because it has the longer cutting
edge<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.539> and<00:01:46.959> I<00:01:47.529> just<00:01:47.590> find<00:01:48.069> that<00:01:48.329> if<00:01:49.329> you

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
edge and and I just find that if you

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.589 
edge and and I just find that if you
have<00:01:49.659> to<00:01:49.810> have<00:01:49.899> a<00:01:49.959> small<00:01:50.319> knife<00:01:50.529> I<00:01:51.599> still

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:52.599 
have to have a small knife I still

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
have to have a small knife I still
prefer<00:01:52.779> the<00:01:53.520> longer<00:01:54.520> cutting<00:01:54.789> edge<00:01:55.060> you<00:01:55.619> lose

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
prefer the longer cutting edge you lose

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.159 
prefer the longer cutting edge you lose
a<00:01:56.649> little<00:01:56.919> bit<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.240> ergonomics<00:01:58.869> on<00:01:59.020> this

00:01:59.159 --> 00:01:59.169 
a little bit with the ergonomics on this

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:04.559 
a little bit with the ergonomics on this
PT<00:02:02.489> the<00:02:03.489> feel<00:02:03.759> of<00:02:03.789> the<00:02:04.119> knife

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
PT the feel of the knife

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.229 
PT the feel of the knife
I<00:02:04.599> like<00:02:05.529> the<00:02:05.679> titanium<00:02:06.219> on<00:02:06.310> both<00:02:06.520> sides<00:02:06.789> it

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.239 
I like the titanium on both sides it

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:11.940 
I like the titanium on both sides it
makes<00:02:07.419> it<00:02:07.539> feel<00:02:07.689> more<00:02:07.959> solid<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:10.750> just<00:02:11.560> feels

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
makes it feel more solid it just feels

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.180 
makes it feel more solid it just feels
more<00:02:12.100> heavy-duty<00:02:12.700> than<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.150> PT<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:14.710> g10

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
more heavy-duty than the PT the g10

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.690 
more heavy-duty than the PT the g10
makes<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.210> feel

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
makes it feel

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.850 
makes it feel
like<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.730> toy<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.959> I<00:02:20.049> said<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.349> my<00:02:20.469> original

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
like a toy and I said that my original

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.209 
like a toy and I said that my original
video<00:02:21.010> but<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:22.420> build<00:02:22.659> quality<00:02:22.870> on<00:02:23.170> on<00:02:23.620> mine

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:24.219 
video but the build quality on on mine

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:28.910 
video but the build quality on on mine
happens<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.909> be<00:02:25.000> pretty<00:02:25.359> good<00:02:26.519> for<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.640> P<00:02:27.819> team

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
happens to be pretty good for the P team

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.410 
happens to be pretty good for the P team
it's<00:02:29.920> just<00:02:30.040> really<00:02:30.549> small

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
it's just really small

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.740 
it's just really small
I<00:02:32.280> have<00:02:33.280> probably<00:02:33.489> medium<00:02:33.760> sized<00:02:34.150> hands<00:02:34.510> and

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
I have probably medium sized hands and

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.160 
I have probably medium sized hands and
the<00:02:37.750> PT<00:02:38.140> just<00:02:38.439> seems<00:02:39.030> toy-like<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.510> small<00:02:40.930> to

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
the PT just seems toy-like and small to

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.520 
the PT just seems toy-like and small to
me<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:43.840> prefer<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.560> s<00:02:44.859> and<00:02:45.099> G<00:02:45.250> instead<00:02:45.549> as

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
me so I prefer the s and G instead as

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:56.580 
me so I prefer the s and G instead as
the<00:02:47.530> oval<00:02:47.950> opening<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:51.720> Sebenza<00:02:55.349> it's<00:02:56.349> just

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
the oval opening the Sebenza it's just
