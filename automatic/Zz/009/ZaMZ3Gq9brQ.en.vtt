00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.410 
travel-size brush I don't really use
this<00:00:25.680> because<00:00:25.949> I'm<00:00:26.279> happy<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.730> myself<00:00:26.910> ones

and<00:00:27.689> their<00:00:28.080> full<00:00:28.380> size<00:00:29.539> the<00:00:30.539> only<00:00:30.810> bad<00:00:31.019> thing

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
and their full size the only bad thing

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.400 
and their full size the only bad thing
about<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.769> palette<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
about this palette is that the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.660 
about this palette is that the
eyeshadows<00:00:34.410> don't<00:00:34.770> come<00:00:34.980> with<00:00:35.130> names<00:00:35.430> or

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.580
