00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
in different locations because earlier

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.709 
in different locations because earlier
in<00:00:46.230> one<00:00:47.100> memory<00:00:47.520> sequences<00:00:48.149> they<00:00:48.300> kind<00:00:48.600> of

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
in one memory sequences they kind of

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.220 
in one memory sequences they kind of
made<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.200> seem<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:51.440> Machiavelli<00:00:52.440> might<00:00:53.340> be

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
made it seem like Machiavelli might be

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.349

know<00:01:00.620> locations<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.859> where<00:01:02.539> individuals<00:01:03.539> oh

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
know locations of where individuals oh

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.469 
know locations of where individuals oh
and<00:01:03.989> whatnot<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:07.430> that's<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> way<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:08.880> what

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
and whatnot so that's the way what what

and whatnot so that's the way what what
that's<00:01:09.720> really<00:01:10.049> what<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.409> whole<00:01:10.650> memory

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that's really what this whole memory

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.910 
that's really what this whole memory
sequence<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.600> trying<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.140> find<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:13.619> who

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
sequence is is trying to find out who

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.330 
sequence is is trying to find out who
the<00:01:14.130> Spy<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.490> within<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:16.590> guild<00:01:16.890> or<00:01:19.310> even<00:01:20.310> just

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340

the Spy is within the guild or even just
said<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.210> Sasson<00:01:21.750> skill<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.200> general<00:01:22.530> not

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
said just a Sasson skill in general not

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.350 
said just a Sasson skill in general not
just<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.979> few<00:01:23.189> run

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
just a few run

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.090 
just a few run
so<00:01:25.570> I<00:01:27.510> a<00:01:28.510> turn<00:01:29.500> out<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:30.790> a<00:01:30.940> large<00:01:31.270> portion<00:01:31.780> of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
so I a turn out like a large portion of

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.030 
so I a turn out like a large portion of
you<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.460> low<00:01:33.880> Bei<00:01:34.180> just<00:01:35.020> writing<00:01:35.680> to<00:01:35.710> this

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
you and low Bei just writing to this

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.090 
you and low Bei just writing to this
location<00:01:36.520> since<00:01:37.410> that's<00:01:38.410> all<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:38.710> do<00:01:38.890> you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
location since that's all you do you

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.400 
location since that's all you do you
just<00:01:39.130> rot<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:40.000> just<00:01:40.240> slide<00:01:40.480> on<00:01:40.510> your<00:01:40.840> voice<00:01:40.990> to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
just rot you just slide on your voice to

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.620 
just rot you just slide on your voice to
this<00:01:41.650> point<00:01:41.979> so<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:45.040> just<00:01:45.700> save<00:01:45.970> time<00:01:46.330> and<00:01:46.540> just

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
this point so I just save time and just

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.260 
this point so I just save time and just
cut<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.590> out<00:01:47.680> just<00:01:48.070> because<00:01:48.250> it's<00:01:48.940> pretty

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
cut it out just because it's pretty

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.810 
cut it out just because it's pretty
pointless<00:01:49.660> they<00:01:49.900> can<00:01:50.050> have<00:01:50.200> in<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.470> video<00:01:51.810> um

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
pointless they can have in the video um

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.420 
pointless they can have in the video um
so<00:01:54.820> you<00:01:55.720> know<00:01:55.750> this<00:01:56.560> is<00:01:56.590> pretty<00:01:56.890> basic<00:01:57.130> stuff

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
so you know this is pretty basic stuff

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.930 
so you know this is pretty basic stuff
you<00:01:58.000> know<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.509> get<00:01:59.050> the<00:01:59.200> aryan<00:01:59.650> you<00:01:59.800> got<00:01:59.979> to

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
rescue you your comrades in arms for

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.580 
rescue you your comrades in arms for
some<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:11.980> these<00:02:12.070> groups<00:02:12.760> um<00:02:13.230> they<00:02:14.230> might<00:02:14.440> be

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
hopefully you can just on one of these

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.810 
hopefully you can just on one of these
guys<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:31.030> get<00:02:32.459> an<00:02:33.459> execution<00:02:34.330> streak<00:02:34.750> going

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
guys and get an execution streak going

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.120 
guys and get an execution streak going
just<00:02:36.820> because<00:02:37.120> with<00:02:37.450> those<00:02:37.630> boots<00:02:38.080> they<00:02:38.739> they

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
just because with those boots they they

just because with those boots they they
will<00:02:39.310> just<00:02:40.470> annihilate<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:41.709> if<00:02:42.100> you<00:02:42.670> don't

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.810 

take<00:02:46.000> care<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.299> them<00:02:46.480> very<00:02:46.840> quickly<00:02:47.080> no<00:02:49.590> so

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
take care of them very quickly no so

take care of them very quickly no so
this<00:02:51.820> is<00:02:52.049> basically<00:02:53.049> the<00:02:53.650> food<00:02:54.390> group<00:02:55.390> he<00:02:55.600> need

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
this is basically the food group he need

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.560 
this is basically the food group he need
to<00:02:56.049> save<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:57.340> have<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:57.610> go<00:02:57.730> into<00:02:57.910> eagle<00:02:58.360> vision

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
to save you have to go into eagle vision

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.350 
to save you have to go into eagle vision
to<00:02:58.870> locate<00:02:59.410> them<00:02:59.709> um

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
to locate them um

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.810 
to locate them um
kill<00:03:03.350> all<00:03:03.920> these<00:03:04.430> guards<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:06.430> if<00:03:07.430> you<00:03:07.640> haven't

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
dropped below five health squares which

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.350 
dropped below five health squares which
I<00:03:11.300> just<00:03:12.200> barely<00:03:12.650> managed<00:03:13.340> uh<00:03:13.610> you'll<00:03:13.970> get<00:03:14.120> one
