00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
range in the middle uh-huh which is an

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.510 
range in the middle uh-huh which is an
octave<00:02:17.630> in<00:02:17.780> one<00:02:18.110> never<00:02:18.620> I'm<00:02:18.860> octave<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.400> a

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
octave in one never I'm octave and a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.280 
octave in one never I'm octave and a
half<00:02:19.730> maybe<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.360> mean<00:02:20.630> up<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.900> an<00:02:20.990> octave<00:02:21.260> and

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
half maybe I mean up to an octave and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.690 
half maybe I mean up to an octave and
half<00:02:21.500> mine<00:02:21.770> goes<00:02:21.980> an<00:02:22.100> octave<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:22.550> half

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
half mine goes an octave and a half

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.880 
half mine goes an octave and a half
right<00:02:23.330> usually<00:02:24.140> they<00:02:24.290> don't<00:02:24.320> go<00:02:24.560> much<00:02:24.680> more

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
right usually they don't go much more

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.800 
right usually they don't go much more
than<00:02:25.040> an<00:02:25.130> office<00:02:25.460> yeah<00:02:25.910> maybe<00:02:26.090> one<00:02:26.390> note<00:02:26.570> over

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
than an office yeah maybe one note over

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.900 
than an office yeah maybe one note over
another<00:02:27.020> ok<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.890> limitations<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.790> are

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
another ok so the limitations of it are

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.700 
another ok so the limitations of it are
the<00:02:29.000> reason<00:02:29.270> it's<00:02:29.360> not<00:02:29.480> not<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.050> popular<00:02:30.230> right

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
the reason it's not not so popular right

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.350 
the reason it's not not so popular right
now<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:31.490> are<00:02:31.640> interested<00:02:31.760> in<00:02:32.150> pushing

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
now and you are interested in pushing

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.160 
now and you are interested in pushing
those<00:02:32.660> into<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.440> max<00:02:33.850> standard<00:02:35.170> Italian

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
those into the max standard Italian

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.160 
those into the max standard Italian
model<00:02:36.530> which<00:02:37.190> keep<00:02:37.400> gaggia<00:02:37.790> went<00:02:38.180> up<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.780> up<00:02:39.110> to

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
model which keep gaggia went up to up to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.040 
model which keep gaggia went up to up to
the<00:02:39.470> up<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.130> 11th<00:02:40.610> mm-hmm<00:02:41.570> is<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.930> this

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
the up to the 11th mm-hmm is that this

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.140 
the up to the 11th mm-hmm is that this
one<00:02:42.260> ya<00:02:42.620> chanda<00:02:43.310> show<00:02:43.460> so<00:02:43.670> sort<00:02:43.910> of<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
one ya chanda show so sort of the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.210 
one ya chanda show so sort of the
eleventh<00:02:44.570> Rite<00:02:44.990> torpedo-shaped<00:02:45.590> thing<00:02:46.010> yeah

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
eleventh Rite torpedo-shaped thing yeah

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.940 
eleventh Rite torpedo-shaped thing yeah
at<00:02:47.120> one<00:02:47.390> finger<00:02:47.780> one<00:02:48.140> finger<00:02:48.320> per<00:02:48.470> hole<00:02:48.770> just

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
at one finger one finger per hole just

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.480 
at one finger one finger per hole just
goes<00:02:49.130> Doremi<00:02:49.670> Faso<00:02:50.150> latido<00:02:51.020> and<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:52.310> goes<00:02:52.460> up

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
goes Doremi Faso latido and it goes up

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.670 
goes Doremi Faso latido and it goes up
to<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.910> 11th<00:02:53.360> using<00:02:53.810> all<00:02:53.990> 10<00:02:54.230> fingers<00:02:54.380> but

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
to the 11th using all 10 fingers but

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.230 
to the 11th using all 10 fingers but
it's<00:02:54.770> hard<00:02:55.220> it's<00:02:55.400> difficult<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.940> hold<00:02:56.030> an

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
it's hard it's difficult to hold an

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.940 
it's hard it's difficult to hold an
instrument<00:02:56.720> with<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.350> many<00:02:57.530> holes<00:02:57.770> open

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
instrument with that many holes open

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.690 
instrument with that many holes open
right<00:02:58.220> yeah<00:02:58.730> this<00:02:58.970> one<00:02:59.150> gets<00:02:59.390> it's<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.700> an

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
right yeah this one gets it's a an

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.430 
right yeah this one gets it's a an
octave<00:03:02.180> with<00:03:02.390> just<00:03:02.600> four<00:03:02.810> holes<00:03:02.990> right

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
octave with just four holes right

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.080 
octave with just four holes right
because<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.430> four<00:03:04.580> holes<00:03:04.730> are<00:03:04.850> all<00:03:04.940> different

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
because the four holes are all different

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.140 
because the four holes are all different
sizes<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:09.220> four<00:03:10.220> holes<00:03:10.430> gives<00:03:10.640> you<00:03:10.760> 16

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
sizes so four holes gives you 16

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.000 
sizes so four holes gives you 16
different<00:03:11.300> possible<00:03:11.900> combinations<00:03:12.590> even<00:03:12.920> if

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
different possible combinations even if

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.340 
different possible combinations even if

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
mm-hmm in western music and so I so

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.949

other<00:03:19.220> people<00:03:19.310> took<00:03:19.730> it<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:20.300> the<00:03:20.330> octave<00:03:20.810> and

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
other people took it to the octave and

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.840 
other people took it to the octave and
then<00:03:21.110> they<00:03:21.200> went<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.590> ninth<00:03:21.830> and<00:03:22.100> then<00:03:22.730> I

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
then they went to the ninth and then I

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.400 
then they went to the ninth and then I
thought<00:03:23.090> that<00:03:23.330> by<00:03:23.480> just<00:03:23.540> one<00:03:23.989> more<00:03:24.170> hole<00:03:24.380> I

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
thought that by just one more hole I

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.820 
thought that by just one more hole I
could<00:03:24.590> go<00:03:24.860> to<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.100> 11th<00:03:25.690> matching<00:03:26.690> what<00:03:27.650> the

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
could go to the 11th matching what the

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.520 
could go to the 11th matching what the
