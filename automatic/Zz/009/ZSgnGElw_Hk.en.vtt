00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.610 
Gingerbread so I am going to be setting
that<00:02:35.019> all<00:02:36.019> right

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
that all right

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.130 
that all right
and<00:02:37.769> then<00:02:38.870> you<00:02:39.870> can<00:02:40.050> start<00:02:40.410> with<00:02:41.269> having<00:02:42.269> some

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
and then you can start with having some

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.290 
and then you can start with having some
kernel<00:02:43.530> tweaks<00:02:43.800> right<00:02:43.980> here<00:02:44.810> like<00:02:45.810> resync

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
kernel tweaks right here like resync

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.150 
kernel tweaks right here like resync
kernel<00:02:48.300> supers<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.050> other<00:02:49.769> kernel<00:02:50.190> tweaks

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
kernel supers and other kernel tweaks

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.280 
kernel supers and other kernel tweaks
and<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.310> course<00:02:54.110> will<00:02:55.110> be<00:02:55.140> good<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:56.989> have<00:02:57.989> all

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
and of course will be good to have all

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.180 
and of course will be good to have all
of<00:02:58.319> them<00:02:58.620> because<00:02:59.330> basically<00:03:00.769> they<00:03:01.769> all<00:03:01.799> make

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
of them because basically they all make

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:09.160 
of them because basically they all make
your<00:03:02.340> phone<00:03:02.640> run<00:03:02.910> faster<00:03:05.540> most<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.810> time<00:03:07.049> I

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
your phone run faster most of the time I

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.289 
your phone run faster most of the time I
select<00:03:10.170> all<00:03:10.319> of<00:03:10.440> them<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:11.549> problem<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.090> that

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
select all of them the problem is that

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.350 
select all of them the problem is that
sometimes<00:03:12.930> there<00:03:13.829> are<00:03:14.010> some<00:03:14.340> tweaks<00:03:14.849> tariffs

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
sometimes there are some tweaks tariffs

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.160 
sometimes there are some tweaks tariffs
or<00:03:15.630> dual-core<00:03:16.790> processors<00:03:17.790> which<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:18.959> that

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
or dual-core processors which in that

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:28.410 
or dual-core processors which in that
case<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.680> don't<00:03:19.739> really<00:03:20.040> have<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:21.060> use<00:03:21.390> for

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.960 

and<00:03:28.960> this<00:03:29.230> next<00:03:29.470> part<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:29.980> can<00:03:30.130> also<00:03:30.280> click

and this next part you can also click

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.910 
and this next part you can also click
this<00:03:31.210> so<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.540> can<00:03:31.690> install<00:03:31.960> every<00:03:32.319> all<00:03:32.560> of<00:03:32.800> the

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
this so you can install every all of the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.130 
this so you can install every all of the
tweaks<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.610> you<00:03:34.240> can<00:03:34.360> see<00:03:34.569> there<00:03:34.720> are<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.840> lot

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
tweaks and you can see there are a lot

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.740 
tweaks and you can see there are a lot
of<00:03:35.560> battery<00:03:36.010> saving<00:03:36.280> Wi-Fi<00:03:36.970> camera<00:03:37.510> quality

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
of battery saving Wi-Fi camera quality

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.920 
of battery saving Wi-Fi camera quality

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
round deep sleep darling time tweaks

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.300

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.470 
increase JPEG flash LED tweaks and so
forth

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.020 

and<00:03:48.650> we<00:03:49.650> also<00:03:49.830> have<00:03:50.069> to<00:03:50.310> say<00:03:50.459> well<00:03:50.640> put<00:03:50.880> an

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
and we also have to say well put an

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.740 
and we also have to say well put an
omission<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.660> other<00:03:51.840> ones<00:03:53.390> disable<00:03:54.390> volume

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.289 

and<00:03:59.049> this<00:03:59.859> has<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.159> do<00:04:00.280> with<00:04:00.400> memory<00:04:00.879> color

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
and this has to do with memory color

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.429 
and this has to do with memory color
values<00:04:01.840> which<00:04:02.620> you<00:04:02.980> can<00:04:03.659> use<00:04:04.659> to<00:04:04.689> balance<00:04:05.260> out

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 
values which you can use to balance out

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.559 
values which you can use to balance out
the<00:04:07.019> phone's<00:04:08.019> process<00:04:08.819> and<00:04:09.819> how<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.120> deals

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
the phone's process and how it deals

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.880

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
with memory and RAM such as mid low to

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.129 
with memory and RAM such as mid low to
medium<00:04:15.069> and<00:04:15.430> it's<00:04:15.670> very<00:04:15.909> clear<00:04:16.329> so<00:04:16.840> even

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
medium and it's very clear so even

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.990 
medium and it's very clear so even
though<00:04:17.259> you<00:04:17.320> don't<00:04:17.709> have<00:04:17.799> a<00:04:18.039> great<00:04:18.639> idea<00:04:18.910> of

the right things but overall what I want

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:12.839 
the right things but overall what I want
to<00:06:09.610> be<00:06:10.149> clear<00:06:10.449> though<00:06:10.659> is<00:06:10.929> how<00:06:11.889> to<00:06:11.949> install<00:06:12.610> it

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
to be clear though is how to install it

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:18.239 
to be clear though is how to install it
so<00:06:13.089> it<00:06:13.779> has<00:06:15.179> the<00:06:16.179> instructions<00:06:16.749> here<00:06:17.079> but<00:06:17.979> I

00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:18.249 
so it has the instructions here but I

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:20.759 
so it has the instructions here but I
think<00:06:18.789> the<00:06:19.119> thing<00:06:19.539> that<00:06:19.749> some<00:06:20.319> of<00:06:20.379> my<00:06:20.469> friends

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:20.769 
think the thing that some of my friends

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:22.799 
think the thing that some of my friends
have<00:06:20.889> problems<00:06:21.249> with<00:06:21.369> is<00:06:21.729> what<00:06:22.479> kind<00:06:22.749> of

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:22.809 
have problems with is what kind of

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:25.589 
have problems with is what kind of
device<00:06:23.339> or<00:06:24.339> what<00:06:24.639> kind<00:06:24.849> of<00:06:24.909> follow<00:06:25.149> you<00:06:25.419> should

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 
device or what kind of follow you should

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:27.589 
device or what kind of follow you should
download<00:06:25.809> because<00:06:26.439> they<00:06:26.679> have<00:06:26.860> these

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 
download because they have these

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:32.369 
download because they have these
different<00:06:29.069> guidelines<00:06:30.479> so<00:06:31.479> the<00:06:31.959> one<00:06:32.169> that<00:06:32.349> I

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:32.379 
different guidelines so the one that I

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.339 
different guidelines so the one that I
use<00:06:32.860> is<00:06:33.099> this<00:06:33.849> one<00:06:33.909> because<00:06:34.479> my<00:06:34.629> phone<00:06:34.869> is<00:06:34.899> the

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:35.349 
use is this one because my phone is the

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.889 
use is this one because my phone is the
Motorola<00:06:36.159> Droid<00:06:36.189> which<00:06:37.089> in<00:06:37.269> this<00:06:37.419> case<00:06:37.629> it<00:06:37.869> is
