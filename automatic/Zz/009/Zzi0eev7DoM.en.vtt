00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
low-end raids or dungeons and I was able

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.230 
low-end raids or dungeons and I was able
to<00:04:30.110> take<00:04:30.229> him<00:04:30.349> down<00:04:30.970> unfortunately<00:04:31.970> I'm

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
to take him down unfortunately I'm

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.510 
to take him down unfortunately I'm
hunting<00:04:32.810> for<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.080> mount<00:04:33.260> and<00:04:33.470> it<00:04:34.039> didn't<00:04:34.310> drop

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
hunting for the mount and it didn't drop

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.600 
hunting for the mount and it didn't drop
I<00:04:34.820> think<00:04:35.750> it's<00:04:35.900> about<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.169> 0.7<00:04:37.010> percent<00:04:37.400> drop

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
I think it's about a 0.7 percent drop

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.270 
I think it's about a 0.7 percent drop
