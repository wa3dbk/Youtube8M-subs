becoming more trendy I don't think that

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.429 
becoming more trendy I don't think that
there's<00:01:49.970> a<00:01:50.030> whole<00:01:50.299> lot<00:01:50.509> of<00:01:50.539> them<00:01:50.869> doing<00:01:51.319> it

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
there's a whole lot of them doing it

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:52.630

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
because they don't think the knowledge

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.399 
because they don't think the knowledge
and<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:52.880> education<00:01:53.539> and<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:53.780> security<00:01:54.259> out

and the education and the security out

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.710 
and the education and the security out
there<00:01:54.439> of<00:01:54.830> being<00:01:55.729> able<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:56.030> put<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:56.509> pack
