in<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.430> little<00:02:45.459> bit<00:02:45.910> this<00:02:46.330> stuff<00:02:46.570> really

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
in a little bit this stuff really

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.900 
in a little bit this stuff really
doesn't<00:02:47.080> run<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.620> can<00:02:51.100> be<00:02:51.340> pretty<00:02:51.610> liberal

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
doesn't run so you can be pretty liberal

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.949 
doesn't run so you can be pretty liberal
with<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.300> so<00:02:53.110> that's<00:02:53.380> what<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.800> was<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.580> you

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
with it so that's what it was and you

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.600 
with it so that's what it was and you
can<00:02:55.959> see<00:02:56.170> how<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.470> color<00:02:56.800> comes<00:02:57.130> out<00:02:57.340> in<00:02:57.519> the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
can see how the color comes out in the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.380 
can see how the color comes out in the
wood<00:02:57.820> now<00:02:59.160> so<00:03:00.160> there<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:00.880> looks<00:03:01.090> like<00:03:01.150> it's

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
wood now so there it looks like it's

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.800 
wood now so there it looks like it's
going<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.600> be<00:03:01.660> pretty<00:03:01.870> dark<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:04.150> once<00:03:04.420> we<00:03:04.570> put

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
going to be pretty dark but once we put

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.470 
going to be pretty dark but once we put
the<00:03:04.930> coating<00:03:05.380> on<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.820> light<00:03:07.000> hits<00:03:07.269> it

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
the coating on it and the light hits it

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.350 
the coating on it and the light hits it
without<00:03:08.200> much<00:03:08.500> better<00:03:08.799> it<00:03:08.950> looks<00:03:08.980> even<00:03:09.970> this

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
without much better it looks even this

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.550 
without much better it looks even this
piece<00:03:10.630> over<00:03:10.870> here<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:13.720> looking<00:03:14.019> really<00:03:14.260> good

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
piece over here is looking really good

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.979 
piece over here is looking really good
now<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.980> has<00:03:15.160> been<00:03:15.430> around<00:03:15.549> 7<00:03:16.329> minutes<00:03:16.660> I'm

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
now this has been around 7 minutes I'm

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.780 
now this has been around 7 minutes I'm
going<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.170> touch<00:03:17.440> an<00:03:17.620> area<00:03:17.920> underneath<00:03:18.519> the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
going to touch an area underneath the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.500 
going to touch an area underneath the
ends<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:21.459> it<00:03:21.640> feels<00:03:23.549> almost<00:03:24.549> completely<00:03:25.299> dry

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
ends and it feels almost completely dry

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.470 
ends and it feels almost completely dry
that's<00:03:25.810> why<00:03:25.989> I<00:03:26.049> like<00:03:26.200> to<00:03:26.320> use<00:03:26.500> this<00:03:26.680> stuff

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
that's why I like to use this stuff

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.550 
that's why I like to use this stuff
