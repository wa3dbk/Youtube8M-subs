00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
other video about this guy where he said

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.799 
other video about this guy where he said
he<00:00:43.200> had<00:00:43.320> problems<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.270> schooling<00:00:45.270> business

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
he had problems on schooling business

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.810 
he had problems on schooling business
too<00:00:45.989> hard<00:00:46.289> or<00:00:46.649> something<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.460> he<00:00:47.520> broke<00:00:47.760> it

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
too hard or something and he broke it

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.600 
too hard or something and he broke it
and<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:49.410> know<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> second<00:00:50.070> arm<00:00:50.280> stopped

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
and then you know the second arm stopped

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.209 
and then you know the second arm stopped
moving<00:00:50.789> whatever<00:00:51.590> mine<00:00:52.590> really<00:00:52.890> wasn't<00:00:53.070> that

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
moving whatever mine really wasn't that

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.760 
moving whatever mine really wasn't that
tight<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.820> was<00:00:53.969> very<00:00:54.120> loose<00:00:54.420> actually<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.530> when

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
tight it was very loose actually so when

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.110 
tight it was very loose actually so when
you<00:00:55.949> open<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:57.239> opens<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:58.160> as<00:00:59.160> you

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
you open it it opens like that as you

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.250 
you open it it opens like that as you
can<00:01:00.300> see<00:01:01.760> everything<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.879> very<00:01:03.000> shiny<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.809> a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
can see everything is very shiny as a

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.350 
can see everything is very shiny as a
rubber<00:01:04.650> ring<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.580> isolations<00:01:06.240> of

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
rubber ring to it for isolations of

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.630 
rubber ring to it for isolations of
water<00:01:06.540> won't<00:01:06.750> penetrate<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.130> push<00:01:08.460> this

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
water won't penetrate and you push this

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.820 
water won't penetrate and you push this
in<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.119> then<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> second<00:01:09.869> arm<00:01:10.080> starts<00:01:10.500> moving

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
in and then the second arm starts moving

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.480 
in and then the second arm starts moving
and<00:01:11.720> here's<00:01:12.720> where<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.470> adjust<00:01:14.159> date

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
and here's where you you adjust date

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.330 
and here's where you you adjust date
push<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.479> back<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:17.070> pretty

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
push your back in so pretty

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.999 
push your back in so pretty
straightforward<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.530> it's

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
straightforward I really like this it's

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.130 
straightforward I really like this it's
a<00:01:20.130> nice<00:01:20.310> feature<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:24.330> when<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.750> tied<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.110> back

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
a nice feature so when you tied it back

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.800 
a nice feature so when you tied it back
don't<00:01:25.770> tighten<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.159> too<00:01:26.220> hard<00:01:26.520> over<00:01:27.450> over

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
don't tighten it too hard over over

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.630 
don't tighten it too hard over over
tighten<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.530> know<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:29.009> not<00:01:29.250> something

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
tighten it you know it's not something

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.640 
tighten it you know it's not something
you<00:01:29.759> will<00:01:29.909> be<00:01:30.060> able<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.479> over<00:01:30.930> tight<00:01:31.170> anyways

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
you will be able to over tight anyways

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.870 
you will be able to over tight anyways
because<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.220> very<00:01:32.930> rough<00:01:33.930> material<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:34.880> you

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
because it's very rough material but you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.880 
because it's very rough material but you
know<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:37.020> know<00:01:37.110> for<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.530> open<00:01:37.799> it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
know if you you know for you to open it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.969 
know if you you know for you to open it
later<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.570> as<00:01:39.570> treat<00:01:40.079> chronographs

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
later on as treat chronographs

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.100 
later on as treat chronographs
on<00:01:41.460> its<00:01:42.140> one<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.759> day<00:01:45.090> which<00:01:46.079> is

on its one is for the day which is
accurate<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.950> adjusted<00:01:47.790> here<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.390> click<00:01:48.600> it

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
accurate you adjusted here you click it

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.120 
accurate you adjusted here you click it
up<00:01:49.079> lift<00:01:49.259> up<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.549> goes<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:51.240> day<00:01:51.979> you<00:01:52.979> know

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
up lift up and it goes on day you know

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.429 
up lift up and it goes on day you know
right<00:01:53.430> now<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.030> Tuesday<00:01:54.450> because<00:01:54.659> day<00:01:55.200> is

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
right now it's on Tuesday because day is

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.130 
right now it's on Tuesday because day is
to<00:01:55.740> thing<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.640> thought<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.600> will<00:01:57.750> probably

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
to thing I thought you will probably

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.050 
to thing I thought you will probably
have<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.500> click<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.100> every<00:01:59.340> day<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.610> change<00:01:59.939> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
have to click it every day to change the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.940 
have to click it every day to change the
day<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.750> won't<00:02:00.930> go<00:02:01.110> automatically<00:02:01.710> but

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
day that it won't go automatically but

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.429 
day that it won't go automatically but
it<00:02:02.100> did<00:02:02.250> go<00:02:02.430> automatically<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.630> here<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.229> just

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
it did go automatically so here you just

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.319 
it did go automatically so here you just
adjust<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.310> then<00:02:05.520> that's<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.270> don't

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
adjust it and then that's it you don't

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.490 
adjust it and then that's it you don't
have<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.570> touch<00:02:06.689> anymore

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
have to touch anymore

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.330 
have to touch anymore
it<00:02:08.130> will<00:02:08.250> adjust<00:02:08.550> by<00:02:08.759> itself<00:02:10.039> so<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.100> have

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
it will adjust by itself so you have

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.090

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
right so that's 8 9 there we go on 10 11

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.800 
right so that's 8 9 there we go on 10 11
12<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.570> on<00:02:42.690> so<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:43.020> works<00:02:43.670> spot<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:44.850> the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
12 and so on so that works spot on the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.220 
12 and so on so that works spot on the
bezel<00:02:46.110> itself<00:02:49.430> it's<00:02:50.430> okay<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.810> know<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:52.170> think

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
bezel itself it's okay you know I think

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.840 
bezel itself it's okay you know I think
the<00:02:52.709> bezel<00:02:53.100> would<00:02:53.250> have<00:02:53.340> made<00:02:53.520> more

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
the bezel would have made more

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.190 
the bezel would have made more
impression<00:02:54.540> if<00:02:54.720> all<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:56.340> gold<00:02:57.300> bar<00:02:57.750> hears

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
impression if all the gold bar hears

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.600 
impression if all the gold bar hears
were<00:02:58.890> actually<00:02:59.489> just<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.360> same<00:03:00.660> as<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.610> our

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
were actually just the same as the our

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.490 
were actually just the same as the our
arms<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.510> mint<00:03:03.690> arms<00:03:04.070> like<00:03:05.070> gold<00:03:05.340> or<00:03:05.670> the

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
arms and the mint arms like gold or the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.920 
arms and the mint arms like gold or the
the<00:03:07.500> frame<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.430> round<00:03:08.730> chronographs<00:03:09.420> gold

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
the frame of the round chronographs gold

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.520 
the frame of the round chronographs gold
that<00:03:10.680> would<00:03:10.770> have<00:03:10.890> been<00:03:11.070> more<00:03:11.580> impressive

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
that would have been more impressive

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.199 
that would have been more impressive
than<00:03:13.530> just<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.190> gold<00:03:14.820> paint<00:03:17.000> but<00:03:18.000> that's

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
than just this gold paint but that's

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.860 
than just this gold paint but that's
okay<00:03:18.709> it<00:03:19.709> has<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.400> very<00:03:20.670> thick<00:03:21.030> glass<00:03:21.269> on<00:03:21.660> it

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
okay it has a very thick glass on it

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:33.160 
okay it has a very thick glass on it
um<00:03:23.630> scratch<00:03:24.630> proof<00:03:29.450> so<00:03:30.450> that's<00:03:30.630> that's<00:03:30.959> cool

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
um scratch proof so that's that's cool

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.620 
um scratch proof so that's that's cool
