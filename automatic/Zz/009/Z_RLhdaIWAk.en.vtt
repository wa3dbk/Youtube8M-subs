vertebrae<00:01:03.409> this<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> whale<00:01:04.890> vert<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.850> it's

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
vertebrae this is a whale vert and it's

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.500 
vertebrae this is a whale vert and it's
it's<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> same<00:01:07.799> age<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.250> my<00:01:08.430> scene<00:01:08.790> epic<00:01:09.270> so

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
it's the same age as my scene epic so

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.320 
it's the same age as my scene epic so
it's<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.260> know<00:01:10.380> ballpark<00:01:10.979> for<00:01:11.369> 224<00:01:12.150> million

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it's you know ballpark for 224 million

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.789 
it's you know ballpark for 224 million
years<00:01:12.570> old<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.840> essentially<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> dinosaur

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
years old it's essentially a dinosaur

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.350 
years old it's essentially a dinosaur
bone<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:15.830> actually<00:01:16.830> still<00:01:17.220> keep<00:01:17.460> these<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.970> got<00:01:18.299> a

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
bone I actually still keep these I got a

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.090 
bone I actually still keep these I got a
bucket<00:01:18.689> full<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.049> them<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.380> don't<00:01:19.710> really<00:01:19.979> know

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
bucket full of them I don't really know

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.859 
bucket full of them I don't really know
what<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.400> with<00:01:20.520> them<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:20.820> they're<00:01:21.390> fun<00:01:21.600> and

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
what to do with them but they're fun and

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.830 
what to do with them but they're fun and
if<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.860> look<00:01:23.040> down<00:01:23.189> there<00:01:23.460> hidden<00:01:24.000> partially

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
if you look down there hidden partially

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.230 
if you look down there hidden partially
in<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.960> gravel<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.790> what<00:01:26.790> looks<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.210> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
in the gravel is what looks to be a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.749 
in the gravel is what looks to be a
pretty<00:01:27.479> decent<00:01:27.540> snaggletooth<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.710> these<00:01:29.610> are

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
pretty decent snaggletooth and these are

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.460 
pretty decent snaggletooth and these are
probably<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.210> most<00:01:30.450> common<00:01:30.900> larger<00:01:31.290> sized

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
probably the most common larger sized

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.080 
probably the most common larger sized
teeth<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.890> definitely<00:01:32.460> don't<00:01:32.579> find<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.880> mega

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
teeth you definitely don't find a mega

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.969 
teeth you definitely don't find a mega
every<00:01:33.390> trip<00:01:33.630> that's<00:01:33.810> pretty<00:01:34.020> rare<00:01:34.229> but<00:01:34.799> let's

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
every trip that's pretty rare but let's

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.010 
every trip that's pretty rare but let's
see<00:01:35.130> if<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.280> see<00:01:35.490> that

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.750 

yeah<00:01:42.020> it's<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.260> pretty<00:01:42.530> nice<00:01:42.770> negative<00:01:43.310> it's<00:01:43.670> a

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
yeah it's a pretty nice negative it's a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.570 
yeah it's a pretty nice negative it's a
little<00:01:43.940> beat-up<00:01:44.120> but<00:01:44.890> pretty<00:01:45.890> cool<00:01:47.170> so<00:01:48.460> like<00:01:49.460> I

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
little beat-up but pretty cool so like I

little beat-up but pretty cool so like I
said<00:01:49.640> wherever<00:01:50.120> you<00:01:50.180> find<00:01:50.360> these<00:01:50.600> like<00:01:50.780> little

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
said wherever you find these like little

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.000 
said wherever you find these like little
gravel<00:01:51.500> areas<00:01:51.860> I<00:01:52.100> look<00:01:52.370> real<00:01:52.640> good<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:54.010> you

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
gravel areas I look real good so you

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.680 
gravel areas I look real good so you
know<00:01:55.040> again<00:01:55.430> where<00:01:55.910> you<00:01:56.000> find<00:01:56.240> one<00:01:56.450> thing<00:01:56.660> a

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
know again where you find one thing a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.210 
know again where you find one thing a
lot<00:01:56.900> of<00:01:56.990> times<00:01:57.170> you'll<00:01:57.350> find<00:01:57.380> two<00:01:57.770> things<00:01:58.040> so

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
lot of times you'll find two things so

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.770 
lot of times you'll find two things so
I'm<00:01:58.310> going<00:01:58.460> to<00:01:58.520> check<00:01:58.670> this<00:01:58.790> area<00:01:59.000> out<00:01:59.210> real

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
I'm going to check this area out real

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
the cliffs people really don't

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.050 
the cliffs people really don't
understand<00:02:03.530> they<00:02:03.710> are<00:02:03.830> extremely<00:02:04.340> dangerous

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
understand they are extremely dangerous

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.380 
understand they are extremely dangerous
I<00:02:05.380> actually<00:02:06.520> really<00:02:07.520> never<00:02:07.820> get<00:02:08.030> this<00:02:08.149> close

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
I actually really never get this close

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.480 
I'm just doing this to show you
giant<00:02:11.240> chunks<00:02:11.540> fall<00:02:11.750> off<00:02:11.930> all<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.290> time<00:02:12.490> and

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
giant chunks fall off all the time and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.760 
giant chunks fall off all the time and
sometimes<00:02:13.970> you'll<00:02:14.330> have<00:02:14.450> giant<00:02:15.200> things<00:02:15.590> like

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
sometimes you'll have giant things like

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.410 
sometimes you'll have giant things like
that<00:02:15.920> huge<00:02:16.130> tree<00:02:16.250> up<00:02:16.790> there<00:02:16.940> that's<00:02:17.120> ready<00:02:17.330> to

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
that huge tree up there that's ready to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.930 
that huge tree up there that's ready to
come<00:02:17.570> down<00:02:17.600> even<00:02:18.070> a<00:02:19.070> piece<00:02:19.400> as<00:02:19.580> big<00:02:19.760> as<00:02:19.910> a

come down even a piece as big as a
bowling<00:02:20.690> ball<00:02:20.840> is<00:02:20.959> probably<00:02:21.260> gonna<00:02:22.300> probably

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
bowling ball is probably gonna probably

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.800 
bowling ball is probably gonna probably
kill<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.570> see<00:02:23.980> see<00:02:24.980> over<00:02:25.130> there<00:02:25.600> I'm<00:02:26.600> actually
