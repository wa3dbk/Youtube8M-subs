the<00:00:18.420> answer<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:19.730> old-school<00:00:20.750> Scotchguard

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930

the answer is old-school Scotchguard
so<00:00:22.380> what<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.740> want<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.980> do<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.220> spray<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.779> in

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
so what you want to do is spray it on in

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.839 
so what you want to do is spray it on in
two<00:00:25.230> light<00:00:25.500> coats<00:00:25.800> rather<00:00:26.099> than<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> heavy<00:00:26.519> coat

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
two light coats rather than a heavy coat

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.810 
two light coats rather than a heavy coat
and<00:00:27.349> before<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.470> spray<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.189> spray<00:00:29.699> it

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
and before you spray it on you spray it

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.849 
and before you spray it on you spray it
onto<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.179> dark<00:00:30.480> area<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.109> see<00:00:31.470> if<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> colour

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
onto a dark area and see if the colour

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.160 
onto a dark area and see if the colour
comes<00:00:32.219> off<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.759> if<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.239> does<00:00:33.420> then<00:00:33.719> don't<00:00:33.989> do

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
comes off and if it does then don't do

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.780 
comes off and if it does then don't do
the<00:00:34.200> rest<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.590> your<00:00:34.710> car<00:00:34.920> but<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.280> think<00:00:35.610> most

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the rest of your car but I think most

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.360 
the rest of your car but I think most
cars<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.210> pretty<00:00:36.630> color<00:00:36.989> safe<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:38.219> let's

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
cars are pretty color safe and let's

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.240 
cars are pretty color safe and let's
test<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.790> out<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.620> ketchup<00:00:41.010> stain

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
test it out and see if a ketchup stain

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.319 
test it out and see if a ketchup stain
can<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.610> easily<00:00:41.850> lifted<00:00:42.450> out<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:44.300> all<00:00:45.300> right

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
can be easily lifted out of it all right

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.060 
can be easily lifted out of it all right
I'm<00:00:45.539> not<00:00:45.570> going<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:45.960> testing<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> out<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.860> my

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070
