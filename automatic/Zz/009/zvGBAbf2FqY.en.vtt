00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.500
 from a historical point of view the 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.270
 evangelical word has been used then for 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.610
 refer to Christians whose only 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.919
 authority for what you believe about the 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.770
 salvation is found exclusively in 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.840
 the word of God 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.900
 describes Christians who recognize 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.820
 Jesus Christ as the only Lord and Savior 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.340
 the only mediator between god and 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.030
 men the one with whom we can 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.309
 relate exclusively by faith 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.860
 why always in the history of 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.440
 the church has turned to these truths 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.550
 Christians have been known as 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.250
 evangelicals 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.920
 well jon wycliff in the 14th century in 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.469
 england was known as the doctor 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.840
 evangelical to maintain that the 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.149
 writings contain everything you need 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.320
 for salvation 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.049
 subsequently Martin Luther in the century 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.750
 16 in germany was also called 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.509
 evangelical doctor for holding that the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.110
 scriptures teach that we are declared 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:16.560
 just before God only by faith in 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.110
 Jesus Christ since then all those who 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.130
 have embraced these teachings have been 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.680
 considered evangelicals 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.560
 so in the so-called evangelical awakening 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.020
 that started in the 18th century many 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.210
 men and women of many countries 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.179
 they returned to God the father for the 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.360
 testimony of the bible and they did it 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:41.179
 for by faith alone rest for your 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.740
 salvation exclusively in the person and 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.500
 work of Jesus Christ 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.759
 as a result of that awakening 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.860
 many men and women brought the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.540
 gospel on all continents of the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.159
 world from india to china and all asia 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.770
 from australia and the pacific to the 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.230
 very heart of africa america or 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.540
 even the same europe 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.160
 at the same time the evangelicals of 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.530
 according to the teaching of God in the 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.630
 bible they fought against the trade of 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.000
 slaves and they were behind the 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.260
 abolition of slavery through the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.640
 Atlantic and on the African continent 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.640
 promoted measures to alleviate 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.460
 sufferings of the poorest weak e 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.490
 unfairly treated children or 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.710
 single mothers the sick and the 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.380
 prisoners and were behind the 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.140
 foundation of the red cross ' 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.120
 for that reason the word evangelical is a 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.280
 precious word for all those who 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.440
 we have known salvation by 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.370
 testimony of the bible about 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.739
 Jesus Christ 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.260
 a salvation that leads us to live a 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.690
 life of gratitude goodbye preaching to 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.799
 Jesus Christ and doing good for the 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.799
