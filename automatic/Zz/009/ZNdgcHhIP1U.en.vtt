00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.840
 allow us to thank you for the hunt you just made as well 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.339
 that on the choice of m 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.849
 let's discover together the editing tips of the multipoint scene 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.449
 appearance 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.079
 look at the inscriptions on the front and back of the packaging 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.410
 as the list of tools needed to mount your lock 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.410
 and if the good sense of opening your door 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.310
 in this case the right cheekbone left locks 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.320
 like the left 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.430
 locks right 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.060
 here you need a rock scene 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.510
 right here 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.390
 also make sure of the flatness and bonuca of your reach 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.070
 dismantle the existing lock and then close the holes carefully with 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.620
 wood pulp 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.530
 m 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.390
 to work in good conditions discover the door as 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.020
 this 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.000
 and put it on trestles 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.740
 this inventory of your parts this allows you to familiarize yourself with 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.740
 together then take the note 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.500
 tracy your first gold markers like this 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500
 starting from the bottom of the door 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.650
 a dimension of 975 minimal catch other benchmarks 50 millimeters from the 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.920
 side 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.670
 you're taking standard thies cabarry calculus for his straight robes of 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.810
 locks left 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.069
 choose common sense use as you can see here 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.060
 I have the time following the layout then position it like this in you 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.060
 serving the backhand 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.580
 ap 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.410
 once positioned more than the adhesive to ensure the maintenance of calm 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.800
 then point out the end of center 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.170
 now proceed to the characters using a 5-year-old girls' hole saw 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.170
 be sure to stay perpendicular 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.789
 Once this character is finished, proceed to the second 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.789
 character who serves as housing in lagos more security 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.519
 trace to set their location for the trunk ridge 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.599
 principal so that this one without breaks of three millimeters on the field of the 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.019
 door 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.109
 for this operation use a wood chisel 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.279
 once this operation 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.279
 finished put the square in the lock like this 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.469
 i had dhabi who was tightened the mental screw with a key using 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.469
 three minutes after 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.180
 once the chest well positioned near pierced using a forest of 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:53.179
 diameter of difficulties using screws 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:06.069
 once the chest is well positioned and wounded it will have to proceed to 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.069
 setting up 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.310
 positioned in this sense the classic turntables in the notches of the trunk of 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.129
 the lock 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.129
 screen for adventures 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:30.009
 positioned intermediate plates following the tracing 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:34.539
 6 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.169
 once this operation is completed exceeded 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.699
 some to ferriÃ¨res and higher by aligning them respectively by 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.499
 relationship to low voice and singing beyond door 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:44.779
 v 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:46.529
 3 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:49.590
 gather the pads on the team barely for pedestrians 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.590
 remove the mosquitoes they will be positioned later 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:04:00.569
 prepare your arrival then gather the lower tramelots and 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.569
 higher using a smart key 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:17.819
 adjust the larger size at the field level too much of the door 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.509
 block the propeller points for very strong ambition until the 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.509
 tunnel deformation 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:29.089
 repeat the operation for the lower frame using the tube of 

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:32.089
 disc diameter over 150 millimeters 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:36.400
 6 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.630
 place the foam pieces at the level of the intermediate products so 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.630
 avoid noise during the opening and closing of the door 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.080
 test your lock to check that the lock is working properly 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.279
 closing system 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:56.229
 once the tests finished positioned which I work 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.229
 eclipsed 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:06.839
 cut if necessary to adjust capitals and so be able to police 

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:09.569
 on the guides barely making sure at the same time more on the side of 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.569
 performances 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.900
 once every case I fixed and eclipsed repositioned the door on the 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.900
 bed 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:32.659
 put upper lagoon in the center and leaving three mini game master 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.970
 tubular lagoon compound drilled the soil costs put it 25 on 31 mini meters 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.970
 deep and then stick 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:46.710
 3 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.680
 thus marking the trigger terral alone with a wood chisel for 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.680
 404 three minutes to go in the frame 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.599
 mixing process this one 

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:19.949
 positioned hide it a good standard or cash wrist sold big options 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.719
 here is the lock is now put and you are in security package
