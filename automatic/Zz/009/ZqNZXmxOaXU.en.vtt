00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.960
 consequence on the account defeat is for 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.070
 so far, a foreign word erndtebrück 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.260
 wants to shorten the distance and one 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:30.359
 Of course, avoid it all 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:35.989
 the host in blue the first good 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:38.370
 attacked with naked but whatever comes 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.940
 one step too late 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.120
 the first corner but the friend and enemy 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.149
 miss again nakai waldrich 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.570
 markus waldrich initially keeps goalkeeper 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:56.309
 stauder but then he is beaten 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.809
 the eighth goal of the season from waldrich for 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.800
 The hosts kicked off as painted for 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.920
 all the opposite 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.830
 then throw in all erndtebrück goes 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.850
 inbetween ball loss of the guests and it 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.860
 means 2 2 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.200
 the receipt for the defense error 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.009
 laurenz water a double beat 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.840
 Ahlen within two minutes 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.830
 impressed by the robust aggressive 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.030
 play the host only gradually 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.659
 The red and white are better in the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:35.009
 party here with ivancicevic but no 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.869
 problem for keeper tim beecker then one 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.009
 played half an hour and now 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.470
 excitement foul from bednorz to judge 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.670
 the referee decides immediately 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.960
 on eleven meters no question that goes in 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:55.659
 order it shoots damir ivancicevic he 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.759
 shortened to 2 1 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.829
 the on a require a warning or 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.200
 even more for bednorz this 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.500
 they like the impartial 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.240
 but not 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.519
 red-white-trainer antwerp he reacts 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.379
 brings his noble joker yildirim 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.370
 Of course, the attacking game too 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.540
 improve 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:23.440
 nevertheless everything is in it but that 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.530
 impression confirms erndtebrück im 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.519
 play forward the more dangerous the 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:35.079
 Creative Team Again Qatar The 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:39.099
 Nakai also missed the opportunity to go there 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:41.650
 Not much then throw in all the game 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.569
 now completely open it goes back and forth 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.379
 two good opponents at eye level the 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:51.940
 possibility for ivancicevic yet 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:55.060
 it remains in the game 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.940
 forward the better the more creative 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:03.430
 team with the clearer chances 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:08.799
 caviar again the victory lubasa but good 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:12.489
 held by stauder about 600 spectators 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.680
 in powder waldstadion erndtebrück short 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.430
 before the break with wassinger 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.370
 then lubasa sees waltrich and there 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.250
 it stands 3 to 1 40 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.939
 minute was the tough or not the 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:32.129
 Ball naturally placed in any case 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:36.189
 two gates lead for erndtebrück 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:38.739
 waldrich ninth of the season and his 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:40.569
 cheers artistically valuable 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.159
 yes, if we do not win today then 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.780
 the tension pretty much awakens ahnatal 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.359
 at least twelve points ahead of us 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.040
 and therefore it is very important that 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.139
 to shorten to six points and in the 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.459
 moment it looks quite good for the 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.780
 league has always been strong that was the 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.939
 Strongly balanced last two years 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.739
 this year is the newcomer 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.430
 are good lippstadt comes neither is too 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.950
 to be expected 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.689
 So the league is closely the 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.419
 it will stay that way all the time 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:07.299
 hopefully stay at the top 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:10.599
 the second half all tried hard for the 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.340
 connection free kick felix backszat the 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.709
 Team has a tremendous amount 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:19.090
 but offensive potential here and today 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:21.609
 it does not come as usual to wear 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.250
 on the other side of the wide ball 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.039
 direction wassinger there he wins again 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.940
 a headball duel and then it is called 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:32.139
 4 to 1 jan patrick k the iata the 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.680
 scorer 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:39.479
 Stauder still with the fingers on the ball 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:42.960
 but hit three-goal residue 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:47.020
 marco antwerp the red and white coach 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:50.500
 suspects that the soft provided clearly 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.159
 are colleague Schnorrenberg brings hangover 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.620
 from the place of which has contributed 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.800
 Survived injury just before 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.199
 decided on the kickoff 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.930
 52 minutes now played one of the few 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:09.460
 good opportunities for guests with 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:11.920
 everyone but great parried by tim beecker 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.400
 in the gate 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:19.610
 Nether bridge from back to front 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.350
 concentrated and present well organized 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.780
 and again and again with dangerous ones 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.430
 Attacks of the counter over waldrich the 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:31.910
 sits down heavily by serving what in 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:34.970
 laurenz wassinger even increases to 5 21 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:39.140
 Memories are awake at the 5 to 0 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:43.670
 triumph of the wittgensteiner against 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:45.560
 Westfalia rhynern the all now similar 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:50.000
 rarely inferior before 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:52.880
 Nederbrücker box and if it is then 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.570
 the defense of the hosts to the place 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.790
 very attentive 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.800
 from a casting the team caught 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:05.330
 a dawn day, especially the attack duo 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.500
 waltrich and wassinger then again 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:12.920
 to delete lubasa and that is Roman 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.500
 finds bohemia switched on increased 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:20.420
 six to one half dozen is full 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:22.250
 who would have thought we jump in 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.220
 the final phase florian schnorrenberg 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:28.730
 picks up markus waldrich from the r 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.380
 holds much applause the table leads that 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.530
 will be a real gossip 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:36.620
 We are once again experiencing the key 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:40.520
 ball philipp boehmer the header of 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:45.190
 wassinger markus was responsible for the china 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:47.270
 finish 7 to 1 holiday for Erndtebrück 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.220
 fasko for everyone 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.990
 I think today the team is 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.950
 So I wanted more from the beginning 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.430
 we have seen that we longer 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.650
 wanted to 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.780
 and we will be at seven gates 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.120
 Of course in the back then still 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.100
 maybe too much but was good for us 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.650
 that for us at height, of course 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.580
 happen 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.080
 At the end I think every shot was fired 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.520
 hit 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.180
 and we must now first 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.790
 analyze 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.140
 shortly after the game after such a game 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.430
 are still missing the words I believe we 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.070
 were not completely one today 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.690
 As I said some situations 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.070
 will have been there where such a game 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.380
 maybe it turns in the other direction 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.840
 she did not get that way either 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.880
 as you imagine 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.260
 accordingly, I believe today 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.300
 highly deserved then with such a clap 

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.900
 from the place we had nine points today 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.730
 Residue 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.560
 we still have 6 residue left 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.570
 and then everything is very tight and we 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.310
 every week need a good day shape 

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.500
 to play games in our favor 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.680
 decide and of course we lead ourselves 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.270
 above, but clearly must be hard 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.220
 work to stay up 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.860
 I think we just clean ourselves now 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:52.070
 in the mouth and now found such a long 

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:54.920
 Travel back then we grab the thing 

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:57.280
 again I believe we are not 

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.180
 free of charge up there with his series and 

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.240
 are not assumed that the 

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.440
 here breaks today and now there are new ones 

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.000
 series on my legs and me 

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.420
 I am firmly convinced that he is in to 

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.420
 the situation is
