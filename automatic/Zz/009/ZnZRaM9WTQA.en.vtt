00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
what is up guys so with season 5 like

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.220 
what is up guys so with season 5 like
wave<00:00:02.490> control<00:00:02.970> and<00:00:03.179> freezing<00:00:03.689> has<00:00:03.840> become

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
wave control and freezing has become

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.869 
wave control and freezing has become
even<00:00:04.410> more<00:00:04.740> important<00:00:05.339> in<00:00:05.460> bot<00:00:05.700> lane

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
even more important in bot lane

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.970 
even more important in bot lane
especially<00:00:06.569> so<00:00:06.899> with<00:00:07.020> these<00:00:07.140> rise<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.740> these

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
especially so with these rise of these

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.860 
especially so with these rise of these
mega<00:00:08.280> tanks<00:00:08.820> with<00:00:08.970> cinderhulk<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.660> stuff

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
mega tanks with cinderhulk and stuff

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.839 
mega tanks with cinderhulk and stuff
like<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.260> it's<00:00:10.530> even<00:00:11.010> more<00:00:11.160> important<00:00:11.670> for

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
like that it's even more important for

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.509 
like that it's even more important for
ATS<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.450> get<00:00:12.630> farm<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.320> items<00:00:13.799> quickly<00:00:14.250> and

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
ATS to get farm and items quickly and

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.820 
ATS to get farm and items quickly and
well<00:00:15.000> if<00:00:15.299> you're<00:00:15.690> freezing<00:00:16.260> you're<00:00:16.470> making

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
well if you're freezing you're making

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.800 
well if you're freezing you're making
the<00:00:16.920> enemy<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> be<00:00:17.460> weak<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.510> huge

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
the enemy a be weak and it's a huge

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.810 
the enemy a be weak and it's a huge
advantage<00:00:18.930> for<00:00:19.619> your<00:00:19.710> team<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.670> big

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
advantage for your team so the big

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.000 
advantage for your team so the big
reasons<00:00:21.270> why<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.660> would<00:00:21.930> freeze<00:00:22.260> are<00:00:22.680> because

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
reasons why you would freeze are because

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.439 
reasons why you would freeze are because
it<00:00:23.130> makes<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.400> easier<00:00:23.789> if<00:00:23.880> your<00:00:24.060> jungler<00:00:24.420> to

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
it makes it easier if your jungler to

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.140 
it makes it easier if your jungler to
gank<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.140> denies<00:00:25.410> experience<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.430> denies<00:00:26.730> gold

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
gank it denies experience it denies gold

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.210 
gank it denies experience it denies gold

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
from the enemy carry just before we kick

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.310 
from the enemy carry just before we kick
off<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.730> case<00:00:29.910> anyone<00:00:30.300> isn't<00:00:30.599> sure<00:00:30.840> wave

off in case anyone isn't sure wave

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.440 
off in case anyone isn't sure wave
control<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:32.009> talking<00:00:32.399> about<00:00:32.489> how<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:32.969> manage

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
control is talking about how you manage

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.990 
control is talking about how you manage
the<00:00:33.480> minions<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.170> your<00:00:34.350> lane<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.860> freezing<00:00:35.760> is

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the minions in your lane and freezing is

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.639 
the minions in your lane and freezing is
keeping<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.510> wave<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.960> an<00:00:37.110> advantageous

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
keeping the wave in an advantageous

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.680 
keeping the wave in an advantageous
position<00:00:37.950> for<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.790> while<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.300> keeps<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
position for you while it keeps the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.869 
position for you while it keeps the
enemy<00:00:39.870> away<00:00:40.260> from<00:00:40.770> them<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.550> best<00:00:41.730> place

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
enemy away from them so the best place

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.119 
enemy away from them so the best place
to<00:00:41.969> start<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.629> wave<00:00:43.260> control<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.010> there

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
to start is with wave control and there

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.619 
to start is with wave control and there
are<00:00:44.219> kind<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.489> three<00:00:44.550> positions<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
are kind of three positions that the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.690 
are kind of three positions that the
wave<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:46.079> have<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.500> bot<00:00:46.739> lane<00:00:46.920> either<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
wave can have in bot lane either the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.520 
wave can have in bot lane either the
minions<00:00:48.059> will<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.390> towards<00:00:48.840> your<00:00:49.079> turret

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
minions will be towards your turret

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.200 
minions will be towards your turret
they'll<00:00:49.770> be<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> middle<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> lane<00:00:50.940> or

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
they'll be in the middle of the lane or

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.029 
they'll be in the middle of the lane or
towards<00:00:51.690> their<00:00:51.960> turret<00:00:52.440> we're<00:00:52.800> gonna<00:00:52.890> be

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
towards their turret we're gonna be

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.770 
towards their turret we're gonna be
looking<00:00:53.160> at<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> bird's<00:00:53.910> eye<00:00:54.090> view<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.390> bot<00:00:54.629> Lane

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
looking at a bird's eye view of bot Lane

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.720 
looking at a bird's eye view of bot Lane
because<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> easiest<00:00:56.489> way

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
because this is really the easiest way

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.860 
because this is really the easiest way
that<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.180> show<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.480> these<00:00:57.660> different

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that I can show you these different

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.770 
that I can show you these different
zones<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.800> why<00:00:59.219> each<00:00:59.760> one<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.149> gonna<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.480> good

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
zones and why each one is gonna be good

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900 
zones and why each one is gonna be good
so<00:01:01.199> first<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:02.219> turret<00:01:02.699> so

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
so first one is that your turret so

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.850 
so first one is that your turret so
their<00:01:03.149> minions<00:01:03.449> outnumber<00:01:04.229> yours<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.799> it

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
their minions outnumber yours and it

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.770 
their minions outnumber yours and it
means<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.159> can't<00:01:05.460> trade<00:01:05.850> because<00:01:06.299> they<00:01:06.540> have

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
means you can't trade because they have

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.929 
means you can't trade because they have
the<00:01:06.900> mini<00:01:07.110> advantage<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.070> will<00:01:08.400> eventually

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the mini advantage it will eventually

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.789 
the mini advantage it will eventually
push<00:01:09.210> into<00:01:09.420> tower<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.110> you'll<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> farm

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
push into tower and you'll have to farm

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.530 
push into tower and you'll have to farm
under<00:01:11.010> Tower<00:01:11.340> now<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.880> doesn't<00:01:12.180> sound<00:01:12.330> too

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
under Tower now this doesn't sound too

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.020 
under Tower now this doesn't sound too
bad<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:13.170> they<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.530> no<00:01:13.799> minions<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.490> kill<00:01:14.760> so

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
bad but they have no minions to kill so

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.060 
bad but they have no minions to kill so
they<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.330> focus<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.900> hitting<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.590> whereas

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
they can focus on hitting you whereas

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.039 
they can focus on hitting you whereas
you<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.549> minions<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.090> kill<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.900> to

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
you have minions to kill so you have to

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.440 
you have minions to kill so you have to
split<00:01:19.320> your<00:01:19.530> focus<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:20.490> are<00:01:20.640> unlikely<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.299> get

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
split your focus you are unlikely to get

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.420 
split your focus you are unlikely to get
ganks<00:01:21.840> unless<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.229> get<00:01:22.350> poked<00:01:22.680> too<00:01:22.950> much<00:01:23.159> and

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
ganks unless you get poked too much and

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.670 
ganks unless you get poked too much and
dived<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:24.240> they<00:01:24.420> do<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.930> lane<00:01:25.200> control<00:01:25.590> in

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
dived but they do have lane control in

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.770 
dived but they do have lane control in
this<00:01:25.799> position<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.909> moving<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> middle

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
this position so moving on to the middle

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.020 
this position so moving on to the middle
zone<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.350> orange<00:01:28.829> zone<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.430> they<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.880> zone

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
zone the orange zone and they can zone

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.240 
zone the orange zone and they can zone
you<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.509> they're<00:01:30.840> ahead<00:01:31.020> or<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:32.070> zone

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
you if they're ahead or you can zone

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.620 
you if they're ahead or you can zone
them<00:01:32.520> if<00:01:32.759> you're<00:01:33.180> ahead

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
them if you're ahead

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.810 
them if you're ahead
and<00:01:33.900> because<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.710> minions<00:01:35.100> are<00:01:35.400> gonna<00:01:35.610> be

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
and because the minions are gonna be

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.340 
and because the minions are gonna be
equal<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.329> either<00:01:36.479> side<00:01:36.869> there's<00:01:37.170> no

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
equal on either side there's no

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.289 
equal on either side there's no
advantage<00:01:37.650> here<00:01:38.189> when<00:01:38.729> you're<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.090> dead

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
advantage here when you're in the dead

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.730 
advantage here when you're in the dead
center<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.900> lane<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.290> actually<00:01:40.560> quite

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
center of a lane it's actually quite

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.289 
center of a lane it's actually quite
difficult<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.430> gank<00:01:41.640> Eve<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.030> you're<00:01:42.180> probably

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
difficult to gank Eve so you're probably

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.719 
difficult to gank Eve so you're probably
unlikely<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.380> get<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.189> position

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
unlikely to get going to this position

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.280 
unlikely to get going to this position
and<00:01:44.939> if<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.299> are<00:01:45.479> gonna<00:01:45.630> get<00:01:45.840> ganked<00:01:46.079> you'll

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
and if you are gonna get ganked you'll

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.350 
and if you are gonna get ganked you'll
get<00:01:46.500> ganked<00:01:46.740> from<00:01:46.950> behind<00:01:47.310> when<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.000> lane<00:01:48.180> is

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
get ganked from behind when the lane is

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.030 
get ganked from behind when the lane is
in<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> middle<00:01:48.899> here<00:01:49.140> Lane<00:01:49.409> control<00:01:49.860> is

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
in the middle here Lane control is

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.310 
in the middle here Lane control is
pretty<00:01:50.340> even<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.090> comes<00:01:51.329> down<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.600> who<00:01:52.079> is

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
pretty even and it comes down to who is

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.800 
pretty even and it comes down to who is
actually<00:01:52.560> stronger<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.579> fire<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.450> finally

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
actually stronger in a fire so finally

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.420 
actually stronger in a fire so finally
moving<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> red<00:01:55.649> zone<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.280> is

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
moving on to the red zone and this is

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.160 
moving on to the red zone and this is
when<00:01:56.610> you're<00:01:56.759> pushing<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.540> your<00:01:57.810> minions

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
when you're pushing so your minions

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.590 
when you're pushing so your minions
outnumber<00:01:58.829> there<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.399> you're<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.790> control<00:01:59.820> you

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
outnumber there so you're in control you

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.330 
outnumber there so you're in control you
can<00:02:00.780> trade<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.320> can<00:02:01.469> put<00:02:01.710> them<00:02:01.890> under<00:02:02.100> Tower

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
can trade you can put them under Tower

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.730 
can trade you can put them under Tower
for<00:02:02.579> free<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.090> they<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.600> focus<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:04.140> csing

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
for free and they have to focus on csing

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.709 
for free and they have to focus on csing
so<00:02:05.189> at<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.460> point<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.820> are<00:02:05.850> likely<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.479> get

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
so at this point you are likely to get

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.139 
so at this point you are likely to get
ganked<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.799> have<00:02:08.039> lane<00:02:08.310> control<00:02:08.610> even

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
ganked but you do have lane control even

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.850 
ganked but you do have lane control even
if<00:02:09.270> you're<00:02:09.390> not<00:02:09.539> actually<00:02:09.690> stronger<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.530> 2v2

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
if you're not actually stronger in a 2v2

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.190 
if you're not actually stronger in a 2v2
fire<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.970> those<00:02:12.180> are<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> three<00:02:12.870> main

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
fire so those are the three main

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.890 
fire so those are the three main
outcomes

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
outcomes

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.539 
outcomes
of<00:02:13.959> wave<00:02:14.170> control<00:02:14.590> botlane<00:02:14.980> but<00:02:15.220> let's<00:02:15.400> just

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
of wave control botlane but let's just

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.490 
of wave control botlane but let's just
kind<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.790> look<00:02:16.030> at<00:02:16.120> how<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.450> achieve<00:02:16.959> each<00:02:17.230> one

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
kind of look at how you achieve each one

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.500 
kind of look at how you achieve each one
I<00:02:17.530> guess<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.459> pushing<00:02:18.849> is<00:02:19.000> going<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.239> get<00:02:19.420> you

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
I guess so pushing is going to get you

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.360 
I guess so pushing is going to get you
an<00:02:19.599> advantage<00:02:19.959> it's<00:02:20.439> the<00:02:20.530> easiest<00:02:21.040> way<00:02:21.310> to

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
an advantage it's the easiest way to

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.190 
an advantage it's the easiest way to
establish<00:02:22.060> lane<00:02:22.299> control<00:02:22.720> because<00:02:23.079> they

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
establish lane control because they

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.170 
establish lane control because they
can't<00:02:23.470> really<00:02:23.709> fight<00:02:23.950> back<00:02:24.189> and<00:02:24.549> it<00:02:24.849> forces

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
can't really fight back and it forces

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.630 
can't really fight back and it forces
them<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.480> focus<00:02:26.019> on<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.409> minions<00:02:26.799> and<00:02:27.040> not<00:02:27.310> you

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
them to focus on the minions and not you

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.270 
them to focus on the minions and not you
they<00:02:28.150> may<00:02:28.360> miss<00:02:28.540> some<00:02:28.810> CS<00:02:29.110> under<00:02:29.500> Tower<00:02:29.769> but

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
they may miss some CS under Tower but

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.160 
they may miss some CS under Tower but
you're<00:02:30.459> still<00:02:30.819> feeding<00:02:31.209> them<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.659> wave<00:02:31.870> by

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
you're still feeding them the wave by

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.050 
you're still feeding them the wave by
pushing<00:02:32.439> it<00:02:32.680> into<00:02:32.829> them<00:02:33.159> so<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:33.430> are<00:02:33.609> still<00:02:33.879> in

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
pushing it into them so you are still in

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.149 
pushing it into them so you are still in
control<00:02:34.390> but<00:02:34.810> kind<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.349> what<00:02:35.590> good<00:02:35.769> is<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:35.950> if

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
control but kind of what good is it if

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.280 
control but kind of what good is it if
you're<00:02:36.430> still<00:02:36.700> feeding<00:02:37.000> them<00:02:37.299> gold<00:02:37.599> so<00:02:38.170> this

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
you're still feeding them gold so this

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.929 
you're still feeding them gold so this
is<00:02:38.439> kind<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.739> where<00:02:38.890> freezing<00:02:39.370> comes<00:02:39.640> in<00:02:39.819> this

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
is kind of where freezing comes in this

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.970 
is kind of where freezing comes in this
is<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.209> way<00:02:40.359> you<00:02:40.420> deny<00:02:40.900> gold<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.829> way<00:02:41.950> to

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
is the way you deny gold so the way to

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.190 
is the way you deny gold so the way to
do<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.549> to<00:02:42.730> push<00:02:42.939> the<00:02:43.090> wave<00:02:43.239> into<00:02:43.480> tower<00:02:43.810> and

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
do it is to push the wave into tower and

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.349 
do it is to push the wave into tower and
when<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.620> comes<00:02:44.799> back<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.400> will<00:02:45.489> slowly<00:02:45.940> push

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
when it comes back it will slowly push

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.660 
when it comes back it will slowly push
to<00:02:46.599> you<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:47.230> only<00:02:47.409> want<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:47.769> last<00:02:47.950> hit<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.459> let

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
to you you only want to last hit and let

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.819 
to you you only want to last hit and let
the<00:02:48.790> wave<00:02:48.970> ease<00:02:49.269> back<00:02:49.690> just<00:02:50.109> pass<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.530> middle

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
the wave ease back just pass the middle

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.890 
the wave ease back just pass the middle
towards<00:02:51.340> your<00:02:51.489> tower<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:52.299> this<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.599> where<00:02:52.780> you

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
towards your tower so this is where you

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.140 
towards your tower so this is where you
can<00:02:53.109> freeze<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.829> zone<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.220> enemy<00:02:54.549> ad<00:02:54.760> carry

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
can freeze and zone the enemy ad carry

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.270 
can freeze and zone the enemy ad carry
properly<00:02:55.720> if<00:02:55.959> they<00:02:56.170> come<00:02:56.409> for<00:02:56.620> CS<00:02:56.859> you<00:02:57.069> leave

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
properly if they come for CS you leave

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.949 
properly if they come for CS you leave
the<00:02:57.430> wave<00:02:57.579> and<00:02:57.819> you<00:02:57.879> fire<00:02:58.180> them<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.599> if<00:02:58.810> they

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
the wave and you fire them and if they

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.539 
the wave and you fire them and if they
don't<00:02:59.290> then<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.620> continue<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.189> last-hit

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
don't then you continue to last-hit

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.699 
don't then you continue to last-hit
sometimes<00:03:01.269> killing<00:03:01.569> a<00:03:01.750> few<00:03:01.930> more<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.379> keep<00:03:02.560> the

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
sometimes killing a few more to keep the

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.920 
sometimes killing a few more to keep the
wave<00:03:02.889> where<00:03:03.189> it<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.519> so<00:03:04.090> if<00:03:04.209> we<00:03:04.329> go<00:03:04.450> back<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.810> our

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
wave where it is so if we go back to our

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.110 
wave where it is so if we go back to our
zone<00:03:05.200> example<00:03:05.769> from<00:03:06.010> before<00:03:06.400> this<00:03:06.700> is<00:03:06.879> kind<00:03:07.090> of

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
zone example from before this is kind of

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.089 
zone example from before this is kind of
the<00:03:07.239> ideal<00:03:07.689> place<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.260> really<00:03:08.409> have<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.739> freeze

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
the ideal place to really have a freeze

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.099 
the ideal place to really have a freeze
it's<00:03:09.430> not<00:03:09.670> too<00:03:09.909> close<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.389> your<00:03:10.480> tower<00:03:10.780> but

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
it's not too close to your tower but

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.140 
it's not too close to your tower but
it's<00:03:11.290> at<00:03:11.379> the<00:03:11.620> end<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:12.159> your<00:03:12.250> lane<00:03:12.549> what<00:03:13.030> you're

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
it's at the end of your lane what you're

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.330 
it's at the end of your lane what you're
really<00:03:13.329> achieving<00:03:13.959> or<00:03:14.170> doing<00:03:14.560> by<00:03:14.769> all<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.159> this

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
really achieving or doing by all of this

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.520 
really achieving or doing by all of this
is<00:03:15.579> you're<00:03:15.879> forcing<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.450> enemy<00:03:16.750> ad<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.290> sit

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
is you're forcing the enemy ad to sit

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.289 
is you're forcing the enemy ad to sit
back<00:03:17.739> they're<00:03:18.129> gonna<00:03:18.280> miss<00:03:18.519> gold<00:03:18.879> um<00:03:19.150> it's

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
back they're gonna miss gold um it's

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.059 
back they're gonna miss gold um it's
experience<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.169> it's<00:03:20.349> putting<00:03:20.560> them<00:03:20.799> further

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
experience and it's putting them further

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.979 
experience and it's putting them further
behind<00:03:21.370> than<00:03:21.819> if<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.090> were<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.449> push<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.840> wave

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
behind than if you were to push the wave

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.869 
behind than if you were to push the wave
into<00:03:23.290> them<00:03:23.620> so<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.220> might<00:03:24.459> have<00:03:24.549> seen<00:03:24.730> this

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
into them so you might have seen this

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.879 
into them so you might have seen this
clip<00:03:25.150> already<00:03:25.329> I<00:03:25.599> did<00:03:25.870> run<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:26.169> earlier<00:03:26.500> when<00:03:26.829> I

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
clip already I did run it earlier when I

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.920 
clip already I did run it earlier when I
was<00:03:27.069> talking<00:03:27.310> about<00:03:27.819> freezing<00:03:28.209> but<00:03:28.569> I<00:03:28.660> wanted

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
was talking about freezing but I wanted

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.689 
was talking about freezing but I wanted
to<00:03:29.019> go<00:03:29.169> over<00:03:29.409> it<00:03:29.530> properly<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.159> show<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.400> what

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
to go over it properly to show you what

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.030 
to go over it properly to show you what
I<00:03:30.730> mean<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.419> in<00:03:31.629> this<00:03:31.780> clip<00:03:32.049> jinx<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.560> csing

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
I mean so in this clip jinx is csing

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.649 
I mean so in this clip jinx is csing
pretty<00:03:33.280> well<00:03:33.519> under<00:03:33.790> towel<00:03:34.000> she's<00:03:34.359> actually

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
pretty well under towel she's actually

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.140 
pretty well under towel she's actually
hardly<00:03:34.989> missing<00:03:35.409> any<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:36.040> amumu<00:03:36.459> is<00:03:36.819> starting

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
hardly missing any and amumu is starting

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.789 
hardly missing any and amumu is starting
to<00:03:37.269> sniff<00:03:37.480> around<00:03:37.599> for<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:38.049> gank<00:03:38.319> because<00:03:38.680> I've

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
to sniff around for a gank because I've

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.530 
to sniff around for a gank because I've
been<00:03:38.980> pushing<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:39.609> long<00:03:39.819> so<00:03:40.030> this<00:03:40.180> is<00:03:40.359> when<00:03:40.510> I

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
been pushing so long so this is when I

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.839 
been pushing so long so this is when I
decided<00:03:40.989> to<00:03:41.139> freeze<00:03:41.560> I<00:03:41.919> back<00:03:42.310> away<00:03:42.340> from<00:03:42.609> the

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
decided to freeze I back away from the

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.939 
decided to freeze I back away from the
wave<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.389> I<00:03:43.659> only<00:03:44.079> last<00:03:44.290> hit<00:03:44.560> as<00:03:44.709> late<00:03:44.919> as

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:44.949 
wave and I only last hit as late as

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:47.159 
wave and I only last hit as late as
possible<00:03:45.129> and<00:03:45.639> I<00:03:46.060> slowly<00:03:46.389> let<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:46.780> reach<00:03:46.959> my

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
possible and I slowly let it reach my

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.170 
possible and I slowly let it reach my
tower<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:48.129> when<00:03:48.280> you've<00:03:48.400> decided<00:03:48.729> to<00:03:48.849> freeze

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
tower so when you've decided to freeze

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.089 
tower so when you've decided to freeze
you<00:03:49.510> will<00:03:49.780> actually<00:03:49.959> let<00:03:50.260> her<00:03:50.409> get<00:03:50.560> some<00:03:50.620> CS

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
you will actually let her get some CS

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.890 
you will actually let her get some CS
while<00:03:51.340> she<00:03:51.519> pushes<00:03:51.879> it<00:03:51.909> into<00:03:52.180> you<00:03:52.479> but<00:03:52.780> you

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
while she pushes it into you but you

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.119 
while she pushes it into you but you
just<00:03:53.109> have<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.290> remember<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:53.799> that's

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
just have to remember that that's

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.069 
just have to remember that that's
nothing<00:03:54.669> compared<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.180> what<00:03:55.299> you're<00:03:55.629> about<00:03:55.870> to

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
nothing compared to what you're about to

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.899 
nothing compared to what you're about to
deny<00:03:56.379> her<00:03:56.620> now<00:03:57.099> you'll<00:03:57.220> see<00:03:57.400> I<00:03:57.430> take<00:03:57.760> these

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
deny her now you'll see I take these

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.089 
deny her now you'll see I take these
caster<00:03:58.389> minions<00:03:58.720> myself<00:03:59.349> so<00:03:59.590> that<00:03:59.769> they<00:03:59.859> don't

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
caster minions myself so that they don't

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.550 
caster minions myself so that they don't
attack<00:04:00.430> my<00:04:00.639> minions<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.299> then<00:04:01.659> I<00:04:01.750> use<00:04:01.959> my<00:04:01.989> Q<00:04:02.409> to

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
attack my minions and then I use my Q to

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.199 
attack my minions and then I use my Q to
thin<00:04:02.799> them<00:04:02.949> out<00:04:03.069> a<00:04:03.099> little<00:04:03.310> bit<00:04:03.519> so<00:04:03.669> they<00:04:03.940> don't

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
thin them out a little bit so they don't

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.270 
thin them out a little bit so they don't
push<00:04:04.419> too<00:04:04.750> hard<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:05.319> then<00:04:05.530> I<00:04:05.560> start<00:04:05.949> to<00:04:06.069> only

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
push too hard and then I start to only

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.309 
push too hard and then I start to only
last<00:04:06.609> hit<00:04:06.819> again<00:04:07.120> this<00:04:07.599> is<00:04:07.840> really<00:04:08.199> the

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
last hit again this is really the

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.319 
last hit again this is really the
perfect<00:04:08.560> position<00:04:08.949> to<00:04:09.280> hold<00:04:09.639> a<00:04:09.819> wave<00:04:10.000> and

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
perfect position to hold a wave and

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.119 
perfect position to hold a wave and
freeze<00:04:10.659> it<00:04:10.840> if<00:04:10.959> you're<00:04:11.079> stronger<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:11.799> as<00:04:11.949> you

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
freeze it if you're stronger and as you

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.250 
freeze it if you're stronger and as you
see<00:04:12.340> jinx<00:04:12.729> comes<00:04:12.940> forward<00:04:13.359> to<00:04:13.510> try<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:13.870> CS<00:04:14.229> and

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
see jinx comes forward to try and CS and

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.710 
see jinx comes forward to try and CS and
we<00:04:14.709> instantly<00:04:15.129> get<00:04:15.400> our<00:04:15.549> flash<00:04:15.819> so<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:16.570> last

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
we instantly get our flash so the last

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.449 
we instantly get our flash so the last
thing<00:04:16.959> to<00:04:17.109> really<00:04:17.349> point<00:04:17.530> out<00:04:17.799> is<00:04:18.039> a<00:04:18.070> little

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
thing to really point out is a little

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.099 
thing to really point out is a little
bit<00:04:18.579> different<00:04:18.940> with<00:04:19.090> lane<00:04:19.269> control<00:04:19.479> and<00:04:19.959> it's

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
bit different with lane control and it's

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.440 
bit different with lane control and it's
when<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.470> push<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:21.010> when<00:04:21.099> to<00:04:21.280> base<00:04:21.699> so<00:04:22.240> bot

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
when to push and when to base so bot

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.240 
when to push and when to base so bot
lane<00:04:22.599> is<00:04:22.810> very<00:04:23.080> item<00:04:23.469> dependent<00:04:24.039> right

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
you're gonna base first this is a

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.230 
you're gonna base first this is a
question<00:04:37.040> that<00:04:37.070> people<00:04:37.220> ask<00:04:37.610> me<00:04:37.880> a<00:04:37.910> lot<00:04:38.210> you

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
question that people ask me a lot you

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.060

wave<00:04:40.340> really<00:04:41.060> hard<00:04:41.330> and<00:04:41.630> then<00:04:41.750> leave

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
wave really hard and then leave

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.560 
wave really hard and then leave
straightaway<00:04:42.290> if<00:04:42.980> you<00:04:43.250> base<00:04:43.460> after<00:04:43.760> either

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
straightaway if you base after either

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.300 
straightaway if you base after either
you<00:04:44.720> kill<00:04:44.960> your<00:04:45.170> opponent<00:04:45.590> or<00:04:45.710> you<00:04:45.830> force<00:04:46.160> them

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
to leave you want to push that wave into

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.350 
to leave you want to push that wave into
tower<00:04:48.500> and<00:04:48.890> make<00:04:49.040> them<00:04:49.220> miss<00:04:49.430> as<00:04:49.610> much<00:04:49.850> as<00:04:50.060> yes

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
tower and make them miss as much as yes

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.510 
tower and make them miss as much as yes
as<00:04:50.570> possible<00:04:51.170> the<00:04:51.560> worst<00:04:51.860> thing<00:04:52.040> you<00:04:52.160> can<00:04:52.310> do

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
as possible the worst thing you can do

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.970 
as possible the worst thing you can do
is<00:04:52.820> not<00:04:53.240> push<00:04:53.570> it<00:04:53.810> because<00:04:54.290> a<00:04:54.320> wave<00:04:54.650> is<00:04:54.890> gonna

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
is not push it because a wave is gonna

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.770 
is not push it because a wave is gonna
build<00:04:55.340> up<00:04:55.490> with<00:04:55.700> that<00:04:55.880> wave<00:04:56.120> already<00:04:56.540> there

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
build up with that wave already there

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.510 
build up with that wave already there
and<00:04:57.020> another<00:04:57.350> one<00:04:57.530> coming<00:04:57.830> in<00:04:58.100> and<00:04:58.370> you'll

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
and another one coming in and you'll

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.280 
and another one coming in and you'll
give<00:04:58.700> them<00:04:58.880> all<00:04:59.090> this<00:04:59.300> experience<00:04:59.840> and<00:05:00.020> gold

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
give them all this experience and gold

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.320 
give them all this experience and gold
from<00:05:00.590> those<00:05:00.800> waves<00:05:01.220> that<00:05:01.550> are<00:05:01.640> built<00:05:01.910> up<00:05:02.090> and

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
from those waves that are built up and

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.270 
from those waves that are built up and
you<00:05:02.540> won't<00:05:02.780> get<00:05:02.870> any<00:05:02.930> advantage<00:05:03.620> from<00:05:03.650> forcing

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
you won't get any advantage from forcing

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.250 
you won't get any advantage from forcing
them<00:05:04.400> out<00:05:04.460> of<00:05:04.610> Lane<00:05:04.880> so<00:05:05.450> these<00:05:05.570> are<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:05.840> basics

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
them out of Lane so these are the basics

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.200 
them out of Lane so these are the basics
of<00:05:06.410> weight<00:05:06.680> control<00:05:07.010> and<00:05:07.310> freezing<00:05:07.880> I<00:05:08.060> guess

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
of weight control and freezing I guess

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.060 
of weight control and freezing I guess
in<00:05:08.390> simple<00:05:08.780> terms<00:05:09.020> but<00:05:09.290> this<00:05:09.410> is<00:05:09.560> all<00:05:09.740> you<00:05:09.950> need

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
in simple terms but this is all you need

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.070 
in simple terms but this is all you need
to<00:05:10.220> know<00:05:10.460> until<00:05:10.730> you<00:05:11.030> reach<00:05:11.210> a<00:05:11.420> low<00:05:11.630> Diamond

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
to know until you reach a low Diamond

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.050 
to know until you reach a low Diamond
standard<00:05:12.650> just<00:05:13.010> try<00:05:13.310> it<00:05:13.370> in<00:05:13.550> your<00:05:13.670> next<00:05:13.820> game

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
standard just try it in your next game

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.090 
standard just try it in your next game
and<00:05:14.390> I<00:05:14.660> promise<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:15.320> you<00:05:15.440> will<00:05:15.560> see<00:05:15.770> a<00:05:15.800> bigger

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
and I promise you you will see a bigger

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.650 
and I promise you you will see a bigger
difference<00:05:16.550> between<00:05:16.640> how<00:05:17.090> strong<00:05:17.390> you<00:05:17.630> are

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
difference between how strong you are

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.750 
difference between how strong you are
and<00:05:17.840> how<00:05:18.230> strong<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:18.680> enemy<00:05:18.830> ID<00:05:19.160> is<00:05:19.430> by<00:05:19.700> the

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
and how strong the enemy ID is by the

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.909 
and how strong the enemy ID is by the
end<00:05:19.970> of<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.180> lane<00:05:20.390> phase<00:05:20.660> as<00:05:21.020> always<00:05:21.500> so<00:05:21.680> that

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
end of the lane phase as always so that

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.740 
end of the lane phase as always so that
is<00:05:22.070> all<00:05:22.280> for<00:05:22.310> this<00:05:22.550> video<00:05:22.730> so<00:05:23.240> I'll<00:05:23.419> catch<00:05:23.600> you

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
is all for this video so I'll catch you

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.169 
is all for this video so I'll catch you
