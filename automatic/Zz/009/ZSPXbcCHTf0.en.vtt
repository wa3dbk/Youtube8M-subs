perfect for the fall it's a little bit

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.430 
perfect for the fall it's a little bit
dramatic<00:05:31.150> so<00:05:31.630> it<00:05:31.750> might<00:05:31.930> not<00:05:31.960> appeal<00:05:32.410> to

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
dramatic so it might not appeal to

dramatic so it might not appeal to
