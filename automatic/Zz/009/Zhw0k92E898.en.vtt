 human anatomy dot net presents bone 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:08.590
 hyoid 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.559
 The hyoid bone is shaped like a USA 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:15.769
 is located at c3 level above 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.830
 of the thyroid cartilage is divided into 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.740
 body that is convex anterior in 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.349
 transverse direction presents a crest 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.710
 transversal that divides the anterior face 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:30.110
 in two upper horizontal zones and 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.710
 vertical bottom 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.660
 it has some greater antlers or thyroid 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.330
 these antlers are to flat from below 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.780
 up end at the vertex 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.180
 dilating and rounding its edges 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.920
 internal and external are continuous with the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.850
 upper and lower edges of 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.760
 body the thyroid membrane originates 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.079
 of the inner edge of the larger horns and 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.879
 of the upper body 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.589
 Minor antlers or style ideas you're antlers 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.240
 born from the union of the body and

 older antlers are not palpable in 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.119
 to its insertions the sweet tooth is born of 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.460
 is greater and the anterior face of 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.710
 body in relation to the artery 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.680
 lingual and the middle constrictor of the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.299
 pharynx pharynx style or inside 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.179
 of the posterior portion of the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.549
 greater the joy style of or outside the 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:29.610
 I glossed and in front of the slide 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.610
 for the tendon of the gastric d 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.580
 thyroid on the outer edge and the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.709
 adjacent portion of the body the gene and 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.460
 today from or on the front of the body 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:43.890
 and above it goes the genius glossed 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.799
 in the lower portion goes the milo I
