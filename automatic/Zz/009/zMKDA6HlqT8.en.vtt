this<00:04:33.430> just<00:04:33.849> to<00:04:34.000> kind<00:04:34.210> of<00:04:34.270> move<00:04:34.629> it<00:04:34.780> along<00:04:34.870> a

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
this just to kind of move it along a

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.999 
this just to kind of move it along a
little<00:04:35.229> bit<00:04:35.969> my<00:04:36.969> anubius<00:04:37.509> ever<00:04:38.259> since<00:04:38.560> i<00:04:38.650> added

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
little bit my anubius ever since i added

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.459 
little bit my anubius ever since i added
the<00:04:39.039> light<00:04:39.580> in<00:04:39.789> the<00:04:39.960> co2<00:04:40.960> is<00:04:41.349> just<00:04:42.240> it's<00:04:43.240> just

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:43.469 
the light in the co2 is just it's just

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:48.570 
the light in the co2 is just it's just
doing<00:04:44.469> amazingly<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:47.169> root<00:04:47.830> for<00:04:48.189> the<00:04:48.310> stem

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
doing amazingly the root for the stem

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.330 
doing amazingly the root for the stem
system<00:04:49.090> down<00:04:49.270> here<00:04:49.629> is<00:04:49.810> just<00:04:51.509> really<00:04:52.509> strong<00:04:52.870> I

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
system down here is just really strong I

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.619 
system down here is just really strong I
haven't<00:04:54.340> never<00:04:54.759> seen<00:04:55.030> this<00:04:55.120> plants<00:04:55.479> so

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 
haven't never seen this plants so

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:59.850 
haven't never seen this plants so

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
really excited about these I'll show you

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.399 
really excited about these I'll show you
guys<00:05:02.520> we're<00:05:03.520> all<00:05:03.669> you<00:05:04.000> know<00:05:04.030> review<00:05:05.020> this<00:05:05.199> as

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
guys we're all you know review this as

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.800 
guys we're all you know review this as
time<00:05:06.159> goes<00:05:06.400> on<00:05:06.520> I<00:05:06.580> still<00:05:06.969> have<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.210> API<00:05:07.509> leaf

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
time goes on I still have the API leaf

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.589 
time goes on I still have the API leaf
zone<00:05:08.400> but<00:05:09.400> I<00:05:09.430> really<00:05:09.909> think<00:05:10.060> that<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.330> floor

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
zone but I really think that the floor

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.360 
zone but I really think that the floor
is<00:05:10.629> going<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.169> be<00:05:11.289> much<00:05:11.500> better<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:11.979> see<00:05:12.159> ken

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
is going to be much better the see ken

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.240 
is going to be much better the see ken
is<00:05:12.520> just<00:05:12.669> a<00:05:12.819> a<00:05:13.060> more<00:05:13.719> trusted<00:05:14.169> brand<00:05:14.440> it's<00:05:15.129> been

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
is just a a more trusted brand it's been

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.360 
is just a a more trusted brand it's been
around<00:05:15.430> for<00:05:15.639> a<00:05:15.699> lot<00:05:15.789> longer<00:05:16.919> all<00:05:17.919> right<00:05:18.099> next

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
around for a lot longer all right next

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.040 
around for a lot longer all right next
thing<00:05:18.610> that<00:05:18.639> I<00:05:18.759> got<00:05:19.000> is<00:05:20.819> fluval<00:05:21.819> Pete<00:05:22.509> granules

have it right here i have it in this
media<00:05:35.740> bag<00:05:37.050> can't<00:05:38.050> see<00:05:38.199> it<00:05:38.289> too<00:05:38.440> well<00:05:38.469> but<00:05:38.889> i'm

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
media bag can't see it too well but i'm

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.579 
media bag can't see it too well but i'm
going<00:05:39.370> to<00:05:39.430> try<00:05:39.520> to<00:05:39.729> mess<00:05:40.150> around<00:05:40.270> with<00:05:40.750> some

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:41.589 
going to try to mess around with some

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:44.610 
going to try to mess around with some
water<00:05:41.800> chemistry<00:05:42.190> to<00:05:43.150> try<00:05:43.300> to<00:05:43.360> soften<00:05:43.690> the

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
water chemistry to try to soften the

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.610 
water chemistry to try to soften the
water<00:05:44.889> and<00:05:45.460> bring<00:05:45.639> the<00:05:45.789> ph<00:05:45.969> down<00:05:46.419> this<00:05:47.349> is<00:05:47.469> an

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
water and bring the ph down this is an

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.129 
water and bring the ph down this is an
all-natural<00:05:47.800> way<00:05:48.460> to<00:05:48.520> soften<00:05:48.969> and<00:05:49.389> bring<00:05:50.050> the

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
ph of your water down i know that my

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.029 
ph of your water down i know that my
cardinal<00:05:56.529> tetras<00:05:56.680> and<00:05:57.659> the<00:05:58.659> auto<00:05:59.080> cats<00:05:59.440> like<00:06:00.009> a

cardinal tetras and the auto cats like a

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.379 
cardinal tetras and the auto cats like a
softer<00:06:00.819> more<00:06:01.259> acidic<00:06:02.259> water<00:06:02.819> so<00:06:03.819> i'm<00:06:04.210> going<00:06:04.330> to

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
softer more acidic water so i'm going to

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:05.879 
softer more acidic water so i'm going to
mess<00:06:04.509> around<00:06:04.629> with<00:06:04.870> water<00:06:05.050> chemistry<00:06:05.379> in<00:06:05.680> my

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
mess around with water chemistry in my

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.249

hardness<00:06:46.620> test<00:06:47.010> in<00:06:47.250> it<00:06:47.370> so<00:06:47.490> i<00:06:47.550> had<00:06:47.699> to<00:06:47.790> buy<00:06:47.910> this

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
hardness test in it so i had to buy this

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.550 
hardness test in it so i had to buy this
separately<00:06:48.389> it<00:06:48.660> came<00:06:48.840> with<00:06:48.990> two<00:06:49.020> test<00:06:49.470> tubes

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
separately it came with two test tubes

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.810 
separately it came with two test tubes
and<00:06:49.919> to<00:06:50.550> test<00:06:51.180> bottles<00:06:52.310> and<00:06:53.310> i<00:06:53.370> think<00:06:53.580> it<00:06:53.639> says

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:53.820 
and to test bottles and i think it says

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.650 
and to test bottles and i think it says
it's<00:06:53.970> good<00:06:54.150> for<00:06:55.430> quite<00:06:56.430> a<00:06:56.490> few<00:06:56.580> hundred<00:06:57.000> tests

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
it's good for quite a few hundred tests

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.930 
it's good for quite a few hundred tests
actually<00:06:57.810> so<00:06:58.380> really<00:06:59.310> excited<00:06:59.669> about<00:06:59.760> this

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
actually so really excited about this

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.250 
actually so really excited about this
i'm<00:07:00.090> going<00:07:00.210> to<00:07:00.270> be<00:07:00.330> using<00:07:00.389> this<00:07:00.810> in

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:01.260 
i'm going to be using this in

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.290 
i'm going to be using this in
conjunction<00:07:01.560> with<00:07:01.919> the<00:07:02.250> peat<00:07:02.550> granules<00:07:03.060> to

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
conjunction with the peat granules to

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.670 
conjunction with the peat granules to
try<00:07:03.510> to<00:07:04.130> lower<00:07:05.130> the<00:07:06.200> hardness<00:07:07.200> of<00:07:07.380> the<00:07:07.470> water

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 
try to lower the hardness of the water

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.520 
try to lower the hardness of the water
and<00:07:08.040> also<00:07:08.910> use<00:07:09.150> the<00:07:09.360> pH<00:07:09.630> test<00:07:10.020> that<00:07:10.169> i<00:07:10.229> have<00:07:10.380> in

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530 
and also use the pH test that i have in

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.040 
and also use the pH test that i have in
the<00:07:10.620> master<00:07:10.919> test<00:07:11.160> cape<00:07:11.400> to<00:07:12.060> lower<00:07:12.240> the<00:07:12.450> ph<00:07:12.750> and

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
the master test cape to lower the ph and

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.990 
the master test cape to lower the ph and
try<00:07:13.169> to<00:07:13.229> find<00:07:13.500> the<00:07:13.650> right<00:07:15.650> right<00:07:16.650> quantity<00:07:17.250> of

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
try to find the right right quantity of

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.110 
try to find the right right quantity of
P<00:07:18.300> granules<00:07:18.720> to<00:07:19.050> use<00:07:19.229> inside<00:07:19.740> of<00:07:19.919> my<00:07:20.340> 20<00:07:20.820> gallon

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 
P granules to use inside of my 20 gallon

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.390 
P granules to use inside of my 20 gallon
tank<00:07:21.330> I'm<00:07:21.990> changing<00:07:22.470> the<00:07:22.560> water<00:07:22.740> right<00:07:22.979> now<00:07:23.010> so

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 
tank I'm changing the water right now so

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.719 
tank I'm changing the water right now so
that's<00:07:23.550> why<00:07:23.700> the<00:07:23.760> water<00:07:24.000> isn't<00:07:25.520> the<00:07:26.520> water

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:26.729 
that's why the water isn't the water

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:29.240 
that's why the water isn't the water
level<00:07:27.060> isn't<00:07:27.240> as<00:07:27.510> high<00:07:27.840> as<00:07:27.900> it<00:07:28.020> should<00:07:28.260> be<00:07:28.410> but

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:29.250 
level isn't as high as it should be but

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.500 
level isn't as high as it should be but
I<00:07:29.310> just<00:07:29.460> wanted<00:07:29.669> to<00:07:29.729> show<00:07:29.880> you<00:07:29.910> guys<00:07:30.030> what<00:07:30.389> I've
