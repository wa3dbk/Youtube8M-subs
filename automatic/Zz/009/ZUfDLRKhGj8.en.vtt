it's loaded under the keeper for a

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.930 
it's loaded under the keeper for a
really<00:00:52.620> no<00:00:52.739> solo<00:00:53.070> effort<00:00:53.399> from<00:00:53.550> Wallace<00:00:53.820> in

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
recording here because I just thought it

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.830 
recording here because I just thought it
was<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.640> perfect<00:01:23.850> skill<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.509> perfect

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
was like perfect skill for the perfect

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.570 
was like perfect skill for the perfect
moment<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.740> we're<00:01:25.890> all<00:01:25.950> pointy<00:01:26.369> thing<00:01:26.490> I

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
moment but we're all pointy thing I

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.800 
moment but we're all pointy thing I
don't<00:01:26.729> know<00:01:26.790> what<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:26.970> cool<00:01:27.210> but<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.479> just<00:01:27.600> goes

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
don't know what is cool but it just goes

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.539 
don't know what is cool but it just goes
through<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.110> tiny<00:01:28.530> little<00:01:28.680> guy<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.310> was<00:01:29.430> just

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
through that tiny little guy I was just

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.630 
through that tiny little guy I was just
like<00:01:29.670> oh<00:01:29.820> my<00:01:30.030> god<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.979> finished<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.189> into<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
like oh my god and finished it into the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.149 
like oh my god and finished it into the
corner<00:01:32.939> that's<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.180> really<00:01:33.450> nice<00:01:33.570> goal<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.159> he

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
corner that's a really nice goal and he

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.740 
corner that's a really nice goal and he
actually<00:01:35.250> gets<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:35.909> back<00:01:36.090> here<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.420> bit<00:01:36.689> of

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
actually gets one back here a bit of

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.179 
actually gets one back here a bit of
luxury<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.200> got<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.439> board<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
luxury I got the board but I go the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.319 
luxury I got the board but I go the
wrong<00:01:38.310> way<00:01:38.369> thinking<00:01:38.880> he<00:01:38.939> was<00:01:39.030> going<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.240> get

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
wrong way thinking he was going to get

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.480 
wrong way thinking he was going to get
outside<00:01:39.630> me<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.560> slot<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.009> sutherlin

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
outside me and just slot in sutherlin

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.490 
outside me and just slot in sutherlin
there<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.360> ends<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.720> game<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.200> was<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.350> nice

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
there and that ends a game it was a nice

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.350 
there and that ends a game it was a nice
3-1<00:01:44.040> win<00:01:44.250> had<00:01:44.460> some<00:01:44.579> really<00:01:44.759> nice<00:01:44.970> goals<00:01:45.240> in

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
3-1 win had some really nice goals in

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.240 
3-1 win had some really nice goals in
that<00:01:45.450> game<00:01:45.630> I'm<00:01:45.810> really<00:01:46.110> happy<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.950> couple

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.310 
that game I'm really happy with a couple
of<00:01:47.280> compilation<00:01:47.759> clips<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.299> but<00:01:49.079> we<00:01:49.140> can't

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
of compilation clips and but we can't

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.319 
of compilation clips and but we can't
the<00:01:49.439> game<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.770> macos<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.159> was<00:01:50.280> injured<00:01:50.640> yet

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the game and macos I was injured yet

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.770 
the game and macos I was injured yet
again<00:01:52.140> which<00:01:52.740> kind<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.040> sucks<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.720> but<00:01:54.720> I'll

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
again which kind of sucks and but I'll

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.209 
again which kind of sucks and but I'll
trying<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.020> work<00:01:55.140> out<00:01:55.259> chemistry<00:01:55.710> reasons<00:01:56.040> to

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
trying to work out chemistry reasons to

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.469 
trying to work out chemistry reasons to
try<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.520> sort<00:01:56.700> mounts<00:01:56.969> here<00:01:57.060> long<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.360> out

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
try and sort mounts here long is out

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.859 
try and sort mounts here long is out
full<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.340> just<00:01:59.340> get<00:01:59.729> kind<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.149> fit<00:02:00.450> into<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
full and just get kind of a fit into the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.230 
full and just get kind of a fit into the
game<00:02:01.280> but<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> trouble<00:02:02.610> with<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.000> team<00:02:03.149> at

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
game but the trouble with the team at

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.310 
game but the trouble with the team at
the<00:02:03.299> moment<00:02:03.570> obviously<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.869> lot<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.200> the

the moment obviously a lot of the
players<00:02:04.500> are<00:02:04.860> out<00:02:05.579> formation<00:02:05.880> out<00:02:06.240> position<00:02:06.630> I

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
players are out formation out position I

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.330 
players are out formation out position I
haven't<00:02:06.930> got<00:02:07.079> someone<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> fill<00:02:07.500> each<00:02:07.619> spot<00:02:08.009> so

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
haven't got someone to fill each spot so

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.619 
haven't got someone to fill each spot so
I'm<00:02:08.640> trying<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.879> find<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.270> know<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.479> best

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
I'm trying to find you know the best

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.180 
I'm trying to find you know the best
chemistry<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.200> for<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.410> best<00:02:10.590> skills<00:02:10.979> is

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
chemistry of for the best skills is

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.559 
chemistry of for the best skills is
actually<00:02:11.459> quite<00:02:11.550> tough<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.330> Senate

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
actually quite tough and the Senate

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.590 
actually quite tough and the Senate
attacking<00:02:12.840> made<00:02:12.959> obviously<00:02:13.349> how

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
attacking made obviously how

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.180 
attacking made obviously how
no<00:02:13.780> links<00:02:14.080> but<00:02:14.470> he<00:02:14.560> does<00:02:14.710> have<00:02:14.860> forced<00:02:15.130> our

no links but he does have forced our

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.680 
no links but he does have forced our
skill<00:02:15.490> which<00:02:15.640> thanks<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.150> guys<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.510> found
