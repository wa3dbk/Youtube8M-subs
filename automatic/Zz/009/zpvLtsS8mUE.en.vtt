00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
now they all work and I've been using

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.920 
now they all work and I've been using
this<00:00:46.970> menu<00:00:47.270> for<00:00:47.690> about<00:00:48.110> a<00:00:48.140> year<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:49.840> he's<00:00:50.840> very

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
this menu for about a year and he's very

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.860 
this menu for about a year and he's very
good<00:00:51.379> one<00:00:51.650> of<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.770> best<00:00:51.920> I've<00:00:52.129> seen<00:00:52.840> or<00:00:53.840> used

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870
