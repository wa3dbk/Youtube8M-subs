he's buddy come to look at us only issue

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.229 
he's buddy come to look at us only issue
with<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.539> basically<00:00:46.469> I've<00:00:47.370> used<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.000> a

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
with this is basically I've used this a

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.010 
with this is basically I've used this a
lot<00:00:49.879> in<00:00:51.079> the<00:00:52.079> last<00:00:52.649> oh<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.489> don't<00:00:53.850> know<00:00:54.020> almost

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
lot in the last oh I don't know almost

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.110 
lot in the last oh I don't know almost
10<00:00:55.379> years<00:00:55.430> and<00:00:57.020> because<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.969> the<00:00:59.969> edge

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
10 years and because of that the edge

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.920 
10 years and because of that the edge
has<00:01:00.480> thickened<00:01:00.930> now<00:01:01.760> to<00:01:02.760> almost<00:01:03.420> 25

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
has thickened now to almost 25

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.359 
has thickened now to almost 25
thousandths<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.070> an<00:01:05.880> inch<00:01:06.350> now<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:08.159> might

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
thousandths of an inch now that might

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.039 
thousandths of an inch now that might
not<00:01:08.400> seem<00:01:09.200> thick<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.439> general<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.729> isn't

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
not seem thick in general and it isn't

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.990 
not seem thick in general and it isn't
but<00:01:13.049> for<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.950> Phil's<00:01:14.189> knives<00:01:14.490> that's

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
but for one of Phil's knives that's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.810 
but for one of Phil's knives that's
quite<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> lot<00:01:15.689> because<00:01:16.619> they'll<00:01:16.979> come<00:01:17.009> between

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
quite a lot because they'll come between

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.140 
quite a lot because they'll come between
five<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.210> ten<00:01:18.570> thousandths<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.880> see

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
five and ten thousandths so you can see

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.080 
five and ten thousandths so you can see
that<00:01:21.450> there's<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.810> significant<00:01:22.470> amount<00:01:22.560> of

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
that there's a significant amount of

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.550 
that there's a significant amount of
wear<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.110> edges<00:01:25.409> after

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
wear on this and the edges after

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.020 
wear on this and the edges after
thickening<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:27.210> what<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> need<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.900> do<00:01:28.020> now<00:01:28.229> is

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
thickening so what I need to do now is

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.940 
thickening so what I need to do now is
send<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.210> back<00:01:30.450> down<00:01:30.720> grind<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.500> primary

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
send this back down grind the primary

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.980 
send this back down grind the primary
down<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.460> thin<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> edge<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.600> get<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.840> back

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
down and thin the edge and get it back

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.740 
down and thin the edge and get it back
to<00:01:34.049> around<00:01:34.500> 5,000<00:01:35.340> sticks<00:01:35.579> now<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.630> will

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
to around 5,000 sticks now that will

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.560 
to around 5,000 sticks now that will
have<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.159> bit<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> an<00:01:38.369> effect<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.880> cutting

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
have a bit of an effect on cutting

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.990 
have a bit of an effect on cutting
ability<00:01:39.750> shore<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.250> main<00:01:41.430> effect<00:01:41.820> will

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
ability shore but the main effect will

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.410 
ability shore but the main effect will
be<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.329> increase<00:01:42.630> ease<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.829> sharpening

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
be to increase ease of sharpening

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.660 
be to increase ease of sharpening
because<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.840> CPM<00:01:46.350> 10v<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.310> tennis

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
because this is CPM 10v the tennis

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.550 
because this is CPM 10v the tennis
further<00:01:47.909> vanadium<00:01:48.210> content<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.320> grind

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
further vanadium content the grind

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.130 
further vanadium content the grind
ability<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.100> exceptionally<00:01:50.880> low<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.450> thus

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
ability is exceptionally low and thus

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.819 
ability is exceptionally low and thus
you<00:01:52.439> don't<00:01:52.740> want<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.759> really<00:01:54.619> thick<00:01:55.619> edge

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
you don't want a really thick edge

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.830 
you don't want a really thick edge
because<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.700> will<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:56.969> take<00:01:57.210> far<00:01:57.659> too<00:01:57.689> long

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
because it will just take far too long

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.429 
because it will just take far too long
to<00:01:58.439> grind<00:01:59.130> so<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> need<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.570> thin<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.960> back<00:02:01.200> out

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
to grind so I need to thin that back out

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.920 
to grind so I need to thin that back out
now<00:02:02.310> there's<00:02:02.490> also<00:02:02.670> some<00:02:02.969> damage<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.719> see

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
now there's also some damage you can see

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.160 
now there's also some damage you can see
up<00:02:04.500> by<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.829> tip<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.880> there's<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.750> little<00:02:06.930> chip

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
up by the tip and there's a little chip

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.779 
up by the tip and there's a little chip
there<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.560> middle<00:02:07.829> I'm<00:02:08.220> not<00:02:08.399> gonna<00:02:08.580> grow

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
there in the middle I'm not gonna grow

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.609 
there in the middle I'm not gonna grow
in<00:02:08.940> all<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.270> them<00:02:09.390> out<00:02:09.539> because<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.319> know<00:02:10.410> this

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
in all of them out because you know this

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.860 
in all of them out because you know this
is<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.770> hard-working<00:02:11.039> life<00:02:11.520> like<00:02:11.790> most<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.209> my

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
is a hard-working life like most of my

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.990 
is a hard-working life like most of my
so<00:02:13.530> they<00:02:13.650> do<00:02:13.830> take<00:02:14.040> little<00:02:14.400> bits<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.610> damage

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
so they do take little bits of damage

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.420 
so they do take little bits of damage
from<00:02:15.180> time<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.630> time<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:17.040> was<00:02:17.190> probably

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
from time to time and this was probably

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.510 
from time to time and this was probably
given<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.030> friend<00:02:18.710> who<00:02:19.710> did<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.010> job<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.280> the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
given to a friend who did the job on the

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.250 
given to a friend who did the job on the
tip<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:23.640> I'll<00:02:24.120> grind<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:24.570> right<00:02:24.810> down<00:02:25.050> now

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
tip so I'll grind this right down now

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.380 
tip so I'll grind this right down now
and<00:02:25.500> thin<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.860> edge<00:02:25.980> back<00:02:26.480> 100%<00:02:29.240> here's<00:02:30.240> the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
and thin the edge back 100% here's the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.580 
and thin the edge back 100% here's the
knife<00:02:30.570> free<00:02:30.840> ground<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.900> can<00:02:33.930> see<00:02:34.080> now<00:02:34.440> it

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
knife free ground and you can see now it

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.410 
knife free ground and you can see now it
just<00:02:34.620> as<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> hint<00:02:35.190> on<00:02:35.630> secondary<00:02:36.630> edge<00:02:36.780> well

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
just as a hint on secondary edge well

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.280 
just as a hint on secondary edge well
it's<00:02:39.420> about<00:02:40.190> 5000<00:02:41.190> inch<00:02:41.370> thick<00:02:42.110> right<00:02:43.110> behind

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
it's about 5000 inch thick right behind

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.260 
it's about 5000 inch thick right behind
the<00:02:43.500> very<00:02:43.680> edge<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:44.520> again<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:44.880> didn't<00:02:45.180> take

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
the very edge and again I didn't take

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.660 
the very edge and again I didn't take
the<00:02:45.390> damage<00:02:45.720> out<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.140> tip<00:02:46.350> I'm<00:02:47.310> not<00:02:47.460> gonna

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
the damage out in the tip I'm not gonna

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.550 
the damage out in the tip I'm not gonna
grind<00:02:47.820> away<00:02:48.030> all<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:48.420> steel<00:02:48.750> no<00:02:49.260> cannot

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
grind away all that steel no cannot

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.130 
grind away all that steel no cannot
eventually<00:02:50.010> we'll<00:02:50.130> use<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:51.660> now<00:02:51.840> it'll

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
eventually we'll use and now it'll

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.010 
eventually we'll use and now it'll
sharpen<00:02:52.350> up<00:02:52.590> much<00:02:52.800> faster<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.730> again<00:02:54.030> see<00:02:54.990> a

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
sharpen up much faster and again see a

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.390 
sharpen up much faster and again see a
little<00:02:55.350> bit<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.530> an<00:02:55.620> improvement<00:02:55.920> in<00:02:56.130> cutting

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
little bit of an improvement in cutting

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.580 
little bit of an improvement in cutting
ability
