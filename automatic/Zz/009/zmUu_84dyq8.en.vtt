variation<00:01:45.479> itself<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.770> saying<00:01:47.040> a

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
variation itself this is like saying a

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.789 
variation itself this is like saying a
varied<00:01:47.640> diet<00:01:47.670> should<00:01:48.659> include<00:01:48.930> spoiled<00:01:49.530> foods

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
and poisons let's be clear we mean it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.789 
and poisons let's be clear we mean it
takes<00:01:53.040> several<00:01:53.490> kinds<00:01:53.790> many<00:01:54.570> kinds<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.560> does

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
takes several kinds many kinds it does

takes several kinds many kinds it does
not<00:01:55.979> take<00:01:56.040> all<00:01:56.520> kinds<00:01:56.880> here<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
not take all kinds here is just a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.010 
not take all kinds here is just a
partial<00:01:58.619> list<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:59.100> unnecessary<00:01:59.939> kinds

partial list of unnecessary kinds

but<00:02:03.020> let's<00:02:03.470> say<00:02:03.710> you're<00:02:03.980> a<00:02:04.010> takes<00:02:04.370> all<00:02:04.580> kinds

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
but let's say you're a takes all kinds

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.600 
but let's say you're a takes all kinds
absolutist<00:02:05.720> you<00:02:06.110> really<00:02:06.500> do<00:02:06.650> think<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:07.160> takes

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
absolutist you really do think it takes

absolutist you really do think it takes
all<00:02:07.970> kinds<00:02:08.000> let's<00:02:08.810> say<00:02:08.960> you<00:02:09.020> decide<00:02:09.229> for

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
all kinds let's say you decide for

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.740 
all kinds let's say you decide for

even<00:02:23.450> then<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:24.020> think<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.650> still<00:02:24.980> have<00:02:25.220> to

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
even then I think you still have to

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.850 
even then I think you still have to
concede<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.790> some<00:02:26.330> types<00:02:26.630> are<00:02:26.960> let's<00:02:27.590> face

concede that some types are let's face
it<00:02:28.070> over<00:02:28.670> represented<00:02:29.240> I<00:02:29.480> think<00:02:29.900> for<00:02:30.350> example

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
it over represented I think for example

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.710 
it over represented I think for example
we<00:02:31.160> would<00:02:31.250> all<00:02:31.430> still<00:02:31.790> get<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.270> point<00:02:32.510> about

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
we would all still get the point about

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.630 
we would all still get the point about
frat<00:02:33.080> boys<00:02:33.290> even<00:02:34.040> if<00:02:34.160> their<00:02:34.310> numbers<00:02:34.610> were

frat boys even if their numbers were
reduced<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.330> let's<00:02:35.630> say<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.870> maximum<00:02:36.440> of

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
fifteen of them at any college campus it

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.430 
fifteen of them at any college campus it
takes<00:02:39.920> all<00:02:40.220> kinds<00:02:40.510> it's<00:02:41.510> like<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:41.690> pin<00:02:42.080> in<00:02:42.290> my

takes all kinds it's like a pin in my

takes all kinds it's like a pin in my

phrase but you know what having said my
piece<00:02:46.280> about<00:02:46.520> it<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:46.850> feel<00:02:46.970> better<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.720> that's

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
piece about it I feel better and that's

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.380 
piece about it I feel better and that's
the<00:02:48.440> last<00:02:48.590> I'll<00:02:48.860> gripe<00:02:49.130> about<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.550> to<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:49.880> but

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
the last I'll gripe about it to you but

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.960 
the last I'll gripe about it to you but
you<00:02:50.600> know<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:51.110> won't<00:02:51.470> because<00:02:52.100> he's<00:02:52.460> been<00:02:52.760> the

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
you know it won't because he's been the
