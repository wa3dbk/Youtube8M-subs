right<00:00:43.850> from<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.180> start<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:44.720> now<00:00:45.140> what<00:00:45.290> you

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
right from the start and now what you

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.619 
right from the start and now what you
must<00:00:45.650> do<00:00:45.800> if<00:00:45.949> you<00:00:46.040> go<00:00:46.159> second<00:00:46.640> is<00:00:46.730> combat<00:00:47.390> each

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
must do if you go second is combat each

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.540 
must do if you go second is combat each
of<00:00:47.930> those<00:00:48.050> obstacles<00:00:48.440> and<00:00:49.159> that<00:00:49.309> kind<00:00:49.489> of

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
of those obstacles and that kind of

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.700 
of those obstacles and that kind of
gives<00:00:49.729> you<00:00:49.909> a<00:00:50.199> disadvantage<00:00:51.199> right<00:00:51.379> off<00:00:51.559> the

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
gives you a disadvantage right off the

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.430 
gives you a disadvantage right off the
bat<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.370> what<00:00:53.089> I've<00:00:53.180> seen<00:00:53.360> in<00:00:53.510> other<00:00:53.659> TCG's

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
bat so what I've seen in other TCG's

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.710 
bat so what I've seen in other TCG's
what<00:00:55.010> they've<00:00:55.159> kind<00:00:55.370> of<00:00:55.460> done<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:56.180> mitigate

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
what they've kind of done to mitigate

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.259 
what they've kind of done to mitigate
this<00:00:57.260> so<00:00:57.769> the<00:00:57.890> going<00:00:58.220> second<00:00:58.790> is<00:00:58.879> not<00:00:59.030> such<00:00:59.239> a

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
this so the going second is not such a

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.689 
this so the going second is not such a
detriment<00:00:59.839> to<00:00:59.870> going<00:01:00.170> first<00:01:00.500> is<00:01:00.739> they<00:01:01.489> have

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
detriment to going first is they have

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.759 
detriment to going first is they have
the<00:01:01.820> first<00:01:02.059> players<00:01:02.330> get<00:01:02.930> their<00:01:03.170> initial<00:01:03.559> draw

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
the first players get their initial draw

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.160 
the first players get their initial draw
phase<00:01:04.040> which<00:01:04.610> is<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:04.909> say<00:01:04.940> both<00:01:05.690> players<00:01:05.960> in

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
phase which is to say both players in

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.050 
phase which is to say both players in
yugioh<00:01:06.500> would<00:01:06.740> still<00:01:07.130> draw<00:01:07.460> their<00:01:07.700> initial

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
yugioh would still draw their initial

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.690 
yugioh would still draw their initial
five<00:01:08.240> cards<00:01:08.690> to<00:01:08.840> start<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:09.170> duel<00:01:09.320> but<00:01:09.950> if<00:01:10.490> you

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
five cards to start the duel but if you

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.399 
five cards to start the duel but if you
wit<00:01:10.880> first<00:01:11.180> you<00:01:11.450> would<00:01:11.570> have<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:11.930> skip<00:01:12.200> your

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
wit first you would have to skip your

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.630 
wit first you would have to skip your
first<00:01:12.620> drop<00:01:12.830> is<00:01:12.860> you<00:01:13.159> wouldn't<00:01:13.460> get<00:01:13.610> that

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
first drop is you wouldn't get that

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.760 
first drop is you wouldn't get that
initial<00:01:14.030> sixth<00:01:14.479> card<00:01:14.719> you<00:01:15.140> just<00:01:15.350> have<00:01:15.469> to<00:01:15.500> play

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
initial sixth card you just have to play

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.260 
initial sixth card you just have to play
with<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.039> first<00:01:16.280> five<00:01:16.490> that<00:01:16.759> you<00:01:16.820> get<00:01:17.030> and

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
with the first five that you get and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.330 
with the first five that you get and
then<00:01:17.750> going<00:01:18.229> second<00:01:18.770> you<00:01:18.950> would<00:01:19.070> get<00:01:19.189> the

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
then going second you would get the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.620 
then going second you would get the
first<00:01:19.549> draw<00:01:19.759> phase<00:01:20.030> of<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.240> game<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:20.570> you

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
first draw phase of the game so you

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.410 
first draw phase of the game so you
would<00:01:20.869> get<00:01:21.049> a<00:01:21.110> plus<00:01:21.500> one<00:01:21.619> by<00:01:22.340> going<00:01:22.549> second<00:01:23.090> you

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
would get a plus one by going second you

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.760 
would get a plus one by going second you
wouldn't<00:01:23.750> get<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.960> initial<00:01:24.289> set<00:01:24.530> up<00:01:24.649> the

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
wouldn't get the initial set up the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.770 
wouldn't get the initial set up the
first<00:01:24.950> player<00:01:25.250> gets<00:01:25.579> but<00:01:26.210> you<00:01:26.420> would<00:01:26.539> at<00:01:26.630> least

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
first player gets but you would at least

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.779 
first player gets but you would at least
get<00:01:27.049> that<00:01:27.109> six<00:01:27.560> cars<00:01:27.890> you<00:01:28.219> might<00:01:28.430> have<00:01:28.640> an
