00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
color that I decided to get because I

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.089 
color that I decided to get because I
was<00:02:17.540> debating<00:02:17.689> between<00:02:17.959> this<00:02:18.439> one<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:18.739> the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
like green and pink one but I was like

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.270 
like green and pink one but I was like
you<00:02:20.959> know<00:02:21.110> what<00:02:21.290> I've<00:02:21.500> been<00:02:21.650> wanting<00:02:21.830> this<00:02:21.980> one

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
you know what I've been wanting this one

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.250 
you know what I've been wanting this one
for<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.489> while<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:22.910> I<00:02:22.940> got<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.330> this<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:23.959> how<00:02:24.110> it

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
for a while so I got it this is how it

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.080 
for a while so I got it this is how it
looks<00:02:24.470> like<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.890> love<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.580> material

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
looks like I love the material

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.840 
looks like I love the material
I<00:02:26.209> think<00:02:26.420> it's<00:02:26.540> going

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
I think it's going

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.300 
I think it's going
but<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.600> does<00:02:27.840> not<00:02:28.020> have<00:02:28.260> an<00:02:28.380> adjustable<00:02:28.860> clamp

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
but it does not have an adjustable clamp

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.490 
but it does not have an adjustable clamp
in<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.520> fact<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.450> hopefully<00:02:31.020> this<00:02:31.230> fits

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
in the fact so hopefully this fits

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.010 
in the fact so hopefully this fits
really<00:02:31.740> nicely<00:02:32.270> thankfully<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.450> does<00:02:33.720> have

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
really nicely thankfully it does have

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.100 
really nicely thankfully it does have
adjustable<00:02:34.920> straps<00:02:35.580> but<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.480> think<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:36.870> looks

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
adjustable straps but I think this looks

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.780 
adjustable straps but I think this looks
pretty<00:02:37.200> good<00:02:37.560> I'm<00:02:37.830> gonna<00:02:38.070> try<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.430> on<00:02:38.520> in<00:02:38.700> a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
pretty good I'm gonna try it on in a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.100 
pretty good I'm gonna try it on in a

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
that but other than that it looks

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.960 
that but other than that it looks
beautiful<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:43.110> love<00:02:43.620> how<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.890> wiring<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.730> it
