00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.910 

more<00:01:47.050> than<00:01:47.140> one<00:01:47.290> Firefox<00:01:47.830> tab<00:01:48.250> or<00:01:48.760> window

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
and another really neat thing is let's

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.050 
and another really neat thing is let's
say<00:01:55.689> I<00:01:55.810> have<00:01:55.930> Firefox<00:01:56.830> open

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
say I have Firefox open

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.050 
say I have Firefox open
and<00:01:59.619> nope

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
and nope

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:11.790 
and nope
I<00:02:01.119> guess

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.620 

with<00:02:12.190> those<00:02:12.900> smaller

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
with those smaller

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.880 
with those smaller
and<00:02:16.100> you<00:02:17.100> drag<00:02:17.400> this<00:02:17.550> over<00:02:17.850> here

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
and you drag this over here

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.809 
and you drag this over here
creating<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.430> one<00:02:20.610> over<00:02:20.850> here

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.849 

now<00:02:24.239> this<00:02:24.359> is<00:02:24.450> really<00:02:24.780> nice<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.290> just<00:02:25.439> split<00:02:25.650> my

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
now this is really nice to just split my

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.660 
now this is really nice to just split my
screen<00:02:26.129> totally<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:26.760> half<00:02:27.049> one<00:02:28.049> half<00:02:28.670> is

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
screen totally in half one half is

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.940 
screen totally in half one half is
google<00:02:30.150> Firefox<00:02:31.069> one<00:02:32.069> half<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.489> no<00:02:32.670> pet

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
google Firefox one half is no pet

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.520 
google Firefox one half is no pet
and<00:02:34.069> I<00:02:34.819> don't<00:02:35.480> think<00:02:35.629> you<00:02:35.870> really<00:02:36.050> realize<00:02:36.319> how

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
and I don't think you really realize how

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.369 
and I don't think you really realize how
