00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 how do you know about your armor 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.029
 look for break forever today 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.029
 we talk about strength 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.449
 this maykravtov guides with you I and today 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.239
 we will consider as you could 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.169
 guess strength on your tools 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.090
 or armor 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.250
 as you know there are many 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.619
 items that have strength is 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.030
 You can cover up the green stripes 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.309
 which will slowly turn 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.620
 red in places you use an item 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.960
 for different types of objects of different types 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.670
 strength also exists enchantment 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.030
 who made you subjects 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.829
 served you longer well what drove you 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.960
 you can see below you can see green 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.730
 strip on these items she and 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.980
 determines the strength of the subject 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.450
 you can guess what's easier with 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.760
 items depends on the material of 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.370
 whom they were made and yes it is 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.739
 so each item has its own strength 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.350
 however now I will tell you this feature. 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.630
 who few know and this is how we 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.399
 we can see more easily from the subject in numbers 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.210
 for this we must simultaneously press 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.840
 keys f3 speech and here and now if 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.600
 open the chest 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.280
 then I will now see the strength figure 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.659
 here for example here this gold 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.340
 kids under + 2 attack we see durability 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.039
 crushers translated from English this 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.170
 strength of the world if i bring but still from 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.450
 subject it is easier 100 enemy will not 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.149
 so I do nâ€™t use them at all 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.100
 diamond items better you can 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.939
 see what is the example of the golden picks 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.249
 only 32 strength she is now 31 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.130
 because once and used it and 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:46.389
 all are now wooden pickaxe here 69 but 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.069
 Now 10 because again 

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:49.929
 used once up here all of 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:54.249
 path once respectively on the stone 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:57.399
 that here 31 on iron 250 and normal 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:59.200
 food 561 you can watch how 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.669
 strength may become less to 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.649
 example tools 

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:05.349
 using them we are seeing a decrease 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.359
 strength but in case you have armor 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:09.490
 as I have now, under her I immediately now 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:12.040
 clothe all that I have here is 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.319
 a couple of things that will damage me and 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.260
 my armor an hour I will come cactus example 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.540
 about i start the lake and see op with us 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.350
 robbed strength you can see 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.170
 right now 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.790
 This I took the arrow you a cap now 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.930
 I will dip my head 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.210
 sees what I like fall 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.660
 strength however however 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.690
 see if I step away you will see 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.720
 strength does not decrease I will burn 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.090
 but I will take damage they are my armor 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.610
 there are also a couple of things that 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.160
 will be worn out to the player himself but not him 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.400
 scolding is hunger or if you 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.500
 stuck in the wall well or let's say you 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.340
 suffocated under the water you disappeared and you do not 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.500
 enough air 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.080
 your armor will not get any damage 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.820
 you will be easier now 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.460
 from breastplates so that at least we 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.060
 understood and so the skin of us 80 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:11.540
 gold on 112 kolchuzhny 240 iron 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.670
 240 by the way which is interesting and chain mail 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.160
 and gold assumes the same 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.680
 damage however strength already lada 112 y 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.750
 chainmail 240 means less than that of gold 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.630
 therefore, it is also considered better than chainmail 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.150
 although the chain mail and iron equally 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.310
 strength is 240 but iron is better but 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.090
 takes on a big role and diamond 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.810
 at the borders 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.780
 28 now back again with the pickaxe gold 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.790
 the worst fragility is only 32 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.590
 but diamonds are respectively the best 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.230
 wooden 59 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.830
 by the fireplace of 31 years already two hundred fifty 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.630
 and 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.880
 in 1561 the diamond so now you 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.560
 remember i said earlier about what can 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.640
 make it work 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.190
 you much longer 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.000
 enchantment for strength now you 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.910
 see within 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.880
 books on strength if hand issuing your 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.050
 subject to strength one then if 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.210
 the percentage chance that 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.490
 the strength of your subject will decrease 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:12.080
 if you enchanted for strength 2 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:14.360
 then 33 percent of what strength 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.160
 your subject will decrease and if you 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.590
 enchantment strength 3 to 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.720
 probability of 25 procedures that is one 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.820
 the trait can actually be said that 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.600
 your item will last 4 times longer 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.800
 what he was originally destined also 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.200
 I want to say that if you will 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.540
 misuse for example 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.360
 if you start digging the ground with the sword then 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.219
 then the strength of your nothing month 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.599
 on 2 or for example you will 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:40.599
 use your tools like 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:43.330
 pickaxes or an ax to fight with words or 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:44.590
 the players in this case their not strength 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.439
 also decrease by 2 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.139
 however i want to surprise you enchantment 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:52.180
 can and reduce easier with the subject if 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.819
 you use enchantment spikes on your 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.710
 armor ascii trains if u could or hands 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:58.539
 strike you a lesson 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.550
 the fact that he too will take damage that 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.110
 hit you and then get armor 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.270
 double damage because it is used 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.639
 like a weapon or else you figure it out for yourself 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.560
 so but if you didn't have this cheese 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.029
 no, then everything would be fine, I 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.219
 I hope you enjoyed this episode 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:14.500

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:15.430
 today we looked away from will take a 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.560
 then how can she 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.719
 magnified how it can decrease in 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.789
 Generally considered all as much as possible 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.439
 I tried to make everything as simple as possible. 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.659
 explain it i hope you me 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:26.919
 understood i had to fit into the channel 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:29.289
