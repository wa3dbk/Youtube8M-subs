and<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.479> usual<00:01:57.869> audio<00:01:58.170> ports<00:01:58.619> but<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> best

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and the usual audio ports but the best

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.920 
and the usual audio ports but the best
thing<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.790> this<00:01:59.850> motherboard<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.509> probably

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
thing on this motherboard is probably

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.660 
thing on this motherboard is probably
going<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.320> OC<00:02:01.920> buttons<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.490> can

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
going to be the OC buttons that you can

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.539 
going to be the OC buttons that you can
see<00:02:02.850> here<00:02:03.590> these<00:02:04.590> are<00:02:04.649> see<00:02:04.950> buttons<00:02:05.280> allow<00:02:05.490> you

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
see here these are see buttons allow you

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.410 
see here these are see buttons allow you
to<00:02:06.030> do<00:02:06.240> multiple<00:02:06.540> things<00:02:06.810> within<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.649> system

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
to do multiple things within the system

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.199 
to do multiple things within the system
there<00:02:09.420> later<00:02:09.720> too<00:02:10.440> from<00:02:11.310> here<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.910> can<00:02:11.970> see

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
there later too from here you can see

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.670 
there later too from here you can see
them<00:02:12.330> all<00:02:12.569> along<00:02:12.900> here

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
them all along here

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.000 
them all along here
so<00:02:13.829> you<00:02:13.920> can<00:02:14.069> do<00:02:14.189> tag<00:02:14.549> turbo<00:02:15.299> base<00:02:15.599> clocking

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
so you can do tag turbo base clocking

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.250 
so you can do tag turbo base clocking

it'll just click one of these buttons

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.599 
it'll just click one of these buttons
and<00:02:21.390> your<00:02:21.480> CPU<00:02:21.780> ratio<00:02:22.079> goes<00:02:22.260> up<00:02:22.469> or<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:23.459> can

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
and your CPU ratio goes up or you can

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.449 
and your CPU ratio goes up or you can

some onboard voltage monitoring that you

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.080 
some onboard voltage monitoring that you
can<00:02:58.079> see<00:02:58.290> here<00:02:58.609> we're<00:02:59.609> not<00:02:59.700> going<00:02:59.819> to<00:02:59.879> be<00:02:59.939> using

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
can see here we're not going to be using

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.550 
can see here we're not going to be using
those<00:03:00.299> was<00:03:00.569> not<00:03:00.719> been<00:03:00.870> going<00:03:00.989> into<00:03:01.260> some<00:03:01.439> crazy

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
those was not been going into some crazy

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.500 
those was not been going into some crazy
overclocking<00:03:02.340> but<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:02.879> board<00:03:03.120> has<00:03:03.269> been

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
overclocking but this board has been

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.839 
overclocking but this board has been
doing<00:03:04.349> some<00:03:04.560> World<00:03:04.739> Records<00:03:04.799> for<00:03:05.430> the

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
doing some World Records for the

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:06.949 
doing some World Records for the
overclockers<00:03:06.329> out<00:03:06.510> there<00:03:06.659> and<00:03:06.750> liquid

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
overclockers out there and liquid

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.159 
overclockers out there and liquid
nitrogen<00:03:07.319> so<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:08.010> kind<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.370> stuff<00:03:08.609> there<00:03:08.909> is

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:09.169 
nitrogen so that kind of stuff there is

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.360 
nitrogen so that kind of stuff there is
very<00:03:10.169> important<00:03:10.650> for<00:03:10.709> them<00:03:10.829> you<00:03:11.099> can<00:03:11.250> actually

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
very important for them you can actually

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.550 
very important for them you can actually
connect<00:03:11.819> up<00:03:11.969> a<00:03:12.090> multimedia<00:03:12.540> ammo<00:03:13.049> tomato<00:03:13.319> so

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
connect up a multimedia ammo tomato so

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.640 
connect up a multimedia ammo tomato so
you<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:13.799> see<00:03:14.359> so<00:03:15.359> you<00:03:15.419> can<00:03:15.569> measure<00:03:15.719> component

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
you can see so you can measure component

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.309 
you can see so you can measure component
voltages<00:03:17.150> separately<00:03:18.150> which<00:03:18.419> is<00:03:18.569> a<00:03:18.840> really

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
voltages separately which is a really

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.509 
voltages separately which is a really
good<00:03:19.409> feature<00:03:19.650> for<00:03:19.949> the<00:03:20.040> advanced

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
good feature for the advanced

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.819 
good feature for the advanced
overclockers<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:22.049> can<00:03:22.169> see<00:03:22.349> they're<00:03:22.560> in<00:03:22.680> high

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829
