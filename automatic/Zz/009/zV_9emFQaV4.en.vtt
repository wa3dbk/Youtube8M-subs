on<00:04:47.410> eye<00:04:47.440> pencils<00:04:47.890> because<00:04:48.670> those<00:04:49.480> they<00:04:50.350> smudge

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
on eye pencils because those they smudge

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.040 
on eye pencils because those they smudge
a<00:04:50.950> little<00:04:51.490> too<00:04:51.700> much<00:04:52.000> like<00:04:52.300> because<00:04:52.570> they're

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
a little too much like because they're

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.170 
a little too much like because they're
so<00:04:53.200> creamy<00:04:53.440> but<00:04:54.040> this<00:04:54.160> one's<00:04:54.370> not<00:04:54.550> too<00:04:54.640> dry

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
so creamy but this one's not too dry

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.880 
so creamy but this one's not too dry
either<00:04:55.540> so<00:04:56.020> I<00:04:56.050> think<00:04:56.440> it's<00:04:56.530> a<00:04:56.620> really<00:04:56.650> good

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
either so I think it's a really good

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.470 
either so I think it's a really good
consistency<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:57.760> it<00:04:57.850> also<00:04:57.970> came<00:04:58.240> to<00:04:58.300> that

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
consistency and it also came to that
