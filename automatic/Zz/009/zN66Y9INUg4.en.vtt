 often the consumer does not have 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.950
 necessary information for a conscious 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.599
 selection of interior locks mechanisms 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.759
 which varies significantly between 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:22.140

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.809
 This is a very strong backlash even on 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.010
 completely new product and as a result 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.559
 metallic bounce from touching 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.660
 pen and looking at it its pen features 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.230
 knob performs properly and will serve 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.230
 long enough 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.180
 interroom latch it's just 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.940
 mechanical latch not intended 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.280
 under the latch this mechanism opens and 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.200
 locked by turning the handle intended 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.990

 dots 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.490
 and also with the magnetic mechanism by 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.619

 the toilet 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.260
 to install such a lock will require 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.450
