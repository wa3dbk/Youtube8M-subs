an experiment on the water front a

sustainability for Thunder Bay I don't

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.730 
sustainability for Thunder Bay I don't
need<00:05:27.520> to<00:05:27.700> explain<00:05:27.820> to<00:05:28.419> you<00:05:28.599> how<00:05:28.870> we<00:05:29.200> need<00:05:29.590> an

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
need to explain to you how we need an

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.500 
need to explain to you how we need an
icon<00:05:30.190> of<00:05:30.220> hope<00:05:30.610> and<00:05:30.820> a<00:05:30.880> real<00:05:31.060> success<00:05:31.479> story

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
icon of hope and a real success story

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.659 
icon of hope and a real success story
and<00:05:31.900> thunder<00:05:32.200> bay<00:05:32.320> at<00:05:32.470> this<00:05:32.650> time<00:05:32.889> and<00:05:33.130> we

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
and thunder bay at this time and we

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.550 
and thunder bay at this time and we
think<00:05:33.880> that<00:05:34.030> this<00:05:34.330> will<00:05:34.599> be<00:05:34.630> that<00:05:35.050> will<00:05:35.380> be<00:05:35.530> a

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
think that this will be that will be a

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.040 
think that this will be that will be a
large<00:05:35.770> part<00:05:36.160> of<00:05:36.400> that<00:05:36.669> upward<00:05:37.450> spiral<00:05:37.720> of

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
large part of that upward spiral of

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.900 
large part of that upward spiral of
optimism<00:05:38.500> which<00:05:38.800> we<00:05:38.979> all<00:05:39.130> know<00:05:39.160> we<00:05:39.490> need<00:05:39.669> and

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
optimism which we all know we need and

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.460 
optimism which we all know we need and
the<00:05:40.270> third<00:05:40.419> one<00:05:40.630> is<00:05:40.720> economic<00:05:41.260> sustainability

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
the third one is economic sustainability

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.500 
the third one is economic sustainability
and<00:05:42.479> let's<00:05:43.479> not<00:05:43.780> back<00:05:44.770> away<00:05:44.979> from<00:05:45.130> it<00:05:45.510> there's

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
and let's not back away from it there's

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.029 
and let's not back away from it there's
a<00:05:46.599> lot<00:05:46.630> of<00:05:46.780> good<00:05:46.990> ideas<00:05:47.020> here<00:05:47.620> there<00:05:47.800> are<00:05:47.860> a<00:05:47.889> lot

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
a lot of good ideas here there are a lot

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:49.890 
a lot of good ideas here there are a lot
of<00:05:48.070> expensive<00:05:48.639> good<00:05:48.820> ideas<00:05:49.210> here<00:05:49.479> and<00:05:49.599> somehow

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
of expensive good ideas here and somehow

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.240 
of expensive good ideas here and somehow
we<00:05:50.110> have<00:05:50.440> to<00:05:50.470> find<00:05:50.830> a<00:05:50.950> way<00:05:51.120> so<00:05:52.120> that<00:05:52.470> this<00:05:53.470> pays

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
we have to find a way so that this pays

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.940 
we have to find a way so that this pays
its<00:05:54.669> expenses<00:05:55.360> as<00:05:55.539> it<00:05:55.840> goes<00:05:56.050> and<00:05:56.349> it's<00:05:56.860> a

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
its expenses as it goes and it's a

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.680 
its expenses as it goes and it's a
positive<00:05:57.160> economic<00:05:58.060> driver<00:05:58.300> for<00:05:58.419> the

positive economic driver for the

positive economic driver for the
