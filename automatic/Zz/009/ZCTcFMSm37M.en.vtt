00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.850

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.820
 Manuel or if you feel like going to 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:15.170
 break the bottle because there seems to be 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.090
 a madridista to madridismo there is 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.490
 of them who wants to contribute know but not 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.530
 can because they are not journalists but 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.660
 I am in favor of freedom and 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.520
 freedom of expression and if I'm from 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.710
 madrid del madrid if I am from the barça del 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.199
 barça and that in the background the whole world 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.840
 is pulling home and home from 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.050
 underneath there is of the suit this one can see 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.420
 a white or red and white shirt or 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.829
 up to the same cooler 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.829
 but I have relieved myself with the manolos 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:54.950
 It is not like this 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.360
 at 3 yes despite the goals 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.360
 of opinion 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.050
 because he has called us a penalty I want 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.660
 it was a subway outside the area 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.560
 we had to complain about this 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:15.030
 and no and no one else but of course like there 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.030
 the shirt below 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.300
 now well in kids 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.060
 every day 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.500
 'I fight' figo I do not see how it is with the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.500
 handy just the hot ball umbrella ya 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.300
 that the second time is no longer saying if the 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.900
 take the next left sometimes 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.190
 luck is the luck changes a bit 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.909
 why do not we always have to dance 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.909
 with the ugliest 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.490
 if there is a tie and I say 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.290
 a cheese ham sandwich and a coffee with 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.010
 milk 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.010
