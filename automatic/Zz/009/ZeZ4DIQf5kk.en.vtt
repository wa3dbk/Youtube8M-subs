gives you a little bit better impression

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.020 
gives you a little bit better impression
of<00:00:12.719> how<00:00:12.840> they<00:00:12.960> look<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.410> truck<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.030> some

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
of how they look on the truck and some

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.320 
of how they look on the truck and some
of<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.210> fitment<00:00:15.740> I've<00:00:16.740> had<00:00:17.010> them<00:00:17.130> for<00:00:17.330> about

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
of the fitment I've had them for about

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.480 
of the fitment I've had them for about
two<00:00:18.570> months<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.990> I've<00:00:19.949> used<00:00:20.220> them

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
two months and I've used them

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.259 
two months and I've used them
extensively<00:00:21.140> off-road<00:00:22.140> I'm<00:00:23.070> very<00:00:23.699> happy<00:00:24.090> with

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
extensively off-road I'm very happy with

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.470 
extensively off-road I'm very happy with
the<00:00:24.420> performance<00:00:25.039> you<00:00:26.039> can<00:00:26.160> see<00:00:26.400> from<00:00:27.330> this

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the performance you can see from this

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.859 
the performance you can see from this
angle<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:29.300> sliders<00:00:30.300> fall<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.660> body

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
angle that the sliders fall the body

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.179 
angle that the sliders fall the body
line<00:00:31.170> very<00:00:31.710> cleanly

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
line very cleanly

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.280 
line very cleanly
a<00:00:32.340> nice<00:00:33.300> mild<00:00:34.170> kick-out<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:36.050> chose<00:00:37.050> these

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
a nice mild kick-out I chose these

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.229 
a nice mild kick-out I chose these
sliders<00:00:37.739> because<00:00:38.280> they<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.700> stick<00:00:39.090> out

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
sliders because they do stick out

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.630 
sliders because they do stick out
slightly<00:00:39.719> more<00:00:40.140> than<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:41.070> rocky<00:00:41.460> road

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
slightly more than the rocky road

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.000 
slightly more than the rocky road
sliders<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.420> offer<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:43.050> little<00:00:43.290> bit<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.620> use<00:00:43.800> as

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
sliders and offer a little bit of use as

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.369 
sliders and offer a little bit of use as
a<00:00:44.040> step<00:00:45.050> plenty<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.110> clearance<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> door

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
a step plenty of clearance for the door

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.630 
a step plenty of clearance for the door
and<00:00:50.750> they<00:00:51.750> really<00:00:51.989> don't<00:00:52.170> stick<00:00:52.440> out<00:00:52.620> too<00:00:53.430> much

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
and they really don't stick out too much

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.450 
and they really don't stick out too much
you<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.870> use<00:00:55.020> them<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> step<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.949> they're

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
you can use them as a step and they're

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.040 
you can use them as a step and they're
very<00:00:56.969> easy<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.270> get<00:00:57.480> around<00:00:57.600> when<00:00:57.930> you're

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
very easy to get around when you're

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.869 
very easy to get around when you're
getting<00:00:58.649> out<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.280> truck<00:00:59.600> which<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.629> nice<00:01:00.989> I

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
getting out of the truck which is nice I

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.179 
getting out of the truck which is nice I
used<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.000> layer<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.739> rust-oleum<00:01:05.150> bedliner<00:01:06.150> to

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
used a layer of rust-oleum bedliner to

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.440 
used a layer of rust-oleum bedliner to
paint<00:01:08.189> them<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.640> gives<00:01:08.790> me<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> little<00:01:09.180> bit<00:01:09.360> of

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
paint them it gives me a little bit of

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.380 
paint them it gives me a little bit of
traction<00:01:09.659> over<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.110> top<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.530> slider<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
traction over the top of the slider and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.440 
traction over the top of the slider and
I<00:01:12.860> can<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:14.040> rattle-can<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.760> when<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.330> gets

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
I can just rattle-can it when it gets

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.999 
I can just rattle-can it when it gets
scratched<00:01:16.049> from<00:01:16.350> sliding<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.799> rocks

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
scratched from sliding on the rocks

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.780 
scratched from sliding on the rocks
which<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.400> certainly<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:18.479> done<00:01:19.610> to<00:01:20.610> see

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
which I certainly have done to see

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.880 
which I certainly have done to see
underneath<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.360> truck<00:01:21.630> they<00:01:22.290> bolt<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.710> with

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
underneath the truck they bolt on with

will<00:01:36.630> need<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.850> footlong<00:01:39.229> combo<00:01:40.229> wrench<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
will need a footlong combo wrench to

will need a footlong combo wrench to
reach<00:01:42.479> two<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.990> bolts<00:01:43.369> that<00:01:44.369> are<00:01:44.520> nestled

inside<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.979> frame<00:01:47.460> rail<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:48.930> see<00:01:49.110> by

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
inside the frame rail and you can see by

inside the frame rail and you can see by
the<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:50.399> bottom<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.000> sliders<00:01:51.360> I've

the the bottom of the sliders I've

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.109 
the the bottom of the sliders I've
already<00:01:51.810> scratched<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.590> out<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.920> them

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119

sliding<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.329> rocks<00:01:55.490> they<00:01:56.490> performed<00:01:57.090> very

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
sliding on the rocks they performed very

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.950 
sliding on the rocks they performed very
well<00:01:58.430> they<00:01:59.430> are<00:01:59.460> high<00:01:59.729> lift<00:02:00.000> rated<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.750> I've

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
well they are high lift rated and I've

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.850 
well they are high lift rated and I've
used<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.439> high<00:02:02.219> lift<00:02:02.689> all<00:02:03.689> along<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.380> slider

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
used the high lift all along the slider

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.210 
used the high lift all along the slider
to<00:02:06.430> lift<00:02:06.610> either<00:02:06.820> one<00:02:07.120> wheel<00:02:07.360> or<00:02:07.920> two<00:02:08.920> wheels
