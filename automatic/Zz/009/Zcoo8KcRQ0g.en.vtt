and<00:01:41.600> it's<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.689> splitter<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.619> makes<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:43.979> you

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
and it's a splitter that makes it so you

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.410 
and it's a splitter that makes it so you
run<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.280> series<00:01:44.579> naturally<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.090> want<00:01:45.210> enough

back<00:04:27.789> from<00:04:27.969> putting<00:04:28.150> this<00:04:28.240> brushless<00:04:28.479> system

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
back from putting this brushless system

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.580 
back from putting this brushless system
in<00:04:29.020> since<00:04:29.199> I've<00:04:29.289> had<00:04:29.409> it<00:04:29.560> for<00:04:29.770> what<00:04:30.189> a<00:04:30.219> year<00:04:30.340> now

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590

yeah<00:04:32.620> oh<00:04:32.830> um<00:04:33.639> about<00:04:34.240> a<00:04:34.360> year<00:04:34.419> uh<00:04:35.009> but<00:04:36.009> this<00:04:36.460> was

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
yeah oh um about a year uh but this was

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.279 
yeah oh um about a year uh but this was
the<00:04:36.819> first<00:04:37.060> car<00:04:37.479> that<00:04:37.539> I<00:04:37.719> drove<00:04:37.990> and<00:04:38.199> we've

no<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.270> bought<00:04:40.569> the<00:04:40.689> brushless<00:04:40.900> system<00:04:41.289> later

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:41.439 
no I bought the brushless system later

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:44.189 
no I bought the brushless system later
on<00:04:41.530> oh<00:04:41.889> sorry<00:04:42.729> I'm<00:04:43.150> half<00:04:43.389> asleep<00:04:43.539> I've<00:04:43.900> had<00:04:44.080> the

that<00:04:47.469> I<00:04:47.620> think<00:04:47.800> was<00:04:47.919> a<00:04:47.949> Christmas<00:04:48.550> before<00:04:48.819> I

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
that I think was a Christmas before I

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:50.909 
that I think was a Christmas before I
met<00:04:49.030> you<00:04:49.409> somebody<00:04:50.409> got<00:04:50.530> a<00:04:50.560> for<00:04:50.710> me<00:04:50.800> for

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
met you somebody got a for me for

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:51.770 
met you somebody got a for me for
Christmas

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
Christmas

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.869 
Christmas
and<00:04:52.780> it<00:04:53.710> was<00:04:53.860> it<00:04:54.099> was<00:04:54.129> the<00:04:54.280> brushed<00:04:54.460> one<00:04:54.639> then<00:04:54.789> I

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:54.879 
and it was it was the brushed one then I

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.790 
and it was it was the brushed one then I
just<00:04:55.060> it<00:04:55.479> was<00:04:55.629> too<00:04:55.780> slow<00:04:55.960> I<00:04:56.139> like<00:04:56.439> things<00:04:56.680> that

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
just it was too slow I like things that

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.129 
just it was too slow I like things that
go<00:04:56.889> if<00:04:57.189> it's<00:04:57.370> if<00:04:57.610> it's<00:04:57.729> unless<00:04:58.659> it's<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:58.900> crawler

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
go if it's if it's unless it's a crawler

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.959 
go if it's if it's unless it's a crawler
it<00:04:59.439> needs<00:04:59.590> to<00:04:59.650> be<00:04:59.740> fast<00:04:59.919> for<00:05:00.159> me<00:05:00.279> at<00:05:00.550> 40<00:05:00.819> miles

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:00.969 
it needs to be fast for me at 40 miles

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:02.760 
it needs to be fast for me at 40 miles
per<00:05:01.060> hour<00:05:01.180> and<00:05:01.360> about<00:05:01.419> for<00:05:01.719> sure<00:05:01.750> this<00:05:02.560> was

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
per hour and about for sure this was

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.420 
per hour and about for sure this was
intended<00:05:03.009> so<00:05:03.789> I<00:05:03.819> went<00:05:04.029> brushless<00:05:04.210> for<00:05:04.599> it<00:05:04.659> and

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
intended so I went brushless for it and

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.070 
intended so I went brushless for it and
yeah<00:05:06.430> I<00:05:06.699> might<00:05:06.939> regret<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.330> in<00:05:07.449> in<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:07.960> future

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
yeah I might regret it in in the future

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.740 
yeah I might regret it in in the future
with<00:05:08.800> repairs<00:05:09.219> and<00:05:09.370> everything<00:05:09.669> but<00:05:10.000> uh<00:05:10.029> like
