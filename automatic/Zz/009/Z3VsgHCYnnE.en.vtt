00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
is a perfect example for a solid call

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.069 
is a perfect example for a solid call
you<00:03:26.570> can<00:03:26.750> set<00:03:26.989> up<00:03:27.340> with<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.370> software<00:03:28.880> not<00:03:29.780> more

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
you can set up with a software not more

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.390 
you can set up with a software not more
than<00:03:30.290> 12

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
than 12

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.090 
than 12
the<00:03:32.359> next<00:03:32.630> example<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:33.140> will<00:03:33.200> demonstrate<00:03:33.560> you

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
the next example I will demonstrate you

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.449 
the next example I will demonstrate you
how<00:03:34.340> we<00:03:34.609> intercept<00:03:35.359> a<00:03:35.540> call<00:03:35.890> so<00:03:36.890> this<00:03:37.130> is<00:03:37.280> our

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
how we intercept a call so this is our

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.759 
how we intercept a call so this is our
target<00:03:37.730> phone<00:03:38.150> where<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.930> spy<00:03:39.170> software<00:03:39.410> is

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
target phone where the spy software is

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.729 
target phone where the spy software is
installed<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:41.180> this<00:03:41.450> one<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:42.170> calling<00:03:42.590> the

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
installed and this one is calling the

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:50.150 
installed and this one is calling the
other<00:03:42.890> form

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.590 

so<00:03:51.160> it<00:03:51.250> calls<00:03:51.520> this<00:03:52.270> phone<00:03:52.540> I<00:03:55.650> accept<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.860> call

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
so it calls this phone I accept the call

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.180 
so it calls this phone I accept the call
and<00:03:58.600> now<00:03:58.780> we<00:03:59.230> have<00:03:59.410> a<00:03:59.440> connection<00:03:59.890> between

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
and now we have a connection between

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.020 
and now we have a connection between
these<00:04:00.940> two<00:04:01.210> phones<00:04:01.540> here<00:04:02.550> what<00:04:03.550> happens<00:04:03.970> is

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
these two phones here what happens is

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.620 
these two phones here what happens is
this<00:04:04.570> phone<00:04:04.840> is<00:04:05.170> going<00:04:05.440> to<00:04:05.530> send<00:04:05.830> an<00:04:05.980> SMS<00:04:06.630> over

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
this phone is going to send an SMS over

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:20.310 
this phone is going to send an SMS over
to<00:04:07.840> this<00:04:07.990> home<00:04:16.950> now<00:04:17.950> I<00:04:17.980> know<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:19.930> there's<00:04:20.230> a

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
to this home now I know that there's a

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.810 
to this home now I know that there's a
phone<00:04:20.620> call<00:04:20.890> going<00:04:21.220> on

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
phone call going on

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:34.010 
phone call going on
I<00:04:22.560> do<00:04:23.560> know<00:04:23.970> it's<00:04:24.970> just<00:04:25.420> called

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:50.530 

and<00:04:34.560> I<00:04:34.620> will<00:04:34.830> intercept<00:04:38.030> into<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.150> phone

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.110 

this<00:04:51.140> is<00:04:51.290> how<00:04:51.470> it<00:04:51.590> works

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:12.670 

so<00:04:55.750> I<00:04:55.780> call<00:04:56.290> him

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.070 

so<00:05:14.509> no<00:05:15.509> you<00:05:16.050> see<00:05:16.289> when<00:05:16.500> I<00:05:16.530> turn<00:05:16.830> on<00:05:17.870> its<00:05:18.870> just

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
so no you see when I turn on its just

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.439 
so no you see when I turn on its just
now<00:05:19.259> there's<00:05:19.830> a<00:05:19.949> conference<00:05:20.340> going<00:05:20.610> on<00:05:20.910> but

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
now there's a conference going on but

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.080 
now there's a conference going on but
they<00:05:21.660> don't<00:05:21.810> know
