00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.199
 is an elite collection of soloporteros 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.150
 which as its own name indicates 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.489
 belongs to the most armed gloves of 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.380
 the elite line and for the palm uses 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.560
 a cut of roll flat roll in the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.560
 lateral 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.190
 if we talk about the part that gives more 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.370
 glove consistency the area of what 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.140
 it's a little the aspect and level armed 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.190
 we find that as I said 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.830
 before it's an extra glove this year it 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.020
 divided into two modalities the mus astro 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.850
 more armed and we will go lighter 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.230
 because we consider that this how much is 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.600
 a little bit more armed than we have done 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.800
 to give it that armed level 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.960
 mainly by the area of ​​torso two 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.610
 differentiated latex panels with a 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.230
 intermediate joint that after 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.730
 send you a little bit of flexibility 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.979
 for this first latex plate 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.840
 natural as we can see covers the 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.220
 four main fingers of the hand and it 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.750
 Make sure that these fingers are always 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.760
 move in block so that if one 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.740
 it supports some kind of tension the others 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.040
 have a support that allows them 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.050
 work at the same time and improve blockings 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.910
 for the second for the second plate 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.650
 in front is the one we see inserted in 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.480
 after s &amp; p it's actually a 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.100
 palm sculpture we can check 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.020
 that there is no type of cut in the 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.790
 lateral zone therefore the latex of the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.560
 palm activities of the thumb and tip 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.140
 of the fingers extends towards the area 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.030
 of the back and even reaches up to 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.310
 the final area of ​​the thumb in such a way 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.000
 that we get the glove to be a 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.060
 single piece 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.610
 the part that you hold in your hand will be a 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.390
 single piece with that we have a better 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.390
 adjustment 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.250
 the last part of the 2nd as we can see 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.920
 it is an area of ​​textile mp efe a textile 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.170
 that we discovered in the previous collection 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.660
 2012-2013 that we consider to be the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.520
 maybe the best material to get 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.680
 a neutral level of both armed 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.930
 glove like the inner ventilation 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.300
 of it in such a way that does not allow 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.190
 that there is too much difference 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.410
 temperature between elba which is 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.950
 usually works as by hand and that 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.599
 not too much water too 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.819
 one of the characteristic parts of 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.280
 this glove of this model is that there 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.650
 a piece that extends from the back 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.840
 until the seasonal wristband of which 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.150
 we intend to do with this piece many 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.100
 times when when we have a glove 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.050
 put the guaje is divided in two 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.090
 parts on one side the back and on the other 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.430
 side the body of the great type of work 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.280
 Wristbands therefore it is necessary to make 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.140
 a piece that serves as a link or 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.940
 that stabilizes are all these two 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.480
 parts once we have put the 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.980
 glove we closed the anchor of the closure and 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.480
 we get any movement that 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.280
 have our hand be a little 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.040
 stabilized with this with this iron 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.959
 latex 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.489
 we went on to talk about the palm as I 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.439
 said earlier of the chosen cut 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.150
 a hybrid cut say it the finger to 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:03.290
 those of two known sides that has 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.910
 to make more force in the action of 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.190
 block 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.630
 and a flower cut with angular finish for 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.100
 the two middle fingers that are the ones 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.090
 they bring sensitivity with 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.080
 local stability for the thumb 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.000
 we present a latex wrap 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.620
 maybe older than usual because 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.900
 We believe it is important that the thumb 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.400
 be as protected as possible with 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.140
 which is this wrap that comes from the area 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.760
 of the palm not only came to 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.590
 the entrance of the finger but wraps 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.610
 completely to the fundamental thumb 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.310
 to the finger that works 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.239
 Independent 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.720
 to join the two index fingers and 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.010
 thumb a zone with a small cut in 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.020
 the center presented before this drastic 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.790
 to avoid being in the face of stress 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.680
 of we make a blockage suffers a break 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.870
 premature and therefore that cut life 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.569
 of the glove and finally we ended up 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.010
 to saying that logically the accused 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.660
 is the crooked grip that is the 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.740
 maximum adhesion that makes its 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.069
 own 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.299
 before 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.129
 we will notice new features 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.329
 specials that differentiate all the 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.150
 doormen camera for this 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.939
 collection 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.650
 and they are small gel inserts or 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.360
 of silicone that are placed 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.209
 directly in the areas of the buds 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.590
 of the fingers and at the base of the palm already 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.150
 that these are the six zones that 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.980
 impact with the ball when we want 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.989
 make a lock therefore improves the 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.370
 flexibility and does not arm both the hand 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.919
 as maybe the tube that can reach 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.740
 be annoying as we can see this 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.509
 independent latex piece once 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.030
 the two points are fixed 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:30.340
 Velcro anchor fits perfectly 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.470
 inserted in the glove and we will 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.470
 allow to have that adjustment
