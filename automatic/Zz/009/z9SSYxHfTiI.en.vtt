00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:07.319
 what's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.790
 new video to destiny today with one 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.469
 little update because we have plans 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.809
 some weeks ago I think before two or 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.250
 Three does not nail me to it 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.120
 we made a video that they come in 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.190
 our team 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.770
 that had the meaning that you have the chance 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.140
 have the same clear tag in the name so 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.199
 to have in game in the destiny and 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.029
 we have youtube zero tv right now 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.830
 It's just been that we have one 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.570
 have been killed by the little 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.340
 whole people after a half 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.559
 hour was the sound already full 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.910
 bungie has received a limited edition of approx 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.739
 200 members 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.340
 it does not matter if xbox or 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.090
 playstation 4 or ps3 or xbox 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.559
 360 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.020
 Everything is diced together and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.420
 summed up to a clear that 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.489
 If there are now 199 ps4 player in it 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.469
 there is still room for an xbox 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.969
 Player is a bit of luck rule 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.300
 no idea why bungie that there 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.739
 somehow power fact is definitely 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.449
 The thing has been filled up quickly 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.620
 but were often asked if we were not 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.030
 can still open a clear or 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.489
 how we fix it 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.080
 now it is so often 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.510
 also which go out of the old plan 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.920
 you can always get one there 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.600
 Send inquiry that you can go in 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.390
 Graz and 197 in it 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.590
 that means there are three places left 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.759
 is definitely always there 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.930
 it's a little advertise 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.520
 Group there you can always beautiful 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.590
 exchange therefore like a forum 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.470
 but now we have decided for it 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.400
 that others have the clear tech in it 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.799
 but may have in another 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.560
 variation and that's exactly it 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.090
 same clan day with a 2 at the end and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.250
 if that should be fully we do 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.920
 a three at the end of 1 4 at the end and so on 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.570
 But that does not mean that it is one 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.549
 Ranking has been there too now 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.280
 often asked it is then that 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.840
 the clear number one then rather with us 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.060
 also play as clear number two or 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.770
 five or six no people there I have to 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.460
 say very clearly you are even 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.110
 the newer version of the older clan 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.060
 and I can say it again 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.259
 yes not the final clans we 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.869
 We will do that too 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.610
 always when people invite or 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.230
 let's play with us then we test 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.790
 these people and look at us 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.860
 they play the and when we go to 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.300
 Example is in the random team that is 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.000
 already a two people really blatant 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.800
 noticed bike red in the hard mode the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.560
 run there without problems through the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.730
 Communication is everything then top 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.860
 which is also the chance in the 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.780
 finally, there are 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.370
 not yet but that will be 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.560
 be an elite clearly where then only the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.390
 best ten players come in or in 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.800
 others clearly where the best 100 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.990
 come in or maybe one 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.870
 smaller is called the best 200 then 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.190
 something like this movie are here and there 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.260
 That's why we're planning on it 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.510
 anyway, you do not care if you're two-three-five 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.450
 or six have it is practical 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.740
 all one we try only one 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.870
 to create a complete plan 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.770
 if she thinks now there are 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.330
 a ranking 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.280
 then I will do that too 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.410
 In any case, I hardly with any 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.940
 from here on this day also take over 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.910
 that means I give my original 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.770
 zero 1 away and then get me zero 2 because 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.590
 it does not matter in the end 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.080
 point if we want to see how to get in 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.790
 then come in and check this clear 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.010
 the description in any case the 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.740
 original video come into our team 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.870
 because there we explain it to all 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.530
 that's exactly how it is in our opinion 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.800
 also really does not matter if ps3 xbox 360 psp 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.720
 or xbox wall would normally have 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.459
 everyone comes in because of that 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.830
 try your luck I do not know how 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.500
 long the thing is still open or 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.989
 how long is there room because it is 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.510
 really fierce writes in 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.280
 the comments if you apply 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.440
 I have for this new plan 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.840
 there will probably come in as well 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.340
 maybe also flo writes on everyone 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.800
 fall into the comments when you are there 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.330
 have applied if it's too late 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.860
 then you can maybe see 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.060
 not at all she writes in the 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.970
 comments then you can directly 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.580
 Share that it would also check people out 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.340
 In any case, the description people 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.680
 there is the video in there where everything explains 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.270

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.270

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.390

 as you are called there by releasing 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.890
 People can be a clear thing else 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.060
 Maybe it's not possible and you're hanging 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.560
 we can not go outside again 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.180
 open a new plan every day 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.040

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.390
 We are looking forward to any part 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.070
 we are curious how fast the 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.020

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.070
