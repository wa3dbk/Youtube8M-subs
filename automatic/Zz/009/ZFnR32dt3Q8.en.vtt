00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.120
 what does one want from long winter 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:19.350
 frustrated model airplane completely clear 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:21.560
 He wants to get out of it is a 1500 mm 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.789
 span very handy and 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.720
 at the same time strong electric sailer 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.720
 from the well 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.220
 The construction is as easy as possible 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.480
 kept and the detailed construction plan 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.480
 hardly leaves questions open 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.030
 the profile has on the top 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.680
 two stages so no in flight from 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.680
 trend can take place 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:10.090
 the thermal search is the real thing 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.600
 with each of out but also a bit faster 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.600
 That's fun 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.090
 For vertical riser flights provide a 60 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.460
 gram brushless motor and a two it 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.400
 rather with 1200 milliamp hours 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.590
 Capacity that's enough at 500 grams 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.250
 take-off weight for at least half 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.250
 hour flight time 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.069
 Build this model with it 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.180
 I was able to say yesterday 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.180
 was really nice 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:43.250
