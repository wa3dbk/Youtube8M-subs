00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.449
 Switching from to ball clutches 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.919
 accumulating absorbers or train belongs rods 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.680
 to the basics of maintenance and 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:29.050
 repair work at one 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.730
 Exchange of the casserole and the 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.980
 To google clutch first is the 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.079
 bellows pushed back then 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.210
 solved the screw connection and then the 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.470
 clutch removed 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.809
 now the rear screw of the 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.699
 Loosen the damper on the housing and the old one 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.329
 casserole damper from the pull rod 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.329
 pull out 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.750
 next the new casserole 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.949
 with the pressure body moving forward in the 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.589
 Introduce train route 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.269
 until the rear casserole damper eye with 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.949
 the crossbar of the pull rod and the 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:01.290
 hole in the housing is congruent 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.290
 then screw and tighten 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.260
 when fitting the ball clutches is 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.840
 It makes sense with a screwdriver 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.790
 or thorn the back hole in the train 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.860
 rod with the socket in the casserole damper 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.400
 congruent and with a 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.140
 then keep the bolt in position 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.120
 ball clutch and put the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.650
 rear bolt from above against the 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.650
 hammer in the second bolt 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.540
 after that, the front screws are screwed 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.370
 used the new fuse nuts 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:45.930
 screwed on and tightened 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:47.550
 The clutch is now mounted as 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.040
 last the bellows over the 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.540
 screw tightening for a safe 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.550
 and proper operation too 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.830
 should basically only guarantee 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.100
 original bpw spare parts used 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.100
 become
