over to where you have hold it down lift

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.800 
over to where you have hold it down lift
it<00:01:19.000> up<00:01:19.380> take<00:01:20.380> one<00:01:21.070> side<00:01:21.370> or<00:01:21.610> it<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.270> fold<00:01:22.660> it

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
should have this shape right now this

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.390 
should have this shape right now this
will<00:01:34.000> change<00:01:35.430> with<00:01:36.430> that<00:01:37.740> these<00:01:38.740> are<00:01:39.070> going<00:01:39.280> to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
will change with that these are going to

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.359 
will change with that these are going to
take<00:01:39.610> one<00:01:40.020> side<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:42.340> arm<00:01:43.619> triangle<00:01:44.619> and

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
take one side of the arm triangle and

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:56.249 
take one side of the arm triangle and
just<00:01:46.200> um<00:01:48.300> ok<00:01:50.190> just<00:01:51.190> to<00:01:53.340> fold<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.580> at<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.750> courts

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
just um ok just to fold it at the courts

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.080 
just um ok just to fold it at the courts
like<00:01:56.680> this

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
like this

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.679 
like this
enter<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.020> other<00:02:00.229> flat<00:02:00.590> up<00:02:01.310> fold<00:02:01.880> with<00:02:02.329> one

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
enter the other flat up fold with one

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.410 
enter the other flat up fold with one
third<00:02:03.109> of<00:02:03.140> it<00:02:03.579> is<00:02:04.579> like<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.909> only<00:02:05.060> small

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
third of it is like the only small

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.270

fold it so you can do it with your very
long<00:02:13.959> trapezoid<00:02:15.400> okay<00:02:16.400> that's<00:02:16.879> right<00:02:18.730> yep

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
long trapezoid okay that's right yep

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.229 
long trapezoid okay that's right yep
you're<00:02:20.480> going<00:02:20.629> to<00:02:20.690> unfold<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:25.030> you're<00:02:26.030> going

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
you're going to unfold it you're going

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
to take where you made your trapezoid

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.990 
to take where you made your trapezoid
and<00:02:29.120> fold<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.870> bit<00:02:30.440> over<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.190> triangle<00:02:31.849> now

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
and fold it a bit over a triangle now

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.420 
and fold it a bit over a triangle now
you<00:02:32.060> have<00:02:32.360> one<00:02:33.220> this<00:02:35.799> and<00:02:36.799> then<00:02:36.980> you're<00:02:37.190> going

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:51.339 
put on your bigger triangle and fold
back<00:02:47.170> where<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:48.379> make<00:02:48.650> your<00:02:48.950> crease<00:02:49.610> line<00:02:50.349> so

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
back where you make your crease line so

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.020 
back where you make your crease line so
about<00:02:51.530> where<00:02:51.739> you<00:02:51.829> increase<00:02:52.370> I'll<00:02:52.579> just<00:02:52.760> fold

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
about where you increase I'll just fold

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.020 
about where you increase I'll just fold

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
can look at what you have here the topic

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.590 
can look at what you have here the topic
right<00:03:04.040> here<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:04.840> for<00:03:05.840> this<00:03:06.850> that<00:03:07.850> was<00:03:08.269> where

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
right here and for this that was where

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.710 
right here and for this that was where
the<00:03:08.780> point<00:03:09.639> Eddie's<00:03:10.639> all<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.359> point<00:03:11.690> so

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
the point Eddie's all that point so

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.260 
the point Eddie's all that point so
since<00:03:16.230> I'm<00:03:17.230> looking<00:03:17.710> at<00:03:17.890> it<00:03:18.100> but<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.520> says<00:03:18.850> full

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
since I'm looking at it but it says full

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.650 
since I'm looking at it but it says full
of<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.540> dotted<00:03:19.900> line<00:03:20.550> but<00:03:21.550> really<00:03:22.120> dotted<00:03:22.510> line

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
of a dotted line but really dotted line

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.300 
of a dotted line but really dotted line
is<00:03:22.870> where<00:03:23.140> you<00:03:23.440> had<00:03:23.680> your<00:03:23.710> endpoint<00:03:24.930> with<00:03:25.930> the

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
is where you had your endpoint with the

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.850 
is where you had your endpoint with the
little<00:03:27.330> bit<00:03:28.330> triangle<00:03:29.020> so<00:03:29.200> it<00:03:29.350> should<00:03:29.560> end<00:03:29.710> up

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
little bit triangle so it should end up

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.080 
little bit triangle so it should end up
like<00:03:29.980> this<00:03:31.350> we're<00:03:32.350> going<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.650> take<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.580> bottom

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
like this we're going to take the bottom

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:46.210 
like this we're going to take the bottom
portion<00:03:34.300> and<00:03:35.010> then<00:03:36.010> fold<00:03:38.880> back<00:03:40.200> out

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.800 

just<00:03:47.220> watch<00:03:48.950> then<00:03:49.950> I'm<00:03:50.459> going<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.700> take<00:03:50.850> your

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
just watch then I'm going to take your

00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:03.199 
just watch then I'm going to take your
little<00:03:52.110> shape<00:03:52.800> here<00:03:53.420> and<00:03:55.370> fold<00:04:01.430> fold<00:04:02.430> this

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
little shape here and fold fold this

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.550 
little shape here and fold fold this
scary<00:04:03.900> like<00:04:04.290> right<00:04:04.530> here<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.959> little<00:04:06.959> bit<00:04:07.170> of<00:04:07.380> it
