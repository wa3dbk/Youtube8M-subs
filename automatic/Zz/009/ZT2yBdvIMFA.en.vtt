hi<00:00:06.839> this<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:07.080> kimo<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.770> this<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.510> PP<00:00:10.040> part<00:00:11.040> 1<00:00:11.480> PP

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
hi this is kimo and this is PP part 1 PP

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.629 
hi this is kimo and this is PP part 1 PP
stands<00:00:12.719> for<00:00:12.929> pool<00:00:13.139> pack<00:00:13.349> there<00:00:14.070> are<00:00:14.280> six

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
stands for pool pack there are six

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.310 
stands for pool pack there are six
prisms<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.960> set<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.490> 36<00:00:17.490> normal<00:00:17.880> cards<00:00:18.320> I'm

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
prisms and a set in 36 normal cards I'm

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.769 
prisms and a set in 36 normal cards I'm
not<00:00:19.800> exactly<00:00:20.250> sure<00:00:20.460> when<00:00:21.150> these<00:00:21.390> were<00:00:21.570> made

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
not exactly sure when these were made

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.080 
not exactly sure when these were made
since<00:00:22.109> there<00:00:22.260> were<00:00:22.380> no<00:00:22.410> dates<00:00:22.859> but<00:00:23.850> I'm

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
since there were no dates but I'm

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.210 
since there were no dates but I'm
assuming<00:00:24.590> it's<00:00:25.590> about<00:00:25.859> like<00:00:26.720> 1988<00:00:27.720> or<00:00:28.220> 89

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
assuming it's about like 1988 or 89

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.150 
assuming it's about like 1988 or 89
could<00:00:29.609> be<00:00:29.699> earlier<00:00:30.289> so<00:00:31.289> here<00:00:32.130> are<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.369> cards

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
could be earlier so here are the cards

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:48.490 
could be earlier so here are the cards
so<00:00:35.160> these<00:00:35.280> are<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.520> prisms

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.350 

this<00:00:49.100> is<00:00:49.250> basically<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.730> start<00:00:50.120> of<00:00:50.330> the

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
this is basically the start of the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.460 
this is basically the start of the
z-series<00:00:52.570> one<00:00:53.570> thing<00:00:53.720> you'll<00:00:53.840> notice<00:00:54.050> is<00:00:54.290> up

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
z-series one thing you'll notice is up

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.590 
z-series one thing you'll notice is up
here<00:00:54.739> there's<00:00:55.670> some<00:00:55.790> like<00:00:56.090> really<00:00:56.270> weird

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
here there's some like really weird

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.200 
here there's some like really weird
characters<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:57.680> if<00:00:58.610> you<00:00:58.700> look<00:00:58.730> at<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.059> back

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
characters and if you look at the back

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.960 
characters and if you look at the back
of<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.450> card<00:00:59.739> it<00:01:00.739> actually<00:01:01.130> shows<00:01:01.370> you<00:01:01.640> how<00:01:01.910> to

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
of the card it actually shows you how to

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:09.810 
of the card it actually shows you how to
decode<00:01:02.510> them<00:01:03.430> so<00:01:04.430> this<00:01:04.640> one<00:01:04.850> is<00:01:05.059> basically

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.109 

2990<00:01:13.000> so<00:01:14.000> all<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.479> cards<00:01:14.869> have<00:01:15.640> this<00:01:16.640> decoder

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
2990 so all the cards have this decoder

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.020 
2990 so all the cards have this decoder
thing<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:18.040> all<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.190> cards<00:01:19.490> in<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.640> front<00:01:19.880> of

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
thing and all the cards in the front of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.719 
thing and all the cards in the front of
part<00:01:20.300> one<00:01:20.509> has<00:01:20.869> these<00:01:21.110> little<00:01:21.290> codes<00:01:21.619> on<00:01:22.009> the

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
part one has these little codes on the

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:37.220 
part one has these little codes on the
border<00:01:24.340> so<00:01:25.340> here<00:01:25.640> are<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.850> normal<00:01:26.360> cards

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.140 

I<00:01:37.290> was<00:01:37.920> actually<00:01:38.010> very<00:01:38.220> fortunate<00:01:38.910> to<00:01:39.030> get

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
I was actually very fortunate to get

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.290 
I was actually very fortunate to get
these<00:01:39.360> cards<00:01:39.690> in<00:01:39.840> decent<00:01:40.290> condition<00:01:41.300> since

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
these cards in decent condition since

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.780 
these cards in decent condition since
these<00:01:42.540> are<00:01:42.600> really<00:01:43.020> old<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.620> lot<00:01:44.190> of<00:01:44.310> time<00:01:44.520> you

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
these are really old a lot of time you

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.810 
these are really old a lot of time you
have<00:01:44.940> like<00:01:46.040> scratched<00:01:47.040> cards<00:01:47.670> bent<00:01:48.000> cards

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
have like scratched cards bent cards

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.980 
have like scratched cards bent cards
just<00:01:50.840> normal<00:01:51.840> wear<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.020> tear<00:01:53.510> these<00:01:54.510> are<00:01:54.690> in

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
just normal wear and tear these are in

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.260 
just normal wear and tear these are in
actually<00:01:55.860> pretty<00:01:56.130> good<00:01:56.340> condition<00:01:56.850> except

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
actually pretty good condition except

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.720 
actually pretty good condition except
some<00:01:58.230> of<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.410> cards<00:01:58.710> do<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.130> some<00:01:59.370> yellowing

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
some of the cards do have some yellowing

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.630 
some of the cards do have some yellowing
on<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.510> back<00:02:02.510> but<00:02:03.510> it's<00:02:03.750> okay<00:02:04.110> as<00:02:04.470> long<00:02:05.160> as<00:02:05.550> I

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
on the back but it's okay as long as I

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:48.630 
on the back but it's okay as long as I
have<00:02:05.820> them<00:02:05.970> all

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.260 

so<00:02:49.240> that's<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:49.750> for<00:02:49.780> PP<00:02:50.590> part<00:02:50.860> 1<00:02:51.150> thanks<00:02:52.150> for
