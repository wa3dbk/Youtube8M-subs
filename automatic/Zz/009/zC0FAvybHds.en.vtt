00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
then you're dumb shit I know that Google

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.140 
then you're dumb shit I know that Google
is<00:02:09.149> starting<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.110> blown<00:02:10.560> into

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
is starting a blown into

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.839 
is starting a blown into
thing<00:02:11.420> slowly<00:02:12.200> but<00:02:12.500> surely<00:02:12.560> they're<00:02:13.459> getting

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
thing slowly but surely they're getting

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.240 
thing slowly but surely they're getting
it<00:02:14.000> hooked<00:02:14.599> up<00:02:14.750> in<00:02:14.930> like<00:02:15.079> Kansas<00:02:16.040> City

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
it hooked up in like Kansas City

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.240 
it hooked up in like Kansas City
Missouri<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.849> Kansas<00:02:17.090> City<00:02:17.510> Kansas<00:02:18.470> so

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
Missouri and Kansas City Kansas so

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.479 
Missouri and Kansas City Kansas so
that's<00:02:19.939> kind<00:02:20.629> of<00:02:20.720> real<00:02:21.019> places<00:02:21.379> but<00:02:21.890> at<00:02:22.340> least

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
that's kind of real places but at least

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.360 
that's kind of real places but at least
they<00:02:22.700> experimenting<00:02:23.659> out<00:02:24.079> they<00:02:24.409> land<00:02:24.829> on<00:02:24.980> like

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
they experimenting out they land on like

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.979 
they experimenting out they land on like
New<00:02:25.760> York<00:02:25.970> City<00:02:26.269> because<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.629> would<00:02:26.750> just<00:02:26.780> be

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
New York City because that would just be

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.190 
New York City because that would just be
like<00:02:27.079> garbage<00:02:27.730> because<00:02:28.730> let's<00:02:29.359> let's<00:02:29.930> think

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
like garbage because let's let's think

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.399 
like garbage because let's let's think
about<00:02:30.260> it<00:02:30.939> it<00:02:31.939> just<00:02:32.180> wouldn't<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:32.989> like<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.379> was

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
on to the next topic point they talk

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.819 
on to the next topic point they talk
about<00:02:47.329> and<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:48.290> basically<00:02:48.500> just

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
about and it's basically just

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.119 
about and it's basically just
understanding<00:02:49.760> how<00:02:50.000> speed<00:02:50.569> then<00:02:51.170> if<00:02:51.379> you<00:02:51.920> need

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
understanding how speed then if you need

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.089 
understanding how speed then if you need
a<00:02:52.159> lot<00:02:52.489> of<00:02:52.519> internet<00:02:53.530> capabilities<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:54.709> need

another<00:03:16.010> tip<00:03:16.250> I<00:03:16.489> don't<00:03:16.730> know<00:03:16.790> if<00:03:16.910> this<00:03:17.060> applies

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
another tip I don't know if this applies

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.289 
another tip I don't know if this applies
that<00:03:17.750> much<00:03:18.019> but<00:03:18.949> they<00:03:19.370> say<00:03:19.579> to<00:03:19.639> negotiate

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
that much but they say to negotiate

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.750 
that much but they say to negotiate
you're<00:03:20.660> late<00:03:20.930> now<00:03:21.319> this<00:03:21.769> can<00:03:21.980> happen<00:03:22.190> with

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
you're late now this can happen with

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.879 
you're late now this can happen with
some<00:03:23.120> small<00:03:23.599> companies<00:03:24.169> you<00:03:24.349> can<00:03:24.500> maybe<00:03:24.650> do

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
some small companies you can maybe do

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.890 
some small companies you can maybe do
this<00:03:25.069> but<00:03:25.340> you're<00:03:25.879> with<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.060> larger<00:03:26.720> company

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
this but you're with a larger company

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.490 
this but you're with a larger company
that<00:03:27.290> services<00:03:27.889> most<00:03:28.699> of<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.090> region<00:03:29.299> un<00:03:29.810> then

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
that services most of the region un then

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.530 
that services most of the region un then
that's<00:03:30.919> probably<00:03:31.099> not<00:03:31.879> going<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.180> work<00:03:32.299> out

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
that's probably not going to work out

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.300 
that's probably not going to work out
good<00:03:32.690> but<00:03:33.019> if<00:03:33.290> you're<00:03:33.500> like<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.739> region<00:03:34.220> of

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
good but if you're like a region of

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.390 
good but if you're like a region of
maybe<00:03:35.060> like<00:03:35.269> five<00:03:35.810> six<00:03:36.590> hundred<00:03:36.919> houses<00:03:37.129> I

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
maybe like five six hundred houses I

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.180 
maybe like five six hundred houses I
have<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:38.000> then<00:03:38.329> I<00:03:38.690> would<00:03:39.019> suggest<00:03:39.190> negotiating

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
have it then I would suggest negotiating

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.849 
have it then I would suggest negotiating
advice<00:03:40.430> because<00:03:41.169> they<00:03:42.169> want<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:42.500> make<00:03:42.650> money

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
advice because they want to make money

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.069 
advice because they want to make money
so<00:03:43.280> anyway<00:03:43.909> they<00:03:44.090> can<00:03:44.269> make<00:03:44.389> money<00:03:44.599> they'll

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
so anyway they can make money they'll

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.140 
so anyway they can make money they'll
try<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:45.379> do<00:03:45.590> it<00:03:45.739> now<00:03:46.010> they<00:03:46.609> might<00:03:46.819> want<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.030> try

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
try to do it now they might want to try

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.789 
try to do it now they might want to try
to<00:03:47.269> make<00:03:47.449> more<00:03:47.750> money<00:03:47.930> off<00:03:48.109> you<00:03:48.440> but<00:03:48.680> they're
