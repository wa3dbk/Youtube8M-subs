00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:13.780
 the navigation system is a screen 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.780
 of 85 can watch more matches 85 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.950
 It has the same blue as a tablet 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.480
 and mobile tablets mobile 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.529
 It also has a system that is very 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.529
 well here you have also 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.680
 the interior environments that configure 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.590
 the choice as 2 from the green looks 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.629
 how change changes everything changes 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.629
 even the light is from the pillars 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.910
 the food also changes 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.100
 and then you also have the aid to the 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.100
 driving 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.300
 there are seven helps because you know the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.560
 Lane change collection system la 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.850
 distance 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.159
 the collection 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.509
 in the blind spot in practice of all 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.509
 the cars the speed 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.080
 Traction control and lights 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.480
 automatic 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.020
 and then you have the driving mode in 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.020
 multi sense 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.950
 in which your configuration car because 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.270
 the chassis is configured according to 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.430
 driving style that so that 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.680
 you really have neutral we have not 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.880
 could logically prove they are not new 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.320
 could circulate with them with 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.450
 instrumentation and even the seats 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.950
 are changing a little bit like that because if 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.740
 when not for that comfort world that should 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.610
 to do a massage the car as well 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.610
 it also counts revolutions 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.880
 now with sport 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.399
 it is changed red you and the 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.520
 revolvers preside over the sale in 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.520
 shops 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.859
 and then what else do we have here that I 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.859
 it costs that versions 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.310
 the initial truthful paris 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.239
 that's very good but it 's a last 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.510
 of buckwheat and then you also have the 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.860
 helps not to lose aid 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.629
 parking for which action of 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.629
 obstacles and the xxi for fish 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.050
 the truth that is a tablet 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.250
 you have applications also these 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.770
 applications like functions leave the 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:46.320
 mobile like we could not prove it 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.580
 because we can not spend the mobile I 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.180
 I think that the presentation will be 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.180
 car launch 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.740
 another story very very very very 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.390
 interesting as much a very story 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.810
 interesting the inside the tray in 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.810
 recording 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:12.330
 it's huge 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.330
 if not quite large 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.700
 and then take the chassis chassis for 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.220
 control the ford control can be 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.660
 disable the screen yes but in 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.550
 this case as it is a doctor version 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.470
 you're not going to be able to do in Paris I 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.110
 they said that it could be regulated a bit is 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.090
 balanced treatment very agile 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.530
 less agile what happens that like this 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.340
 this is a demo version because not yet 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.900
 they have it operational and nothing you can do 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.470
 and take pictures of all the photos that 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.470
 require have
