00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
pac-man but you are pac-man down below

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.600 
pac-man but you are pac-man down below
and<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.559> lot<00:01:01.769> more<00:01:01.890> terrifying<00:01:02.370> swish

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
and it's a lot more terrifying swish

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.850 
and it's a lot more terrifying swish
with<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> music<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:03.530> also<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.710> seen

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
it's terrifying but anyway I would say

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.310 
it's terrifying but anyway I would say
the<00:01:12.330> objective<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.140> normal

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the objective is just like normal

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.670 
the objective is just like normal
pac-man<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.950> gotta<00:01:15.290> go<00:01:16.290> around<00:01:16.380> and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
pac-man you gotta go around and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.800 
pac-man you gotta go around and
basically<00:01:16.980> get<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.940> apples<00:01:18.420> which<00:01:18.600> look<00:01:18.780> like

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
basically get the apples which look like

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.550 
basically get the apples which look like
for<00:01:19.110> floating<00:01:19.620> atoms<00:01:20.040> basically<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.470> if<00:01:22.470> it

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
for floating atoms basically and if it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.090 
for floating atoms basically and if it
goes<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.830> get<00:01:22.950> all<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:24.500> bits<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.770> don't<00:01:26.010> know

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
goes and get all the bits I don't know

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.469 
goes and get all the bits I don't know
what<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.280> air<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:26.610> yeah<00:01:26.790> basically<00:01:27.210> that's

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
what the air but yeah basically that's

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.620
