 a dozen have accepted 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.780
 clear the rhythm imposed tarbes must this light bruno cabal then bruno 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.910
 lightweight it's weapons the new champion his marathon is a little late 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.930
 career now 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.920
 case and he accepted bernard to find out for veronique for 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.680
 veronique billat it's disgusting 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.960
 she is a researcher at CNRS and Sahrawis and teachers 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.089
 of university of villevêque 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.900
 the csl 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.300
 do we have to look for the following the team of france was also patrick 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.970
 the whole portugal team it must be said portugal is expecting better 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.570
 champions he had done tests to measure oxygen consumption in 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.570
 direct would it so it's a little complicated but you'll see 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.600
 this light bruno effect 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.610
 serve of course improved had enormously 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.020
 lala technology on marathon in any case performance while bruno 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.520
 the vaudois head by dreamworks refuel if the first 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.290
 refueling 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.840
 benoît who took so to refuel in a dress for the pilots and 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.970
 especially the German refusal raised the hadopi standard also the departure of 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.440
 members of his family or in those who want the change planned to 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.050
 meet the two cars have stopped clearing a little bit the 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.460
 passage it's very hard to dream about this formidable 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.159
 koudougou behind because it's true that running with the lot of 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.540
 the device and the club offers a little embarrassment too why he agreed for 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.720
 the first time 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.720
 claude to lend to the little lessons of his body 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.250
 go to research and physiology of sport 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.200
 all summer with his past 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.700
 maybe it's less so because it's still a boy 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.860
 of high-level dede at a stage where we will be forced 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.240
 the gym club just fresh even without passion especially on 12 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.180
 just as I even tell myself if actually drive one can 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.560
 to do tests and the entire France team hated that this 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.320
 device to carry it on 42 km this is the novelty that wanted to introduce 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.530
 Roma rugby and we follow the topic 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.530
 that of fair of marseille 40 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.069
 imagine a traveling laboratory a match that exhausts 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.699
 600 grams connected to a computer you're on the oxygen consumption of the 

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:02.580
 runner 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.760
 viguier the treadmill the taking of information is done on the ground 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.700
 the interlude around 11 am about stable 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.779
 but the gas content 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:18.839
 between what came back 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.339
 because going out 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:22.529
 to know what she wants 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.299
 first rejection to know the maximum guinea pig consumption for 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.459
 light bruno the text obviously gives a high-level result 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.659
 in swimming all the same consumption 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:41.609
 more before you ride salsa return value of 20 to 25 times 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.609
 while the site entirely dedicated 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.029
 second step studied the oxygen consumption for the runner 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.409
 evolves for more than half an hour at its average speed on a marathon 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:57.399
 to start 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:03.159
 light bruno trains him on bases of 2 hours and 13 minutes is 10 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.159
 9 km 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.859
 during the 30-minute test in the middle of the night and increasing the frequency 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.859
 cardiac a system casting unix stabilization 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:20.099
 a couple of athletes is about 1 85% of their consumption of 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.609
 continent the mask will finally know the evolution of the 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.119
 oxygen consumption over the duration of a marathon 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:29.209
 between devices and sportsman we think he understands what's going on 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.739
 it's actually before mulhouse are not dead of his brother's theory 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.109
 since yesterday decades 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.309
 in any case an extremely experience 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:41.029
 landing the 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:44.399
 the one that attempts repetitions so with a slight so veronique 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:45.189
 and in a whole 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.819
 dancing in a car right now and she decision that on a 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.159
 computer data that is transmitted by by light bruno sound 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.370
 mask that's because what's exciting in the body after 10 km 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:00.989
 is not quite what happens after 15 20 30 and 40 injured 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.869
 quite interesting to see them 

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:06.459
 in situation that's what's happening what's going on for big 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.989
 daubes we discover there the winners was still loyal to 100 2 hours 10
