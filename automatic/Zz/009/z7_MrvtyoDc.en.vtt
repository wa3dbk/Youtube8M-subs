00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 Hello everyone, today you want to make mine live 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.389
 old project practically the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.590
 realization of this bob in a manner 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.280
 completely handmade 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:18.090
 now I pull it, I 'll show you how 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.529
 I realized practically not 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.570
 we can disassemble it of course but 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.029
 I will try to explain it to you in the best way 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.070
 possible 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:30.960
 as you see below we have a sheet 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.640
 that practically all the toboggan run 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:39.270
 and in front it covers the whole curve up to 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.190
 here on this all a sheet 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.379
 then since I punched holes for 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.789
 I had it perfectly smooth underneath 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:52.320
 inserted later in a second 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:55.829
 riveted sheet on the sides you see of 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.399
 dark that the supporting surface with 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.710
 the snow is perfectly smooth for 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.650
 keep the curvature of the sheet 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.320
 then I made with other sheets 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:14.000
 these flanks here that to them 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.420
 time they are poured on the first way 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.950
 and on top 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:24.979
 I founded the bordeaux to avoid 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.979
 that cut something very important 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.740
 then in the dump I recovered this 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.740
 old coach board 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:49.200
 has been fixed on the sheet by means of the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:52.799
 the same l there are four says the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.330
 foam rubber goes under there are others 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.929
 even here in front and side panels I do n't know 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:05.670
 you are recognized but are simply 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:08.239
 the plates with which they are made 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.720
 player the shutters so to speak 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:16.920
 custom-made garages 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:20.010
 two per side and also these riveted to the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.810
 bottom there are slits a spoken one 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.350
 as a network to insert hands for 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.650
 carry it and even here I entered 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.989
 he had attached rubber to avoid 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.549
 to cut his hands even the deputy 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:40.010
 coordinate this here practically e 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:43.430
 of the adhesive wine that is used for 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.980
 protect the water pipes in the frost 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:51.420
 then try us on all sides and 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.840
 very strong and thick and stick very well 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.260
 well it doesn't come off then inside had 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.049
 inserted by blocks the more paragraph for 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.690
 to cushion unavoidable bumps a little 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.630
 they happened as much as anything 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.450
 behind is enough space for one 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:14.209
 second person and I entered this 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.260
 round bar to give stability of course 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:21.359
 to the proletarian structure that is 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:25.069
 they opened their hips and then finally i 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.069
 brakes I had used 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:34.250
 the old rods I had in the garage 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.310
 handle is always made the handle 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:44.950
 with the sheath I said before 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:44.950
 here is the pivot on which the Koran rotates 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:53.950
 made with recovery percy at the bottom 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.950
 he had inserted this bent harpoon 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:02.560
 that were discreetly merged into the 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:06.040
 also because I assure you that to stop 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.250
 this monster when it takes speed 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.160
 serious when good brakes or last 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.550
 the true nature made with a canister 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.890
 that in front of oren and salted on the fly 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:28.480
 four signs with a cardboard 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:28.480
 cut it out here
