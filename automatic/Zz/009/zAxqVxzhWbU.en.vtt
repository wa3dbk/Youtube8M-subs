docking is fairly simple just pops right
in<00:01:32.460> here<00:01:33.170> makes<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.259> little<00:01:34.409> sound<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.890> let<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
in here makes a little sound to let you

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.030 
in here makes a little sound to let you
know<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> docked<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.409> you<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.590> close<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.950> like

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
know a docked and you can close it like

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.609 
know a docked and you can close it like
a<00:01:38.100> clamshell<00:01:38.720> or<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.710> actually<00:01:40.920> open<00:01:41.280> it

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
a clamshell or you can actually open it

a clamshell or you can actually open it
about<00:01:43.619> 300<00:01:44.340> degrees<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.630> want<00:01:45.810> to

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
about 300 degrees so if you want to

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.539 
about 300 degrees so if you want to
watch<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.170> movie<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.710> still<00:01:47.009> keep<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.340> docked

this is a good way to do it one nice
thing<00:01:50.280> about<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:51.119> system<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.200> has

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
thing about this system is that it has

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.530 
thing about this system is that it has
extremely<00:01:52.890> long<00:01:53.130> battery<00:01:53.399> life<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.970> tablet

extremely long battery life the tablet

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.389 
extremely long battery life the tablet
alone<00:01:54.600> gets<00:01:54.960> about<00:01:55.170> eight<00:01:55.409> close<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.219> nine

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
alone gets about eight close to nine
