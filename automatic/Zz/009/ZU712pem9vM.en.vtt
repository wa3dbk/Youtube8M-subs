00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
happen but you know when I looked at

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.910 
happen but you know when I looked at
their<00:01:11.760> GDP<00:01:12.210> assumptions<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> gauge<00:01:13.740> of

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
their GDP assumptions this is a gauge of

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.010 
their GDP assumptions this is a gauge of
how<00:01:13.979> much<00:01:14.970> they<00:01:15.240> see<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.540> economy<00:01:15.900> will<00:01:15.990> grow

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
how much they see the economy will grow

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.170 
how much they see the economy will grow
in<00:01:16.200> future<00:01:16.530> years<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:17.310> seems<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.060> little

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
in future years it seems a little

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.480 
in future years it seems a little
generous<00:01:18.509> given<00:01:19.020> these<00:01:19.200> deficits<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.070> given

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
generous given these deficits and given

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.920 
generous given these deficits and given
the<00:01:20.580> fact<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.060> lot<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.299> things<00:01:21.570> could<00:01:21.810> hit

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the fact that a lot of things could hit

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.600 
the fact that a lot of things could hit
the<00:01:22.080> fan<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.770> couple<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.070> years<00:01:23.130> as<00:01:23.460> you've

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the fan in a couple of years as you've

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.070 
the fan in a couple of years as you've
won<00:01:23.850> right<00:01:24.030> yeah<00:01:24.420> that's<00:01:24.630> building<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
won right yeah that's building to the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.539 
won right yeah that's building to the
assumption<00:01:25.439> we<00:01:25.590> stress<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.100> because<00:01:26.400> if

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
assumption we stress this because if

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.130 
assumption we stress this because if
these<00:01:26.970> are<00:01:27.180> coming<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.720> underlying

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
these are coming the underlying

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.230 
these are coming the underlying
assumptions<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.770> your<00:01:28.890> map<00:01:29.040> obviously<00:01:29.970> you're

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
assumptions in your map obviously you're

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.940 
assumptions in your map obviously you're
going<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:30.689> more<00:01:30.990> generous<00:01:31.439> revenue

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
going to have more generous revenue

money that's been created where we just

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.200 
money that's been created where we just
raise<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.560> national<00:02:54.980> debt<00:02:55.130> ceiling<00:02:55.520> by<00:02:55.970> one
