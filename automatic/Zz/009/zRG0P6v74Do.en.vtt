okay<00:00:01.800> so<00:00:02.190> if<00:00:02.610> you're<00:00:02.850> like<00:00:03.030> me<00:00:03.589> you're<00:00:04.589> we

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
okay so if you're like me you're we

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.900 
okay so if you're like me you're we
drive<00:00:05.310> has<00:00:05.759> started<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.450> become<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.870> bit<00:00:07.200> noisy

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
drive has started to become a bit noisy

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.910 
drive has started to become a bit noisy
you<00:00:08.910> know<00:00:09.599> it's<00:00:09.750> not<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.929> vibration<00:00:10.469> from<00:00:10.769> the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
you know it's not a vibration from the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.350 
you know it's not a vibration from the
case<00:00:11.130> or<00:00:11.340> whatever<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.730> actually<00:00:12.030> know<00:00:12.179> that

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
case or whatever you actually know that

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.089 
case or whatever you actually know that
it's<00:00:12.480> from<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.840> drive<00:00:13.080> whenever<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.920> put<00:00:14.040> a

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
it's from the drive whenever you put a

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.310 
it's from the drive whenever you put a
disk<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.610> starts<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.049> make<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.199> know<00:00:16.289> like

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
disk in it starts to make you know like

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.290 
disk in it starts to make you know like
a<00:00:16.470> little<00:00:16.590> vibrating<00:00:17.070> noise<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.490> have

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
a little vibrating noise I have

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.460 
a little vibrating noise I have
discovered<00:00:18.960> exactly<00:00:19.890> why<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.400> happens<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.840> a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
discovered exactly why it happens and a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.710 
discovered exactly why it happens and a
solution<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.880> what<00:00:24.029> happens<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.539> if<00:00:24.689> you

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
solution to it so what happens is if you

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.439 
solution to it so what happens is if you
can<00:00:24.930> see<00:00:25.260> right<00:00:26.010> here<00:00:26.090> you<00:00:27.090> have<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.240> little

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
can see right here you have a little

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.759 
can see right here you have a little
mechanism<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:28.140> whenever<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.470> insert<00:00:28.710> a

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
mechanism that whenever you insert a

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.950 
mechanism that whenever you insert a
disc<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.279> part<00:00:29.519> goes<00:00:29.730> down<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.840> holds

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
disc this part goes down and it holds

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.889 
disc this part goes down and it holds
the<00:00:31.109> disc<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.470> place<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:33.360> what<00:00:33.510> happens<00:00:33.780> with

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
the disc in place so what happens with

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.090 
the disc in place so what happens with
that<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.200> much<00:00:34.860> as<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.309> will<00:00:35.520> show<00:00:36.770> my<00:00:37.770> Mario

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
that is much as I will show my Mario

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.520 
that is much as I will show my Mario
Kart<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:41.660> you'll<00:00:42.660> see<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.899> press<00:00:43.140> down<00:00:43.350> right

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
Kart here you'll see it press down right

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.180 
Kart here you'll see it press down right
there<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:44.700> as<00:00:44.940> you'll<00:00:45.120> notice<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:46.190> little

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
there and then as you'll notice a little

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.490 
there and then as you'll notice a little
noise<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.670> startup<00:00:48.000> but<00:00:48.500> eventually

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
noise on the startup but eventually

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.790 
noise on the startup but eventually
there's<00:00:51.079> still<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> little<00:00:52.170> bit<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.440> noise<00:00:52.530> but

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
there's still a little bit of noise but

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.990 
there's still a little bit of noise but
if<00:00:52.920> you'll<00:00:53.070> notice<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.520> if<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.730> push<00:00:53.969> down

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
if you'll notice that if I push down

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.510 
if you'll notice that if I push down
right<00:00:54.390> here<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.629> center<00:00:55.039> almost<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
right here in the center almost all the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.790 
right here in the center almost all the
vibration<00:00:57.000> goes<00:00:57.180> away<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:58.170> reason<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.590> is

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
vibration goes away the reason that is

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.369 
vibration goes away the reason that is
is<00:00:58.829> because<00:00:59.210> this<00:01:00.210> little<00:01:00.539> bar<00:01:00.660> flexes<00:01:01.170> here

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
is because this little bar flexes here

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.229 
is because this little bar flexes here
so<00:01:01.559> over<00:01:01.710> time<00:01:02.100> what<00:01:02.370> happens<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:02.910> it

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
so over time what happens is that it

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.020 
so over time what happens is that it
loses<00:01:03.629> its<00:01:03.840> spring<00:01:04.290> action<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.549> tension<00:01:05.939> that

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
loses its spring action the tension that

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.570 
loses its spring action the tension that
it<00:01:06.119> goes<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.450> disks<00:01:07.040> so<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.369> know<00:01:08.460> if

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
it goes on the disks so like you know if

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.420 
it goes on the disks so like you know if
you<00:01:08.700> turn<00:01:09.150> off<00:01:09.270> your<00:01:09.299> wii<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.280> leave<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
you turn off your wii and then leave the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.490 
you turn off your wii and then leave the
disc<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.850> what<00:01:12.299> happens<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.930> bar<00:01:13.170> stays

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
disc in what happens is this bar stays

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.130 
disc in what happens is this bar stays
straight<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.270> eventually<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> loses<00:01:15.810> its

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
straight and eventually it loses its

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.740 
straight and eventually it loses its
tension<00:01:16.729> causing<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.820> vibrating<00:01:18.360> noise<00:01:18.479> so

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
tension causing that vibrating noise so

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.620 
tension causing that vibrating noise so
what<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:20.189> unscrew<00:01:20.729> these<00:01:21.570> two

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
what you do is you unscrew these two

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.840 
what you do is you unscrew these two
screws<00:01:21.930> right<00:01:22.380> here<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.430> whole<00:01:23.640> piece

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
screws right here and this whole piece

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:34.970 
screws right here and this whole piece
actually<00:01:24.030> comes<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:26.060> ejected<00:01:27.060> bass<00:01:27.299> king

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.060 

okay<00:01:36.870> okay<00:01:37.870> so<00:01:38.080> you<00:01:38.650> just<00:01:38.830> take<00:01:38.980> your

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
okay okay so you just take your

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:54.580 
okay okay so you just take your
screwdriver<00:01:39.400> here<00:01:45.930> take<00:01:46.930> that<00:01:46.960> out

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.289 

and<00:01:55.130> I'd<00:01:55.250> be<00:01:55.400> careful<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:55.880> you<00:01:55.940> don't<00:01:56.060> lose

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
and I'd be careful that you don't lose

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.969 
and I'd be careful that you don't lose
these<00:01:56.479> screws<00:01:56.810> they<00:01:57.080> fall<00:01:57.350> inside<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.740> drive

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
these screws they fall inside the drive

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.219 
these screws they fall inside the drive
or<00:01:58.159> anything<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:01.250> then<00:02:01.540> so<00:02:02.540> I<00:02:02.570> very<00:02:02.690> carefully

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
or anything and then so I very carefully

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.050 
or anything and then so I very carefully
pull<00:02:03.950> this<00:02:04.040> whole<00:02:04.220> part<00:02:04.460> out<00:02:04.580> just<00:02:04.850> slides

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
pull this whole part out just slides

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.910 
pull this whole part out just slides
right<00:02:05.390> out<00:02:05.450> underneath<00:02:06.020> those<00:02:06.200> two<00:02:06.650> little

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
right out underneath those two little

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.430 
right out underneath those two little
bars<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.490> are<00:02:07.610> right<00:02:07.759> there<00:02:09.729> okay<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:12.230> then

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
bars that are right there okay so then

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.470 
bars that are right there okay so then
if<00:02:12.470> you'll<00:02:12.770> notice<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.640> way<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.910> is<00:02:14.030> angled

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
if you'll notice the way it is angled

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.750 
if you'll notice the way it is angled
see<00:02:15.110> how<00:02:15.230> puts<00:02:15.530> tension<00:02:15.920> down<00:02:16.250> on<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.520> disc

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
see how puts tension down on the disc

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.820 
see how puts tension down on the disc
this<00:02:17.270> part<00:02:17.720> these<00:02:17.870> two<00:02:18.080> screws<00:02:18.470> right<00:02:18.620> there

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
this part these two screws right there

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.500 
this part these two screws right there
going<00:02:19.069> right<00:02:19.220> there<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:19.850> holds<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.209> flat

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
going right there and it holds it flat

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.780 
going right there and it holds it flat
and<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.560> part<00:02:21.770> actually<00:02:21.890> goes<00:02:22.220> tension<00:02:22.640> so

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
and that part actually goes tension so

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.940 
and that part actually goes tension so
what<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.060> have<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.239> do<00:02:23.630> is<00:02:24.459> kind<00:02:25.459> of<00:02:25.640> just<00:02:26.239> very

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
what you have to do is kind of just very

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.090 
what you have to do is kind of just very
very<00:02:28.000> gingerly<00:02:29.000> Bend<00:02:29.930> this<00:02:30.260> area<00:02:30.830> right<00:02:31.040> here

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
very gingerly Bend this area right here

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.720 
very gingerly Bend this area right here
back<00:02:31.580> down<00:02:31.850> where<00:02:32.360> these<00:02:32.570> two<00:02:32.900> angles<00:02:33.080> go<00:02:33.730> it

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
back down where these two angles go it

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.130 
back down where these two angles go it
takes<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:35.000> little<00:02:35.090> trial<00:02:35.390> trial<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:35.930> error<00:02:36.050> you

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
takes a little trial trial and error you

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.490 
takes a little trial trial and error you
know<00:02:36.320> just<00:02:36.620> move<00:02:36.769> it<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:36.950> little<00:02:36.980> bit<00:02:37.310> each<00:02:37.700> time

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
know just move it a little bit each time

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.050 
know just move it a little bit each time
but<00:02:39.500> eventually<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.980> will<00:02:40.040> start<00:02:40.130> putting<00:02:40.400> the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
but eventually it will start putting the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.210 
but eventually it will start putting the
proper<00:02:41.360> amount<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.660> pressure<00:02:41.989> onto<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.950> disc

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
proper amount of pressure onto the disc

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.670 
proper amount of pressure onto the disc
again<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.819> will<00:02:43.880> stop<00:02:44.090> making<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.390> noise

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
again and it will stop making that noise

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.780 
again and it will stop making that noise
which<00:02:45.680> is<00:02:45.709> actually<00:02:46.100> this<00:02:46.190> plastic<00:02:46.610> part

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
which is actually this plastic part

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.910 
which is actually this plastic part
hitting<00:02:47.120> right<00:02:47.269> here<00:02:47.530> but<00:02:48.530> if<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.709> push

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
hitting right here but if you push

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.770 
hitting right here but if you push
enough<00:02:49.220> pressure<00:02:49.760> on<00:02:50.090> there<00:02:50.269> it<00:02:50.690> will

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
enough pressure on there it will

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.270 
enough pressure on there it will
actually<00:02:50.900> stop<00:02:51.590> that<00:02:51.769> vibration<00:02:52.190> all

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
actually stop that vibration all

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.660 
actually stop that vibration all
together<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:54.440> yeah<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:54.860> then<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.220> guess<00:02:55.459> for

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
together so yeah and then I guess for

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.430 
together so yeah and then I guess for
future<00:02:56.000> just<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.390> try<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:56.959> make<00:02:57.140> sure<00:02:57.170> this

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
future just to try to make sure this

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.990 
future just to try to make sure this
doesn't<00:02:57.620> happen<00:02:57.769> again<00:02:58.069> you<00:02:58.400> might<00:02:58.700> want<00:02:58.760> to

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
doesn't happen again you might want to

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.090 
doesn't happen again you might want to
just<00:02:59.209> try<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.480> leave<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.989> disc<00:03:00.320> outside<00:03:00.980> of

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
just try to leave the disc outside of

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.090 
just try to leave the disc outside of
the<00:03:01.250> week<00:03:01.430> that<00:03:02.420> way<00:03:02.630> it<00:03:02.840> keeps<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.650> spring

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
the week that way it keeps the spring

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.819 
the week that way it keeps the spring
action<00:03:04.430> happen<00:03:04.940> in<00:03:05.060> there<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:06.380> that's<00:03:06.620> what<00:03:06.799> I

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
action happen in there and that's what I

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.479 
action happen in there and that's what I
believe<00:03:06.950> is<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:08.890> explanations<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.190> the

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
believe is the explanations and the

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.950 
believe is the explanations and the
solution<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:12.110> vibrating<00:03:12.500> problem
