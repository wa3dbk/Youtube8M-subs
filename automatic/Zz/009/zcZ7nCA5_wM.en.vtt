out<00:04:20.290> of<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.470> demo<00:04:21.120> shouldn't<00:04:22.120> I<00:04:22.270> should<00:04:22.450> do

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
out of the demo shouldn't I should do

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:32.980 
out of the demo shouldn't I should do
that<00:04:22.720> sometime

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.969 

clearly<00:04:33.990> from<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:34.199> demo<00:04:34.500> was<00:04:34.740> kind<00:04:34.919> of

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
clearly from the demo was kind of

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.210 
clearly from the demo was kind of
cheating<00:04:35.340> though

cheating though

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.130
