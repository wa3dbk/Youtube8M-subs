into<00:00:58.329> four<00:00:58.780> basic<00:00:59.110> strategies<00:00:59.890> which<00:01:00.250> are

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
into four basic strategies which are

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.790 
into four basic strategies which are
leveraging<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.050> competition<00:01:02.590> among

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
leveraging the competition among

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.650 
leveraging the competition among
suppliers<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.610> traditional<00:01:04.089> approach<00:01:04.390> but

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
suppliers the traditional approach but

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.859 
suppliers the traditional approach but
also<00:01:04.720> about<00:01:05.460> managing<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.580> demand<00:01:06.940> and

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
also about managing the demand and

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.590 
also about managing the demand and
reducing<00:01:08.410> it<00:01:08.610> for<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.670> same<00:01:09.850> service<00:01:10.210> levels

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
reducing it for the same service levels

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.570 
reducing it for the same service levels
it<00:01:11.200> also<00:01:11.380> looks<00:01:11.590> at<00:01:11.740> things<00:01:11.920> like<00:01:12.009> changing

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
it also looks at things like changing

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.249 
it also looks at things like changing
the<00:01:12.670> nature<00:01:12.880> of<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.210> demand<00:01:13.539> by<00:01:13.899> looking<00:01:14.170> at

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
the nature of the demand by looking at

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.830 
the nature of the demand by looking at
the<00:01:14.320> specifications<00:01:15.070> or<00:01:15.280> partnering<00:01:16.240> jointly

the specifications or partnering jointly

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.090 
the specifications or partnering jointly
with<00:01:16.930> your<00:01:17.080> suppliers<00:01:17.440> to<00:01:17.560> seek<00:01:17.800> a<00:01:17.920> common

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
with your suppliers to seek a common

advantage<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:19.000> strategy<00:01:19.479> to<00:01:19.630> apply<00:01:19.960> it

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
advantage the strategy to apply it

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.260 
advantage the strategy to apply it
depends<00:01:20.920> on<00:01:21.039> two<00:01:21.340> things<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.670> supply<00:01:22.000> power

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
depends on two things the supply power

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.570 
depends on two things the supply power
and<00:01:22.509> the<00:01:22.599> demand<00:01:22.929> power<00:01:23.170> so<00:01:23.590> if<00:01:23.890> a<00:01:24.069> company<00:01:24.310> is

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
and the demand power so if a company is

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.999 
and the demand power so if a company is
looking<00:01:25.270> at<00:01:25.479> a<00:01:25.509> specific<00:01:26.170> product<00:01:26.440> category

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
to look at is the purchasing power they

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.089 
to look at is the purchasing power they
have<00:01:31.509> as<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.660> buyer<00:01:31.929> in<00:01:32.200> that<00:01:32.380> market<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:32.890> the
