00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 we all have our own battles 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.000
 dreamed and probably most 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.130
 will continue to be dreamed either by the 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.349
 age of these fighters or because they no longer 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.730
 be in this world anyway 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.400
 we hope that one day 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.350
 somehow happen but like that 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.710
 it will not happen soon I proceed to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.000
 present the 8 most dreamed matches 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.730
 double w 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.320
 number 8 if in punk versus stone cold it is 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.150
 known that more than once the fans 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.610
 they had the idea that this fight 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.050
 It could be carried out even though 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.390
 stone cold has said that its 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.250
 career that there is no reason to return or 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.110
 it simply prevents age 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.050
 do the things that I did before 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.390
 matter the fans we are intransables and 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.650
 continue with a living dream of seeing in time 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.810
 although steve austin in a ring 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.580
 the way of being of both combines 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.720
 perfectly to give us a degree 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.700
 amazing 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.650
 Austin is the old man who 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.410
 defies authority and refuses to 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.050
 to be told what to do for Austin the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.699
 ring is where he takes control 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.770
 I could say that both fighters cause 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.350
 perfect since the character he had 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.600
 time was essentially the one he had is 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.730
 so young anna the only clear difference 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.620
 x tom when he expresses how well he wants 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.880
 whoever gets in the way and 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.400
 always with the being of his sister 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.229
 while he always only used his faithful 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.030
 microphone to say the things that all 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.060
 they wanted to say but nobody had the 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.210
 guts to do it in a way the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.210
 voice 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.360
 it's a big dream and unfortunately it's 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.360
 very unlikely that ever 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.300
 number 7 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.970
 big show versus andrew the giantess there 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.320
 something bigger than this the giant more 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.200
 recognized in the history of wrestling 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.020
 andrÃ©s de giant versus the athlete more 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.630
 long of the world big show your bout 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.550
 it would be a literal clash of titans are 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.440
 the two largest phenomena that have been 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.970
 seen in double w 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.190
 and if they had ever faced each other 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.750
 face to face we have more than clear that 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.360
 they would have given us a fight 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.730
 impressive not because of its speed nor 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.280
 technique would be impressive just for the 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.560
 fact that everyone will stand together in 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.360
 the ring the result this fight is 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.420
 difficult to predict and unfortunately 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.190
 we will never know, we just have to continue 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.440
 dreaming 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.600
 number 6 john without having his judges that the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.600
 original superman versus the classic 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.120
 golden boy jones ina and they judge would have 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.340
 an epic fight independent of the 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.680
 combat quality would be not viable for 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.660
 the world of double w 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.430
 both are the biggest names in 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.320
 the story of the version and a face to face 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.470
 of both heroes would be more than 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.990
 entertaining the question is a game that 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.750
 will make your electro pool or if not 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.070
 will respond with an attitude adjustment the 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.920
 two are the faces of their generations 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.710
 being in each main event in each 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.630
 volume already always present now goes 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.000
 for women and children but day two 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.120
 for many men the final question is 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.130
 what are you going to do when the selection and 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.530
 judge men and wild satan in you 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.880
 brother 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.640
 number 5 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.500
 the rock versus shawn michaels 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.390
 this combat would have been stolen at 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.610
 looks from any fan to see if 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.740
 nobody understands like the double double and 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.110
 it never occurred to him to put on the rock and 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.330
 shawn michaels in a fight together by 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.490
 very surprising that it sounds true 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.310
 these brilliant fighters are never 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.220
 the points are ring for a simple reason 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.650
 they got it wrong it was easy there was no 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.810
 chemistry the high personality of both 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.730
 it led to fans the westin never 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.459
 they saw a fight that would surely be 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.170
 a masterpiece their rivalry would have 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.880
 been the best since both manage 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.310
 good leads excellent entries 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.650
 admirable movements in the ring and a lot 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.690
 support from the fans the champion of the people 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.480
 broken hearts in front of the boy he had 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.930
 been a combat that would surpass what 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:08.000
 surprising 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:10.609
 number 4 red hat versus with range this 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.170
 it would be a technical show can 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.120
 leave excellence to the execution 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.400
 against cold and go the medalist 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.410
 olympic imagine what would have been 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.750
 have a fight where these two 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.980
 show the best your expertise in the 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.680
 king 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.660
 their bodies are similar their erre said 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.190
 is comparable and your senses we 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.640
 would have complemented the more 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.110
 in the king his rivalry would have reached 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.580
 perfectly since 'not for long 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.890
 time was considered the hero 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.720
 american while hart as well 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.490
 known for being anti-American and 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.830
 proud to be the cadence flag 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.200
 all this would lead us to a rivalry 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.750
 A must-see that would end in a fight 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.310
 of those 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.560
 number 3 is tom court versus code see 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.300
 this shock of sending protagonists to 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.400
 two very popular fighters and 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.080
 destructive each one raised the 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.500
 Robert Sing's economy through the skies 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.710
 in each of its companies 1 in double w 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.080
 and the other in double sw in the 90s 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.570
 you could talk about the westin without mentioning 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.540
 these two this combat would have been something 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.550
 fatal with much violence and emotion the 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.590
 extractive goldberg against grand stone 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.660
 com although this combat probably 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.980
 will continue in other dreams we can not deny 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.449
 that would have an incomparable impact 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:29.139
 number 2 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:31.449
 is tom court versus woodcock in the two 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.520
 superstars that marked times in the 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.020
 history of seeing without this combat was 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.539
 asked for a long time with the fans 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.749
 stone cold steve austin versus the 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:43.059
 immortal fuck ok not only is it enough to say 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:44.800
 that his combat would be great too 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:46.870
 it adds that both were the faces of 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.650
 the version for years and that led to the 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.409
 double w 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.150
 to their best time respectively in 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:54.099
 summary can be said that they made 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.469
 wrestling a global phenomenon 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:59.439
 the combat itself would be spectacular the 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:02.289
 people would be divided 50 and 50 ones with 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:03.669
 the rebel 316 of austin and others with the 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:06.069
 multimedia on fire 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.900
 we never know and if a surprise is 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:11.540
 where everything would end or the famous 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.950
 electro that would sentence the combat 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.950
 number 1 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.870
 undertaker first sting this is unique is 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.150
 a match that excites the fans with 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.639
 look to be done in average universe 31 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.030
 but that unfortunately will not be brought to 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:28.669
 cape 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.319
 sting and the undertaker meeting in 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:31.920
 the ring would give us goosebumps to 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:34.380
 everyone 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.660
 both represent their companies as 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.970
 no other are true icon of 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.360
 our one fight that had these 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:44.520
 two veterans would be a masterpiece 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.110
 it would simply steal the show would be a 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.030
 honors match in which they would leave 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.580
 everything in the ring to confirm that they are 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.870
 legendary fighters does not matter that already 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.900
 are not the same as their best 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.700
 days their promos would be phenomenal and for 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.610
 the mere fact that the two are in the 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.530
 same ring is enough to see man 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.320
 dead walk on the fog in his 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.570
 epic entry only to fight against 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.630
 sting who would also give us his 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.430
 magical and peculiar entrance would be something 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:15.500
 difficult to explain with words that 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.500
 you just have to live
