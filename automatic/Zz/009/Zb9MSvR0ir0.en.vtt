00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
doesn't replace doing a carb clean out

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.940 
doesn't replace doing a carb clean out
or<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.390> carb<00:01:39.900> rebuild<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.590> doesn't<00:01:40.860> replace

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
or a carb rebuild it doesn't replace

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.670 
or a carb rebuild it doesn't replace
that<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> does<00:01:42.299> keep<00:01:42.540> your<00:01:42.810> jets<00:01:43.079> clean<00:01:43.409> so

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.630 
that sometimes the Jets you can't clean
them<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.829> guess<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.920> can't<00:01:47.100> get<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.399> them<00:01:47.460> and
