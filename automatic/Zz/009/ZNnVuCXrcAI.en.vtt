00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:08.040
 Welcome to my wind tunnel with the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.460
 name Mike in the tutorial channel my name 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.980
 is michael I will now only one 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.840
 say few things and then we start 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:22.830
 yes okay so on request of some 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.840
 Subscribers I will be more often from today 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.330
 to deal with the development 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.690
 It was expressly the wish 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.780
 said to be active says 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.370
 table is a raw converter for linux 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.629
 and for meego is under windows you can 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.070
 you can also use it under windows 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:51.510
 use it as an iso-file as a 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.940
 runway file on a dvd or on 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.469
 a cd burns and then over that 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.129
 dvd drive so you can start it 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.549
 then, so to speak , in a virtual 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.770
 use the environment 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.950
 and of course I have to 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.869
 first of all incorporate into this topic 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:20.189
 because I have been with this story before 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:23.100
 had relatively little to do and say 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.750
 we been there dublin his functions yes 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.740
 which I do not differentiate now 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.299
 to go in to understand better 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.960
 I recommend the video of karsten 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.170
 Günther karsten Günther shows thanks to table 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.090
 u boot on and in Vienna 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.340
 I have videolink in the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.939
 description given in and the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.700
 karsten günther explains in detail here 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.479
 the function of dark table based on 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.149
 examples 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:57.600
 yes, yes, I will now against it first 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:01.229
 just a little insight into the topic 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.860
 give into the local contrast 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.469
 gain with the equalizer that 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.229
 you can find the original tutorial of it 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.569
 shutter speed you can find the link to it 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.620
 also in the video description 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:22.109
 as well as the downloadlink for the photo and 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:24.599
 the downloadlink leads just as I have 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:27.359
 me here on the light table 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.569
 directory imported so you can 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:33.450
 single pictures in dark table inside 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.260
 import or an entire directory 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.459
 or from devices so from photographer 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.829
 You can also use cameras from cameras 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:46.260
 pictures on this light table 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:48.569
 import and we will now if 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.489
 Here we take a picture I take 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.510
 for example the second one from the left 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.609
 and if I double click on it 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.030
 then we come to the so-called 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:03.209
 darkroom and in this darkroom 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.099
 There are many and many 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.209
 possibilities to edit this picture 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.629
 originally it is thought that way 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:16.230
 just raw files so format files 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.239
 edited because they are mostly one 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.159
 a bit dull and weak in the 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.439
 colors and the contrasts and so on 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.790
 but of course you can use table 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:29.870
 actually do a lot more that is 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:34.590
 practically so to speak the ambivalent to 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.750
 lightroom in linux okay and as 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.209
 First of all, I just want to show you completely 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.400
 in short, how to deal with the so-called 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.560
 equalizer the local contrast 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.849
 can amplify 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.349
 Let's give this to the here 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.120
 I have the equalizer 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.639
 even here in the favorites in 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.620
 loaded it goes over further modules here 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.329
 below you can find that and then you can 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.009
 click on this module and then you could 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.569
 do new favorites 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.069
 I already have that with the 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.500
 made equalizer and then we open 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.870
 now here 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.979
 and yes we can then luminance 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.310
 excuse me for luminance 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:13.829
 luminosity become easy here 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.539
 only with the kur process and that 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:19.799
 if we take the second point from here 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:24.000
 take left mouse button and on the left 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:26.330
 next higher parts pull the here 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.330
 we pull down completely 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.879
 the first here also the first left 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.960
 quite down but a bit 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:37.860
 always pull up a bit 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:42.599
 news that you pull we also like that 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.199
 in about the same direction 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.169
 above 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.969
 and here we have to go to the 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.000
 fine adjustments here a bit 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:54.180
 rework and pull and here too 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.500
 The curve is about as you are here 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:02.879
 See, that would be the local contrast 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.569
 gain over the equalizer in the 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:06.539
 subjects 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.770
 I switch it again from here can 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:11.280
 you clearly see that this is 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.159
 original picture and here with the local 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.669
 contrast gain 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:19.740
 i hope my short tutorial will be mine 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:23.960
 first has some information 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:26.009
 given and then I will go now and then 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.949
 or depending on 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:32.779
 often at noon table a few 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.710
 do tutorials 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:36.810
 maybe I will also have a few 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.870
 rebuild lightroom tutorials 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.379
 I need a bit of time for that 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.909
 I hope he stays with me 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:47.389
 thanks for looking up to the 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.389
 next time
