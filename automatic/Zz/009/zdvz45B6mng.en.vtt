00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:10.150
 hello my name is to explain the parts of 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:14.410
 computer for it instead of the book that 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:18.010
 it is very nice still pics 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:21.550
 explained very well and we prefer 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.340
 put the unordered slogan is worth then 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.100
 what we are seeing here 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.260
 and he has it in front of him this is called the 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.180
 motherboard of the motherboard will mount 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.000
 on the box 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.260
 and it has a lot of frank connectors and 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.570
 that you will not lose 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.570
 then the motherboard has 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.170
 apart from the motherboard you have to 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.620
 have a power source 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.620
 or care 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.120
 then you have to have a source 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:01.269
 power that has some cables here 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.019
 that come out and plug in all the 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.770
 dispositives 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:08.810
 the plate has to plug in 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.140
 to how much food because if not 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.140
 it is understood 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.640
 this just has a way of putting 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.060
 these are the signs way mind the 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.880
 secret if you try to put the other one 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.310
 way you have to be very strong 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:33.159
 another long vale 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.600
 Gemma has the amount of cables 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.000
 who has these cables fans for 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.630
 devices for example 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.119
 for hard disk that is here is hard 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.579
 and you have two connections you have this 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.020
 connection is the power this 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.920
 condition that on hillsides where also 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.920
 I had the plate 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.010
 not only do you have a way on your plot 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.990
 and then you have the rosemary where more 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.100
 ancient that also has the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.440
 current power and data ok let's go 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.700
 to center a little on the flat the 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.700
 plate has here 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.920
 a connector for connecting a cpu s 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.290
 and it is the most important part of 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.830
 computer in which the brain thinks 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.750
 of the computer 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.960
 Hello 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.700
 but it has a historical interest are the 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.910
 cases in the processing in the part 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.910
 that is worth more money I am one that 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.910
 brand as do 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.060
 and then what you see here is the 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.340
 processed itself that is covered with 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.540
 a putty that what it does is 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.490
 transfer the heat because this is 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.230
 we heat then transfer the heat 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.230
 to this piece of massage 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.629
 that ventilate health care 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.200
 this has transmitted the heat up and already 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:08.430
 by the fan of the ark 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.440
 then you have to put the cpu 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.209
 to make it work you have to have 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.590
 beware of the pins that go in your 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.780
 site as you are not wrong the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.560
 pills the lees then have here 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.560
 in triangles 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.850
 in a triangle that points you to where 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.850
 have to go 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.680
 beautiful 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.260
 if you put it in 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.260
 have go let's go from local 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.560
 do not 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.520
 this is more doubled since I 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.920
 you put it and lives to go down and it 's 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.920
 putting the faith but then it would be over 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:04:00.109
 obviously 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.290
 this has an expired current of 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.290
 Nov 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.750
 unplugged here 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:20.370
 then this is anchored here clearly and 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.680
 it is plugged in and the fan already has 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.650
 cpu fan base whatever you think of 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.450
 the simple or clear part you think and 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.490
 the operations but it seems to need 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.490
 data the missing data 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.669
 1 - in mounting a bar 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.249
 the plugged in the plate that the plate 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.159
 outside to communicate everything then the 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:47.560
 Ranc keeps everything you are seeing 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:50.110
 at this time all web pages 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.830
 the document that you are touching this 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.830
 It is very easy to put 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.700
 the goal here is already 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.350
 it gets to find we have better because 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.230
 more with the door in Ã¡lava 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.530
 and then of course if it goes to light the 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.950
 content of this memory is deleted where 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.330
 save the things that the disk does not keep 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.220
 something you give to keep what is 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.110
 happening is that it goes from this memory to this 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.930
 memory this memory is not deleted when 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.009
 the fingers go out 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.009
 of the hard disk 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.889
 has its data failure that goes from the 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.660
 plate up the hard drive then what 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.030
 what happens with the guards to what is 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.539
 happening here here that has more 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.539
 computer 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.380
 the ran 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.240
 the hard drive we go to the information the 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.310
 cpu these are the most important parts 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.270
 the source feed the box 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.400
 and then from behind it has connectors 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.020
 these collectors are different bread 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.639
 devices of a key part of a 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.219
 old moral 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.860
 the green keyboard the mouse then has a 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:05.810
 pair of ports usb a port for 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.860
 connect it to the network that was already wifi not 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.840
 de facto 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.719
 These are ancient port 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.610
 parallel fourth series and the port of 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:15.729
 jake and then has four connectors 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.920
 the speakers 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:21.490
 after c 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.030
 all this microphone if they have here 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.030
 integrated 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.509
 the one in charge of the audio formerly 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:32.030
 each one if it came separated a card for 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:34.669
 to give it integrated the plate then all the 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.870
 computers have to connect a 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.870
 monitor that not all a man 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.130
 everything else connects a monitor everything sounds 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.990
 formerly the poplars that are put in 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.070
 cards are derived here in these 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.140
 ports 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.969
 here's the tangent of the days over here 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.599
 but it is that it is no longer necessary 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:55.599
 good 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:02.479
 and we are even ordered and have no more 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:06.530
 on the plate mounted the cpu ravine 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:06.530
 connect hard drives dvds 

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:11.449
 connect to the ribs behind the 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:15.099
 mouse keyboard and the monitor and the 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:15.099
 speakers do not have 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.600
 better than here 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.590
 I could not ride your hours if you wanted 

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.590
 you want to ride
