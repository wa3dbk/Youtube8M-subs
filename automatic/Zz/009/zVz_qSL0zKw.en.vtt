00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
back is just mud accurate I guess but

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.400

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
right so far he's the most accurate one

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.780 
right so far he's the most accurate one
and<00:04:58.320> he<00:04:58.380> actually<00:04:58.500> looks<00:04:58.860> somewhat<00:04:59.550> decent

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
and he actually looks somewhat decent

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.940 
and he actually looks somewhat decent

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
like if he got you on those and another

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.660 
like if he got you on those and another
side<00:05:02.190> looks<00:05:02.460> better<00:05:06.260> figure<00:05:07.490> don't<00:05:08.490> when<00:05:08.610> you

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
side looks better figure don't when you

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.600 
side looks better figure don't when you
get<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:08.910> mask<00:05:09.120> wrong<00:05:09.660> but<00:05:10.070> they<00:05:11.070> sort<00:05:11.430> of<00:05:11.490> ran
