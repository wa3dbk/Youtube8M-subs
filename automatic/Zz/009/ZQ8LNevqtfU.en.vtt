00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:41.560
 five years of retirement 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:42.120
 after his blunder at a good start of 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.739
 playoffs 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.890
 yes we worked in training 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.020
 as I repeated them and it's not my 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.100
 individual benefit that I have that I 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.780
 'm glad it's all the appreciation 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.850
 the team we had fun on the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.500
 field and it felt 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.960
 we really had fun with 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.070
 one created a good game after one back 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.930
 maybe someone still details 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.969
 defensively settled for my part on 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.399
 everything but a workout will do everything 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:10.170
 to improve that puts quite a 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:12.130
 decisive role for you with assists 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.540
 as I say again just now 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.520
 in my philosophy we are me 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.780
 learned to always uphold this 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.540
 that I asked and that's all 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.720
 just what I did I'm 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:27.299
 satisfies a three point win and 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:31.420
 a goal good results nice result 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.010
 it goes with the morale we will forget the 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:39.830
 final to be pure concentrate 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:42.320
 the play off okay we're gonna be 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.390
 good for us for morale and it's going 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.320
 finally, but I'm glad it's not 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.140
 because it's the playoffs 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.610
 we still have to win we have 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.650
 turned the page as in the final we did 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.780
 we lost it's frustrating but hey 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.060
 think we lost we can do nothing 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.200
 we must immediately turn the page and 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.600
 go ahead and that's what we have 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.640
 done today and from Tuesday 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.440
 we will resume training on 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.060
 turn the page and continue to 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.080
 work on this momentum and is elected 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.380
 the week lasts after the match in the 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.810
 chopped off 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.450
 yeah after after three months which 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.900
 gives us a death personally 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.530
 I think about this work of rest the three 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.780
 days off 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.690
 I thought about it but after 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.950
 seemed to resume training I 'll 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.370
 I had completely forgotten a minute 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.760
 our account but here we must leave 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.030
 michael site of all novels and 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.400
 stories like snmsac live in africa 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.520
 I think we imposed our game well 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.530
 that it was not bad but we have 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.930
 having fun we have we really 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.660
 created a good game and it felt like 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.530
 the pitch and that's the score what good is it 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.540
 started well 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.140
 not me alone we started well say 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.560

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.510
