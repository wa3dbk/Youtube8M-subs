expected Pamela and Damian with the
weakest<00:04:30.080> link<00:04:30.350> it<00:04:31.310> was<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.490> little<00:04:31.730> awkward<00:04:31.940> in

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
weakest link it was a little awkward in

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.240 
weakest link it was a little awkward in
spots<00:04:32.630> but<00:04:32.810> for<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.169> most<00:04:33.320> part<00:04:33.470> they<00:04:33.919> stayed

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
spots but for the most part they stayed

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.520 
spots but for the most part they stayed
pretty<00:04:34.460> much<00:04:34.580> in<00:04:34.910> sync<00:04:35.180> it<00:04:35.480> was<00:04:35.660> you<00:04:35.930> know<00:04:35.960> was

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
pretty much in sync it was you know was

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.970 
pretty much in sync it was you know was
pretty<00:04:36.770> good<00:04:36.950> they<00:04:37.160> had<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.310> 27<00:04:38.110> so<00:04:39.110> now<00:04:39.260> team

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
pretty good they had a 27 so now team

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.310 
pretty good they had a 27 so now team
Gaga<00:04:40.430> was<00:04:40.669> definitely<00:04:41.270> better<00:04:41.450> than<00:04:41.630> team

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
Gaga was definitely better than team

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.159 
Gaga was definitely better than team
Madonna<00:04:42.680> though<00:04:43.010> because<00:04:43.310> nice<00:04:44.060> teen<00:04:44.330> was

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
Madonna though because nice teen was

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.050 
Madonna though because nice teen was
definitely<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.800> weakest<00:04:46.190> link<00:04:46.430> on<00:04:46.610> that<00:04:46.639> side

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
definitely the weakest link on that side

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.970 
definitely the weakest link on that side
and<00:04:48.250> she<00:04:49.250> hardly<00:04:49.639> moved<00:04:50.060> at<00:04:50.360> all<00:04:50.660> oh<00:04:51.050> I<00:04:51.650> don't

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
and she hardly moved at all oh I don't

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.590 
and she hardly moved at all oh I don't
know<00:04:52.220> her<00:04:52.520> movements<00:04:53.030> were<00:04:53.150> like<00:04:53.330> really

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
know her movements were like really

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.530 
know her movements were like really
small<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.410> didn't<00:04:55.310> she<00:04:55.400> do<00:04:55.639> cha<00:04:55.910> cha<00:04:56.180> already

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
small and didn't she do cha cha already

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.820 
small and didn't she do cha cha already
so<00:04:56.840> I<00:04:56.870> mean<00:04:56.960> this<00:04:57.229> should<00:04:57.290> have<00:04:57.500> been<00:04:57.560> like<00:04:57.680> a

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
so I mean this should have been like a

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.270 
so I mean this should have been like a
review<00:04:58.310> for<00:04:58.520> her<00:04:58.700> and<00:04:59.200> erin<00:05:00.200> and<00:05:00.380> maks<00:05:00.410> i<00:05:00.979> was<00:05:01.250> a

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
review for her and erin and maks i was a

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.770 
review for her and erin and maks i was a
little<00:05:01.490> bit<00:05:01.729> disappointed<00:05:02.479> with<00:05:02.630> their

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
little bit disappointed with their

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.780 
little bit disappointed with their
choreography<00:05:03.650> I<00:05:03.680> mean<00:05:04.010> they<00:05:04.160> just<00:05:04.190> had<00:05:04.580> like<00:05:04.760> a

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
choreography I mean they just had like a

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.570 
choreography I mean they just had like a
whole<00:05:05.030> lot<00:05:05.300> of<00:05:05.330> walking<00:05:05.810> around<00:05:06.050> then<00:05:06.470> not<00:05:07.400> too

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
whole lot of walking around then not too

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.100 
whole lot of walking around then not too
much<00:05:07.729> substance<00:05:08.270> there<00:05:08.630> so<00:05:08.870> I<00:05:08.900> was<00:05:09.020> a<00:05:09.050> little

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
much substance there so I was a little

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.340 
much substance there so I was a little
disappointed<00:05:09.350> with<00:05:09.979> them<00:05:10.220> but<00:05:11.210> they<00:05:11.570> ended<00:05:12.260> up

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
disappointed with them but they ended up

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.610 
disappointed with them but they ended up
with<00:05:12.530> a<00:05:12.560> 24<00:05:13.130> so<00:05:13.970> after<00:05:14.660> you<00:05:14.750> add<00:05:14.930> those<00:05:15.200> scores
