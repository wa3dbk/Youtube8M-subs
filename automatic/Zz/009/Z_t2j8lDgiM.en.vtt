00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.960 

triple<00:04:34.520> threat<00:04:35.680> it's<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:36.830> little<00:04:37.070> of<00:04:37.250> foam<00:04:37.940> and

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
triple threat it's a little of foam and

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.780 
triple threat it's a little of foam and
ply<00:04:38.420> airplane<00:04:38.960> it<00:04:39.950> was<00:04:40.070> designed<00:04:40.190> for<00:04:40.580> single

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
ply airplane it was designed for single

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.930 
ply airplane it was designed for single
motor<00:04:41.120> but<00:04:41.480> I<00:04:42.070> modified<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.370> week<00:04:43.610> to<00:04:43.730> put

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
motor but I modified the week to put

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.420 
motor but I modified the week to put
dual<00:04:44.200> brush<00:04:45.200> this<00:04:45.410> out<00:04:45.590> runners<00:04:45.950> on<00:04:46.100> it<00:04:46.280> and

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
dual brush this out runners on it and

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.430 
dual brush this out runners on it and
then<00:04:47.060> I<00:04:47.150> put<00:04:47.419> another<00:04:47.840> little<00:04:48.139> out<00:04:48.200> runner

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
then I put another little out runner

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.350 
then I put another little out runner
back<00:04:48.710> on<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:48.950> nose<00:04:49.130> once<00:04:49.430> I<00:04:49.550> had<00:04:49.730> it<00:04:49.850> fine<00:04:50.150> as<00:04:50.330> a

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
back on the nose once I had it fine as a

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.080 
back on the nose once I had it fine as a
duel<00:04:50.660> and<00:04:51.440> so<00:04:51.710> I<00:04:51.740> call<00:04:52.040> it<00:04:52.160> triple<00:04:52.490> threat<00:04:52.760> or

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
duel and so I call it triple threat or

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.290 
duel and so I call it triple threat or
not<00:04:53.240> so<00:04:53.389> simple<00:04:53.570> stick<00:04:54.050> or<00:04:54.410> an<00:04:55.250> s<00:04:55.940> cube

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
not so simple stick or an s cube

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.970 
not so simple stick or an s cube
something<00:04:56.780> like<00:04:56.930> that<00:04:57.110> from<00:04:57.230> the<00:04:57.380> mind<00:04:57.620> of<00:04:57.770> my

so you open the hatch the open hatch and
i've<00:05:05.030> got<00:05:05.210> two<00:05:05.360> batteries<00:05:05.750> in<00:05:05.930> here<00:05:05.960> once<00:05:06.290> a

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
i've got two batteries in here once a

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.640 
i've got two batteries in here once a
little<00:05:06.650> thousand<00:05:07.070> milliamp<00:05:07.370> hour<00:05:08.110> 3<00:05:09.110> 30<00:05:09.380> cell

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
little thousand milliamp hour 3 30 cell

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.500 
little thousand milliamp hour 3 30 cell
okay<00:05:10.130> and<00:05:10.370> then<00:05:10.880> I've<00:05:11.030> got<00:05:11.060> a<00:05:12.700> 2100<00:05:13.700> fuel<00:05:14.390> a

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
okay and then I've got a 2100 fuel a

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.860 
okay and then I've got a 2100 fuel a
half<00:05:14.630> hour<00:05:14.810> 3-cell<00:05:15.500> battery<00:05:16.390> the<00:05:17.390> third<00:05:17.570> speed

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
half hour 3-cell battery the third speed

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.480 
half hour 3-cell battery the third speed
controls<00:05:18.290> right<00:05:18.500> in<00:05:18.680> the<00:05:18.800> battery

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
controls right in the battery

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.800 
controls right in the battery
compartment<00:05:19.610> and<00:05:20.090> that's<00:05:20.240> different<00:05:20.690> than

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
compartment and that's different than

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.360 
compartment and that's different than
the<00:05:20.930> other<00:05:21.110> two<00:05:21.230> yeah<00:05:21.890> this<00:05:22.130> is<00:05:22.280> a<00:05:22.310> little

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
the other two yeah this is a little

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.320 
the other two yeah this is a little
dynamo<00:05:22.970> it's<00:05:23.660> an<00:05:23.840> 80<00:05:24.140> nap<00:05:24.500> and<00:05:24.710> then<00:05:25.070> the<00:05:26.000> two

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
dynamo it's an 80 nap and then the two

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.650 
dynamo it's an 80 nap and then the two
controllers<00:05:27.169> on<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.440> bottom<00:05:27.890> our<00:05:28.330> tower<00:05:29.330> pro

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
controllers on the bottom our tower pro

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.340 
controllers on the bottom our tower pro
30<00:05:29.960> amp<00:05:30.430> not<00:05:31.430> so<00:05:31.669> simple<00:05:31.910> Michael<00:05:32.510> not<00:05:33.080> so

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
30 amp not so simple Michael not so

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.850 
30 amp not so simple Michael not so
simple<00:05:33.820> basically<00:05:34.820> a<00:05:34.850> prototype<00:05:35.419> for<00:05:35.450> the

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
simple basically a prototype for the

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.340 
simple basically a prototype for the
b-26<00:05:36.860> marauder<00:05:37.540> my<00:05:38.540> friend<00:05:38.810> is<00:05:38.930> gonna<00:05:39.050> build

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
b-26 marauder my friend is gonna build

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.560 
b-26 marauder my friend is gonna build
so<00:05:39.620> alright<00:05:40.190> decided<00:05:40.910> to<00:05:40.970> work<00:05:41.090> on<00:05:41.240> the<00:05:41.360> power

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
so alright decided to work on the power

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.920 
so alright decided to work on the power
system<00:05:41.870> well<00:05:42.710> he<00:05:42.890> works<00:05:43.010> on<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.490> airframe<00:05:44.150> but

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
system well he works on the airframe but

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.520 
system well he works on the airframe but
not<00:05:45.169> so<00:05:45.620> simple<00:05:46.010> not<00:05:46.400> so<00:05:46.580> simple<00:05:47.350> you've<00:05:48.350> got

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
not so simple not so simple you've got

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.350 
not so simple not so simple you've got
the<00:05:48.680> speed<00:05:48.979> controls<00:05:49.460> velcro<00:05:49.940> it<00:05:50.000> onto<00:05:50.240> the

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
the speed controls velcro it onto the

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.170 
the speed controls velcro it onto the
bottom<00:05:50.539> very<00:05:50.990> interesting<00:05:51.620> and<00:05:51.800> that<00:05:52.250> way<00:05:52.580> you

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
bottom very interesting and that way you

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.750 
bottom very interesting and that way you
can<00:05:53.510> they're<00:05:54.200> good<00:05:54.500> for<00:05:54.680> cooling<00:05:55.130> cooling<00:05:55.370> and

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
can they're good for cooling cooling and

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.880 
can they're good for cooling cooling and
let's<00:05:56.210> see<00:05:56.360> you<00:05:56.510> got<00:05:56.690> brushless<00:05:57.080> what<00:05:57.740> are

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
let's see you got brushless what are

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:03.850 
let's see you got brushless what are
they<00:05:58.100> little<00:05:58.669> tower<00:05:58.940> promotors<00:05:59.539> 24<00:06:00.520> that's<00:06:02.860> 24

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
they little tower promotors 24 that's 24

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.210 
they little tower promotors 24 that's 24
