ablution alright this really nice on the
other<00:03:32.010> side<00:03:32.280> was<00:03:32.579> December<00:03:33.260> there<00:03:34.260> was<00:03:34.410> the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
other side was December there was the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.120 
other side was December there was the
yellow<00:03:34.950> on<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.610> button<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.530> read<00:03:37.530> on<00:03:37.709> the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
yellow on the button and read on the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.900 
yellow on the button and read on the
other<00:03:38.280> side<00:03:38.519> of<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:41.340> other<00:03:41.370> thing<00:03:41.670> is

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
other side of it and the other thing is

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.789 
other side of it and the other thing is
about<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.840> riser<00:03:43.110> ok<00:03:43.829> because<00:03:44.670> actually<00:03:45.239> a

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
about the riser ok because actually a

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:51.020 
about the riser ok because actually a
flush<00:03:46.799> mount<00:03:47.750> actually<00:03:48.750> comes<00:03:49.049> up<00:03:49.880> you<00:03:50.880> can

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
flush mount actually comes up you can

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.890 
flush mount actually comes up you can
seize<00:03:52.160> cut<00:03:53.160> through<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.700> bore<00:03:53.910> actually<00:03:54.450> in

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
seize cut through the bore actually in

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.160 
seize cut through the bore actually in
here<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:55.980> therefore<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.880> have<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.090> use<00:03:57.420> the

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
here so therefore you have to use the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:06.210 
here so therefore you have to use the
chiro<00:03:58.440> or<00:03:59.250> any<00:04:00.000> other<00:04:01.670> frost<00:04:02.989> flat<00:04:03.989> amount

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
chiro or any other frost flat amount

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.000 
chiro or any other frost flat amount
bushings<00:04:07.220> in<00:04:07.400> here<00:04:07.730> so<00:04:08.390> as<00:04:09.200> you<00:04:09.380> can<00:04:09.710> see<00:04:09.980> I

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
bushings in here so as you can see I

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.800 
bushings in here so as you can see I
tried<00:04:10.220> I<00:04:10.970> think<00:04:11.330> it's<00:04:11.600> supposed<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:12.200> be<00:04:12.440> the

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
tried I think it's supposed to be the

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.290 
tried I think it's supposed to be the
let<00:04:14.810> me<00:04:14.900> check<00:04:15.080> if<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:16.280> five<00:04:16.489> degrees<00:04:16.970> and

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.300 
let me check if the five degrees and

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.170 
let me check if the five degrees and
fourth<00:04:17.690> degree<00:04:17.870> 5<00:04:18.590> degree<00:04:19.160> on<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.610> front<00:04:19.970> and

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
fourth degree 5 degree on the front and

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.260 
fourth degree 5 degree on the front and
then<00:04:20.360> four<00:04:20.690> degree<00:04:20.989> on<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.170> back<00:04:21.410> of<00:04:21.440> it

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
then four degree on the back of it

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.800 
then four degree on the back of it
actually<00:04:23.270> I<00:04:23.300> searched<00:04:23.750> on<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.370> website<00:04:25.370> for

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
actually I searched on the website for

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.370 
actually I searched on the website for
long<00:04:26.810> distant<00:04:27.290> pumping<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:29.380> recommendations

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
long distant pumping the recommendations

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.400 
long distant pumping the recommendations
is<00:04:30.560> that<00:04:30.830> actually<00:04:31.700> if<00:04:31.910> you<00:04:32.630> want<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:33.020> pull

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
is that actually if you want to pull

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.430 
is that actually if you want to pull
like<00:04:33.740> wage<00:04:34.250> for<00:04:34.760> 15<00:04:35.240> degree<00:04:35.600> on<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:35.840> front<00:04:36.260> and

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
like wage for 15 degree on the front and

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.040 
like wage for 15 degree on the front and
five<00:04:36.860> degrees<00:04:37.220> on<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.640> back<00:04:37.850> will<00:04:38.300> be<00:04:38.420> the

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
five degrees on the back will be the

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.510 
five degrees on the back will be the
best<00:04:39.200> setup<00:04:39.530> but<00:04:39.920> I<00:04:40.450> mean<00:04:41.450> things<00:04:41.810> is<00:04:42.050> a<00:04:42.520> flash

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
best setup but I mean things is a flash

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.590 
best setup but I mean things is a flash
amount<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:44.630> thing<00:04:44.960> is<00:04:44.990> if<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.950> put<00:04:46.400> 15<00:04:47.060> in<00:04:47.240> here

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
amount the thing is if I put 15 in here

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.050 
amount the thing is if I put 15 in here
actually<00:04:48.050> I<00:04:48.080> got<00:04:48.290> a<00:04:48.320> 15-year<00:04:49.010> like<00:04:49.220> really

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
actually I got a 15-year like really

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
have the scattered school and then

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.620 
have the scattered school and then
everything<00:04:56.150> if<00:04:56.840> I<00:04:56.990> put<00:04:57.380> in<00:04:57.620> here<00:04:58.390> the<00:04:59.390> chart

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
everything if I put in here the chart

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.860 
everything if I put in here the chart
going<00:04:59.810> to<00:04:59.870> begin<00:05:00.080> here<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:01.370> by<00:05:01.730> the<00:05:01.760> way<00:05:01.970> it's

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
going to begin here and by the way it's

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.810 
going to begin here and by the way it's
going<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.170> low<00:05:03.380> down<00:05:03.680> the<00:05:03.890> front<00:05:04.130> side<00:05:04.460> of<00:05:04.640> the

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
going to low down the front side of the

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.690 
going to low down the front side of the
board<00:05:05.090> so<00:05:05.750> if<00:05:05.990> you<00:05:06.170> standing<00:05:07.130> on<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.430> on<00:05:07.640> the

come to come to the front truck because

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.670 
come to come to the front truck because
actually<00:05:18.860> it's<00:05:19.420> being<00:05:20.420> separate<00:05:20.960> it's<00:05:21.170> like

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
actually it's being separate it's like

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.330 
actually it's being separate it's like
it's<00:05:22.610> like<00:05:23.350> the<00:05:24.350> power<00:05:24.620> doesn't<00:05:24.950> come<00:05:25.190> out

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
it's like the power doesn't come out

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.970 
it's like the power doesn't come out
with<00:05:25.700> all<00:05:25.970> on<00:05:26.270> your<00:05:26.570> front<00:05:26.840> truck<00:05:27.140> therefore<00:05:27.950> I

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
with all on your front truck therefore I

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.240 
with all on your front truck therefore I
comes<00:05:28.370> always<00:05:28.730> another<00:05:29.110> result<00:05:30.110> of<00:05:30.380> the<00:05:31.040> back

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
comes always another result of the back

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.930 
comes always another result of the back
side<00:05:31.960> still<00:05:32.960> four<00:05:33.320> degree<00:05:33.680> and<00:05:33.950> the<00:05:34.670> front

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
side still four degree and the front

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.150 
side still four degree and the front
side<00:05:35.210> will<00:05:35.600> become<00:05:35.930> five<00:05:36.170> degree<00:05:36.560> of<00:05:36.710> it<00:05:36.920> and

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
side will become five degree of it and

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.560 
side will become five degree of it and
it's<00:05:37.990> turning<00:05:38.990> really<00:05:39.620> real<00:05:40.210> Byron<00:05:41.210> Eve<00:05:41.330> like
