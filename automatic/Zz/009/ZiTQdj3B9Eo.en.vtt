00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
then you're going to take any lip liner

then you're going to take any lip liner
it<00:01:52.369> has<00:01:52.670> to<00:01:52.970> be<00:01:53.119> a<00:01:53.299> lip<00:01:53.630> liner<00:01:55.149> line<00:01:56.149> your<00:01:56.509> lips

it has to be a lip liner line your lips

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:07.990 
it has to be a lip liner line your lips
first<00:02:05.409> and<00:02:06.409> then<00:02:06.979> fill<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:07.340> up<00:02:07.429> with<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.850> lip

first and then fill it up with the lip

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.059 
first and then fill it up with the lip
liner<00:02:08.269> the<00:02:08.630> reason<00:02:08.929> why<00:02:09.049> I<00:02:09.080> use<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.619> lip<00:02:09.799> liner

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
liner the reason why I use the lip liner

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.039 
liner the reason why I use the lip liner
is<00:02:10.399> because<00:02:10.789> lip<00:02:10.970> liners<00:02:11.420> tend<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.810> stay

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
is because lip liners tend to stay

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:18.070 
is because lip liners tend to stay
longer<00:02:12.080> than<00:02:12.980> lipsticks<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:16.190> that's<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:17.080> now

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
longer than lipsticks and that's it now

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.930 
longer than lipsticks and that's it now
we<00:02:18.140> are<00:02:18.620> going<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.860> be<00:02:18.950> using<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.489> color<00:02:19.670> bar

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
we are going to be using the color bar

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.490 
we are going to be using the color bar
stay<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.330> definition<00:02:21.049> mist

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
stay the definition mist

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.430 
stay the definition mist
it's<00:02:21.980> really<00:02:22.340> inexpensive<00:02:23.209> and<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:24.140> works

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
it's really inexpensive and it works

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.220 
it's really inexpensive and it works
just<00:02:25.130> spray<00:02:25.549> as<00:02:25.819> many<00:02:26.120> sprays<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.780> want

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
and then it literally becomes titanium

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.620 
and then it literally becomes titanium
unbreakable<00:02:33.230> just<00:02:34.040> let<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.459> dry<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:35.120> that's
