00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:16.490
 look how important is a new way of 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:19.730
 communication a new FM radio 24 hours 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.270
 focused on the sport is in the country in love 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.550
 the sport the day before in the 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.310
 Confederations Cup World Cup 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.039
 and I think it will have a 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.260
 also important for the health that the 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.430
 physical activity is very important for 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.949
 the health 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.320
 sports discipline is important for the 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:42.710
 social interaction sport generates 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.129
 business opportunity to create 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.809
 employment creation and 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.480
 entertainment right? 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.059
 How good it is for us to practice the 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.090
 attended a sporting activity and a 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.489
 union of two of two excellencies that is 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.969
 bradesco and the band that has a huge 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.190
 expertise in sports journalism is the 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.380
 radio has two things that you call me 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.070
 much attention is the music and information 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.289
 I live watching the news where I 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.280
 I'm arriving at the hotel and I do not mind 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:18.380
 television or playing the sound so I guess 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.369
 that information and music is two 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.110
 things that are very important 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.860
 for me I think the station 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.289
 She has work like that on a mission. 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.090
 very important to bring quality 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.740
 life information of the people 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.869
 major events have always had the 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.830
 coverage of all that is an organ of 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.770
 Communication 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.039
 but the daily 24-hour radio 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.080
 sport opening for modalities 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.270
 sportsmen who do not have this right in 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.910
 television on the radio in the newspaper 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.830
 so the importance of radio is a dream 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.890
 carried out by the bandeirantes group of 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.890
 Communication 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.330
 when I heard about the initiative of the 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.920
 group we were here 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.990
 in fact to congratulate closely 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.340
 important major initiative 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.920
 For us, we are not for those 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.440
 who like to sport here who likes 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.480
 in my soccer case, I can not 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.060
 closely monitor the news of the day 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.050
 day is all so simultaneously in 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.850
 first hand 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.620
 begins the radio for example , that for us is 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.480
 a very large facility, right? 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.790
 the flag has to have this tradition of 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.530
 renewal is k I am living proof of this 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.240
 I started loading tape on tv 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.250
 who had a history in the 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.620
 radio but I still got there from 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.260
 down carrying tape I passed through several 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.810
 stadiums until the subject approached as reporter 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.930
 on television I love bandeirantes or 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.910
 almost eighteen eighteen years in the group then 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.790
 a cool thing to learn I'm created 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.040
 then I find it interesting that I 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.680
 I had this opportunity to start and how 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.600
 I also had we always had this 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.850
 condition of the possibility for the 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.580
 renewal for the market shows itself to 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.170
 new talents appear and think 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.390
 this is very important is a tradition 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.160
 she is being perpetuated 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.350
 now with this new project 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.550
 The main reason I transfer 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.989
 leave the globe radio 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.270
 was not in compatibility with 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.800
 diligence was not compatible with 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.840
 the companions was no problem 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.930
 very much the opposite has been 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.470
 only the acceptance of a new project of 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.570
 work and my idea was exactly 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.150
 renew values ​​on the radio because I 'm 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.940
 radioactive in the last few years. 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.380
 is not renewing everyone who is there 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.010
 main speakers and commentators 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.800
 reporters are very mature then the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.650
 My idea is to gorge the little hoop and 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.769
 gilson ricardo and a young reporter jorge 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.959
 Eduardo will be references to 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.940
 college students who will 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.370
 work with us then for example 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.860
 the Silvio Santos but I will ask for help to 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.540
 college students arrives at the 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.780
 flamenco today in flamenco training 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.480
 was silvio da silva from the 7th 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.920
 federal university of rio de janeiro 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.380
 Silvio, how have you been? 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.319
 hua understood I'm going to give a rotation 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.830
 great opportunity and prepare them as 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.500
 if it were radio bradesco spot fm and 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.930
 bandnews fm from rio de janeiro se 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.750
 transformed into a radio school 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.030
 with Uncle and I the modest teacher 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.739
 we are talking about a financial group and 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.200
 extremely important economic 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.940
 bradesco and one of the main groups 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.410
 of communication from brazil and america 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.930
 Latino group that the bandeirantes 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.389
 communication a partnership in the right measure 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.979
 two great sport supporters to 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.440
 band does not only value in football 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.880
 but today it gives attention to several 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.740
 it has a channel of 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.810
 television that the bandsports where it 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.389
 presents several events where she 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.280
 encourages new talents where it shows 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.440
 who really stands out today within the 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.760
 bradesco also has 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.919
 a show history for people 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.560
 How important is it, for example, 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.960
 Olympic event you from the base of this 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.030
 school as a child you encourage the 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.310
 athlete and I'm sure that now a 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.680
 radio that will make room for 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.870
 all the arrangements that will cover 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.490
 much more affection in more detail with 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.270
 more efficiency all events 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.070
 sports 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.320
 we get a very big gift 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.240
 I like passionate about football and the 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.630
 other sports I feel privileged 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.760
 I 've already flattered 94.1 in my 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.830
 car to my house in the appliances 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.510
 and I'm very happy for this 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.000
 partnership was what lacked an idea 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.890
 a differentiated idea I 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.900
 I'm very proud to be 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.690
 watching all this seeing all the 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.490
 details and knowing that the band is in this 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.890
 project and the banks once again 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.530
 evolution in sports is as follows 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.660
 we are more important itu sportive 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.940
 everybody talks Olympic cycle is not 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.690
 is a sports cycle Olympic games of 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.360
 2012 Confederations Cup 2013 Cup 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.590
 2014 and finally the 2016 Olympics is a 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.840
 of the largest one of the largest 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.330
 business opportunities and 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.190
 mainly concretion of the sport 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.050
 the national sport will become 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.840
 a reality is clear that the result 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.810
 should not appear either 2016 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.850
 but from 2020 Brazil will become 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.770
 become an Olympic power because 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.050
 it will become that australia did the same 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.420
 thing australia got results 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.680
 significant until 2000 , but 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.720
 the great cleanliness of australia was in 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.920
 2004 when she was fourth placed in the 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.840
 I believe that the same 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.820
 thing will happen to Brazil with 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.500
 mother during the sport's history 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.050
 Brazilian in São Paulo 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.910
 the story is told through the 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.660
 wonderful voices that the bandeirantes 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:35.150
 had and I'm captive since I was a child 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.580
 listen to the bandeirantes with longing for 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.140
 fiori giglioti the whole class of the 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.020
 band journalism 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.880
 I think one more important action 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.340
 even more so with the institutional support 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.530
 so strong and that we have affection 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.360
 we also hand are further Paulo 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.880
 by bradesco I think it was a 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.400
 Bright partnership is this baby. 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.110
 Bandeirantes bradesco is something that will be 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.440
 extraordinary when two groups 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.360
 such as the bradesco and the 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.270
 to come together to launch a 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.520
 24 hour sports radio is because the 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.280
 segment that we are working on is high 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.530
 and I have the impression that this 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.650
 radio will lead to the public 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:18.410
 news consumer on the radio a 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.980
 product of the highest quality is not the 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:23.840
 people will offer to the listener 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.510
 24 hour sports schedule a great 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.300
 time with a great schedule and I think 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.740
 this will be the news consumer 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.730
 will win enough listener will win 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.949
 a lot with that 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.949
 [Music] 

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.709
 [Music]
