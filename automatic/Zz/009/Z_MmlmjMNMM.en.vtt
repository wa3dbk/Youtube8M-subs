00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
Brett Bodine well actually a you know

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.230 
Brett Bodine well actually a you know
Terry<00:06:11.170> Terry<00:06:12.160> had<00:06:12.370> him<00:06:12.520> cleared<00:06:12.760> off<00:06:12.910> the<00:06:12.940> turn

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
Terry Terry had him cleared off the turn

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.110 
Terry Terry had him cleared off the turn
and<00:06:14.230> I<00:06:14.530> just<00:06:14.740> don't<00:06:14.860> think<00:06:15.130> that<00:06:15.490> he<00:06:15.640> expected

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
and I just don't think that he expected

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.210 
and I just don't think that he expected
bread<00:06:16.390> to<00:06:16.510> come<00:06:16.690> back<00:06:16.870> and<00:06:17.290> drive<00:06:17.830> in<00:06:18.070> that

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
bread to come back and drive in that

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.460 
bread to come back and drive in that
hard<00:06:18.520> once<00:06:18.790> you<00:06:18.940> got<00:06:19.090> by

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
hard once you got by

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.080 
hard once you got by
and<00:06:20.920> I<00:06:21.010> think<00:06:21.220> that's<00:06:21.370> the<00:06:21.520> difference<00:06:21.730> zero

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
and I think that's the difference zero

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.670 
and I think that's the difference zero
here<00:06:22.330> you'll<00:06:22.450> see<00:06:22.540> again<00:06:22.840> from<00:06:23.050> Dale<00:06:23.200> jr.
