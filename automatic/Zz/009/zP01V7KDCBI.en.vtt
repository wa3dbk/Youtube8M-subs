00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.090
 makeup proposal that you have prevented 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.440
 enough that it's super blurry look 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.450
 it's quite easy to make a result 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.010
 amazing, I loved it 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.439
 if they want to know how I did it 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.660
 just keep watching there 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.609
 Good people, I'll start using the prime minister. 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.800
 fixer daniks with a sponge giving 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.740
 beats all over my eyelid I 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.050
 I'm going to grab a planet, it looks like 02 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.600
 it 's already said 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.730
 I'm going to smoke all over the place. 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.950
 from my eye I go there in my 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.079
 chocolate barn vest illuminator 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.610
 well light 2 tomatoes I go 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.780
 deposited by siegmann who already had 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.399
 made application to leave more 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.140
 light and below my 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.129
 eyebrow because it will be mine 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.260
 illuminator 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.210
 now I'm going to get intermediate color with 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.129
 volt and go vanilla brush 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.899
 travel in circular motions in my 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.219
 external corner contest until more or 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.930
 less than half 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.420
 besides my contest is in how already 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.100
 I have an illuminator he will not even let 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.110
 brown shadow pigment much inside 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.640
 It's so light 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.170
 now it will take on a darker color and 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.450
 I'm going to be like a neighbor in the corner. 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.850
 I'm going to reach the height of the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.799
 my concave and I'll leave it at the end 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.689
 there a corner without applying the 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.030
 shadow that is for me then one or more 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.009
 dark also do well in the outer corner 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.390
 I applied in the center and in congo there 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.610
 leave blank we come with this 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.680
 Darkest shadow of the palette I am 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.049
 using the episode of the model says smoking 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.509
 I go after her bm where I did not have 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.310
 product still makes a neighbor first only 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.470
 depositing and then there was a movement 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.619
 circular to take the markings 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.479
 it's pretty easy look how it looks now comes with 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.820
 pencil the model that I love people is 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.070
 finishing and I'll make a dash of 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.030
 eyeliner like any other delineated 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.920
 very common 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.000
 in fact you do not need to have much practice 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.909
 Why to do it anyway? 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.890
 even zapping like that 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.020
 base to the external continuum I came down 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.270
 from my water line and I'm taking the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.070
 trace more or less to my car with 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.630
 toward my eyebrow like 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.219
 that other video determining that already 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.759
 I had done it before for you, remember. 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.640
 these watched a neighborhood of people 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.410
 done that now I saw and I will unite that 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.580
 with the first one that already had 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.620
 done more 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.180
 and even regular anyway can 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.950
 that you are not very close and not 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.900
 important is that you fill in and stay 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.080
 It's pretty black because then we 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.700
 will see will inform well and if this trait 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.060
 so it does not have to be too much and it had 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.700
 very nice, good people , done there 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.770
 I came with the bevelled brush as well. 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.320
 thin and I go there in the black shadow of 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.660
 my skin had not even seen me 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.000
 circular motion I'll seal that 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.590
 eyeliner and has been making movements 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.530
 circular that leave it well shaped 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.960
 I'm going to do more or less the format 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.330
 of the outlined only pulling by dragging 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.130
 this black shadow a little bit longer 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.870
 up and already making moves 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.280
 which is to take the marking 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.740
 stronger than we did with 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.030
 eyeliner the inner corner and also 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.860
 the smoke is but the most remarkable black 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.690
 It is at the outer corner then're gives 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.970
 The biggest effect I'm going to get is a passenger 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.830
 damaclio law more black shadow and I will 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.570
 Forget a little more there in the 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.370
 external corner to get this effect 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.950
 good with chad in the eye 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.270
 Now, calm down , I'll be right back to mine. 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.820
 skin 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.890
 People look at the false eyelashes difference and 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.209
 skin ready itu has not seen how I 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.610
 I prepared my skin and I'll leave it here. 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.230
 below in the link information box of the 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.760
 video that I did explaining every step to 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.530
 step it all cute 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.450
 I'm going to wear that blush he came in 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.220
 mac goldfish to give a name of 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.320
 health is always my face, I do not 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.640
 I wanted something very brown to give a 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.739
 highlight that my eye is 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.600
 practically all in shades of brown I 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.670
 I 'll come back with a pencil and I 'll apply it. 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.890
 from my water line and off to give a 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.780
 more beautiful effect of olhão 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.310
 Then I'll catch it, watch it. It 's the 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.380
 same dark brown shade as the 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.690
 people applied in the field for this sea 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.090
 below the eye and gives an eye effect 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.130
 more blurred and I also know there a lapse 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.310
 there I came with the thought of the attack 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.680
 of nature a common brush these 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.300

 lipstick that I'm going to use 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.550

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.190
 that he is rosé mate liquid lipstick from 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.290
