00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.479 
know I was really worried about whether
the<00:02:26.400> color<00:02:26.700> was<00:02:27.030> gonna<00:02:27.269> truly<00:02:27.860> color<00:02:28.860> my<00:02:29.159> roots

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
the color was gonna truly color my roots

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.160 
the color was gonna truly color my roots
or<00:02:29.730> whatnot<00:02:29.939> because<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.480> lot<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.989> you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
or whatnot because a lot of that you

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.809 
or whatnot because a lot of that you
know<00:02:31.349> it<00:02:31.409> was<00:02:31.500> natural<00:02:31.920> virgin<00:02:32.250> hair<00:02:32.430> cuz<00:02:32.730> I

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
know it was natural virgin hair cuz I

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.000 
know it was natural virgin hair cuz I
had<00:02:33.000> not<00:02:33.150> put<00:02:33.330> color<00:02:33.540> on<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.870> yet<00:02:34.819> so<00:02:35.819> I<00:02:36.209> can<00:02:36.510> see

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
had not put color on it yet so I can see

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.030 
had not put color on it yet so I can see
it<00:02:38.010> did<00:02:38.909> lift<00:02:39.359> it<00:02:39.599> slightly<00:02:39.810> but<00:02:40.379> my<00:02:40.529> roots<00:02:40.829> are

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
it did lift it slightly but my roots are

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.000 
it did lift it slightly but my roots are
still<00:02:41.400> dark

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
still dark

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.460 
still dark
I<00:02:42.040> don't<00:02:42.459> know<00:02:42.580> how<00:02:42.790> far<00:02:43.090> down<00:02:43.360> they're<00:02:44.140> still

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
I don't know how far down they're still

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.649 
I don't know how far down they're still
dark<00:02:44.739> because<00:02:45.069> I<00:02:45.099> have<00:02:45.400> not<00:02:45.580> straightened<00:02:46.569> my

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
dark because I have not straightened my

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.830 
dark because I have not straightened my
hair<00:02:46.690> out<00:02:47.080> yet<00:02:47.409> since<00:02:48.190> coloring<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:48.849> but<00:02:49.810> I

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
hair out yet since coloring it but I

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.949 
hair out yet since coloring it but I
definitely<00:02:50.080> can<00:02:50.409> still<00:02:50.650> see<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.250> know<00:02:51.959> that

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
definitely can still see you know that

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.380 
definitely can still see you know that
it's<00:02:53.170> dark<00:02:53.560> in<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.069> root<00:02:54.280> area<00:02:54.549> so<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.090> didn't

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
it's dark in the root area so it didn't

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.070 
it's dark in the root area so it didn't
lift<00:02:55.599> it<00:02:55.780> completely<00:02:57.180> but<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.510> mean<00:02:58.720> that's

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
lift it completely but I mean that's

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.170 
lift it completely but I mean that's
fine<00:02:59.349> it's<00:02:59.590> no<00:03:00.010> big<00:03:00.190> deal<00:03:00.220> again<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:00.849> wear<00:03:01.030> my

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
fine it's no big deal again I wear my

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.440 
fine it's no big deal again I wear my
hair<00:03:01.330> curly<00:03:01.569> or<00:03:02.080> I'm<00:03:02.709> wearing<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.129> wig<00:03:03.340> so<00:03:03.760> it

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
hair curly or I'm wearing a wig so it

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.600 
hair curly or I'm wearing a wig so it
really<00:03:04.900> doesn't<00:03:05.680> bother<00:03:05.769> me<00:03:06.010> but<00:03:06.250> if<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.370> have
