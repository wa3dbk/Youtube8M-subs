00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
in the foreseeable future I think it's

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.280 
in the foreseeable future I think it's
too<00:03:50.100> soon<00:03:50.670> it's<00:03:50.970> too<00:03:51.209> early<00:03:51.269> to<00:03:51.630> make<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.930> call

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
too soon it's too early to make a call

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.500 
too soon it's too early to make a call
on<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.680> at<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.760> end<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.150> day<00:03:54.300> I<00:03:54.330> think

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
on that at the end of the day I think

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.240 
on that at the end of the day I think
cricket<00:03:55.230> should<00:03:55.410> not<00:03:55.650> cricketer<00:03:56.160> should<00:03:56.489> not

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
cricket should not cricketer should not

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.530 
cricket should not cricketer should not
penalized<00:03:59.250> in<00:03:59.519> Pakistan<00:04:00.150> there<00:04:00.360> are<00:04:00.390> lot<00:04:00.510> of

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
penalized in Pakistan there are lot of

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.870 
penalized in Pakistan there are lot of
lots<00:04:00.989> of<00:04:01.200> good<00:04:01.470> cricketers<00:04:01.950> there<00:04:02.220> lots<00:04:02.760> of

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
lots of good cricketers there lots of

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.330 
lots of good cricketers there lots of
talent<00:04:03.239> there<00:04:03.300> I<00:04:03.660> mean<00:04:04.320> you<00:04:04.890> should<00:04:04.920> not

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
talent there I mean you should not

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.009 
talent there I mean you should not
isolate<00:04:06.709> cricketers<00:04:07.709> cricket<00:04:08.160> in<00:04:09.019> Pakistan

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
isolate cricketers cricket in Pakistan

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.789 
isolate cricketers cricket in Pakistan
and<00:04:10.200> this<00:04:10.950> is<00:04:11.070> where<00:04:11.280> I<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.820> find<00:04:12.660> ICC<00:04:13.500> had<00:04:13.650> to

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
and this is where I I find ICC had to

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.460 
and this is where I I find ICC had to
get<00:04:13.950> involved<00:04:14.519> in<00:04:14.670> make<00:04:14.880> sure<00:04:14.910> that<00:04:15.330> they<00:04:16.200> give

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
get involved in make sure that they give

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.860 
get involved in make sure that they give
Pakistan<00:04:16.739> enough<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:17.850> more<00:04:18.000> cricket<00:04:18.330> maybe

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
Pakistan enough and more cricket maybe

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.990 
Pakistan enough and more cricket maybe
elsewhere<00:04:19.320> maybe<00:04:19.590> maybe<00:04:19.979> on<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.280> on<00:04:20.640> a<00:04:20.669> on<00:04:20.880> a

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
elsewhere maybe maybe on a on a on a
