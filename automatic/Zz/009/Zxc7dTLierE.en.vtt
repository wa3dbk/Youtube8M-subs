00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.170
 who is actually a role that is not worth more than one 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.850
 To be can 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 as Auerbach I consider further 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:13.340
 give it away without it 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.790
 great they were not improved in theirs or yet who against 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.200
 whom 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.200
 the ltte rebels yes 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.300
 So then maybe you were first class 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.680
 we are understaffed and controls are not yet mature when they are 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.739
 A stopover could make everyone immediately follow us 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.840
 Already almost in Cali go ahead 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.060
 maybe you can navigate these roles control group to land 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.770
 so that not the better represented 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.770
 everything is back to work 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.960
 we have rankings here 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.720
 Hoteliers year we did not give them two minutes 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.130
 elsewhere 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.490
 Bismarck Power Inc 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.490
 With that I give you billiard mastery 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.730
 unfortunately they are not 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.730
 I will take the girl and the tree and slices Tel 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.060
 that means we have to shoot the EC SE we will be in Oberstaufen 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.060
 do not damage 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.740
 No no 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.370
 Ewald Bichler north 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.370
 like from court documents 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.500
 and that even the competition of selective magnetic energy brighten it up 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.860
 the last attack planned 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.050
 we have somehow raised Main's Greek problem down and praise it 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.050
 stand for him 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.519
 the answer 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.619
 On the draws a vacuum cleaner with above-average suction power 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.740
 he is and puts himself in the right direction Berlin 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.740
 like now Colautti glorious 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:02.700
 I'm doing the rest 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.859
 replace 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.400
 Therefore, I do not even honored any kerosene gear fuels 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.559
 Annika Heise in Leipzig activator 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:27.009
 Pasi I know everyone where was expected at night in Iraq and Iran 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.529
 administration 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.529
 hardware 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.759
 the city that someone else pilot 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.239
 Shine, what did he do now? 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.829
 foul 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.569
 they did not really die we come 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:24.719
 golf 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:27.719
 like her from renault-pilot neither 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:30.830
 "Tail" Borussia up 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.830
 but we are not going 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.249
 s by specifically applies 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.609
 I just do not feel like being a tin can anymore because of them 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.490
 because of the recession 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.099
 foresighted 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:11.290
 MÃ¶ller out 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.290
 I'm here 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.740
 May the whole night for the 18th 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.319
 and now we have to quickly get to the research center rental car 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.039
 Neighbors or ill 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.039
 Picture de-interview 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:37.379
 So we can not thank enough for us to be unsure of ourselves 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.139
 Oh, that was clear as gear Ede 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.189
 and I found 13 new Robo friends it would be nice if i did 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:47.389
 your operating earnings EBIT holding could increase a bit 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.520
 I have a good idea 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.389
 Percent the next time you have to go somewhere just take a taxi 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.449
 Wow
