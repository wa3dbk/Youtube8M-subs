speeds<00:01:49.940> had<00:01:50.150> basically<00:01:50.660> outclass<00:01:51.050> him<00:01:51.260> he's

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
speeds had basically outclass him he's

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.740 
speeds had basically outclass him he's
very<00:01:51.680> slow<00:01:52.130> value<00:01:52.490> F<00:01:52.640> obviously<00:01:53.150> is<00:01:53.240> a<00:01:53.270> giant

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
very slow value F obviously is a giant

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.110 
very slow value F obviously is a giant
but<00:01:54.080> I<00:01:54.110> just<00:01:54.320> fancy<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:54.710> can<00:01:54.860> give<00:01:55.520> him<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.730> boxing

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
but I just fancy I can give him a boxing

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.450 
but I just fancy I can give him a boxing
lesson<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:56.930> win<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.230> decision<00:01:57.710> David<00:01:58.250> beats

it right he's going into the guy's
backyard<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:30.900> he's<00:03:30.989> got<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.230> what<00:03:31.350> he's<00:03:31.470> got<00:03:31.500> to

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
backyard so he's got to what he's got to

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.199

I<00:03:36.780> think<00:03:36.870> it's<00:03:37.200> almost<00:03:37.440> won<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:37.829> piece<00:03:38.100> there<00:03:38.340> so

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
I think it's almost won a piece there so

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.250 
I think it's almost won a piece there so
far<00:03:38.820> so<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.120> almost<00:03:39.450> have<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.750> casting<00:03:40.200> vote

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
far so you almost have a casting vote

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.319 
far so you almost have a casting vote

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
having a heavyweight tell me in the

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.600 
having a heavyweight tell me in the
world<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:51.450> reality<00:03:52.049> is<00:03:52.200> this<00:03:52.530> case<00:03:52.769> proven<00:03:53.280> he

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
world the reality is this case proven he

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.430 
world the reality is this case proven he
takes<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:54.030> good<00:03:54.180> shot<00:03:54.480> is<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:54.840> bit<00:03:55.140> more<00:03:55.290> agile

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
takes a good shot is a bit more agile

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.350 
takes a good shot is a bit more agile
actually<00:03:56.190> very<00:03:56.489> quick<00:03:56.880> he's<00:03:57.030> they're<00:03:57.180> very

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
actually very quick he's they're very

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.120 
actually very quick he's they're very
quick<00:03:57.570> punch<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.019> what<00:03:58.350> I<00:03:58.380> also<00:03:58.620> like<00:03:58.860> is<00:03:58.890> the

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
quick punch and what I also like is the

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.759 
quick punch and what I also like is the
fact<00:03:59.310> that<00:03:59.450> he<00:04:00.450> places<00:04:00.810> his<00:04:01.110> shot<00:04:01.350> range<00:04:01.590> with

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
fact that he places his shot range with

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:02.509 
fact that he places his shot range with
great<00:04:01.980> accuracy

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
great accuracy

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.610 
great accuracy
nails<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.180> nails<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.720> right<00:04:04.049> on<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.290> button

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
nails that nails it right on the button

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.920 
nails that nails it right on the button
and<00:04:04.769> put<00:04:05.430> your<00:04:05.549> combinations<00:04:06.180> together<00:04:06.450> does

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
and put your combinations together does

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.360 
and put your combinations together does
take<00:04:07.170> time<00:04:07.320> to<00:04:07.380> get<00:04:07.590> into<00:04:07.709> it<00:04:07.829> but<00:04:07.920> what<00:04:08.070> Dukas

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
take time to get into it but what Dukas

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.530 
take time to get into it but what Dukas
him<00:04:08.519> is<00:04:08.670> he<00:04:08.760> needs<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:09.030> get<00:04:09.120> out<00:04:09.239> of<00:04:09.329> the<00:04:09.389> box

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
him is he needs to get out of the box

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.990 
him is he needs to get out of the box
and<00:04:09.720> start<00:04:09.810> faster<00:04:10.320> truth<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.739> truth<00:04:10.949> is<00:04:11.220> that

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
and start faster truth the truth is that

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.629 
and start faster truth the truth is that
you<00:04:12.329> know<00:04:12.419> he<00:04:12.780> can<00:04:13.049> change<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:14.040> chemistry<00:04:14.400> in

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
you know he can change the chemistry in

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:15.059 
you know he can change the chemistry in
the<00:04:14.730> way<00:04:14.820> he

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
the way he

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.590 
the way he
fights<00:04:15.219> he's<00:04:15.790> got<00:04:15.939> to<00:04:16.030> fake<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.329> way<00:04:16.449> he's

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
fights he's got to fake the way he's

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.020 
fights he's got to fake the way he's
always<00:04:16.780> fought<00:04:17.109> which<00:04:17.500> is<00:04:17.789> explosive

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
always fought which is explosive

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.969 
always fought which is explosive
they<00:04:19.660> put<00:04:19.900> energy<00:04:20.109> into<00:04:20.440> everything<00:04:20.859> he<00:04:20.949> does

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
they put energy into everything he does

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.090 
they put energy into everything he does
and<00:04:21.340> that<00:04:21.759> invariably<00:04:22.449> means<00:04:22.690> getting<00:04:23.650> you

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
and that invariably means getting you

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.499 
and that invariably means getting you
know<00:04:24.220> getting<00:04:24.250> it<00:04:24.639> on<00:04:24.789> with<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.150> big<00:04:25.300> fella

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:25.509 
know getting it on with the big fella

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:27.450 
know getting it on with the big fella
and<00:04:25.720> I<00:04:25.870> just<00:04:26.320> think<00:04:26.440> it's<00:04:26.650> it's<00:04:27.100> going<00:04:27.340> to<00:04:27.400> be

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
and I just think it's it's going to be

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.439 
and I just think it's it's going to be
difficult<00:04:27.669> and<00:04:28.000> it's<00:04:28.120> gonna<00:04:28.210> be<00:04:28.330> difficult

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
difficult and it's gonna be difficult

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.810 
difficult and it's gonna be difficult
because<00:04:29.350> because<00:04:30.130> finally<00:04:30.400> we've<00:04:30.490> got<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.639> good

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
because because finally we've got a good

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.670 
because because finally we've got a good
tight<00:04:31.060> defense<00:04:31.449> the<00:04:31.870> later<00:04:32.110> you<00:04:32.410> know<00:04:32.530> the

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
tight defense the later you know the

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.659 
tight defense the later you know the
longer<00:04:32.979> it<00:04:33.070> goes<00:04:33.099> on

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
longer it goes on

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.310 
longer it goes on
I<00:04:33.699> think<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.479> hardware<00:04:34.810> is<00:04:34.870> going<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.080> be<00:04:35.169> the

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
I think the hardware is going to be the

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.439 
I think the hardware is going to be the
size<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:36.099> size<00:04:36.340> but<00:04:36.729> I<00:04:36.759> mean<00:04:37.000> it's<00:04:37.150> good<00:04:37.270> it's

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
size the size but I mean it's good it's

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.150 
size the size but I mean it's good it's
really<00:04:37.570> like<00:04:37.810> wrestling<00:04:38.259> a<00:04:38.380> hippo<00:04:38.740> yeah<00:04:38.949> I

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
really like wrestling a hippo yeah I

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.110 
really like wrestling a hippo yeah I
mean<00:04:39.280> he's<00:04:40.120> but<00:04:41.020> he's<00:04:41.050> also<00:04:41.759> nervous<00:04:42.759> but<00:04:42.970> he's

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
mean he's but he's also nervous but he's

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.670 
mean he's but he's also nervous but he's
also<00:04:43.300> very<00:04:43.419> hittable<00:04:43.780> that<00:04:44.139> makes<00:04:44.380> it<00:04:44.530> much
