00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:11.110
 simply uncomplicated that until 2012 the 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:24.619
 common almost I also come from the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:26.749
 east from turkey but east next 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.409
 We have started 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:32.480
 oh so already isabel on it 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.579
 already we have just about 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.890
 about the similarities 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.300
 entertained with miss east Germany 2012 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.620
 with this world we have something 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.750
 together they may not come 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.859
 Germany not somehow the 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:52.179
 same reason but the main thing called 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.179
 out of the hat 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.710
 unfortunately over sometime here was how it was 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.960
 a secret from germany yes so 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.910
 At some point, it's still about it 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.400
 was quite interesting so you are one 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.049
 come around a bit and if you like that 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.939
 A bit of coffee can be capitalized 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.420
 It will also be exciting otherwise 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.950
 just to be up now not somehow like that 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.090
 breathtaking or whatever I mean 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.130
 i can make my grandchildren of it 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.890
 tell some photos but show the rest 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.360
 is what comes now that means what 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.890
 We can be happy if we are in the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.560
 Turn on the TV then we look up 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.259
 to all broadcasters soon this world today 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.360
 soon already about main schools 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.560
 yes of course you see me here and 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.270
 come from the east with us there's no 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.579
 tvs bananas are true 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.969
 no longer just group-first though 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:42.380
 crumbs are correct without the norm we are 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.829
 There are only but no evening dresses 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.100
 cucumbers 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.689
 you've had an idea foot that I wanted 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:54.320
 once you have made me a dress of 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:55.850
 Versace great transition I have to go here 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.619
 do a bit of advertising for that 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.479
 AndrÃ© makes that really great 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.570
 dresses which also sells versace dress 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.759
 really great how does he raise the computer 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.909
 but let's just say he has to 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.340
 it does not like my bequeathed here 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.940
 you can stand it yes andrea 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.860
 easy 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.510
 because we just go with it everywhere 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.010
 do not even put in the lag 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.560
 always only at isabelle barth 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.270
 to give so easily and you are already 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.910
 everywhere where you can find the red 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.770
 thread we started on what you have 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.090
 you had that question you have like 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.470
 many dresses do you have tomorrow how many times 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.940
 you have to be up at 10 or shock tomorrow 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.320
 the smaller I go somehow that 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.670
 problem with my measurements that is 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.280
 it's always a bit big 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.720
 is and that's why I sometimes trust me like that 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.940
 So I am really quite 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.530
 normal model dimensions but somehow I am 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.040

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.750

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.560
 Alas, the poor girl will not recover anything 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.820
 I can really eat too much 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.810
 Sorry because I was too sooner 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.810
 always secretly there are just 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.670
 but now it's great 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.720
 Great you can not capitalize on it 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.160

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.820

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.410
 overcome or leave it as it is now time 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.680
