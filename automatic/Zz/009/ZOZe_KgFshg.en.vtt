00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
cleanup crew except your heroes so you

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.880 
cleanup crew except your heroes so you
do<00:00:53.650> need<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.040> lava<00:00:54.430> hounds<00:00:54.700> to<00:00:54.910> explode<00:00:55.390> and

do need the lava hounds to explode and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.639 
do need the lava hounds to explode and

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:00.900 
build that cleanup crew as you go it's
going<00:00:59.860> pretty<00:00:59.890> well<00:01:00.190> here<00:01:00.520> you<00:01:00.640> can<00:01:00.760> see<00:01:00.880> the

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
going pretty well here you can see the

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.430 
going pretty well here you can see the
lava<00:01:01.210> hounds<00:01:01.600> are<00:01:01.690> now<00:01:01.810> becoming<00:01:02.110> a<00:01:02.260> meat

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
lava hounds are now becoming a meat

shield and they're doing a great job of
that<00:01:04.899> right<00:01:05.140> here<00:01:05.290> hopefully<00:01:05.590> they<00:01:05.650> explode

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
that right here hopefully they explode

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.670 
that right here hopefully they explode
quickly<00:01:06.520> and<00:01:06.729> then<00:01:07.390> I<00:01:07.450> will<00:01:07.780> drop<00:01:07.990> down<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.200> free

from there and it worked out so here we
go<00:02:23.650> into<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.129> base<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.849> can<00:02:24.970> see

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.800 
hoping he can take out some of this heat
and<00:02:29.049> it<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.680> working<00:02:30.010> as<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.519> distraction<00:02:31.150> for

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
and it is working as a distraction for

and it is working as a distraction for
the<00:02:31.930> most<00:02:32.140> part<00:02:32.439> oh<00:02:32.739> boy<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.609> now<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.209> V

formation with the balloons dropping the

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.339 
formation with the balloons dropping the
rage<00:02:36.670> spell<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.299> it's<00:02:37.900> going<00:02:38.230> pretty

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
rage spell and it's going pretty

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.220 
rage spell and it's going pretty
decently<00:02:38.799> guys<00:02:39.299> honestly<00:02:40.299> this<00:02:40.689> force<00:02:40.989> I

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
decently guys honestly this force I

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.140 
decently guys honestly this force I
guess<00:02:41.409> a<00:02:41.439> tunnel<00:02:41.799> 9<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.220> absolutely<00:02:42.819> cheating

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
guess a tunnel 9 is absolutely cheating

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.780 
guess a tunnel 9 is absolutely cheating
basically<00:02:43.810> i<00:02:44.019> did<00:02:44.439> use<00:02:44.560> my<00:02:44.680> level<00:02:44.920> 35<00:02:45.340> q<00:02:45.640> in

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
basically i did use my level 35 q in

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.000 
basically i did use my level 35 q in
here<00:02:46.060> i<00:02:46.090> almost<00:02:46.510> said<00:02:46.629> King<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.470> take<00:02:47.709> out<00:02:47.859> that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010

air<00:02:48.190> d<00:02:48.370> just<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.639> help<00:02:48.730> my<00:02:48.909> guys<00:02:49.090> out<00:02:49.299> really

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
air d just to help my guys out really

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.050 
air d just to help my guys out really
wasn't<00:02:49.930> necessary<00:02:49.959> but<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.980> figured<00:02:51.670> why<00:02:52.030> not

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
wasn't necessary but I figured why not

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.940 
wasn't necessary but I figured why not
guarantee<00:02:52.840> our<00:02:52.959> air<00:02:53.139> guys<00:02:53.319> had<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.620> least

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
guarantee our air guys had the least

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.830 
guarantee our air guys had the least
amount<00:02:54.190> of<00:02:54.430> damage<00:02:54.489> on<00:02:54.909> them<00:02:55.060> as<00:02:55.180> possible<00:02:55.690> and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
amount of damage on them as possible and

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.690 
amount of damage on them as possible and
you<00:02:56.200> can<00:02:56.319> see<00:02:56.440> we<00:02:56.560> have<00:02:56.590> three<00:02:57.040> hounds<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.519> like

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
you can see we have three hounds I like

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.149 
you can see we have three hounds I like
really<00:02:58.150> high<00:02:58.480> healthier<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.109> nothing<00:03:00.010> can

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
really high healthier and nothing can

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.849 
really high healthier and nothing can
kill<00:03:00.340> them<00:03:00.459> anymore<00:03:00.700> so<00:03:01.420> absolutely<00:03:02.349> absurd

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
kill them anymore so absolutely absurd

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.710 
kill them anymore so absolutely absurd
how<00:03:03.220> strong<00:03:03.549> this<00:03:03.700> forces<00:03:04.120> against<00:03:04.359> a<00:03:04.450> tunnel

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
how strong this forces against a tunnel

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.199 
how strong this forces against a tunnel
nine<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:05.170> highly<00:03:06.010> recommend<00:03:06.189> it<00:03:06.760> even<00:03:07.060> with

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
nine I highly recommend it even with

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.720 
nine I highly recommend it even with
lower<00:03:07.510> level<00:03:07.959> hounds<00:03:08.409> this<00:03:08.950> force<00:03:09.370> would<00:03:09.670> be

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
lower level hounds this force would be

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.030 
lower level hounds this force would be
formidable<00:03:10.720> against<00:03:11.409> Town<00:03:11.530> Hall<00:03:11.709> nights<00:03:11.889> I

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
formidable against Town Hall nights I

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.530 
formidable against Town Hall nights I
can't<00:03:12.280> see<00:03:12.430> how<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:12.549> wouldn't<00:03:12.939> three-star

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
can't see how you wouldn't three-star

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.960 
can't see how you wouldn't three-star
Town<00:03:14.530> Hall<00:03:14.709> tens<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.220> is<00:03:15.639> a<00:03:15.670> little<00:03:15.790> more

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
Town Hall tens it is a little more

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.759 
Town Hall tens it is a little more
tricky<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.810> reason<00:03:16.989> being<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.560> that

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
tricky and the reason being is that that

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.199 
tricky and the reason being is that that
does<00:03:17.920> have<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:18.159> multi<00:03:18.489> target<00:03:18.819> infernos

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209

in this force as far as how much I like
it<00:03:32.079> or<00:03:32.169> not<00:03:32.290> it's<00:03:32.590> it's<00:03:32.829> a<00:03:33.609> little<00:03:33.849> different

for me as you guys know I am a garching

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.569 
for me as you guys know I am a garching

tier 1 troops to my advantage at

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.500 
tier 1 troops to my advantage at
ninety-nine<00:03:42.040> percent<00:03:42.159> of<00:03:42.370> my<00:03:42.459> time<00:03:42.699> it's<00:03:43.449> a

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
ninety-nine percent of my time it's a

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.909 
ninety-nine percent of my time it's a
cheapest<00:03:43.900> way<00:03:43.989> to<00:03:44.019> do<00:03:44.229> things<00:03:44.409> and<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.769> can

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
cheapest way to do things and you can

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.229 
cheapest way to do things and you can
still<00:03:45.129> win<00:03:45.280> against<00:03:45.489> any<00:03:45.669> base<00:03:45.909> with<00:03:46.150> it

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
still win against any base with it

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.689 
still win against any base with it
pretty<00:03:46.419> much<00:03:46.690> so<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.560> do<00:03:47.680> enjoy<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.370> but<00:03:48.549> this

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
pretty much so I do enjoy that but this

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.069 
pretty much so I do enjoy that but this
is<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.849> fun<00:03:49.060> way<00:03:49.209> to<00:03:49.239> do<00:03:49.449> this<00:03:49.569> once<00:03:49.840> in<00:03:49.959> awhile

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
is a fun way to do this once in awhile

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.619 
is a fun way to do this once in awhile
so<00:03:50.829> I<00:03:50.859> might<00:03:50.979> try<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.459> master<00:03:51.940> especially<00:03:52.389> for

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
so I might try and master especially for

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:53.939 
so I might try and master especially for
war<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:52.930> that's<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.409> reason<00:03:53.530> I'm<00:03:53.739> doing<00:03:53.769> this

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:53.949 
war and that's the reason I'm doing this

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.580 
war and that's the reason I'm doing this
I<00:03:54.220> could<00:03:54.400> 1<00:03:54.909> a<00:03:54.940> 2<00:03:55.060> star<00:03:55.359> any<00:03:55.540> base<00:03:55.690> in<00:03:55.900> war

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
I could 1 a 2 star any base in war

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.369 
I could 1 a 2 star any base in war
sometimes<00:03:57.190> I<00:03:57.459> get<00:03:58.060> I'll<00:03:58.419> never<00:03:58.720> lose<00:03:59.019> really

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
sometimes I get I'll never lose really

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.289 
sometimes I get I'll never lose really
but<00:03:59.590> it<00:04:00.190> really<00:04:00.370> comes<00:04:00.609> down<00:04:00.699> to<00:04:00.819> i<00:04:01.000> need<00:04:01.180> to

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
but it really comes down to i need to

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.420 
but it really comes down to i need to
guaranteed<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:02.109> and<00:04:02.470> if<00:04:02.590> not<00:04:02.739> three<00:04:03.159> star

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
guaranteed to and if not three star

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.509

somebody<00:04:03.909> in<00:04:04.120> clan<00:04:04.900> wars<00:04:05.199> so<00:04:06.099> I'm<00:04:06.220> trying<00:04:06.459> to

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
somebody in clan wars so I'm trying to

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.640 
somebody in clan wars so I'm trying to
learn<00:04:06.579> a<00:04:06.639> force<00:04:06.879> it'll<00:04:07.090> do<00:04:07.209> that<00:04:07.389> my<00:04:07.959> quattro

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
learn a force it'll do that my quattro

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.129 
learn a force it'll do that my quattro
goal<00:04:08.829> wife<00:04:09.010> or<00:04:09.280> my<00:04:09.609> go<00:04:09.970> win<00:04:10.209> strategy<00:04:10.690> does<00:04:10.989> it

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
goal wife or my go win strategy does it

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.979 
goal wife or my go win strategy does it
a<00:04:11.229> lot<00:04:11.260> but<00:04:11.709> it's<00:04:11.859> it's<00:04:12.280> really<00:04:12.609> fickle<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.690> I

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
a lot but it's it's really fickle and I

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.300 
a lot but it's it's really fickle and I
feel<00:04:14.199> like<00:04:14.229> that's<00:04:14.349> what<00:04:14.620> this<00:04:14.709> force<00:04:14.949> is<00:04:15.099> too

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
feel like that's what this force is too

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.409 
feel like that's what this force is too
but<00:04:15.459> I<00:04:15.489> feel<00:04:15.669> like<00:04:15.699> this<00:04:15.879> force<00:04:16.090> is<00:04:16.150> actually

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
but I feel like this force is actually

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.050 
but I feel like this force is actually
better<00:04:16.599> it's<00:04:17.199> stronger<00:04:17.709> I<00:04:17.739> feel<00:04:17.979> like<00:04:18.130> but<00:04:18.970> I'm

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
better it's stronger I feel like but I'm

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.759 
better it's stronger I feel like but I'm
not<00:04:19.269> sure<00:04:19.299> I<00:04:19.510> could<00:04:19.810> be<00:04:19.930> wrong<00:04:20.139> guys<00:04:20.380> I'm<00:04:20.620> just

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769

trying<00:04:21.070> it<00:04:21.159> out<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.400> see<00:04:21.549> how<00:04:21.609> things<00:04:21.789> go<00:04:22.000> on

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
trying it out to see how things go on

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.510 
trying it out to see how things go on
the<00:04:22.150> next<00:04:22.360> war<00:04:22.570> I'm<00:04:23.560> really<00:04:24.039> proud<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.310> see<00:04:24.430> as

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
the next war I'm really proud to see as

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.469 
the next war I'm really proud to see as
much<00:04:24.610> as<00:04:24.729> possible<00:04:24.849> because<00:04:25.120> that<00:04:25.270> war<00:04:25.450> is

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
much as possible because that war is

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.890 
much as possible because that war is
tonight<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:26.320> I<00:04:26.529> need<00:04:26.560> to

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
basically get the kinks out before I

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.879 
basically get the kinks out before I
start<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.419> musics<00:04:30.960> I<00:04:31.110> do<00:04:31.169> not<00:04:31.440> want<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:31.770> lose

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889

10<00:04:51.840> we<00:04:51.990> found<00:04:52.199> nice<00:04:52.560> and<00:04:52.800> easy<00:04:52.970> but<00:04:53.970> really

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
10 we found nice and easy but really

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.110 
10 we found nice and easy but really
effective<00:04:55.259> and<00:04:55.470> it's<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.430> really<00:04:56.789> interesting

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
effective and it's a really interesting

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.240 
effective and it's a really interesting
force<00:04:57.539> to<00:04:57.720> use<00:04:57.930> to<00:04:58.080> be<00:04:58.199> honest<00:04:58.500> like<00:04:58.590> I<00:04:58.770> didn't

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
force to use to be honest like I didn't

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.500 
force to use to be honest like I didn't
expect<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.550> be<00:04:59.639> this<00:04:59.699> kind<00:04:59.880> of<00:05:00.000> this<00:05:00.120> much<00:05:00.270> fun

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
expect to be this kind of this much fun

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.689 
expect to be this kind of this much fun
to<00:05:00.720> use<00:05:00.960> but<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:01.590> was<00:05:01.740> fighting<00:05:01.919> a<00:05:02.130> lot<00:05:02.310> of<00:05:02.490> loot

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
to use but I was fighting a lot of loot

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.450 
to use but I was fighting a lot of loot
and<00:05:02.850> winning<00:05:03.720> it<00:05:03.870> like<00:05:04.440> all<00:05:04.650> like<00:05:05.130> there<00:05:05.310> was

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
and winning it like all like there was

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.250 
and winning it like all like there was
no<00:05:05.880> way<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.120> didn't<00:05:06.449> get<00:05:06.539> all<00:05:06.720> of<00:05:06.750> it<00:05:06.870> was<00:05:07.020> crazy

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
no way I didn't get all of it was crazy

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.620 
no way I didn't get all of it was crazy
so<00:05:07.919> definitely<00:05:08.850> something<00:05:09.389> I<00:05:09.449> might

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
so definitely something I might

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.650 
so definitely something I might
recommend<00:05:09.990> for<00:05:10.530> farming<00:05:11.160> up<00:05:11.280> here<00:05:11.520> but<00:05:12.449> it's

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
recommend for farming up here but it's

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.290 
recommend for farming up here but it's
not<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.130> cheapest<00:05:14.130> force<00:05:14.520> so<00:05:14.880> it<00:05:14.970> is<00:05:15.060> kind<00:05:15.270> of

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
not the cheapest force so it is kind of

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.930 
not the cheapest force so it is kind of
expensive<00:05:15.510> on<00:05:15.840> dark<00:05:16.020> elixir<00:05:16.199> and<00:05:16.560> elixir<00:05:16.910> so<00:05:17.910> I

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
expensive on dark elixir and elixir so I

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.219 
expensive on dark elixir and elixir so I
mean<00:05:18.180> it's<00:05:18.270> not<00:05:18.360> really<00:05:18.510> a<00:05:18.600> good<00:05:18.690> farming<00:05:19.080> for

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
mean it's not really a good farming for

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.589 
mean it's not really a good farming for
us<00:05:19.349> but<00:05:19.680> if<00:05:20.070> you<00:05:20.550> want<00:05:20.820> to<00:05:20.940> use<00:05:21.060> it<00:05:21.090> take<00:05:21.360> it<00:05:21.510> to

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
us but if you want to use it take it to

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:22.850 
us but if you want to use it take it to
a<00:05:21.630> good<00:05:21.870> farming<00:05:22.289> League<00:05:22.470> like<00:05:22.680> high

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
a good farming League like high

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.760 
a good farming League like high
champions<00:05:23.430> and<00:05:23.610> then<00:05:24.150> garch<00:05:24.479> up<00:05:24.690> there<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:25.680> is

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
champions and then garch up there it is

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.950 
champions and then garch up there it is
definitely<00:05:26.099> a<00:05:26.370> faster<00:05:26.940> way<00:05:27.060> to<00:05:27.090> climb<00:05:27.449> so<00:05:27.930> I

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
definitely a faster way to climb so I

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.290 
definitely a faster way to climb so I
would<00:05:28.169> recommend<00:05:28.199> it<00:05:28.770> for<00:05:28.919> that<00:05:29.220> other<00:05:30.210> than

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
would recommend it for that other than

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.520 
would recommend it for that other than
that<00:05:30.509> though<00:05:30.630> it's<00:05:30.780> a<00:05:30.870> really<00:05:31.050> cool<00:05:31.259> force

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
that though it's a really cool force

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.500 
that though it's a really cool force
I've<00:05:31.710> not<00:05:32.039> used<00:05:32.310> to<00:05:32.490> yet<00:05:32.699> if<00:05:32.910> you<00:05:33.090> have<00:05:33.270> any
