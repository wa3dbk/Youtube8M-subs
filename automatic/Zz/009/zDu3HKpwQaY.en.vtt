Club<00:00:37.160> today<00:00:37.820> we<00:00:38.030> have<00:00:38.150> floatplanes<00:00:38.690> once

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
Club today we have floatplanes once

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.049 
Club today we have floatplanes once
again<00:00:39.290> Tom<00:00:39.890> what<00:00:40.190> type<00:00:40.370> of<00:00:40.520> plane<00:00:40.670> is<00:00:40.850> this

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
again Tom what type of plane is this

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.299 
again Tom what type of plane is this
that's<00:00:41.600> a<00:00:41.780> do<00:00:41.960> Havilland<00:00:42.350> turbo<00:00:42.620> beaver<00:00:42.800> what

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
that's a do Havilland turbo beaver what

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.740 
that's a do Havilland turbo beaver what
year<00:00:43.550> would<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:44.000> real<00:00:44.210> plane<00:00:44.480> would<00:00:44.510> have

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
year would the real plane would have

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.180 
year would the real plane would have
been<00:00:44.870> built<00:00:45.079> I'm<00:00:45.320> guessing<00:00:45.650> around<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:46.010> mid

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
been built I'm guessing around the mid

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.810 
been built I'm guessing around the mid
60s

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
60s

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.790 
60s
and<00:00:47.269> that<00:00:47.600> was<00:00:47.720> I<00:00:47.960> guess<00:00:48.170> that's<00:00:48.379> because<00:00:48.530> the

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
and that was I guess that's because the

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.290 
and that was I guess that's because the
turbo<00:00:49.100> technology<00:00:49.730> wasn't<00:00:49.940> readily

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
turbo technology wasn't readily

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.930 
turbo technology wasn't readily
available<00:00:51.010> in<00:00:52.010> had<00:00:52.160> a<00:00:52.190> radial<00:00:52.580> engine

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
available in had a radial engine

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.630 
available in had a radial engine
I'll<00:00:53.120> bunt<00:00:53.629> a<00:00:53.720> whole<00:00:53.839> bunch<00:00:54.019> of<00:00:54.140> Pistons<00:00:54.640> now

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
I'll bunt a whole bunch of Pistons now

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.040 
I'll bunt a whole bunch of Pistons now
how<00:00:55.790> long<00:00:55.850> have<00:00:56.059> you<00:00:56.150> been<00:00:56.180> flying<00:00:56.449> these<00:00:56.809> four

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
how long have you been flying these four

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.210 
how long have you been flying these four
planes<00:00:57.290> down<00:00:57.500> about<00:00:58.629> 17<00:00:59.629> years<00:00:59.660> roughly<00:01:00.260> was

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
planes down about 17 years roughly was

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.680 
planes down about 17 years roughly was
it<00:01:01.339> quite<00:01:01.489> difficult<00:01:01.699> from<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.150> transition

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
it quite difficult from the transition

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.150 
it quite difficult from the transition
from<00:01:02.780> a<00:01:02.930> regular<00:01:03.260> plane<00:01:03.469> to<00:01:03.590> landing<00:01:03.890> on<00:01:03.949> water

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
from a regular plane to landing on water

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.180 
from a regular plane to landing on water
no<00:01:04.399> I<00:01:04.520> kind<00:01:04.879> of<00:01:04.940> liked<00:01:05.119> it<00:01:05.300> yeah<00:01:06.070> waters<00:01:07.070> kind

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
no I kind of liked it yeah waters kind

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.560 
no I kind of liked it yeah waters kind
of<00:01:07.340> hard<00:01:07.490> though<00:01:07.670> if<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:07.910> hit<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.149> hard<00:01:08.300> at

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
of hard though if you hit it hard at

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.719 
of hard though if you hit it hard at
it's<00:01:09.170> like<00:01:09.259> pavement<00:01:09.619> mushy<00:01:10.130> handle<00:01:10.520> in<00:01:10.640> the

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
it's like pavement mushy handle in the

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.070 
it's like pavement mushy handle in the
air<00:01:10.850> well<00:01:11.300> it's<00:01:11.479> not<00:01:11.630> really<00:01:11.780> an<00:01:11.899> aerobatic

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
air well it's not really an aerobatic

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.469 
air well it's not really an aerobatic
airplane<00:01:12.680> I<00:01:12.830> know<00:01:12.890> guys<00:01:13.130> can<00:01:13.399> do<00:01:13.610> aerobatics

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
airplane I know guys can do aerobatics

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:15.790 
airplane I know guys can do aerobatics
with<00:01:14.630> this<00:01:14.750> type<00:01:14.930> of<00:01:14.960> plane<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:15.380> I<00:01:15.410> have<00:01:15.560> seen

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
with this type of plane and I have seen

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.920 
with this type of plane and I have seen
guys<00:01:16.039> fly<00:01:16.399> this<00:01:16.640> particular<00:01:17.180> model<00:01:17.360> with<00:01:17.810> the

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
guys fly this particular model with the

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.540 
guys fly this particular model with the
wheels<00:01:18.110> on<00:01:18.380> it<00:01:18.410> and<00:01:18.680> doing<00:01:19.039> all<00:01:19.160> kinds<00:01:19.490> of

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
wheels on it and doing all kinds of

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.490 
wheels on it and doing all kinds of
crazy<00:01:19.670> stuff<00:01:19.880> well<00:01:20.420> thanks<00:01:20.750> oh<00:01:20.780> you're<00:01:21.410> well

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
crazy stuff well thanks oh you're well

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:46.039 
crazy stuff well thanks oh you're well
great<00:01:21.710> looking<00:01:22.009> plane<00:01:22.280> thank<00:01:22.640> you

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.630 

now<00:01:46.619> tell<00:01:46.859> me<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.100> bit<00:01:47.280> about<00:01:47.369> this

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
now tell me a little bit about this

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.880 
now tell me a little bit about this
plane<00:01:47.909> right<00:01:48.109> this<00:01:49.109> plane<00:01:49.380> does<00:01:49.560> not<00:01:49.710> have

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
plane right this plane does not have

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.310 
plane right this plane does not have
pontoons<00:01:50.369> on<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.670> no<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.289> a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
pontoons on it no this is this is a

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.529 
pontoons on it no this is this is a
custom-built<00:01:52.770> plane<00:01:53.070> it's<00:01:53.399> C<00:01:53.850> master<00:01:54.240> and

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
custom-built plane it's C master and

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.660 
custom-built plane it's C master and
it's<00:01:54.689> basically<00:01:54.990> designed<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> flying

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
it's basically designed like a flying

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.260 
it's basically designed like a flying
boat<00:01:56.929> the<00:01:57.929> whole<00:01:57.960> fuselage<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:59.119> basically<00:02:00.119> a

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
boat the whole fuselage is basically a

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.209 
boat the whole fuselage is basically a
float<00:02:00.719> on<00:02:00.869> its<00:02:01.049> own<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.500> then<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:01.979> has<00:02:02.100> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
float on its own and then it has the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.380 
float on its own and then it has the
components<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.819> the<00:02:02.909> wings<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
components of the wings and the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.380 
components of the wings and the
elevators<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.469> motor<00:02:04.679> so<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.939> concept

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
elevators and the motor so the concept

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.289 
elevators and the motor so the concept
is<00:02:06.539> half<00:02:07.380> boat<00:02:07.619> half<00:02:07.890> plane<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.700> flies<00:02:09.030> really

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
is half boat half plane it flies really

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.320 
is half boat half plane it flies really
nice<00:02:09.569> it's<00:02:10.080> got<00:02:10.229> very<00:02:11.039> sharp<00:02:11.370> handling<00:02:11.849> very

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
nice it's got very sharp handling very

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.570 
nice it's got very sharp handling very
easy<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.720> control<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.410> it's<00:02:14.040> just<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.250> blast<00:02:14.459> to

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
easy to control and it's just a blast to

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.610 
easy to control and it's just a blast to
fly<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.540> little<00:02:15.690> bit<00:02:15.900> more<00:02:16.049> difficult<00:02:16.530> to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
fly is it a little bit more difficult to

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.319 
fly is it a little bit more difficult to
take<00:02:16.739> off<00:02:16.980> because<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.879> added<00:02:18.180> weight

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
take off because of the added weight

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.059 
take off because of the added weight
when<00:02:18.599> you're<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:19.349> know<00:02:19.440> pulling<00:02:19.739> on<00:02:19.980> the

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
when you're you know pulling on the

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.710 
when you're you know pulling on the
water<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.549> have<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.700> really<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.390> first<00:02:21.540> time

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
water you have to really the first time

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.449 
water you have to really the first time
I<00:02:21.780> flew<00:02:22.019> it<00:02:22.140> with<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:23.010> amount<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.280> power

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
I flew it with the the amount of power

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.280 
I flew it with the the amount of power
it<00:02:23.790> actually<00:02:24.329> breaks<00:02:24.510> off<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.900> water<00:02:25.079> very

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
it actually breaks off the water very

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.380 
it actually breaks off the water very
easily<00:02:25.410> right<00:02:25.950> but<00:02:26.640> depending<00:02:26.970> on<00:02:27.060> your<00:02:27.150> setup

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
easily right but depending on your setup

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.580 
easily right but depending on your setup
if<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.720> have<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.840> smaller<00:02:28.110> motor<00:02:28.349> it's<00:02:28.560> a

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
if you have a smaller motor it's a

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.720 
if you have a smaller motor it's a
little<00:02:28.739> bit<00:02:28.829> harder<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.099> get<00:02:29.190> off<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.459> water

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
little bit harder to get off the water

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.309 
little bit harder to get off the water
but<00:02:30.090> this<00:02:30.209> one<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.480> very<00:02:30.690> easy<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.930> take<00:02:31.140> off

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
but this one is very easy to take off

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.190 
but this one is very easy to take off
the<00:02:31.470> water<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.950> would<00:02:32.400> say<00:02:32.579> been<00:02:32.730> flying<00:02:32.970> about

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
the water I would say been flying about

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.870 
the water I would say been flying about
both<00:02:34.200> three<00:02:34.440> years<00:02:34.650> now<00:02:34.860> on<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.519> off<00:02:35.610> and

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
both three years now on and off and

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.640 
both three years now on and off and
actually<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.180> joined<00:02:36.269> beaten<00:02:36.780> two<00:02:37.230> years<00:02:37.440> ago

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
actually I joined beaten two years ago

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.069 
actually I joined beaten two years ago
and<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:38.400> great<00:02:38.670> bunch<00:02:38.849> of<00:02:38.970> guys<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.299> the

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
and a great bunch of guys and the

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.870 
and a great bunch of guys and the
facility<00:02:40.560> over<00:02:40.799> here<00:02:40.950> our<00:02:41.160> location<00:02:41.790> is

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
facility over here our location is

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.270 
facility over here our location is
unbelievable<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:42.750> that's<00:02:43.079> why<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.620> joined<00:02:43.890> up

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
unbelievable so that's why I joined up

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.069 
unbelievable so that's why I joined up
here<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.579> it's<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:45.090> never<00:02:45.480> looked<00:02:45.690> back

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
here and it's I never looked back

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
well Rocco thanks a lot appreciate it

00:02:48.209 --> 00:03:16.149 
well Rocco thanks a lot appreciate it
and<00:02:48.360> there<00:02:48.629> you<00:02:48.720> go<00:02:48.750> folks<00:02:49.170> join<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.860> club

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.160 

this<00:03:17.159> airplane<00:03:17.489> when<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:18.360> turn<00:03:18.569> it<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:18.959> have

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
this airplane when you turn it you have

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.839 
this airplane when you turn it you have
to<00:03:19.319> bank<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:19.920> then<00:03:20.129> use<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.310> bit<00:03:20.579> of<00:03:20.700> rudder

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
to bank it and then use a bit of rudder

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.660 
to bank it and then use a bit of rudder
to<00:03:21.209> keep<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.540> from<00:03:22.049> yarn<00:03:22.319> so<00:03:23.010> instead<00:03:23.280> of<00:03:23.340> doing

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
to keep it from yarn so instead of doing

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.300 
to keep it from yarn so instead of doing
the<00:03:23.939> aileron<00:03:24.360> thing<00:03:24.689> you<00:03:25.590> know<00:03:25.680> other<00:03:25.980> planes

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
the aileron thing you know other planes

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.890 
the aileron thing you know other planes
since<00:03:26.519> usually<00:03:26.700> aileron<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.569> little<00:03:27.810> bit

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
since usually aileron and a little bit

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.780 
since usually aileron and a little bit
of<00:03:28.019> elevator<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.530> keep<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.829> going<00:03:29.069> so<00:03:29.610> now<00:03:29.760> I

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
of elevator to keep it going so now I

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.490 
of elevator to keep it going so now I
have<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.269> use<00:03:30.390> two<00:03:30.599> sticks<00:03:30.840> instead<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.349> just

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
have to use two sticks instead of just

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.420 
have to use two sticks instead of just
one<00:03:31.709> because<00:03:33.409> I'm<00:03:34.409> the<00:03:34.440> plane<00:03:34.799> characteristic

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
one because I'm the plane characteristic

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.339 
one because I'm the plane characteristic
of<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.700> airplane<00:03:36.030> really<00:03:36.480> yeah<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:36.959> even<00:03:37.260> if

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
of the airplane really yeah so even if

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.600 
of the airplane really yeah so even if
you<00:03:37.440> did<00:03:37.590> now<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:37.769> floats<00:03:38.159> on<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.519> we're

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
you did now the floats on and we're

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.339 
you did now the floats on and we're
probably<00:03:38.790> actively<00:03:39.480> same<00:03:39.720> way<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.019> same<00:03:40.170> way

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
probably actively same way the same way

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.259 
probably actively same way the same way
yeah<00:03:40.560> why<00:03:40.890> do<00:03:41.159> you<00:03:41.310> think<00:03:41.489> that<00:03:41.670> is<00:03:41.849> visit

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
yeah why do you think that is visit

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.509 
yeah why do you think that is visit
design<00:03:42.780> flaw<00:03:43.140> may<00:03:43.409> be<00:03:43.470> or<00:03:43.739> is<00:03:43.920> it<00:03:43.950> just<00:03:44.099> this

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
design flaw may be or is it just this

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.250 
design flaw may be or is it just this
has<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.730> fairly<00:03:45.120> long<00:03:45.269> wing<00:03:45.599> for<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.079> type<00:03:46.230> of

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
has a fairly long wing for the type of

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.479 
has a fairly long wing for the type of
airplane<00:03:46.739> that<00:03:46.829> is<00:03:46.890> maybe<00:03:47.220> that's<00:03:47.430> a

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
airplane that is maybe that's a

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.680 
airplane that is maybe that's a
characteristic<00:03:47.879> of<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.299> wing<00:03:48.420> I'm<00:03:48.540> not

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
characteristic of the wing I'm not

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.149 
characteristic of the wing I'm not
really<00:03:48.930> sure<00:03:49.109> why<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.379> characteristic

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
really sure why the characteristic

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.339 
really sure why the characteristic
happens<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.180> it's<00:03:51.329> not<00:03:51.450> really<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.840> performance

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
happens so it's not really a performance

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.349 
happens so it's not really a performance
plane<00:03:52.889> like<00:03:53.129> you<00:03:53.250> can't<00:03:53.489> really<00:03:53.670> turn<00:03:54.000> on<00:03:54.030> you

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
plane like you can't really turn on you

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.149 
plane like you can't really turn on you
can<00:03:54.540> turn<00:03:54.989> this<00:03:55.170> thing<00:03:55.230> too<00:03:55.500> sharp<00:03:55.799> if<00:03:55.980> once

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
can turn this thing too sharp if once

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.710 
can turn this thing too sharp if once
you<00:03:56.280> know<00:03:56.400> what<00:03:56.549> you're<00:03:56.670> doing<00:03:56.970> but<00:03:57.120> I'm<00:03:57.540> not

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
you know what you're doing but I'm not

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.509 
you know what you're doing but I'm not
there<00:03:57.959> yet
