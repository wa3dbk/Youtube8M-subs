hi<00:00:00.930> there<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.589> video<00:00:01.949> demonstrating<00:00:02.760> a

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:03.230 
hi there this is a video demonstrating a

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.140 
hi there this is a video demonstrating a
prison<00:00:04.230> box<00:00:04.650> concept<00:00:05.460> that<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:05.700> came<00:00:05.970> up<00:00:06.120> with

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
prison box concept that I came up with

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.270 
prison box concept that I came up with
for<00:00:06.660> pvp<00:00:07.410> servers<00:00:08.010> or<00:00:08.370> just<00:00:09.210> messing<00:00:09.570> around

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
for pvp servers or just messing around

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.310 
for pvp servers or just messing around
the<00:00:11.280> way<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.639> works<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.509> massive

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
the way that it works is it is a massive

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.810 
the way that it works is it is a massive
cobblestone<00:00:14.130> generator<00:00:14.630> but<00:00:16.160> it<00:00:17.160> initially

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
cobblestone generator but it initially

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.730 
cobblestone generator but it initially
drops<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.539> player<00:00:18.810> off<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.590> small<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.580> zone

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
drops the player off in a small to zone

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.560 
drops the player off in a small to zone
or<00:00:22.740> two<00:00:23.010> blocks<00:00:23.340> tone<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.180> center<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.449> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
or two blocks tone in the center of the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.160 
or two blocks tone in the center of the
cute<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.170> large<00:00:25.680> cobblestone<00:00:26.310> generator

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
cute of this large cobblestone generator

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.839 
cute of this large cobblestone generator
then<00:00:28.170> when<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.650> player<00:00:28.949> tries<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.490> pick<00:00:29.670> out

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
then when the player tries to pick out

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.510 
then when the player tries to pick out
the<00:00:30.779> cobblestone<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.619> instantly<00:00:32.040> replaced

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the cobblestone is instantly replaced

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.139 
the cobblestone is instantly replaced
and<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.510> player<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.989> kept<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> small<00:00:34.800> zone

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
and the player is kept in the small zone

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.729 
and the player is kept in the small zone
so<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.270> all<00:00:36.360> starts<00:00:36.719> with<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.020> pressure

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
so it all starts with this pressure

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.549 
so it all starts with this pressure
plate<00:00:38.120> you<00:00:39.120> could<00:00:39.300> rig<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.719> up<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.200> number<00:00:40.500> of

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
plate you could rig this up a number of

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.830 
plate you could rig this up a number of
ways<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:41.700> what<00:00:42.180> I'm<00:00:42.300> doing<00:00:42.600> for

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
ways this is just what I'm doing for

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.350 
ways this is just what I'm doing for
demonstration<00:00:43.440> purposes<00:00:43.920> player<00:00:44.730> walks<00:00:45.090> on

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
demonstration purposes player walks on

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.600 
demonstration purposes player walks on
the<00:00:45.450> pressure<00:00:45.660> plate<00:00:45.860> gets<00:00:46.860> dropped<00:00:47.219> into

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the pressure plate gets dropped into

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.430 
the pressure plate gets dropped into
water<00:00:47.640> doesn't<00:00:48.300> die<00:00:48.600> because<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.200> water

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
water doesn't die because of the water

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.790 
water doesn't die because of the water
but<00:00:50.430> lands<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.120> pressure<00:00:51.390> plate<00:00:51.800> it

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
but lands on this pressure plate it

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.400 
but lands on this pressure plate it
activates<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.730> cobblestone<00:00:54.510> generator<00:00:54.539> as

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
activates the cobblestone generator as

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.510 
activates the cobblestone generator as
you<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.739> hear<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:57.690> as<00:00:58.559> I'm<00:00:58.859> frantically

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you can hear and as I'm frantically

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.200 
you can hear and as I'm frantically
trying<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.000> get<00:01:00.210> out<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:01.550> little<00:01:02.550> crap<00:01:04.159> I

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
trying to get out of this little crap I

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.359 
trying to get out of this little crap I
just<00:01:06.210> find<00:01:07.020> myself<00:01:07.080> like<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.979> said<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.280> this

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
just find myself like I said in this

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.620 
just find myself like I said in this
little<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.939> block<00:01:09.240> zone<00:01:09.650> so<00:01:10.650> every<00:01:10.950> time<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.630> try

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
little to block zone so every time I try

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.320 
little to block zone so every time I try
to<00:01:12.659> get<00:01:12.930> out<00:01:13.250> try<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.310> get<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> block<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.090> can

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
to get out try to get a block so I can

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.020 
to get out try to get a block so I can
move<00:01:18.479> at<00:01:18.689> least<00:01:18.869> somewhere<00:01:19.790> gets<00:01:20.790> replaced

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
move at least somewhere gets replaced

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.929 
move at least somewhere gets replaced
almost<00:01:21.540> instantly<00:01:22.310> best<00:01:23.310> strategy<00:01:23.850> i've

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
almost instantly best strategy i've

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.480 
almost instantly best strategy i've
found<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.390> going<00:01:24.630> straight<00:01:24.960> down<00:01:25.100> but<00:01:26.100> no<00:01:26.430> you

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
found is going straight down but no you

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.380 
found is going straight down but no you
cannot<00:01:27.030> escape<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.479> key<00:01:28.850> kills<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.030> before

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
cannot escape the key kills you before

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.690 
cannot escape the key kills you before
you<00:01:30.600> get<00:01:31.409> anywhere<00:01:31.799> i<00:01:31.829> think<00:01:32.159> i'm<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
you get anywhere i think i'm just a

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.929 
you get anywhere i think i'm just a
single<00:01:33.090> block<00:01:33.390> day<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:34.460> yeah<00:01:35.460> i<00:01:35.490> can't<00:01:35.850> even

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
single block day on yeah i can't even

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.719 
single block day on yeah i can't even
get<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.270> one<00:01:36.900> block<00:01:37.110> down<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.310> yeah<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.549> is

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
get it one block down so yeah this is

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.200 
get it one block down so yeah this is
the<00:01:38.939> design<00:01:39.600> i<00:01:40.170> hope<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.829> enjoy<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.640> really
