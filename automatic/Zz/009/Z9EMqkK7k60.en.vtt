00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.109
 Carive 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.879
 another exercise that I advise you to do only 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.939
 reading page 78 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.139
 I look against looks at the alternate picking the following 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.429
 it is based would seem if the choice 

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:31.929

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:44.569
 fingering the ladder 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.359
 the exercise 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.680
 because different speeds really 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.349
 our brain must have time to memorize 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.259
 moving board make it your own 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:59.499
 then the jump in terms of both speed and execution 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.609
 capital 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.529
 only automatically 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:07.089
 it is more important to take care of the movements trying to be precise from the beginning 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:10.489
 from the beginning that I make it feel adopted as written where 120 bpm 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.459
 so you can carefully follow the movements of my hands and above all 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.329

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.100
 photo only exercise not only because maybe we will have to face vibrating that 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.300

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.099

 places different tools to do the possible 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.960
 surely this is a great exercise because it requires us to go to 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.870
 bitches to bend our falangetta as much as possible 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.939
