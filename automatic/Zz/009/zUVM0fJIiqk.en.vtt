00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
I'm gonna tell you a little bit about

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.049 
I'm gonna tell you a little bit about
what<00:00:07.529> we've<00:00:07.680> done<00:00:07.859> with<00:00:08.040> technology<00:00:08.639> for<00:00:08.820> you

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
what we've done with technology for you

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.720 
what we've done with technology for you
for<00:00:09.710> especially<00:00:10.710> compared<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.250> our<00:00:11.370> old<00:00:11.519> game

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
for especially compared to our old game

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.530 
for especially compared to our old game
EU<00:00:11.940> 3<00:00:12.179> India<00:00:13.019> 3<00:00:13.230> we<00:00:13.950> had<00:00:14.130> over<00:00:14.490> 70<00:00:15.000> tech<00:00:15.210> levels

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
EU 3 India 3 we had over 70 tech levels

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.810 
EU 3 India 3 we had over 70 tech levels
but<00:00:15.660> they<00:00:15.780> were<00:00:15.839> all<00:00:16.020> fairly<00:00:16.289> generic<00:00:16.820> what

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
but they were all fairly generic what

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.400 
but they were all fairly generic what
we've<00:00:17.940> done<00:00:18.090> with<00:00:18.300> technology<00:00:18.420> near<00:00:18.990> 4<00:00:19.320> is

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
we've done with technology near 4 is

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.529 
we've done with technology near 4 is
that<00:00:19.560> we've<00:00:19.740> tried<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.070> consolidate<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
that we've tried to consolidate the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.050 
that we've tried to consolidate the
technicals<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.380> bit<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.710> make<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.430> more<00:00:23.670> much

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
technicals a bit and make the more much

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.750 
technicals a bit and make the more much
more<00:00:24.240> interesting<00:00:24.960> we<00:00:25.740> want<00:00:25.949> every<00:00:26.340> level<00:00:26.550> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
more interesting we want every level to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.099 
more interesting we want every level to
feel<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.180> you're<00:00:27.449> actually<00:00:27.630> doing

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
feel that you're actually doing

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.230 
feel that you're actually doing
something<00:00:28.980> for<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.490> country<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:29.970> going

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
something for a country and going

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.950 
something for a country and going
forward<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:30.990> really<00:00:31.769> changing<00:00:32.430> something

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
forward and really changing something

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.170 
forward and really changing something
and<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.620> also<00:00:34.800> try<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.190> make<00:00:35.430> each<00:00:35.489> tech<00:00:35.969> level

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
and we also try to make each tech level

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.160 
and we also try to make each tech level
much<00:00:36.570> more<00:00:38.059> historically<00:00:39.059> immersive<00:00:39.660> or<00:00:39.780> you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
much more historically immersive or you

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.410 
much more historically immersive or you
know<00:00:40.290> give<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> bare<00:00:41.340> historical<00:00:41.820> feeling<00:00:42.239> to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
know give the bare historical feeling to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.000 
know give the bare historical feeling to
them<00:00:43.760> so<00:00:44.760> while<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.780> before<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.440> invented

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
them so while you before you invented

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.729 
them so while you before you invented
tech<00:00:47.219> level<00:00:47.399> 10<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:48.200> military<00:00:49.200> technology<00:00:49.710> and

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
tech level 10 in military technology and

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.110 
tech level 10 in military technology and
that<00:00:50.039> gave<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.489> plus<00:00:50.969> say<00:00:51.210> 0.05<00:00:51.989> firepower

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
that gave you plus say 0.05 firepower

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.880 
that gave you plus say 0.05 firepower
whereas<00:00:54.120> now<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.660> will<00:00:55.199> invent<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
whereas now you will invent the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.500 
whereas now you will invent the
Horrible's<00:00:56.489> which<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.910> will<00:00:57.030> encrypt<00:00:57.329> your

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
Horrible's which you will encrypt your

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.080 
Horrible's which you will encrypt your
troops<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.620> with<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.399> new<00:00:59.520> firepower

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
troops with and with the new firepower

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.569 
troops with and with the new firepower
they<00:01:01.020> will<00:01:01.170> change<00:01:01.469> how<00:01:01.739> battles<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.370> fought

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
they will change how battles are fought

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.370 
they will change how battles are fought
and<00:01:02.879> make<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.719> win<00:01:03.960> wars<00:01:04.670> or<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:05.970> example<00:01:06.380> you

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
and make you win wars or for example you

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.590 
and make you win wars or for example you
could<00:01:07.560> get<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:08.070> new<00:01:08.460> diplomatic<00:01:08.790> technology

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
could get a new diplomatic technology

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.750 
could get a new diplomatic technology
Knology<00:01:10.229> called<00:01:10.500> coalition's<00:01:11.159> which<00:01:11.580> would

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
Knology called coalition's which would

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.520 
Knology called coalition's which would
actually<00:01:12.060> give<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> completely<00:01:13.049> new<00:01:13.200> tool

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
actually give you a completely new tool

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.310 
actually give you a completely new tool
to<00:01:13.740> conduct<00:01:14.130> diplomacy<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:15.049> another<00:01:16.049> thing

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
to conduct diplomacy and another thing

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.890 
to conduct diplomacy and another thing
that<00:01:16.860> has<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.280> changed<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.570> fact<00:01:18.810> that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
that has really changed is the fact that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.960 
that has really changed is the fact that
you<00:01:19.140> now<00:01:19.320> by<00:01:19.530> technology<00:01:20.189> with<00:01:20.369> modern<00:01:20.759> power

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
you now by technology with modern power

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.109 
you now by technology with modern power
in<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:22.170> old<00:01:22.350> tech<00:01:22.650> system<00:01:23.100> well<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.970> was

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
in the old tech system well that was

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.140 
in the old tech system well that was
almost<00:01:24.330> self<00:01:24.810> contained<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.710> e3<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.880> got

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
almost self contained in e3 you you got

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.120 
almost self contained in e3 you you got
money<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.600> was<00:01:27.930> put<00:01:28.320> into<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.829> technology

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
money that was put into the technology

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.160 
money that was put into the technology
system<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.030> prioritized<00:01:30.689> between

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
system and you prioritized between

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.160 
system and you prioritized between
technologies<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.880> now<00:01:33.090> we've<00:01:33.630> actually<00:01:33.810> made

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
technologies but now we've actually made

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.219 
technologies but now we've actually made
it<00:01:34.350> into<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.040> trade<00:01:35.400> off<00:01:35.610> before<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.750> forge

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
it into a to trade off before to forge

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.920 
it into a to trade off before to forge
ahead<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.650> technologies<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.450> build<00:01:39.689> that

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
ahead in technologies and and build that

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.700 
ahead in technologies and and build that
new<00:01:40.259> model<00:01:40.500> army<00:01:40.970> or<00:01:41.970> do<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.780> reprioritize

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
new model army or do you reprioritize

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.950 
new model army or do you reprioritize
