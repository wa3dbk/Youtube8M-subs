00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.740
 my name is christian klandt and me 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.930
 I'm a photographer from Berlin 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.670
 some time ago I have one for me 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.400
 completely new photographic process 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.960
 discovered that already over 150 years old 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.949
 is 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.840
 is exposed in order not to 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.820
 footage and certainly not on 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.310
 digital chips but on glass or 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.099
 Metal plates and images are created 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.499
 like this, what made me feel right from the start 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.779
 I was thrilled that I was able to 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.610
 I am an emotional deep in the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.470
 Portraits to bring in like me 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.469
 digital photography so far not 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.699
 was possible 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.120
 is also something fascinating with the 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.350
 I happen to portray people 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.120
 Most of the time they are not just surprised 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.609
 but deeply touched when you see her 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.859
 see your own plate 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.809
 that has me on an idea I brought 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:55.350
 I would like to design a project with myself 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.559
 100 people photographing 100 people 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.629
 looking at the plate and the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.429
 write down your word as anything 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.539
 first thing comes to mind when they get theirs 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.240
 see your own plate 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.159
 this word becomes the title for the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.710
 be plate for the picture 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.560

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.950
