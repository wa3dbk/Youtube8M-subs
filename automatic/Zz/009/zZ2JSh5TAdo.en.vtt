we're<00:00:05.790> gonna<00:00:05.879> cover<00:00:06.150> speed<00:00:06.960> today<00:00:07.170> speed<00:00:08.040> is

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
we're gonna cover speed today speed is

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.730 
we're gonna cover speed today speed is
our<00:00:08.910> friend<00:00:09.179> speed<00:00:09.690> can<00:00:10.110> make<00:00:10.260> us<00:00:10.440> productive

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
our friend speed can make us productive

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.770 
our friend speed can make us productive
but<00:00:11.219> we<00:00:11.370> got<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.580> watch<00:00:11.700> reducers<00:00:12.240> hardener

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
but we got to watch reducers hardener

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.780 
but we got to watch reducers hardener
selections<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:14.250> will<00:00:14.400> help<00:00:14.519> with<00:00:14.610> that

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
selections and this will help with that

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.000 
selections and this will help with that
so<00:00:15.410> without<00:00:16.410> further<00:00:16.590> ado<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:18.710> know<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:19.920> an

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
so without further ado I know it's an

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.349 
so without further ado I know it's an
old<00:00:20.160> joke<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.580> watching<00:00:20.880> paint<00:00:21.060> dry<00:00:21.150> is

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
old joke that watching paint dry is

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.759 
old joke that watching paint dry is
boring<00:00:21.840> as<00:00:21.960> heck<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:22.320> if<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.500> think<00:00:22.650> about

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
boring as heck but if you think about

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.470 
boring as heck but if you think about
what<00:00:23.039> goes<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.369> when<00:00:23.609> paint<00:00:23.850> dries<00:00:24.150> it's

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
what goes on when paint dries it's

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.599 
what goes on when paint dries it's
actually<00:00:24.750> kind<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.019> complicated<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:26.400> throw

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
actually kind of complicated we throw

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.920 
actually kind of complicated we throw
this<00:00:26.789> stuff<00:00:27.029> through<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> air<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.779> hits

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
this stuff through the air and it hits

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.720 
this stuff through the air and it hits
the<00:00:28.080> panel<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.650> during<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.130> first<00:00:29.310> couple

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the panel and during that first couple

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.970 
the panel and during that first couple
of<00:00:29.820> minutes<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.689> want<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.260> metallic<00:00:31.740> flakes

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
of minutes we want the metallic flakes

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.610 
of minutes we want the metallic flakes
to<00:00:32.130> orient<00:00:32.489> properly<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.840> want<00:00:34.050> them<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.230> sink

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
to orient properly we want them to sink

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.130 
to orient properly we want them to sink
in<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.890> film<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:35.730> want<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.239> tint<00:00:36.600> package

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
in the film and we want the tint package

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.440 
in the film and we want the tint package
that<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.710> all<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.100> colorants<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.059> make<00:00:39.270> up

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
that is all the colorants that make up

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.680 
that is all the colorants that make up
that<00:00:39.480> color<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.559> come<00:00:40.770> up<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.579> sit<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.000> top<00:00:42.390> of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
that color to come up and sit on top of

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.869 
that color to come up and sit on top of
the<00:00:42.840> metal<00:00:43.020> flakes<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.680> way<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.670> make<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the metal flakes that way we can make a

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.180 
the metal flakes that way we can make a
silver<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:46.140> most<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.500> metallics<00:00:46.980> are

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
silver like most of the metallics are

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.639 
silver like most of the metallics are
into<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> blue<00:00:48.390> metallic<00:00:48.690> or<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> green<00:00:49.350> or<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> red

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
into a blue metallic or a green or a red

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.700 
into a blue metallic or a green or a red
etc<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.879> if<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.719> not<00:00:51.870> oriented<00:00:52.469> properly

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
etc so if it is not oriented properly

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.189 
etc so if it is not oriented properly
within<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.399> film<00:00:53.640> itself<00:00:54.090> we're<00:00:54.899> gonna<00:00:54.989> get

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
within the film itself we're gonna get

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.080 
within the film itself we're gonna get
all<00:00:55.350> kinds<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.739> freaky<00:00:56.550> things<00:00:56.789> with<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
all kinds of freaky things with the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.369 
all kinds of freaky things with the
metallic<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.840> pearl

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
metallic and the pearl

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.170 
metallic and the pearl
we'll<00:00:58.739> get<00:00:58.859> colors<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.399> are<00:00:59.520> gray<00:00:59.850> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
we'll get colors that are gray and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.349 
we'll get colors that are gray and
blotchy<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.469> streaky<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.340> we<00:01:02.879> want<00:01:03.180> that

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
blotchy and streaky so we want that

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.719 
blotchy and streaky so we want that
flash<00:01:03.809> time<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.229> take<00:01:04.409> place<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.549> in

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
flash time to take place with that in

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.399 
flash time to take place with that in
mind<00:01:05.970> look<00:01:06.450> at<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> different<00:01:06.960> speeds<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
mind look at the different speeds that

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.770 
mind look at the different speeds that
we<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:08.369> have<00:01:08.520> fast<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.390> slow

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
we have we have fast and we have slow

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.960 
we have we have fast and we have slow
but<00:01:10.500> really<00:01:10.979> there<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.299> adjust<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:14.310> dry<00:01:14.640> time

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
but really there to adjust the dry time

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.149 
but really there to adjust the dry time
within<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.780> given<00:01:15.930> temperature<00:01:16.259> range<00:01:16.799> or<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
within a given temperature range or a

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.850 
within a given temperature range or a
job<00:01:17.640> size<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.630> fast<00:01:18.930> doesn't<00:01:19.170> necessarily

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
job size so fast doesn't necessarily

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.690 
job size so fast doesn't necessarily
mean<00:01:20.009> you're<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> make<00:01:20.490> more<00:01:20.640> money

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
mean you're going to make more money

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.850 
mean you're going to make more money
fast<00:01:21.570> means<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.200> going<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.439> get<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
fast means that is going to get you the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.730 
fast means that is going to get you the
same<00:01:23.189> dry<00:01:23.549> time<00:01:23.850> maybe<00:01:24.570> five<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.229> ten<00:01:25.439> minutes

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
same dry time maybe five to ten minutes

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.880 
same dry time maybe five to ten minutes
between<00:01:25.890> coats<00:01:26.400> at<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:27.630> cooler<00:01:28.049> temperature<00:01:28.710> or

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
between coats at a cooler temperature or

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.749 
between coats at a cooler temperature or
on<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> smaller<00:01:30.090> job<00:01:30.420> now<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> bigger<00:01:31.860> job<00:01:32.220> and

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
on a smaller job now on a bigger job and

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.880 
on a smaller job now on a bigger job and
a<00:01:32.850> hotter<00:01:33.090> temperature<00:01:33.659> where<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.350> material

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
a hotter temperature where the material

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.340 
a hotter temperature where the material
tends<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.310> go<00:01:35.490> off<00:01:35.640> faster<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.720> need<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.990> slower

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
tends to go off faster you need a slower

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.440 
tends to go off faster you need a slower
mix<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.280> will<00:01:38.430> allow<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.729> paint<00:01:39.030> film<00:01:39.240> to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
mix that will allow the paint film to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.889 
mix that will allow the paint film to
stay<00:01:39.659> open<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:41.250> fastest<00:01:41.880> thing<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.570> best

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
stay open so the fastest thing the best

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.749 
stay open so the fastest thing the best
thing<00:01:43.140> for<00:01:43.170> metallic<00:01:43.710> control<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.520> best

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
thing for metallic control the best

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.300 
thing for metallic control the best
thing<00:01:45.000> for<00:01:45.030> orientation<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:46.110> going<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
thing for orientation is going to be the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.210 
thing for orientation is going to be the
appropriate<00:01:48.030> speed<00:01:48.270> reducer<00:01:48.869> at<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.110> given<00:01:50.040> job

to be spraying for about a minute or so

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.800 
to be spraying for about a minute or so

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
things are true with the low VLC areas

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.660 
things are true with the low VLC areas
except<00:02:34.859> for<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.129> time<00:02:35.280> we're<00:02:35.430> going<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.579> be

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
except for this time we're going to be

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.780 
except for this time we're going to be
using<00:02:35.909> the<00:02:36.000> MBR<00:02:36.840> reducers<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.709> would<00:02:38.189> be<00:02:38.310> 100

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
using the MBR reducers that would be 100

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.059 
using the MBR reducers that would be 100
through<00:02:39.000> 400<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.689> they're<00:02:40.200> roughly<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.859> same

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
through 400 and they're roughly the same

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.149 
through 400 and they're roughly the same
distance<00:02:41.700> apart<00:02:41.849> as<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.900> mr<00:02:43.409> reducers<00:02:43.920> for

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
distance apart as the mr reducers for

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.979 
distance apart as the mr reducers for
higher<00:02:44.310> VLC<00:02:44.790> areas<00:02:45.090> however<00:02:45.750> there's<00:02:45.930> only

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
higher VLC areas however there's only

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.990 
higher VLC areas however there's only
four<00:02:46.379> of<00:02:46.409> them<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.340> range<00:02:47.549> is<00:02:47.670> gonna<00:02:47.819> be

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
four of them so the range is gonna be

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.599 
four of them so the range is gonna be
slightly<00:02:48.239> different<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:49.280> overall<00:02:50.280> as<00:02:50.579> a

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
slightly different and overall as a

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.460 
slightly different and overall as a
group<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.450> got<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.690> pick<00:02:51.900> them<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.109> little<00:02:52.349> bit

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
group you got to pick them a little bit

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.800 
group you got to pick them a little bit
more<00:02:52.650> carefully<00:02:53.159> so<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:54.030> can<00:02:54.239> see<00:02:54.420> here<00:02:54.659> that

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
more carefully so you can see here that

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.690 
more carefully so you can see here that
they<00:02:55.109> have<00:02:55.139> a<00:02:55.290> wider<00:02:55.620> range<00:02:55.799> for<00:02:56.250> some<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.549> them

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
they have a wider range for some of them

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.809 
they have a wider range for some of them
but<00:02:57.420> they<00:02:58.139> are<00:02:58.319> exempt<00:02:58.799> so<00:02:59.069> as<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.459> whole

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
but they are exempt so as a whole

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.160 
but they are exempt so as a whole
they're<00:03:00.030> going<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.209> be<00:03:00.329> a<00:03:00.359> little<00:03:00.510> bit<00:03:00.659> faster

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
they're going to be a little bit faster

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.929 
they're going to be a little bit faster
have<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.889> watch<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.220> gun<00:03:02.340> distance<00:03:02.790> and

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
have to watch the gun distance and

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.429 
have to watch the gun distance and
everything<00:03:03.209> as<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.420> do<00:03:03.540> with<00:03:03.629> most<00:03:03.840> low<00:03:04.049> plc

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439

same thing happens you want the base
coat<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.180> actually<00:03:09.569> flash<00:03:09.840> out<00:03:10.139> so<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:10.889> we'll

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
coat to actually flash out so that we'll

we're gonna have running maybe and

we're gonna have running maybe and
difficult<00:03:38.879> handling<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:39.750> we<00:03:40.169> want<00:03:40.379> to<00:03:40.470> do<00:03:40.560> the

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
same thing we want to pick the hardener

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:43.909 
same thing we want to pick the hardener
that's<00:03:42.750> gonna<00:03:42.900> give<00:03:43.139> us<00:03:43.169> the<00:03:43.290> flash<00:03:43.650> time

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
that's gonna give us the flash time

that's gonna give us the flash time
that's<00:03:44.129> gonna<00:03:44.250> be<00:03:44.430> appropriate<00:03:45.060> for<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.329> job

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
that's gonna be appropriate for the job

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.809 
that's gonna be appropriate for the job
size<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.169> temperature<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:47.250> with<00:03:47.519> that<00:03:47.639> in

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
size and the temperature so with that in

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.550 
size and the temperature so with that in
mind<00:03:47.849> there's<00:03:48.659> four<00:03:48.900> different<00:03:48.930> hardeners

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
mind there's four different hardeners

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.589 
mind there's four different hardeners
for<00:03:49.769> most<00:03:49.949> clear<00:03:50.250> coats<00:03:50.549> and<00:03:51.030> we<00:03:51.150> go<00:03:51.299> from<00:03:51.479> the

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
for most clear coats and we go from the

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.800 
for most clear coats and we go from the
43<00:03:52.139> which<00:03:52.319> is<00:03:52.470> appropriate<00:03:53.069> for<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.479> small<00:03:54.479> job

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
43 which is appropriate for a small job

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.839 
43 which is appropriate for a small job
cool<00:03:55.260> weather<00:03:55.620> where<00:03:56.129> we<00:03:56.310> only<00:03:56.430> going<00:03:56.639> to<00:03:56.729> be

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
cool weather where we only going to be

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.189 
cool weather where we only going to be
spraying<00:03:57.150> for<00:03:57.329> a<00:03:57.359> couple<00:03:57.659> of<00:03:57.720> minutes<00:03:57.870> maybe

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:58.199 
spraying for a couple of minutes maybe

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.740 
spraying for a couple of minutes maybe
and<00:03:58.560> then<00:03:59.129> a<00:03:59.159> larger<00:03:59.639> job<00:03:59.849> on<00:04:00.030> an<00:04:00.120> overall<00:04:00.419> well

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
and then a larger job on an overall well

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.330 
and then a larger job on an overall well
we<00:04:00.870> might<00:04:01.019> actually<00:04:01.260> be<00:04:01.590> spraying<00:04:01.949> for<00:04:02.310> a

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
we might actually be spraying for a

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.550 
we might actually be spraying for a
total<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.060> 10<00:04:03.269> minutes<00:04:03.599> or<00:04:03.720> something<00:04:03.870> we're

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
total of 10 minutes or something we're

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.710 
total of 10 minutes or something we're
going<00:04:04.739> to<00:04:04.829> need<00:04:04.949> it<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.370> stay<00:04:05.609> open<00:04:05.879> and<00:04:06.389> level

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
going to need it to stay open and level

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.599 
going to need it to stay open and level
longer<00:04:07.049> even<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.470> absorb<00:04:07.829> our<00:04:07.949> own<00:04:08.069> overspray

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
longer even to absorb our own overspray

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.909 
longer even to absorb our own overspray
so<00:04:09.329> there's<00:04:09.750> four<00:04:09.930> hardeners<00:04:10.290> for<00:04:10.500> most<00:04:10.680> clear

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
so there's four hardeners for most clear

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.129 
so there's four hardeners for most clear
coats<00:04:11.190> but<00:04:11.819> then<00:04:12.060> what<00:04:12.540> about<00:04:12.599> some<00:04:12.959> of<00:04:13.049> the

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
coats but then what about some of the

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.899 
coats but then what about some of the
clear<00:04:13.319> coats<00:04:13.560> that<00:04:13.680> only<00:04:13.859> have<00:04:14.129> one<00:04:14.489> hardener

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
clear coats that only have one hardener

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.899 
clear coats that only have one hardener
well<00:04:15.629> that's<00:04:16.109> a<00:04:16.260> different<00:04:16.590> topic<00:04:16.709> with<00:04:17.669> some

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
well that's a different topic with some

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:21.289 
well that's a different topic with some
of<00:04:18.060> them<00:04:18.209> like<00:04:18.389> the<00:04:18.510> MS<00:04:18.810> 15<00:04:19.260> MSP<00:04:19.859> 25<00:04:20.400> they<00:04:21.030> only

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
of them like the MS 15 MSP 25 they only

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.330 
of them like the MS 15 MSP 25 they only
have<00:04:21.449> one<00:04:21.659> activator<00:04:22.200> they<00:04:22.529> are<00:04:22.770> going<00:04:23.099> to<00:04:23.219> be

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
have one activator they are going to be

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.250 
have one activator they are going to be
less<00:04:23.580> adjustable<00:04:24.210> however<00:04:24.779> they<00:04:24.960> are<00:04:25.020> labeled

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
less adjustable however they are labeled

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.820 
less adjustable however they are labeled
as<00:04:25.560> speed<00:04:25.950> clears

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
as speed clears

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.050 
as speed clears
so<00:04:26.949> they're<00:04:27.099> going<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.340> be<00:04:27.430> most<00:04:27.699> appropriate

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
so they're going to be most appropriate

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.629 
so they're going to be most appropriate
for<00:04:28.389> one<00:04:28.720> or<00:04:28.840> two<00:04:28.990> panels<00:04:29.409> sometimes<00:04:30.250> cooler

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
for one or two panels sometimes cooler

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.939 
for one or two panels sometimes cooler
temperatures<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.389> they<00:04:32.349> can<00:04:32.500> exist<00:04:32.770> with

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
temperatures and they can exist with

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.260 
temperatures and they can exist with
their<00:04:33.069> one<00:04:33.220> hardener<00:04:33.550> because<00:04:33.789> that's<00:04:34.030> where

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
their one hardener because that's where

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.149 
their one hardener because that's where
they<00:04:34.389> are<00:04:34.419> most<00:04:34.629> appropriate<00:04:34.960> so<00:04:35.770> as<00:04:35.889> far<00:04:36.099> as

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
they are most appropriate so as far as

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.670 
they are most appropriate so as far as
product<00:04:37.060> selection<00:04:37.539> goes<00:04:37.750> you<00:04:38.259> want<00:04:38.439> to<00:04:38.500> pick

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
product selection goes you want to pick

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.899 
product selection goes you want to pick
the<00:04:38.830> clear<00:04:39.159> that's<00:04:39.340> going<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.550> be<00:04:39.639> appropriate

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
the clear that's going to be appropriate

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:40.800 
the clear that's going to be appropriate
for<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.389> job

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
for the job

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.939 
for the job
then<00:04:40.960> you<00:04:41.110> want<00:04:41.289> to<00:04:41.349> pick<00:04:41.469> the<00:04:41.650> hardener

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
then you want to pick the hardener

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.230 
then you want to pick the hardener
that's<00:04:42.129> going<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.310> give<00:04:42.490> you<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.729> appropriate

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
that's going to give you the appropriate

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.170 
that's going to give you the appropriate
behavior<00:04:43.389> for<00:04:43.990> that<00:04:44.409> job<00:04:44.860> again<00:04:45.669> we<00:04:45.819> want<00:04:46.090> the

behavior for that job again we want the

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.610 
behavior for that job again we want the
flash<00:04:46.449> time<00:04:46.689> to<00:04:46.870> happen<00:04:47.169> we<00:04:47.319> want<00:04:47.469> the

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
flash time to happen we want the

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.529 
flash time to happen we want the
material<00:04:47.770> to<00:04:48.189> flow<00:04:48.400> we<00:04:48.879> want<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.240> let<00:04:49.360> the

sometimes<00:04:59.199> it's<00:04:59.530> just<00:04:59.860> so<00:05:00.039> cold<00:05:00.310> that<00:05:00.580> it's

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
sometimes it's just so cold that it's

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.399 
sometimes it's just so cold that it's
actually<00:05:01.000> going<00:05:01.090> to<00:05:01.180> affect<00:05:01.479> the<00:05:01.629> curing<00:05:02.139> of<00:05:02.319> a

urethane<00:05:02.680> product<00:05:03.280> in<00:05:03.430> that<00:05:03.490> case<00:05:04.210> there's

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
urethane product in that case there's

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.779 
urethane product in that case there's
two<00:05:04.900> accelerators<00:05:05.469> available<00:05:06.009> the<00:05:06.280> MX<00:05:06.699> is

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
two accelerators available the MX is

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.640 
two accelerators available the MX is
zero<00:05:07.090> eight<00:05:07.240> one<00:05:07.449> and<00:05:07.719> the<00:05:07.780> MX<00:05:08.110> is<00:05:08.289> zero<00:05:08.500> eight

zero eight one and the MX is zero eight

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.080 
zero eight one and the MX is zero eight
four<00:05:08.949> there<00:05:09.580> are<00:05:09.610> two<00:05:09.789> different

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
four there are two different

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.490 
four there are two different

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
thing the MX zero eight one is just a

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.050 
thing the MX zero eight one is just a
straightforward<00:05:14.500> accelerator<00:05:15.340> it<00:05:15.729> can<00:05:15.940> be
