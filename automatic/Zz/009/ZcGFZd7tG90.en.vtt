00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850 

increasingly<00:00:00.690> I<00:00:00.840> have<00:00:01.140> people<00:00:01.410> coming<00:00:01.620> up<00:00:01.800> to

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
increasingly I have people coming up to

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.320 
increasingly I have people coming up to
me<00:00:01.979> saying<00:00:02.100> they've<00:00:02.550> ripped<00:00:02.790> the

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
me saying they've ripped the

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.940 
me saying they've ripped the
permaculture<00:00:03.750> books<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.380> they<00:00:04.440> understand

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
permaculture books and they understand

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.490 
permaculture books and they understand
the<00:00:05.100> ideas<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.960> appreciate<00:00:06.960> what

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
the ideas and appreciate what

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.640 
the ideas and appreciate what
permaculture<00:00:07.950> is<00:00:08.130> about<00:00:09.290> but<00:00:10.290> they<00:00:10.469> don't

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
permaculture is about but they don't

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.830 
permaculture is about but they don't
know<00:00:10.740> where<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:10.920> start<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.309> their<00:00:11.460> own<00:00:11.580> yard<00:00:11.849> so

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
know where to start in their own yard so

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.099 
know where to start in their own yard so
we<00:00:12.960> created<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.650> simple<00:00:14.429> service<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.540> we<00:00:15.900> call

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
we created a simple service that we call

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.370 
we created a simple service that we call
walkabouts<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.270> very<00:00:18.270> simply<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.690> person<00:00:19.140> can

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
walkabouts and very simply a person can

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.830 
walkabouts and very simply a person can
call<00:00:20.010> upon<00:00:20.130> us<00:00:20.460> over<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> course<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.720> a

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
call upon us over the course of a

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.400 
call upon us over the course of a
two-hour<00:00:22.289> period<00:00:22.789> will<00:00:23.789> walk<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.930> person's

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
two-hour period will walk the person's

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.830 
two-hour period will walk the person's
property<00:00:25.680> with<00:00:26.070> them<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.490> give<00:00:27.420> them<00:00:27.449> some

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
property with them and give them some

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.259 
property with them and give them some
suggestions<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.680> what<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.429> we<00:00:29.670> see<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.090> good

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
suggestions on what it is we see on good

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.849 
suggestions on what it is we see on good
places<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.750> begin<00:00:31.170> with<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> permaculture

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
places to begin with a permaculture

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.540 
places to begin with a permaculture
design<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.520> their<00:00:32.610> own<00:00:32.730> yard<00:00:33.620> we<00:00:34.620> realized<00:00:35.010> in

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
design in their own yard we realized in

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.139 
design in their own yard we realized in
the<00:00:35.640> process<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.270> offering<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.500> our<00:00:38.149> walk

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the process of offering this to our walk

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.389 
the process of offering this to our walk
about<00:00:39.390> service<00:00:39.920> that<00:00:40.920> there<00:00:41.070> were<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> variety

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
about service that there were a variety

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.369 
about service that there were a variety
of<00:00:41.670> benefits<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.450> let<00:00:42.840> me<00:00:42.870> explain<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.350> you

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
of benefits to it let me explain to you

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.880 
of benefits to it let me explain to you
what<00:00:43.530> some<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.770> those<00:00:43.950> are<00:00:45.320> so<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> idea<00:00:46.500> was

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
what some of those are so the idea was

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.850 
what some of those are so the idea was
to<00:00:47.070> simplify<00:00:47.730> how<00:00:48.149> one<00:00:48.510> would<00:00:48.750> would<00:00:49.140> lay<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
to simplify how one would would lay a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.830 
to simplify how one would would lay a
simple<00:00:50.550> permaculture<00:00:50.969> design<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.629> their

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
simple permaculture design on their

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.959 
simple permaculture design on their
property<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.410> when<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:52.949> developed<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.760> idea

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
property and when we developed this idea

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.479 
property and when we developed this idea
when<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.750> came<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.020> with<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> idea<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.980> realized

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
when we came up with the idea I realized

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.080 
when we came up with the idea I realized
that<00:00:56.640> there<00:00:56.940> were<00:00:57.059> several<00:00:57.539> benefits<00:00:58.440> to

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
that there were several benefits to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.299 
that there were several benefits to
creating<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.239> program<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:01.500> not<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:01.800> to

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
creating this program it's not just to

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.100 
creating this program it's not just to
assist<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.000> homeowner<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.570> figuring<00:01:04.019> out

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
assist the homeowner and figuring out

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.960 
assist the homeowner and figuring out
what<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.710> their<00:01:05.070> own<00:01:05.220> property<00:01:05.519> in

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
what to do with their own property in

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.240 
what to do with their own property in
permaculture<00:01:06.750> design<00:01:06.930> anytime<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.070> do

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
permaculture design anytime you do

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.330 
permaculture design anytime you do
anything<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.880> want<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.659> minimize<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.890> input

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
anything you want to minimize the input

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.219 
anything you want to minimize the input
maximize<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.479> benefits<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:12.990> what<00:01:13.110> we're

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
maximize the benefits so what we're

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.690 
maximize the benefits so what we're
trying<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.530> create<00:01:13.830> here<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> stacking

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
trying to create here is a stacking

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.630 
trying to create here is a stacking
system<00:01:15.150> if<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.290> homeowner<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:17.220> willing<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
system if the homeowner is willing to

system if the homeowner is willing to
allow<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.909> public<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.390> come<00:01:18.659> along<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.259> to

allow the public to come along and to

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.190 
allow the public to come along and to
walk<00:01:19.830> through<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.250> then<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.540> know<00:01:21.630> 10<00:01:21.869> or<00:01:21.990> 12

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
walk through it then you know 10 or 12

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.560 
walk through it then you know 10 or 12
people<00:01:22.640> can<00:01:23.640> learn<00:01:23.790> what<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.090> do<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.299> their<00:01:24.420> own

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
people can learn what to do in their own

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.179 
people can learn what to do in their own
yard<00:01:24.900> while<00:01:25.170> we're<00:01:25.350> talking<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
yard while we're talking to the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.039 
yard while we're talking to the
homeowner<00:01:27.030> if<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> yard<00:01:27.780> very

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
homeowner if you have a yard very

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.690 
homeowner if you have a yard very
similar<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.439> your<00:01:28.680> neighbors<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.430> hear

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
similar to your neighbors and you hear

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.520 
similar to your neighbors and you hear
everything<00:01:30.119> that's<00:01:30.270> discussed<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.290> see

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
everything that's discussed and can see

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.380 
everything that's discussed and can see
some<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> ideas<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.400> were<00:01:32.729> laid<00:01:32.939> out<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
some of the ideas that were laid out you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.850 
some of the ideas that were laid out you
certainly<00:01:33.689> can<00:01:33.869> apply<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.560> your<00:01:34.710> own

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
certainly can apply that to your own

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.069 
certainly can apply that to your own
yard<00:01:35.130> or<00:01:35.430> your<00:01:35.549> own<00:01:35.670> situation<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.659> that's<00:01:36.869> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
yard or your own situation so that's the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.370 
yard or your own situation so that's the
second<00:01:37.470> benefit<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.100> these<00:01:38.400> walkabouts<00:01:39.350> but<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
second benefit to these walkabouts but a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.870 
second benefit to these walkabouts but a
third<00:01:40.680> thing<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:41.100> do<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.310> if<00:01:41.759> it

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
third thing that we do is if it

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.690 
third thing that we do is if it
encourages<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.960> homeowner<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.799> lay<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
encourages the homeowner to lay the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.240 
encourages the homeowner to lay the
permaculture<00:01:45.570> ideas<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.380> designs<00:01:46.500> onto<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
permaculture ideas and designs onto the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.420 
permaculture ideas and designs onto the
landscape<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.119> minimize<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.560> energy<00:01:49.860> demands

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430

so imagine a place of beauty and your

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.230 
so imagine a place of beauty and your
neighbor<00:02:16.080> creates<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:17.670> tends<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.120> be

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
neighbor creates this it tends to be

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.390

contagious<00:02:18.720> in<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.230> eye<00:02:19.260> my<00:02:19.710> hope<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.370> that

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
contagious in the eye my hope is is that

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.730 
contagious in the eye my hope is is that
putting<00:02:20.970> permaculture<00:02:21.690> ideas<00:02:22.230> on<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.500> ground

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
putting permaculture ideas on the ground

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.280 
putting permaculture ideas on the ground
will<00:02:23.310> encourage<00:02:23.730> other<00:02:24.390> residents<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
will encourage other residents in the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.350 
will encourage other residents in the
community<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.740> even<00:02:25.830> entire<00:02:26.250> villages<00:02:26.730> to

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
community and even entire villages to

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.100 
community and even entire villages to
look<00:02:28.020> at<00:02:28.320> how<00:02:28.950> we<00:02:29.010> use<00:02:29.430> our<00:02:29.640> landscapes<00:02:30.210> so

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
look at how we use our landscapes so

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.390 
look at how we use our landscapes so
there<00:02:31.260> would<00:02:31.380> be<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.500> third<00:02:31.770> benefit<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
there would be a third benefit in the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.670 
there would be a third benefit in the
fourth<00:02:32.700> one<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.180> one<00:02:33.570> that<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.960> think<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.440> worth

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
fourth one and one that I think is worth

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.770 
fourth one and one that I think is worth
mentioning<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.820> in<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.270> permaculture

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
mentioning is that in the permaculture

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.980 
mentioning is that in the permaculture
world<00:02:37.970> there<00:02:38.970> aren't<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.300> many<00:02:39.360> trade

walkabouts<00:02:48.210> will<00:02:48.450> create<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.960> opportunity

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
walkabouts will create the opportunity

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.660 
walkabouts will create the opportunity
whereby<00:02:50.340> they<00:02:50.520> can<00:02:50.730> also<00:02:50.880> make<00:02:51.450> make<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.960> living
