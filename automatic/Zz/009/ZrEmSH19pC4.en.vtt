00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello borough will all you know that 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.150
 I like to react on stupid stuff but 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.660
 who take my head but it's this 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.150
 I will do 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.500
 you see this dress that bend ass 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.040
 take the lead to everyone 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.230
 you can see that finally shit 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.520
 short if you may have seen either 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.350
 black and blue quality either they 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.880
 were yellow and white the explanation 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.180
 you can see it on the internet but 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.769
 I explained to you just the trick of 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.590
 this image can be seen this image 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.920
 I will explain this image I 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.239
 can explain show yourself if you 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.180
 look closely you will tend to 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.579
 see that these gold and white if you 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.469
 move back as far as possible 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.579
 you will see that it tends to be 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.410
 blue and black 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.760
 finally more imaged little more you go 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.980
 to see lip games yeah finally the image 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.500
 a little big for the army but in 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.000
 receding we have this tendency to see if 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.469
 you want to do our test you take 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.510
 a camera I can not film myself 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.489
 not filming my camera 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.699
 filming the screen but if you 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.019
 look through a phone if you 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.400
 are on the computer and you look at your 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.720
 computer through your phone you 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.119
 will see that these blues and blacks 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.560
 but the color red is the color 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.670
 original and blue and black but that one 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.960
 do not care the truth because we are 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.000
 shows a picture and when we are shown 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.170
 a photoshopped photo we are interested in 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.310
 photoshop and not to the original photo 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.070
 because press form 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.729
 we will talk about the image what is 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.979
 actually sees 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.540
 well it's all easy with 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.930
 the pipette tool you will know the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.090
 truth 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.759
 we will take what is supposed to be 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.479
 white or blue we will go there we go 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.360
 take the paint bucket and we have a 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.369
 bluish thing then we do the same 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.140
 for the gold 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.290
 we take the fraud I move back a game recoil 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:48.049
 I can see that it's a little black I 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:51.659
 take I take I take the brush and 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.800
 I trace and we see a bluish and a 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.390
 stuff a little fed up on goose poo 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.920

 who sees blue and black have fake 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.160

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.930
