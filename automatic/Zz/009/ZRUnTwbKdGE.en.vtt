00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.009 

instructions<00:03:36.459> card<00:03:36.730> we're<00:03:37.599> labeling

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
instructions card we're labeling

everything<00:03:38.709> where<00:03:38.859> everything<00:03:39.159> is<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:44.010> a

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
everything where everything is and a

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.860 
everything where everything is and a
little<00:03:45.250> manual<00:03:46.650> quick<00:03:47.650> reference<00:03:48.189> guide<00:03:48.870> so

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
little manual quick reference guide so

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.339 
little manual quick reference guide so
this<00:03:50.079> cost<00:03:50.319> about<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:51.010> think<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.239> was<00:03:52.299> $80<00:03:53.109> I

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
this cost about I think it was $80 I

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.750 
this cost about I think it was $80 I
think<00:03:54.010> it<00:03:54.069> was<00:03:54.189> 81<00:03:54.549> plus<00:03:54.760> shipping<00:03:54.939> and<00:03:56.760> that's

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
think it was 81 plus shipping and that's
