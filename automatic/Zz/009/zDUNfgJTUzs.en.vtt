00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.010 
we've talked about how the fundamentals

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.410 
we've talked about how the fundamentals
of<00:00:12.370> the<00:00:12.490> Christian<00:00:12.820> faith<00:00:13.000> are<00:00:13.210> very

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
of the Christian faith are very

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.629 
of the Christian faith are very
important<00:00:13.930> to<00:00:14.020> establishing<00:00:14.830> just<00:00:15.130> the

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
important to establishing just the

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.580 
important to establishing just the
supernatural<00:00:16.390> aspect<00:00:16.810> of<00:00:16.960> Christianity<00:00:17.500> how

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
supernatural aspect of Christianity how

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.710 
supernatural aspect of Christianity how
important<00:00:18.070> yeah<00:00:18.310> there<00:00:18.550> were<00:00:18.670> five<00:00:19.270> kind<00:00:19.630> of

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
important yeah there were five kind of

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.560 
important yeah there were five kind of
fundamental<00:00:20.520> doctrines<00:00:21.520> or<00:00:21.730> ideas<00:00:22.330> it<00:00:22.510> was

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
fundamental doctrines or ideas it was

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.030 
fundamental doctrines or ideas it was
sent<00:00:22.810> around<00:00:22.900> you<00:00:23.170> know<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.320> inspiration<00:00:23.529> and

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
sent around you know the inspiration and

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.010 
sent around you know the inspiration and
fallibilities<00:00:24.460> of<00:00:24.760> the<00:00:24.880> scriptures<00:00:25.330> the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
fallibilities of the scriptures the

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.840 
fallibilities of the scriptures the
Trinity<00:00:26.530> and<00:00:26.650> deity<00:00:27.039> of<00:00:27.070> Christ<00:00:27.520> the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
Trinity and deity of Christ the

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.450 
Trinity and deity of Christ the
atonement<00:00:28.570> of<00:00:28.600> Christ<00:00:28.900> Christ<00:00:29.770> definite<00:00:30.279> own

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
atonement of Christ Christ definite own

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.280 
atonement of Christ Christ definite own
meant<00:00:30.699> the<00:00:31.119> resurrection<00:00:31.690> of<00:00:31.750> Christ<00:00:31.810> and

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
meant the resurrection of Christ and

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.760 
meant the resurrection of Christ and
ultimately<00:00:32.650> a<00:00:32.770> second<00:00:33.220> coming<00:00:33.720> but<00:00:34.720> it<00:00:35.470> seems

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
ultimately a second coming but it seems

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.140 
ultimately a second coming but it seems
like<00:00:35.920> often<00:00:36.340> the<00:00:36.430> fundamentals<00:00:36.910> are<00:00:37.000> also

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
like often the fundamentals are also

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.299 
like often the fundamentals are also
associated<00:00:37.629> with<00:00:38.050> young<00:00:38.320> Earth<00:00:38.470> Creationism

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
associated with young Earth Creationism

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.430 
associated with young Earth Creationism
was<00:00:39.580> that<00:00:39.790> there<00:00:40.090> at<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.360> beginning<00:00:40.480> or<00:00:41.380> did

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
was that there at the beginning or did

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.010 
was that there at the beginning or did
that<00:00:41.770> come<00:00:41.950> later<00:00:42.130> actually<00:00:42.910> it<00:00:43.030> was<00:00:43.210> not<00:00:43.450> at

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
that come later actually it was not at

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.680 
that come later actually it was not at
all<00:00:44.079> a<00:00:44.260> factor<00:00:44.649> in<00:00:45.130> the<00:00:45.670> original<00:00:46.149> writing<00:00:46.540> of

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
all a factor in the original writing of

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.360 
all a factor in the original writing of
the<00:00:46.809> fundamentals<00:00:47.500> as<00:00:47.739> we<00:00:47.890> mentioned<00:00:48.309> the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
the fundamentals as we mentioned the

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.420 
the fundamentals as we mentioned the
fundamentals<00:00:48.969> were<00:00:49.180> 90<00:00:49.870> essays<00:00:50.380> four<00:00:51.070> or<00:00:51.190> five

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
fundamentals were 90 essays four or five

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.729 
fundamentals were 90 essays four or five
of<00:00:51.700> which<00:00:51.940> directly<00:00:52.809> addressed<00:00:53.290> science

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
of which directly addressed science

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.860 
of which directly addressed science
related<00:00:54.250> issues<00:00:54.670> but<00:00:55.300> in<00:00:55.420> none<00:00:55.600> of<00:00:55.629> those

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
related issues but in none of those

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.020 
related issues but in none of those
essays<00:00:56.379> did<00:00:56.739> the<00:00:56.860> issue<00:00:56.980> of<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:57.399> age<00:00:57.579> of<00:00:57.879> the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
essays did the issue of the age of the

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.810 
essays did the issue of the age of the
earth<00:00:58.180> come<00:00:58.629> up<00:00:58.870> so<00:00:59.559> in<00:00:59.950> no<00:01:00.160> way<00:01:00.399> that<00:01:00.700> the

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
earth come up so in no way that the

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.060 
earth come up so in no way that the
fundamentals<00:01:01.510> essentially<00:01:02.230> support<00:01:02.739> young

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
fundamentals essentially support young

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.070 
fundamentals essentially support young
Earth<00:01:03.250> Creationism<00:01:03.539> that's<00:01:04.539> interesting

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
Earth Creationism that's interesting

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.389 
Earth Creationism that's interesting
because<00:01:05.199> again<00:01:05.440> as<00:01:05.770> I<00:01:05.860> understand<00:01:06.310> the

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
because again as I understand the

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.810 
because again as I understand the
fundamentals<00:01:06.910> are<00:01:06.970> kind<00:01:07.210> of<00:01:07.270> a<00:01:07.360> response<00:01:07.869> to

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
fundamentals are kind of a response to

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.490 
fundamentals are kind of a response to
Darwinism<00:01:09.820> evolution<00:01:10.450> you<00:01:10.570> know<00:01:10.630> yes<00:01:10.960> so<00:01:11.229> even

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
Darwinism evolution you know yes so even

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.859 
Darwinism evolution you know yes so even
in<00:01:11.619> that<00:01:11.649> context<00:01:12.490> there<00:01:12.729> weren't<00:01:13.149> explicitly

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
in that context there weren't explicitly

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.980 
in that context there weren't explicitly
young-earth<00:01:14.770> doctrines<00:01:15.399> no<00:01:16.119> more<00:01:16.509> that<00:01:16.750> God

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
young-earth doctrines no more that God

intervened and was part of the creation
that's<00:01:19.390> correct<00:01:19.780> there<00:01:20.020> were<00:01:20.140> serious

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
that's correct there were serious

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.910 
that's correct there were serious
critiques<00:01:22.600> of<00:01:22.810> Darwinism<00:01:23.619> in<00:01:23.800> the

critiques of Darwinism in the

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.710 
critiques of Darwinism in the
fundamentals<00:01:24.580> but<00:01:25.030> when<00:01:25.179> it<00:01:25.300> came<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.630> the

fundamentals but when it came to the

fundamentals but when it came to the
issue<00:01:25.840> of<00:01:26.080> young<00:01:26.229> earth<00:01:26.410> creationism<00:01:27.240> itself

many of the authors of these essays

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.550 
many of the authors of these essays
actually<00:01:30.940> were<00:01:31.090> old<00:01:31.300> earthers<00:01:31.869> believed<00:01:32.410> in

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
actually were old earthers believed in

actually were old earthers believed in
the<00:01:32.679> de-age<00:01:33.069> theory<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:33.759> so<00:01:33.970> on<00:01:34.149> so<00:01:34.780> instead

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:34.959 
the de-age theory and so on so instead

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:36.779 
the de-age theory and so on so instead
of<00:01:35.200> young<00:01:35.500> earth<00:01:35.649> creationism<00:01:36.310> actually
