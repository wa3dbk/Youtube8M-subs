dropped<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> ground<00:01:34.079> but<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:34.770> still

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
dropped on the ground but it's still

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.920 
dropped on the ground but it's still
spinning<00:01:35.640> right<00:01:35.820> here<00:01:36.030> which<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.570> good<00:01:36.720> that's

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
spinning right here which is good that's

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.550 
spinning right here which is good that's
we<00:01:37.110> want<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:38.490> not<00:01:38.700> push<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
spindle right there or else it will just

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.210 
spindle right there or else it will just
stop<00:01:42.899> spinning<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> don't<00:01:44.100> want

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
