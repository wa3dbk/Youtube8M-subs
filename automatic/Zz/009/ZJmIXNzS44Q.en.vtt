carry it my pocket or my purse and so I

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.020 
carry it my pocket or my purse and so I
know<00:04:53.039> there's<00:04:53.280> a<00:04:53.340> lot<00:04:53.460> of<00:04:53.550> females<00:04:53.850> out<00:04:53.970> there

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
same thing they might want to switch it

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.250 
same thing they might want to switch it
up<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.460> little<00:04:56.490> bit<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:57.000> whether<00:04:57.150> they<00:04:57.270> can<00:04:57.330> you

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
up a little bit to whether they can you

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.590 
up a little bit to whether they can you
know<00:04:58.380> carry<00:04:58.979> it<00:04:59.160> differently<00:04:59.610> that<00:05:00.330> would<00:05:00.479> be

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
know carry it differently that would be

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.480 
know carry it differently that would be
the<00:05:00.750> only<00:05:01.020> critique<00:05:01.500> so<00:05:01.919> to<00:05:01.979> speak<00:05:02.250> but

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
the only critique so to speak but

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.180 
the only critique so to speak but
otherwise<00:05:02.760> I<00:05:03.210> love<00:05:03.660> the<00:05:03.780> color<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:04.470> it's<00:05:05.130> just

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
otherwise I love the color and it's just

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.000 
otherwise I love the color and it's just
a<00:05:05.370> really<00:05:05.580> awesome<00:05:05.930> petite<00:05:06.930> knife<00:05:07.260> now

speaking<00:05:08.550> of<00:05:08.639> color<00:05:08.850> they<00:05:09.690> did<00:05:09.960> this<00:05:10.169> aluminum

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
speaking of color they did this aluminum

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
scales and I'll bring this one up close

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.240 
scales and I'll bring this one up close
and<00:05:13.560> what<00:05:14.460> they<00:05:14.610> call<00:05:14.820> that<00:05:15.000> is<00:05:15.300> a<00:05:15.570> color<00:05:15.990> shift

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
and what they call that is a color shift

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.580 
and what they call that is a color shift
design<00:05:17.250> so<00:05:18.030> as<00:05:18.389> you<00:05:18.750> hold<00:05:18.960> it<00:05:19.169> the<00:05:19.289> way<00:05:19.380> the

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
design so as you hold it the way the

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.740 
design so as you hold it the way the
light<00:05:20.070> kind<00:05:20.430> of<00:05:20.610> beams<00:05:20.880> off<00:05:21.120> it<00:05:21.360> a<00:05:21.419> little<00:05:21.630> bit

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
light kind of beams off it a little bit

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.050 
light kind of beams off it a little bit
it<00:05:22.260> changes<00:05:22.830> color<00:05:23.070> a<00:05:23.220> little<00:05:23.400> bit<00:05:23.610> from<00:05:23.760> black

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
it changes color a little bit from black

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.270 
it changes color a little bit from black
and<00:05:24.449> this<00:05:24.539> one<00:05:24.599> happens<00:05:25.110> to<00:05:25.199> be<00:05:25.380> green<00:05:25.680> and<00:05:25.979> the

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
and this one happens to be green and the

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.360 
and this one happens to be green and the
one<00:05:26.400> Ashley<00:05:26.580> has<00:05:26.910> is<00:05:27.120> black<00:05:27.419> but<00:05:28.169> I<00:05:28.530> really

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
one Ashley has is black but I really

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:36.800 
one Ashley has is black but I really
like<00:05:29.520> that<00:05:29.550> -<00:05:29.880> I<00:05:29.910> like<00:05:30.180> that<00:05:30.300> texture<00:05:34.010> now<00:05:35.010> -<00:05:35.810> to

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
like that - I like that texture now - to

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.330 
like that - I like that texture now - to
touch<00:05:37.020> on<00:05:37.199> that<00:05:37.229> bullet<00:05:37.620> point<00:05:37.830> about<00:05:38.190> the

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
touch on that bullet point about the

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.339 
touch on that bullet point about the
pocket<00:05:38.760> clip<00:05:38.880> I<00:05:39.180> have<00:05:39.240> to<00:05:39.539> agree<00:05:39.750> with<00:05:39.840> Ashley

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
pocket clip I have to agree with Ashley

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.159 
pocket clip I have to agree with Ashley
me<00:05:41.130> personally<00:05:41.699> I<00:05:41.760> like<00:05:41.970> a<00:05:42.150> tip-up<00:05:42.570> carry<00:05:42.930> and

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
me personally I like a tip-up carry and

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.189 
me personally I like a tip-up carry and
I<00:05:43.889> mean<00:05:44.370> everybody's<00:05:44.940> polarized<00:05:45.479> on<00:05:45.780> how<00:05:46.050> they

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
I mean everybody's polarized on how they

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:47.930 
I mean everybody's polarized on how they
want<00:05:46.380> to<00:05:46.440> carry<00:05:46.590> a<00:05:46.740> knife<00:05:46.889> tip<00:05:47.280> up<00:05:47.490> tip<00:05:47.729> down

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
want to carry a knife tip up tip down

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.659 
want to carry a knife tip up tip down
but<00:05:48.599> I<00:05:48.900> don't<00:05:49.470> think<00:05:49.860> it<00:05:49.949> would<00:05:50.070> have<00:05:50.160> been<00:05:50.190> too

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
but I don't think it would have been too

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.330 
but I don't think it would have been too
hard<00:05:50.910> to<00:05:51.300> drill<00:05:52.110> two<00:05:52.320> more<00:05:52.349> holes<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:53.099> thread

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
hard to drill two more holes and thread

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.740 
hard to drill two more holes and thread
them<00:05:53.490> so<00:05:53.699> you<00:05:53.789> could<00:05:53.909> put<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.180> pocket<00:05:54.570> clip

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
them so you could put the pocket clip

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.189 
them so you could put the pocket clip
for<00:05:55.320> our<00:05:55.500> left<00:05:55.650> hand<00:05:55.919> users<00:05:56.310> out<00:05:56.520> there<00:05:57.199> also

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
for our left hand users out there also

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.290 
for our left hand users out there also
for<00:05:58.500> a<00:05:58.530> tip<00:05:58.710> up<00:05:58.889> or<00:05:59.099> tip<00:05:59.280> down<00:05:59.430> carry<00:05:59.820> so<00:06:00.150> that

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
for a tip up or tip down carry so that

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.060 
for a tip up or tip down carry so that
was<00:06:00.419> a<00:06:00.449> very<00:06:00.690> good<00:06:00.960> critique<00:06:01.169> on<00:06:01.620> this<00:06:01.800> blade

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070
