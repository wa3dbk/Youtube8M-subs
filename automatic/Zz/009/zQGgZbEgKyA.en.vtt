00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.530
 and it is with jean-rÃ©my good sense in the absurd government 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.820
 launches a touch pad project in paris euros for students then 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.420
 yes one euro for students is a very good idea to allow and 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.050
 well students to buy themselves and ad tablets was made this morning 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.109
 by laurent vauquiez the principle is quite simple c 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.390
 your shares day for two years for a tablet for a 3g tablet all 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.460
 so for 30 euros per month an offer proposed for the moment only by 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.399
 orange with both builders 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.249
 the call ipad was not two 

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:37.739
 and the samson galaxy tab apart from the psg but it gets me drunk south korea in the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.379
 rush for foreign builders and that's the whole question why the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.130
 government 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.719
 did not he propose an offer that would also include the tablet 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.219
 of French browse this would obviously be a nice promotional tool 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.760
 for it is produced from a france of the flesh side obviously cause 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.010
 today we say rather disappointed by this announcement so there are several 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.750
 explanations 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.399
 we already found the orange side 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.510
 the score has no commercial agreement with their cause 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.329
 there may be another reason that deeper listen to the opinion of this 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.899
 guest of nicolas doze was this morning on bfm business 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.630
 and see it in a much deeper way especially impact 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.180
 committee listened 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.939
 and I find that it has a recurring and historical difficulty 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.489
 of French industry the state remembered the story of the Minitel 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.210
 the course did not vote in France 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.509
 for nathalie stop that we appreciate marketed 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.509
 and we did not say we do not have it in France according to the report 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:27.009
 la France 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.030
 the ddc of these industrial behemoths 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.030
 superb while when you have a capacity for innovation 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.600
 only ap 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.829
 the release should not be surprised 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.509
 that our industrial fabric these smes and pmi often bright often 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.620
 innovative 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.790
 she's gone but I have two ministers 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.260
 that's what's so maybe even more so thanks to a date that the 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.750
 la France 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.150
 the government did not think there was no France 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.750
 the conclusions of the day, it is greece who has chosen among other health 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.360
 public the public finances of greece which you know all about the 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.679
 bankruptcy within two weeks without the sixth slice head 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:00.420
 of the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.380
 help from the european union well the country will have more money then among 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.909
 the proposed ideas brings them together today and that's the one 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.819
 both allow you to smoke cigarettes again 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.269
 in nightclubs to bail out crates but it matters 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.480
 a fee of 203 euros per square meter for smokers so far so bad 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.450
 for the health of the Greeks 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.260
 we sometimes say that the excess of rigor can be a real concert 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.629
 for the economy 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.120
 here I am mercy james murdoch
