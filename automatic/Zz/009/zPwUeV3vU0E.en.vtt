00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
make the pipes you can make item pipes

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.840 
make the pipes you can make item pipes
liquid<00:00:52.110> pipes<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.620> conductive<00:00:53.070> pipes<00:00:53.190> it

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
liquid pipes and conductive pipes it

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.660 
liquid pipes and conductive pipes it
does<00:00:54.210> what<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> name<00:00:54.780> says<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:56.219> item<00:00:56.489> pipe

the<00:01:06.990> pipe<00:01:07.200> waterproofing<00:01:08.090> going<00:01:09.090> gets<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
the pipe waterproofing going gets and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.830 
the pipe waterproofing going gets and
the<00:01:10.590> core<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:12.150> make<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the core and then you can make the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.780 
the core and then you can make the
connective<00:01:13.470> pipe<00:01:13.680> which<00:01:13.950> tell<00:01:14.490> what<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.760> know

connective pipe which tell what you know
power<00:01:15.979> nowadays<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.009> need<00:01:17.369> redstone<00:01:17.880> go<00:01:18.540> in

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
power nowadays you need redstone go in

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.219 
power nowadays you need redstone go in
the<00:01:19.140> corner<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:20.060> from<00:01:21.060> here<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.659> need<00:01:21.990> to

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the corner and from here you need to

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.749 
the corner and from here you need to
make<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.590> control<00:01:23.009> station<00:01:23.630> control<00:01:24.630> station

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
make the control station control station

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.830 
make the control station control station
basically<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.060> allows<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.380> set<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.840> what

basically it allows you to set up what

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.319 
basically it allows you to set up what
number<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.350> want<00:01:31.500> your<00:01:31.710> pipes<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.189> be<00:01:32.329> so

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
number you want your pipes to be so

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.560 
number you want your pipes to be so
let's<00:01:33.479> say<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.720> want<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.229> pipe<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.680> be<00:01:34.770> never

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
let's say I want this pipe to be never

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:45.280 
let's say I want this pipe to be never
LOL<00:01:36.860> and<00:01:37.860> despite<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.090> number<00:01:39.890> 10<00:01:40.890> 20<00:01:42.229> loss

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.580 

now<00:01:46.290> what<00:01:46.439> what<00:01:46.920> we<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.930> you<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.110> need<00:01:49.350> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
now what what we can do is you do need a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.429 
now what what we can do is you do need a
warning<00:01:50.310> pipe<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:51.540> take<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.930> items<00:01:52.200> out<00:01:52.409> of

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
warning pipe to take the items out of

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.260 
warning pipe to take the items out of
the<00:01:52.680> chest<00:01:54.799> now<00:01:55.799> let's<00:01:55.979> see<00:01:56.159> now<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.119> need

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
the chest now let's see now you do need

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.670 
the chest now let's see now you do need
to<00:01:57.390> keep<00:01:57.570> track<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.840> what<00:01:58.110> number<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> pipes

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
to keep track of what number the pipes

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.030 
to keep track of what number the pipes
are<00:01:58.860> okay<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.149> part<00:02:00.390> number<00:02:00.420> 101<00:02:01.290> is

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
are okay so this is part number 101 is

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.270 
are okay so this is part number 101 is
per<00:02:02.340> annum<00:02:02.549> 01<00:02:02.909> 02<00:02:03.530> now<00:02:04.530> let's<00:02:04.710> skip<00:02:04.920> ahead<00:02:05.009> of

station upgrades these essentially allow
you<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.890> make<00:02:19.310> some<00:02:19.760> quantity<00:02:20.299> upgrades<00:02:20.750> which

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
you to make some quantity upgrades which

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.530 
you to make some quantity upgrades which
I'll<00:02:21.650> talk<00:02:21.769> about<00:02:21.829> in<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.099> second<00:02:22.370> these<00:02:23.360> right

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
I'll talk about in a second these right

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.170 
I'll talk about in a second these right
here<00:02:24.069> pretty<00:02:25.069> expensive<00:02:25.430> but<00:02:25.909> you<00:02:26.030> know<00:02:26.150> I

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
here pretty expensive but you know I

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.319 
here pretty expensive but you know I
think<00:02:26.209> it<00:02:26.569> gives<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.840> four<00:02:27.079> so<00:02:27.650> these<00:02:28.400> with

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
on one cannot go to one or two so we

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.610 
on one cannot go to one or two so we

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
teleported one power second away so you

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.460 
teleported one power second away so you
can<00:04:41.130> tell<00:04:41.730> what<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:41.940> hefty<00:04:42.300> amount<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:43.290> what

can tell what a hefty amount and what

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.790 
can tell what a hefty amount and what
I've<00:04:43.620> noticed<00:04:43.830> is<00:04:44.220> that<00:04:44.730> for<00:04:45.060> some<00:04:45.390> reason<00:04:45.800> my

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
I've noticed is that for some reason my

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.050 
I've noticed is that for some reason my
power<00:04:47.220> capacity<00:04:48.030> keeps<00:04:48.390> going<00:04:49.050> up<00:04:49.230> and<00:04:50.060> you

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
power capacity keeps going up and you

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.400 
power capacity keeps going up and you
see<00:04:51.270> right<00:04:51.420> now<00:04:51.450> it's<00:04:51.780> fourteen<00:04:52.230> hundred

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
see right now it's fourteen hundred

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.950 
see right now it's fourteen hundred
thousand<00:04:53.070> a<00:04:53.220> look<00:04:53.610> while<00:04:53.850> goes<00:04:54.270> only<00:04:54.630> nine

thousand a look while goes only nine
ninety<00:04:55.800> thousand<00:04:56.220> it's<00:04:57.090> kind<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.390> strange<00:04:57.720> but

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
ninety thousand it's kind of strange but

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.520 
ninety thousand it's kind of strange but
you<00:04:58.590> know<00:04:59.540> that's<00:05:00.540> how<00:05:00.660> it<00:05:00.780> goes<00:05:00.930> not<00:05:01.290> to<00:05:01.410> make

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530
