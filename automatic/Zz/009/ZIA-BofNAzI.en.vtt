00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.800
 a sister's pocket 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:30.230
 just so and be consistent is that more 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:34.710
 There was nobody that I love enough and 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:40.260
 many of you are the 14 you should win is 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.760
 Of course I'm going to play depends on the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.879
 long as they last 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.340
 so I'm going to get in here on a 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.340
 I'm leaving and I'll be right back 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:13.460
 and returned the team only is this already a 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.140
 map and this map is very difficult only only 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.369
 will deliver and how do the 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.799
 competitors 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:29.290
 let's see if we also have luck 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:29.290
 we havent even found the gaucho 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:51.830
 in the case of law 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:02:02.270
 so this will give you one as you can see 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:04.630
 over there on the left side won gg 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.630
 boy 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:16.540
 there is only one thing that found pvp 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:28.310
 Okay, okay, balloon nut. 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:30.280
 This is not honoring my arden in the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.280
 hell 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.280
 damn 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:48.260
 the aae is in a suck my son of a thousand 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.420
 meters is that in my new rat 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:57.890
 in this case the PV that I will be able to 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:03:06.290
 save only works here now and now 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:10.160
 Also the map I do not know just me 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.830
 I love it, I already want some time 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.400
 bring star wars which channel structure 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.400
 thousand 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.020
 this confusion one more time and I ask 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:31.350
 sorry, it is not bringing 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:34.290
 videos regularly in this huge and I 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.550
 I apologize for that also already thought 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.630
 some time ago 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:42.240
 I thought about bringing a series in which it is not 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:48.750
 nothing new, it's nothing, it's nothing 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:51.180
 innovative because the emtu type a series of 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:04:00.360
 voice and region 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:14.450
 The biggest challenge is , what do I think? 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:14.450
 She's not going to kill the game. 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:22.140
 is talking and stopping 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.150
 but then I 'll say year I was to 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.080
 leave without it they could 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:31.410
 likes cn challenge suggestions 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.920

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.670
 Dredge is not me I'll try to bring as is 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.500
 obvious 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.480
 I'll even try to bring it in because it's a 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.480
 series that was really doing 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.060
 calm calm calm 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:56.510

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.940

 portables of printouts about sharing and 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.490
