00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.880
 hi to all the reasons of the sixteenths vi 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.449
 I explain why immediately why some 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.430
 students asked me for this video 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.640
 precisely because they have difficulty in 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.290
 play the panthers in sixteenths then 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.719
 how to play them well 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.989
 here's the answer is this start 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.360
 slowly with the sixteenths up 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.739
 charleston not using accents 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.840
 clearly like a single cash hit 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.840
 and easy easy snare drum 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.600
 the shots must all be the same and 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.149
 then we begin to put the accents on the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.320
 sixteenths then the first exercise with 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:02:02.500
 the accents and with the first and third 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:02:05.440
 sixteenth the effect in this third 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.190
 exercise is to put the 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:32.920
 accents on the third sixteenth and the effect 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:35.940
 is this how much exercise is that of 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:03:01.900
 put the accents on the second and fourth 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:03:05.920
 the sixteenth and the effect will come thus the 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:09.400
 fifth if I am not mistaken exercise is that of 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:33.390
 put the emphasis on how much sixteenth 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:38.080
 and effect will come so here are these 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:41.769
 at least the exercises that allow you 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.790
 then to play the sixteenths well then 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.920
 I recommend the first one slowly 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.780
 exercise is the most important one are 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.780
 the sixteenths without the accents 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.760
 then we repeat now I will do a roundup 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.980
 with all that we have isolated 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.980
 the accents change to the wall 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:21.730
 I'm done now I'll have to go in 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.940
 hospital and then study the plan 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.200
 floor these are the sixteenths mi 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.950
 I recommend 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.950
 hello everyone
