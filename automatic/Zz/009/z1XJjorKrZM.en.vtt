00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
you can take a villains gone now Dave

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
you can take a villains gone now Dave
you're<00:01:47.820> talking<00:01:47.970> about<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.210> tornado<00:01:48.479> with<00:01:48.659> a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
you're talking about that tornado with a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.219 
you're talking about that tornado with a
302<00:01:49.380> mile-per-hour<00:01:49.649> winds<00:01:50.280> back<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.990> 1999<00:01:51.990> was

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
302 mile-per-hour winds back in 1999 was

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.840 
302 mile-per-hour winds back in 1999 was
it<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.829> also<00:01:53.189> what<00:01:53.490> happened<00:01:53.790> to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
it and so this is also what happened to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.999 
it and so this is also what happened to
more<00:01:54.060> which<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.990> same<00:01:55.140> day<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.439> epicenter

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
more which is the same day the epicenter

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.679 
more which is the same day the epicenter
same<00:01:56.250> town<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.210> suburb<00:01:57.509> of

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
same town this was just a suburb of

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.899 
same town this was just a suburb of
Oklahoma<00:01:58.350> City<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.219> historically<00:01:59.729> has

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
Oklahoma City and that historically has

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.190 
Oklahoma City and that historically has
been<00:01:59.969> kind<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> benchmark<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
been kind of the benchmark of the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.410 
been kind of the benchmark of the
strongest<00:02:01.530> tornado<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.969> one<00:02:03.180> looks

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
strongest tornado and and this one looks

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.389 
strongest tornado and and this one looks
like<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.869> could<00:02:04.079> rival<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.770> terms<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.189> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
like it could rival that in terms of the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.130 
like it could rival that in terms of the
the<00:02:05.430> wind<00:02:05.909> speeds<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> size<00:02:06.659> like<00:02:06.930> there's

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the wind speeds of the size like there's

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.590 
the wind speeds of the size like there's
a<00:02:07.200> fire<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.799> get<00:02:07.950> worried

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
a fire to get worried

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.780 
a fire to get worried
the<00:02:09.200> scene<00:02:09.380> just<00:02:09.410> leave<00:02:09.980> pictures<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.610> course

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
the scene just leave pictures of course

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.670 
the scene just leave pictures of course
which<00:02:11.060> we<00:02:11.270> see<00:02:11.510> happen<00:02:11.840> when<00:02:12.230> storms<00:02:12.560> like

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
which we see happen when storms like

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.320 
which we see happen when storms like
this<00:02:12.710> in<00:02:12.950> tornadoes<00:02:13.340> go<00:02:13.550> through<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.880> just<00:02:14.240> the

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
this in tornadoes go through it just the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.430 
this in tornadoes go through it just the
staggering<00:02:14.720> thing<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.960> think<00:02:15.110> when<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.260> see<00:02:15.410> a

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
staggering thing I think when you see a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.050 
staggering thing I think when you see a
storm<00:02:15.680> like<00:02:15.830> this<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:16.220> there<00:02:16.430> one<00:02:16.640> second

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
storm like this it's there one second

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.670 
storm like this it's there one second
it's<00:02:17.240> gone<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.480> within<00:02:17.930> seconds<00:02:18.350> look<00:02:18.500> at<00:02:18.620> the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
it's gone and within seconds look at the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.410 
it's gone and within seconds look at the
devastation<00:02:18.800> left<00:02:19.280> behind<00:02:19.520> these<00:02:20.090> are<00:02:20.210> moving

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
devastation left behind these are moving

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.850 
devastation left behind these are moving
about<00:02:20.570> 40<00:02:20.900> miles<00:02:21.050> an<00:02:21.260> hour<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.650> course

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
about 40 miles an hour and of course

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.080 
about 40 miles an hour and of course
when<00:02:22.070> you<00:02:22.190> think<00:02:22.400> about<00:02:22.460> it<00:02:22.640> where<00:02:22.850> there<00:02:23.030> are

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
when you think about it where there are

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.730 
when you think about it where there are
schools<00:02:23.360> our<00:02:23.540> neighborhoods<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.560> that's

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
schools our neighborhoods and so that's

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.900 
schools our neighborhoods and so that's
that<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.190> tough<00:02:25.460> will<00:02:25.610> see<00:02:25.790> that

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
that is a tough will see that

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.980 
that is a tough will see that
neighborhood<00:02:26.330> right<00:02:26.480> there<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.630> subdivision

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
neighborhood right there a subdivision

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.800 
neighborhood right there a subdivision
looks<00:02:27.380> like<00:02:27.470> all<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.710> see<00:02:27.890> are<00:02:27.920> just<00:02:28.220> the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
looks like all you see are just the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.000 
looks like all you see are just the
foundations<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.930> homes<00:02:30.170> which<00:02:30.440> is<00:02:30.590> typical<00:02:30.980> of

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
foundations of homes which is typical of

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.500 
foundations of homes which is typical of
a<00:02:31.100> tornado<00:02:31.520> coming<00:02:31.730> through<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:32.060> area<00:02:32.330> and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
a tornado coming through that area and

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.360 
a tornado coming through that area and
remember<00:02:33.140> yesterday<00:02:33.590> in<00:02:33.650> Shawnee<00:02:33.950> Oklahoma

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
remember yesterday in Shawnee Oklahoma

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.400 
remember yesterday in Shawnee Oklahoma
not<00:02:34.610> too<00:02:34.670> far<00:02:35.060> from<00:02:35.090> there<00:02:35.360> they<00:02:35.450> had<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.810> line

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
not too far from there they had a line

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.110 
not too far from there they had a line
of<00:02:36.560> thunderstorms<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:37.160> tornadoes<00:02:37.700> spawn<00:02:37.940> out

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
of thunderstorms and tornadoes spawn out

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.190 
of thunderstorms and tornadoes spawn out
of<00:02:38.210> them<00:02:38.330> yesterday<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.930> worst<00:02:39.110> part

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
of them yesterday and the worst part

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.410 
of them yesterday and the worst part
about<00:02:39.410> Oklahoma<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.310> that<00:02:40.790> they<00:02:41.000> have<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.150> very

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
about Oklahoma is that they have a very

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.480 
about Oklahoma is that they have a very
sandy<00:02:41.750> soil<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:42.590> they<00:02:42.710> have<00:02:42.860> no<00:02:42.890> basements

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
sandy soil and so they have no basements

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.980 
sandy soil and so they have no basements
we<00:02:43.610> always<00:02:43.940> talk<00:02:44.120> here<00:02:44.330> in<00:02:44.390> Michigan<00:02:44.750> about

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
we always talk here in Michigan about

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.870 
we always talk here in Michigan about
going<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.440> basement<00:02:45.620> but<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.520> will<00:02:46.670> see

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
going to the basement but you will see

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.340 
going to the basement but you will see
some<00:02:47.150> of<00:02:47.240> these<00:02:47.300> neighborhoods<00:02:47.750> where<00:02:47.960> it's

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
some of these neighborhoods where it's

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.380 
some of these neighborhoods where it's
literally<00:02:48.800> just<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:49.280> chunk<00:02:49.580> of<00:02:49.790> cement<00:02:49.910> left

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
literally just a chunk of cement left

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.450 
literally just a chunk of cement left
and<00:02:50.630> there<00:02:50.750> is<00:02:50.870> absolutely<00:02:51.500> everything<00:02:52.160> gone

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
and there is absolutely everything gone

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.330 
and there is absolutely everything gone
that<00:02:52.790> is<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:54.020> platform<00:02:54.890> for<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.190> house

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
that is the the platform for the house

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.640 
that is the the platform for the house
the<00:02:55.820> slab<00:02:56.090> but<00:02:56.810> everything<00:02:57.110> is<00:02:57.230> gone<00:02:57.410> because

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
the slab but everything is gone because

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.560 
the slab but everything is gone because
they<00:02:57.800> can't<00:02:58.250> build<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.760> basement<00:02:59.210> with<00:02:59.420> the

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
they can't build a basement with the

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.410 
they can't build a basement with the
unstable<00:02:59.960> soil<00:03:00.350> there<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:01.490> there<00:03:01.760> are<00:03:02.090> lots<00:03:02.270> of

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
unstable soil there so there are lots of

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.850 
unstable soil there so there are lots of
times<00:03:02.570> you're<00:03:02.750> about<00:03:02.900> storm<00:03:03.230> shelters<00:03:03.620> they

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
times you're about storm shelters they

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.080 
times you're about storm shelters they
might<00:03:04.010> have<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.190> shelter<00:03:04.610> that<00:03:04.730> they'll<00:03:04.910> go<00:03:05.030> to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
kind of thing underground but typically
