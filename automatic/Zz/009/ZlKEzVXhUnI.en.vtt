00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
level all season long I don't think

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.269 
level all season long I don't think
that's<00:01:29.450> difficult<00:01:29.779> these<00:01:30.560> guys<00:01:30.770> are<00:01:31.009> used<00:01:31.189> to

00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:31.279 
that's difficult these guys are used to

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:33.399 
that's difficult these guys are used to
playing<00:01:31.520> much<00:01:31.789> longer<00:01:32.270> seasons<00:01:32.719> so<00:01:33.109> when<00:01:33.289> they

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
playing much longer seasons so when they

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.529 
playing much longer seasons so when they
come<00:01:33.619> to<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.919> US<00:01:34.249> the<00:01:34.549> seasons<00:01:34.969> only<00:01:35.149> three<00:01:35.479> or

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539

come to the US the seasons only three or
four<00:01:35.749> months<00:01:35.929> so<00:01:36.319> so<00:01:36.979> that<00:01:37.219> won't<00:01:37.459> be<00:01:37.549> a

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:37.669 
four months so so that won't be a

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:40.149 
four months so so that won't be a
problem<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:38.599> on<00:01:38.719> top<00:01:38.959> of<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.169> there's

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
problem and on top of that there's
