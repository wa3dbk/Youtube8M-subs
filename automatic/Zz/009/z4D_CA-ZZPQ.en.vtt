00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
glue cotton to the bottom of the jar it

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.210 
glue cotton to the bottom of the jar it
just<00:02:29.990> kind<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.290> covers<00:02:30.650> all<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.950> silver<00:02:31.340> parts

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
and there I've covered the bottom of the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.550 
and there I've covered the bottom of the
jar<00:02:38.740> our<00:02:39.740> next<00:02:40.040> step<00:02:40.220> is<00:02:40.490> to<00:02:40.520> add<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.030> balls

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
jar our next step is to add the balls

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.449 
jar our next step is to add the balls
into<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.950> clear<00:02:43.160> part<00:02:43.550> of<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.730> jar<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:45.800> this

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
into the clear part of the jar and this

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.760 
into the clear part of the jar and this
stuff<00:02:46.760> gets<00:02:47.090> everywhere<00:02:47.300> so<00:02:48.140> be<00:02:48.290> careful<00:02:48.650> when

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
stuff gets everywhere so be careful when

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.220 
stuff gets everywhere so be careful when
you<00:02:48.890> open<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.370> because<00:02:49.850> it<00:02:50.150> gets<00:02:50.300> staticky<00:02:50.570> and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
you open it because it gets staticky and

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.770 
you open it because it gets staticky and
it<00:02:51.320> gets<00:02:51.470> stuck<00:02:51.800> to<00:02:51.860> things<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.240> flies<00:02:53.540> out

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
it gets stuck to things and it flies out

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:15.140 
it gets stuck to things and it flies out
easily<00:02:54.350> it's<00:02:54.709> just<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:55.910> messy<00:02:56.480> substance

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.539 

our<00:03:16.150> last<00:03:16.569> step<00:03:16.989> is<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.849> screw<00:03:18.849> on<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.239> lid<00:03:19.450> and

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
our last step is to screw on the lid and

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.470 
our last step is to screw on the lid and
that's<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.730> easy<00:03:21.909> part

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
that's the easy part

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.360 
that's the easy part
you<00:03:22.629> just<00:03:22.900> put<00:03:23.349> on<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.500> lid<00:03:23.769> and<00:03:24.040> screw<00:03:24.159> it

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
you just put on the lid and screw it

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.150 
you just put on the lid and screw it
tight<00:03:27.930> then<00:03:28.930> once<00:03:29.230> you're<00:03:29.379> ready<00:03:29.410> turn<00:03:30.010> it

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
tight then once you're ready turn it

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.350 
tight then once you're ready turn it
over<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.489> let<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.910> snow<00:03:31.150> fall<00:03:32.819> very<00:03:33.819> simple

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
over and let the snow fall very simple

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.220 
over and let the snow fall very simple
very<00:03:34.720> easy<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.560> looks<00:03:35.590> so<00:03:36.190> pretty
