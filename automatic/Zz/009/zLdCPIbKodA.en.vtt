your kitty stats and they dropped out
the<00:00:54.210> fatigue<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.199> now<00:00:55.410> your<00:00:55.770> speed

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the fatigue and so now your speed

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.610 
the fatigue and so now your speed
instead<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:57.170> counteracting<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.230> fatigue

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
instead of counteracting the fatigue

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.369 
instead of counteracting the fatigue
actually<00:00:59.160> counts<00:01:00.000> for<00:01:00.300> your<00:01:00.600> initiative

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
actually counts for your initiative

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.830

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
modifier essentially so that your

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.630 
modifier essentially so that your
kitties<00:01:04.470> are<00:01:04.619> fighting<00:01:05.070> more<00:01:05.189> frequently
