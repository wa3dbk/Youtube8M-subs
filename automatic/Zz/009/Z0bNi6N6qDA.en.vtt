 nature becomes a real 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.520
 business 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.370
 it has its own capital and can 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.930
 offer its services to users 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.780
 everywhere on the planet accounting 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.430
 of these services started without the forest 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.439
 Amazonian no rain so no 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.580
 of agriculture in south america so 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.730
 no agricultural economy 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:26.279
 this service was estimated at 240 billion 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.560
 of dollars in the years in the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.269
 oceans there are coral reefs 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.240
 when you can see they are everywhere 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.780
 on the globe micronesia to indonesia

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.480
 these red dots provides the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.340
 food to half a billion 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.480
 people an eighth of humanity 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.040
 scientists tell us that the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.760
 carbon levels the atmosphere are 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.050
 too high 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.120
 it endangers the survival of these reefs 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.950
 over the years by 25 facts become 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.650
 the planetary guru of the economy of the 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.090
 biodiversity economists are trying to 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.399
 convince humans of the importance 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.409
 of this capital calculated the value 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.780
 monetary nature has become the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.799
 fight of his life 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.890
 he also measured himself well 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.700
 ecosystem that quantify the losses 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.009
 overall 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.850
 at the risk of making nature a 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.850
 ordinary goods 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.540
 weary every year the loss of value and 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.659
 $ 2 to $ 4 trillion 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.970
 that is to say between 2 and 4 million 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.200
 millions of dollars 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.670
 it's almost the same order as the 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.970
 losses we suffered during the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.710
 financial crisis of 2008 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.810
 this shows us how much these losses 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.979
 are important 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.479
 yet they are invisible because 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.280
 that we do not count this capital when it 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.560
 disappears whether it's a forest or a 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.570
 swamp we do not count his losses because 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.950
 we do not count the income these assets 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.030
 are invisible 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.160
 it's still the same problem 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.160
 the economic invisibility of nature
