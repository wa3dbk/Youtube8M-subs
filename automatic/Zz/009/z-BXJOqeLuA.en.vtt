00:00:11.728 --> 00:00:13.232
 What happens? 

00:00:15.372 --> 00:00:17.218
 It seems that... 

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:19.726
 When everything is going well in my life ... 

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:22.590
 ... I'm afraid of losing it. 

00:00:24.058 --> 00:00:25.862
 I really love you. 

00:00:27.311 --> 00:00:28.652
 What does he want? 

00:00:32.304 --> 00:00:33.820
 Someone... 

00:00:33.923 --> 00:00:35.381
 Someone! 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:37.621
 Someone help us !!! 

00:00:40.588 --> 00:00:41.925
 What's going on? 

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:44.614
 I think of you every minute. 

00:00:45.493 --> 00:00:48.204
 I think I can still feel you. 

00:00:49.217 --> 00:00:51.599
 The problem with you is that you still think you are real. 

00:00:51.747 --> 00:00:56.561
 Everything is up here. If you want to move something, you have to move it with your mind. 

00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:02.111
 Molly. Why can not you hear me? 

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.855
 - Who's there? - Can you hear? 

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:08.930
 - Sam Wheat! Say my name! Sam! - Leave me alone! 

00:01:09.484 --> 00:01:13.066
 - Hello - I have a message from Sam 

00:01:13.408 --> 00:01:17.601
 - What? - Sam Wheat. He asked me to call. 

00:01:17.548 --> 00:01:21.106
 He wants you to go to the police. He says it was a trap. That he was murdered 

00:01:21.292 --> 00:01:25.596
 - She says Sam knows who killed him. - Are you crazy? What are you going to tell the police? 

00:01:25.597 --> 00:01:27.210
 She knew things. Private things. 

00:01:27.345 --> 00:01:30.746
 Be the green underwear that has your name written. 

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:34.090
 This "psychic" has a long history. 

00:01:34.413 --> 00:01:36.191
 You do not see it? I'm not a fraud! 

00:01:36.392 --> 00:01:38.354
 I do not know what is real anymore. 

00:01:38.981 --> 00:01:41.999
 Do not open molly. Do not open the damn door. He is a murderer. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.717
 Why are you doing this to me? Did you hear me? Why are you doing this to me?! 

00:01:47.196 --> 00:01:48.875
 Sam is dead. 

00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:51.454
 - Tell her I love her. - He says he loves you. 

00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:54.066
 Sam would never say that. 

00:01:54.067 --> 00:01:59.003
 You must take all your rage, all your love, all your hate and then make it explode. 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.303
 Molly? 

00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:02.872
 Molly ... you're in danger 

00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:07.034
 Assassin 

00:02:08.264 --> 00:02:08.854
 YOU 

00:02:11.572 --> 00:02:12.208
 DO YOU BELIEVE? 

00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:20.109
 Oh God... 

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:23.613
 Ghost
