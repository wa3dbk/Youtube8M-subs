00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
like the rest by here my hair in the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.270

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
back is a little bit softer and then my

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.120 
back is a little bit softer and then my
hand<00:03:24.520> front<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.599> like<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.500> rest<00:03:26.709> of<00:03:26.830> my<00:03:26.950> hair

whatever<00:03:28.110> isn't<00:03:29.110> as<00:03:29.620> course<00:03:30.459> I<00:03:30.790> mean<00:03:31.030> isn't<00:03:31.330> as

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
whatever isn't as course I mean isn't as

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:39.380 
whatever isn't as course I mean isn't as
soft<00:03:32.250> so<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.849> can<00:03:34.800> get<00:03:35.800> away<00:03:35.950> with<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:38.170> know

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
soft so I can get away with you know

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:46.309 
soft so I can get away with you know
braiding<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.660> trying<00:03:41.049> to<00:03:41.140> keep<00:03:41.350> a<00:03:42.000> style<00:03:44.519> with

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
braiding and trying to keep a style with

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.520 
braiding and trying to keep a style with
that<00:03:47.319> here<00:03:48.000> because<00:03:49.000> it's<00:03:49.540> coarser<00:03:50.049> and<00:03:50.319> it

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
that here because it's coarser and it

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.050 
that here because it's coarser and it
will<00:03:50.680> hold<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:52.360> style<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:53.260> know<00:03:53.790> it'll<00:03:54.790> hold

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
will hold the style you know it'll hold

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.940 
will hold the style you know it'll hold
the<00:03:55.269> curl<00:03:55.630> or<00:03:55.870> whatever<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.790> pattern<00:03:58.680> but<00:03:59.680> my

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
the curl or whatever the pattern but my

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:13.920 
the curl or whatever the pattern but my
hair<00:04:00.340> on<00:04:03.599> the<00:04:04.599> sides<00:04:06.030> is<00:04:07.030> not<00:04:07.569> as<00:04:12.600> there's<00:04:13.600> not

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
hair on the sides is not as there's not

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:24.230 
hair on the sides is not as there's not
as<00:04:16.829> much<00:04:17.829> to<00:04:18.010> do<00:04:18.190> both<00:04:19.169> it's<00:04:20.169> not<00:04:20.470> as<00:04:20.739> on<00:04:22.530> course

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
as much to do both it's not as on course

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
as much to do both it's not as on course
and<00:04:25.289> so<00:04:26.289> I<00:04:26.830> have<00:04:27.430> an<00:04:27.580> issue<00:04:27.900> we're<00:04:28.900> trying<00:04:29.169> to

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
and so I have an issue we're trying to

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.890 
and so I have an issue we're trying to
hold<00:04:29.410> a<00:04:29.530> style<00:04:30.960> because<00:04:32.880> it<00:04:33.880> doesn't<00:04:34.720> want<00:04:34.840> to

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
hold a style because it doesn't want to
