I've<00:01:32.290> already<00:01:32.530> done<00:01:32.920> this<00:01:33.159> a<00:01:33.610> little

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
I've already done this a little

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.969 
I've already done this a little
horizontal<00:01:34.420> engine<00:01:35.049> it's<00:01:35.170> also<00:01:35.350> got<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:35.680> spool

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
horizontal engine it's also got a spool

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.920 
horizontal engine it's also got a spool
valve<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:36.579> that's<00:01:36.729> I<00:01:36.909> think<00:01:37.150> in<00:01:37.420> eight<00:01:37.540> parts

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
valve and that's I think in eight parts

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.749 
valve and that's I think in eight parts
that's<00:01:38.110> already<00:01:38.380> in<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.680> can<00:01:38.890> so<00:01:39.159> you<00:01:39.220> that

prototypes<00:01:55.509> now<00:01:55.720> it's<00:01:55.869> not<00:01:56.079> ready<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.500> go<00:01:56.649> but

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
prototypes now it's not ready to go but

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.609 
prototypes now it's not ready to go but
there'll<00:01:57.520> be<00:01:57.549> a<00:01:58.210> video<00:01:58.570> on<00:01:59.079> all<00:01:59.740> brass<00:02:00.189> engine

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
there'll be a video on all brass engine

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.200 
there'll be a video on all brass engine
possibly<00:02:02.619> a<00:02:02.950> different<00:02:03.310> version<00:02:03.460> of<00:02:03.729> this<00:02:03.909> and

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
possibly a different version of this and

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.600 
possibly a different version of this and
that<00:02:04.240> will<00:02:04.840> also<00:02:05.020> be<00:02:05.290> a<00:02:05.320> detailed<00:02:05.740> build<00:02:06.159> so

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
that will also be a detailed build so

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.359 
that will also be a detailed build so
watch<00:02:07.509> for<00:02:07.540> that<00:02:07.950> probably<00:02:08.950> during<00:02:09.220> the

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
watch for that probably during the
