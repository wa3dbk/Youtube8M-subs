00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.960
 welcome to life here I bring you 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.270
 news about the next software already 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.309
 that the magazine the game informer has 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.400
 unveiled that there is going to be a new 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.230
 version the next number of this 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.539
 publication of the game informer 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.390
 will deal with this new delivery of the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.179
 epic saga and for the moment it has only 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.329
 unveiled the cover of the number that is 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.910
 what we see on the screen and good 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.100
 a figure handcuffed from being escorted 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.770
 by two guards of the CG while the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.880
 background you see a city burn and you can 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.220
 observe locus so good 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.360
 and as you know, I try to inform you of 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.250
 all the news 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.320
 of the games that we handle in the channel 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.900
 now we are with minecraft and software 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.810
 only so I wanted to inform you of 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.540
 this news and well just also 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.690
 ramble a bit about the next one and 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.930
 software would tell us that it's going to be the 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.380
 software 4 no no because it would not be the 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.040
 but yes I think it would be a 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.040
 new edition as there was hello 3 and 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.280
 then there were halo reach and other versions 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.570
 of hello although it was not halo 4 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.509
 likewise I would say that it is the software 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.460
 is going to have this new edition I do not expect 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.890
 that is software 4 but yes a 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.369
 special and good edition that could 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.050
 try would say that I the idea that would 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.759
 would do it about the wars of the 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.790
 pendulum but on the cover this one that 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.550
 we see in the lower part you can 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.860
 clearly observe that there is locust like this 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.270
 that it's not going to be from the wars of 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.050
 pendulum since the claws of the pendulum 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.979
 they were only between humans so good 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.030
 wandering and looking a little at the 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.170
 historical chronology 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.570
 and software in the first game the 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.360
 first delivery starts 14 years 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.470
 after the day of the emergency or 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.479
 the invasion locus was the day of the 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.600
 emergency and are 14 years later when 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:06.350
 starts so I would say it can be 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.330
 another afternoon the events of the day of 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.390
 the emergency could be although good 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.520
 equally among the other deliveries that 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.340
 there were already software there are also gaps 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.989
 of time because yes or war 2 for example 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.090
 occurs six months after the 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.120
 software containment 1 so also 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.060
 it could be some story in between 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.519
 equally since software 3 take place 18 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.950
 months after the events of 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.600
 the second delivery although good as 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.330
 we see in the image a character is seen 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.730
 chained that is very likely to be 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.440
 marcus when he was arrested as the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.350
 first delivery 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.960
 Saleh that frames are freeing you from 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.210
 the jail is worth and that's why I would say it is 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.600
 very very very likely that the story of 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.100
 this new software is about the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.530
 story that happened before now 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.260
 software is not very likely but good 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.810
 As I tell you, there is nothing confirmed 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.510
 have said that in the in the event 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.520
 e3 is going to show the trailer and the 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.410
 name of this new game so good 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.260
 try to inform you also as soon as 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.100
 know something of 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.350
 as i tell you 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.700
 the e3 is next week so 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.770
 we will simply have to wait and 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.870
 know it but well I wanted to inform you already 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.970
 I like that you are well informed 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.540
 in the channel so well just 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.700
 was that and good to start your 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.380
 musings and theories that will 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.200
 go the story of the new delivery of 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.910
 software because there are many people too 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.460
 who says that that character could be 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.520
 griffin who is a character that came out in 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.140
 plaster war 3 and well there are many 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.650
 theories but I have told you more or 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.740
 except mine I would say it is a delivery 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.680
 that will go from the previous story to the 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.600
 of tsia software uno but as I say 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.170
 there is nothing confirmed so good 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.120
 simply with this I say goodbye 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.920
 and I want to have them well informed as 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.810
 you already know software and minecraft in 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.090
 This channel is going to have everything so 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.400
 well just tell you that we 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.349
 we will see in future videos like if 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.870

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:12.520
