00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.680 
interesting thing about these two phones
is<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.610> galaxies<00:00:12.000> make<00:00:12.179> up<00:00:12.210> from<00:00:12.540> where

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
is that the galaxies make up from where

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.509 
is that the galaxies make up from where
I<00:00:12.719> live<00:00:13.200> it's<00:00:13.650> almost<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.130> little<00:00:14.280> bit<00:00:14.370> more

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
big ok I mean first of all the display

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.750 
big ok I mean first of all the display
is<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.649> little<00:00:37.710> bit<00:00:37.920> bigger<00:00:38.129> here<00:00:38.219> at<00:00:38.399> six<00:00:38.579> point

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
is a little bit bigger here at six point

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.700 
is a little bit bigger here at six point
four<00:00:38.879> inches<00:00:39.180> six<00:00:39.510> foot<00:00:39.629> three<00:00:39.660> inch<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.559> then

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
four inches six foot three inch but then

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.010 
four inches six foot three inch but then
again<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> design<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.180> all<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.510> it's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
again with the design and all that it's

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.260 
again with the design and all that it's
even<00:00:43.379> bigger<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:44.250> what<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.059> this

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
even bigger like what the is this

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.049 
even bigger like what the is this
like<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:45.809> space<00:00:46.170> down<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:47.610> should

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
like this space down here you should

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.139 
like this space down here you should
move<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.300> that's<00:00:49.079> annoying<00:00:49.910> then<00:00:50.910> they<00:00:51.000> also

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
move that that's annoying then they also

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.209 
move that that's annoying then they also
have<00:00:51.329> lot<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.570> space<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:52.020> they<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.949> some

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
have lot of space up here they have some

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.180 
have lot of space up here they have some
fat<00:00:53.579> borders<00:00:54.329> there<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.809> side<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.469> also

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
fat borders there on side with that also

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.369 
fat borders there on side with that also
something<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.730> phone<00:00:56.910> has<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.320> you

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
something that this phone has and if you

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.349 
something that this phone has and if you
take<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> look<00:00:58.680> at<00:00:58.829> them<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.850> design

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
take a look at them here in the design

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.360 
take a look at them here in the design
after<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.500> see<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.160> is

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
after you can see that this one is

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.740 
after you can see that this one is
definitely<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.059> little<00:01:03.149> bit<00:01:03.239> more<00:01:03.480> slimmer

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
definitely a little bit more slimmer

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.960 
definitely a little bit more slimmer
it's<00:01:04.379> more<00:01:04.530> rounded<00:01:04.920> off<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.729> then<00:01:05.880> again

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
it's more rounded off but then again

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.140 
it's more rounded off but then again
this<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.570> not<00:01:06.810> waterproof

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
this one is not waterproof

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.550 
this one is not waterproof
this<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.330> doesn't<00:01:09.750> come<00:01:09.990> with<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.260> also

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
this one doesn't come with this also

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.510 
this one doesn't come with this also
normally<00:01:11.130> display<00:01:11.689> as<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:13.110> would<00:01:13.409> get<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
normally display as we would get on the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.660 
normally display as we would get on the
galaxy<00:01:15.180> s4<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> rs5<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:17.070> has<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> little

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
galaxy s4 like the rs5 it has a little

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.490 
galaxy s4 like the rs5 it has a little
bit<00:01:17.759> worse<00:01:18.090> viewing<00:01:18.810> angle<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> little<00:01:19.320> bit

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
bit worse viewing angle a little bit

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.359 
bit worse viewing angle a little bit
like<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> galaxy<00:01:21.290> galaxy<00:01:22.290> s4<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.920> active

like the galaxy galaxy s4 like active
smartphone<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:24.780> as<00:01:24.869> good<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.439> only<00:01:25.560> do

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
smartphone it's not as good it's only do

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.310 
smartphone it's not as good it's only do
chorim<00:01:26.250> put<00:01:26.369> some<00:01:26.580> gigahertz<00:01:27.110> still<00:01:28.110> runs

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
chorim put some gigahertz still runs

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.440 
chorim put some gigahertz still runs
pretty<00:01:28.500> good<00:01:28.619> though<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.340> something<00:01:30.240> can

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
pretty good though and something can

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.890 
pretty good though and something can
take<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> higher<00:01:30.930> price<00:01:31.229> because<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:32.900> they've

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
take a higher price because of they've

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.249 
take a higher price because of they've
been<00:01:34.140> doing<00:01:34.259> great<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> past<00:01:36.049> but<00:01:37.049> I

really<00:01:37.500> don't<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:38.159> recent<00:01:38.670> problem<00:01:38.909> I

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
really don't see a recent problem I

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.600 
really don't see a recent problem I
would<00:01:39.270> buy<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.540> one<00:01:39.960> over<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:41.189> one<00:01:41.250> this

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
would buy this one over this one this

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.010 
would buy this one over this one this
one<00:01:41.790> feels<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.360> breathe<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:43.439> breathe

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
one feels and breathe just breathe

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.859 
one feels and breathe just breathe
quality<00:01:46.020> okay<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.369> thin<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.180> it's

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
quality okay it's so thin it's it's

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.440 
quality okay it's so thin it's it's
almost<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.380> joke<00:01:49.680> how<00:01:50.430> thin<00:01:50.880> they<00:01:51.299> can

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
almost like a joke how thin they can

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.240 
almost like a joke how thin they can
make<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.689> device<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.680> probably<00:01:53.009> because

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
make this device it's probably because

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.859 
make this device it's probably because
the<00:01:53.399> other<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.880> little<00:01:54.119> bumped<00:01:54.390> down<00:01:54.420> here

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
the other is little bumped down here

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.840 
the other is little bumped down here
that<00:01:55.170> makes<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:56.130> they<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.430> make<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> little

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
that makes it so they can make a little

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.410 
that makes it so they can make a little
bit<00:01:56.939> thinner

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
bit thinner

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.149 
bit thinner
I've<00:01:57.479> been<00:01:57.719> putting<00:01:58.020> water<00:01:58.439> on<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.860> device

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
I've been putting water on this device

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.609 
I've been putting water on this device
and<00:01:59.219> it<00:02:00.090> still<00:02:00.299> seems<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> be<00:02:00.719> working<00:02:01.290> great

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
and it still seems to be working great

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.609 
and it still seems to be working great
which<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.159> also<00:02:02.549> very<00:02:02.909> very<00:02:03.360> cool<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:04.229> have<00:02:04.530> an

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
which is also very very cool you have an

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.249 
which is also very very cool you have an
equal<00:02:04.950> piece<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.280> shooter<00:02:05.640> here<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.750> also<00:02:06.930> do

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
equal piece of shooter here you also do

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.120 
equal piece of shooter here you also do
get<00:02:07.500> an<00:02:07.619> apron

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
get an apron

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.210

so<00:02:08.280> shooter<00:02:08.730> on<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.030> galaxy<00:02:10.020> mega<00:02:10.290> and<00:02:10.800> I

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
so shooter on the galaxy mega and I

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.670 
so shooter on the galaxy mega and I
might<00:02:11.430> go<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> little<00:02:11.850> bit<00:02:12.120> more<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.600> depth<00:02:12.870> in

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
might go a little bit more in depth in

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.330 
might go a little bit more in depth in
depth<00:02:14.490> in<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.600> future<00:02:16.080> if<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.860> guys<00:02:17.010> are

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
that but there is probably like even

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.390 
that but there is probably like even
though<00:02:43.800> it's<00:02:43.920> bigger<00:02:44.220> like<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:45.420> can<00:02:45.540> use<00:02:45.930> it

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
though it's bigger like you can use it

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.560 
though it's bigger like you can use it
I'm<00:02:47.400> not<00:02:47.520> sure<00:02:47.610> if<00:02:47.700> there<00:02:47.850> is<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:47.970> bigger<00:02:48.240> phone

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
I'm not sure if there is a bigger phone

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.840 
I'm not sure if there is a bigger phone
out<00:02:48.780> there<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.080> mean<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:50.010> one<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.460> really

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
out there I mean this one is really

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.420 
out there I mean this one is really
really<00:02:51.150> good<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.750> many<00:02:52.290> many<00:02:52.470> ways<00:02:52.590> one<00:02:53.250> thing

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
really good in many many ways one thing

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.560 
really good in many many ways one thing
is<00:02:53.550> a<00:02:53.610> little<00:02:53.790> bit<00:02:53.880> annoying<00:02:54.030> here<00:02:54.390> though<00:02:54.540> I

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
is a little bit annoying here though I

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.960 
is a little bit annoying here though I
would<00:02:55.050> say<00:02:55.320> is<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.190> display<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.850> a

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
would say is that the display is a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.940 
would say is that the display is a
little<00:02:57.000> bit<00:02:57.390> too<00:02:57.600> much<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:58.470> can<00:02:58.620> see<00:02:58.770> yourself

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
little bit too much you can see yourself

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.490 
little bit too much you can see yourself
a<00:02:59.400> little<00:02:59.520> bit<00:02:59.700> too<00:02:59.850> much<00:03:00.290> it's<00:03:01.290> like

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
a little bit too much it's like

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.560 
a little bit too much it's like
reflecting<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.220> little<00:03:02.280> bit<00:03:02.460> too<00:03:02.550> much<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.000> now

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
reflecting a little bit too much and now

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.000 
reflecting a little bit too much and now
if<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:04.020> not<00:03:04.140> at<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.500> highest<00:03:04.650> brightness

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
if this is not at the highest brightness

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.280 
if this is not at the highest brightness
and<00:03:05.460> I<00:03:05.520> still<00:03:05.730> I'm<00:03:06.120> almost<00:03:06.660> satisfied<00:03:07.080> with

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
and I still I'm almost satisfied with

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.440 
and I still I'm almost satisfied with
this<00:03:07.410> compared<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.100> AMOLED<00:03:08.460> display<00:03:08.820> that

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
this compared to the AMOLED display that

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.950 
this compared to the AMOLED display that
this<00:03:10.050> is<00:03:10.380> very<00:03:10.950> very<00:03:11.310> very<00:03:11.540> vibrating<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.750> just

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
this is very very very vibrating it just

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.210 
this is very very very vibrating it just
shines<00:03:13.500> up

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
shines up

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.880 
shines up
I<00:03:14.250> like<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.270> super<00:03:15.750> super<00:03:15.900> much<00:03:16.200> versus<00:03:16.680> this

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
I like that super super much versus this

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.810 
I like that super super much versus this
display<00:03:17.340> here<00:03:17.520> on<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:18.050> on<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.620> Sony<00:03:20.430> device

rounded<00:03:42.180> off<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.450> sign<00:03:42.720> even<00:03:42.990> though<00:03:43.230> it

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530
