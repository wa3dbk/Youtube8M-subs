 d knowledge 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.830
 I met mediaeval

 530 him 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.830
 I do not want to know the project soon I'm just looking inside the being 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.260
 human 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.340

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.210
 this person that it emits than its sound air 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.730
 the image 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.730
 and all one-year settings 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.960
 It's mental through this cable time 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.100
 I think the al-assad image through pcr information 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.880
 the pc for those who do not know 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.800
 The one in my hand. 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.800
 is the board said and repeat printed 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.479
 here we will have a basic knowledge of the printed circuit board 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.100
 test only liedson 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.100
 the printed circuit board is placed here 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.680
 is placed 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.290
 embedded flex sending general information 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.720
 claude lurks 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.640
 and external 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.150

 despres 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.870
 here is the rotisserie 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.540
 the image 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.459
 and the information 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.589
 let's meet now 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:12.799
 a little 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.899

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.879
 let's take the carcass score 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.679
 Let's now do the reconnaissance 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:35.029
 of the sony ericsson printed circuit board 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.319
 say 530 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.629
 jamal a plate that is already a device 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.209
 new that being on the market is not a device and cultured past 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:50.749
 We have to introduce you now. 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.939
 some things 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.209
 but this recognition 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.279
 in general 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.279
 we have here 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:03.229
 in this region dengue 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:05.859
 Bad boy culture here 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.949
 After that I'm yours. 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.209
 if your mandate on the mount 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.599
 one side out here is the docking of the hotel chips 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.549
 on this chip and I have all the information here 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.169
 causes a cell number 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.520
 it's all right 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.939
 stored your calendar 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.809
 inside this piece milk 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:33.089
 that only work your gsm 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:36.169
 that your gsm only works 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.269
 if you have this part here that your number is stored here 

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:43.429
 what the cadastre 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.089
 after doing a knowledge lesson on a gps 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.179
 Let's move on to something that matters more than the circuit board 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:53.379
 printed 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.959
 that the plate 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.889
 of the cell phone 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.479
 we have here 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.169
 contained we showed to you 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.529
 on here 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:09.529
 As I already told you. 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.079
 is the site connector 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.400
 is one of these Josue
