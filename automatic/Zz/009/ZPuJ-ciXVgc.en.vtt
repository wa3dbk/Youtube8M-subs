00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.880 
energy prepared for the semi now like
all<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.279> dancers<00:00:32.669> usually<00:00:33.149> saying<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:34.050> did

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
all the dancers usually saying we did

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.430 
all the dancers usually saying we did
like<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.629> the<00:00:36.930> middle<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
like we on on the middle of the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.260 
like we on on the middle of the
competition<00:00:38.010> yet<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:38.489> did<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> half<00:00:38.940> and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
competition yet so we did the half and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.919 
competition yet so we did the half and
now<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.739> second<00:00:40.739> half<00:00:40.770> left<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.460> feels<00:00:42.449> good

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:42.929 
now the second half left so feels good

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.340 
now the second half left so feels good
now<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.800> first<00:00:44.489> second<00:00:45.059> half<00:00:45.449> will<00:00:45.780> come<00:00:45.989> so

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
now the first second half will come so

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.459 
now the first second half will come so
the<00:00:46.829> first<00:00:47.039> half<00:00:47.249> is<00:00:47.399> quite<00:00:47.640> quite<00:00:48.089> slow<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.600> we

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the first half is quite quite slow so we

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.649 
the first half is quite quite slow so we
have<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.769> we<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.249> wait<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.269> quite<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.480> long

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
have to we have to wait for quite a long

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.060 
have to we have to wait for quite a long
time<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.109> now<00:00:52.199> we'll<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.469> fast<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.800> think

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
time and now we'll be fast I think

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.869 
time and now we'll be fast I think
okay<00:00:54.059> last<00:00:54.329> year<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.929> Hungary<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:56.370> two<00:00:56.640> came

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
okay last year in Hungary you two came

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.200 
okay last year in Hungary you two came
very<00:00:57.210> very<00:00:57.359> close<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:58.559> came<00:00:58.800> also<00:00:59.249> very<00:00:59.670> very

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
very very close you came also very very

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.460 
very very close you came also very very
close<00:01:00.659> in<00:01:00.929> in<00:01:01.379> Vienna<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.309> that's

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
close in in Vienna and that's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.300 
close in in Vienna and that's
mathematically<00:01:04.470> would<00:01:05.990> basically<00:01:07.310> indicate

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
mathematically would basically indicate

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.040 
mathematically would basically indicate
that<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:09.300> going<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.600> happen<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.990> time

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
that it's going to happen this time

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.550 
that it's going to happen this time
around

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
around

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.950 
around
yeah<00:01:10.950> well<00:01:11.190> mathematically<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:12.420> doesn't<00:01:12.810> work

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
yeah well mathematically it doesn't work

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.740 
yeah well mathematically it doesn't work
in<00:01:13.140> our<00:01:13.229> dancing<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.420> was<00:01:15.600> work

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
in our dancing so if it was work

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.020 
in our dancing so if it was work
mathematically<00:01:16.409> maybe<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:16.979> could<00:01:17.159> win<00:01:17.310> also<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
mathematically maybe we could win also a

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.480 
mathematically maybe we could win also a
bit<00:01:18.329> earlier<00:01:18.630> already<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.710> anyway<00:01:20.070> hopefully

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
bit earlier already but anyway hopefully

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.060 
bit earlier already but anyway hopefully
this<00:01:20.850> year<00:01:21.149> mathematics<00:01:21.719> goes<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.680> our

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
this year mathematics goes in our

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.870 
this year mathematics goes in our
direction<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.299> will<00:01:24.360> work<00:01:24.659> out<00:01:24.869> good

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
direction so it will work out good

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.300 
direction so it will work out good
important<00:01:26.880> we<00:01:27.149> do<00:01:27.450> our<00:01:27.719> best<00:01:27.990> show<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
important we do our best show the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.050 
important we do our best show the
audience<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.329> judges<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.789> deserve<00:01:32.789> what

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
audience and judges that we deserve what

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.660 
audience and judges that we deserve what
they<00:01:33.570> decide<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.200> deserve<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.950> I'm<00:01:35.399> sure

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
they decide we deserve and I'm sure

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.300 
they decide we deserve and I'm sure
we're<00:01:35.969> gonna<00:01:36.119> get<00:01:36.689> as<00:01:36.930> much<00:01:37.079> pleasure<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.039> we

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
we're gonna get as much pleasure as we

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.170
