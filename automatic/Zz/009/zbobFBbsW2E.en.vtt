have been asking me how I do my eyebrows

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.410 
have been asking me how I do my eyebrows
I<00:00:03.870> did<00:00:04.110> have<00:00:04.290> a<00:00:04.319> video<00:00:04.710> about<00:00:04.859> them<00:00:05.370> about<00:00:06.089> two

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
I did have a video about them about two

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.179 
I did have a video about them about two
years<00:00:06.569> ago<00:00:06.750> but<00:00:07.200> since<00:00:07.410> then<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:07.560> have<00:00:07.799> gotten<00:00:08.130> a

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
years ago but since then I have gotten a

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.700 
years ago but since then I have gotten a
new<00:00:08.309> camera<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:09.139> lighting<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.590> everything

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
new camera and lighting and everything

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.530 
new camera and lighting and everything
like<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.460> figured<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.849> would<00:00:11.969> just<00:00:12.000> do<00:00:12.330> a

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
like that so I figured I would just do a

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.509 
like that so I figured I would just do a
new<00:00:12.990> video<00:00:13.259> all<00:00:13.380> together<00:00:13.559> especially<00:00:13.950> that

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
new video all together especially that

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
tweezing it away that way it's less

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.410 
tweezing it away that way it's less
painful<00:01:10.740> then<00:01:11.580> if<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.760> pull<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.060> by<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.270> end

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
painful then if you pull it by the end

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.330 
painful then if you pull it by the end
you<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.020> want<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.350> kind<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> step<00:01:13.770> back<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
see the results you don't want to just

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.960 
see the results you don't want to just
keep<00:01:16.770> plucking<00:01:17.009> because<00:01:17.340> sometimes<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.850> can

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
keep plucking because sometimes you can

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.940 
keep plucking because sometimes you can
/<00:01:18.210> pluck<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.630> it'll<00:01:19.049> be<00:01:19.229> really<00:01:19.470> thin<00:01:19.799> so

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
/ pluck it and it'll be really thin so

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.289 
/ pluck it and it'll be really thin so
you<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.130> want<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> take<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.490> step<00:01:20.790> back<00:01:20.970> every

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
you just want to take a step back every

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.910 
you just want to take a step back every
once<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.689> while<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.140> see<00:01:22.560> how<00:01:22.590> what<00:01:22.830> it

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
once in a while and see how what it

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.499 
once in a while and see how what it
looks<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.189> from<00:01:23.310> farther<00:01:23.610> away<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.240> then<00:01:24.390> if

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
looks like from farther away and then if

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.060 
looks like from farther away and then if

going to go in and fill in the eyebrows

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.150 
going to go in and fill in the eyebrows
a<00:03:08.420> little<00:03:08.570> bit<00:03:08.900> more<00:03:09.110> so<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.470> pencil<00:03:09.800> is<00:03:09.890> just

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
a little bit more so the pencil is just

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.810 
a little bit more so the pencil is just
to<00:03:10.430> kind<00:03:11.300> of<00:03:11.510> give<00:03:11.570> you<00:03:12.500> that<00:03:12.710> basic<00:03:13.250> shape<00:03:13.580> so

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
to kind of give you that basic shape so

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.240 
to kind of give you that basic shape so
that<00:03:13.850> way<00:03:14.150> it's<00:03:14.330> not<00:03:14.450> as<00:03:14.630> hard<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:15.350> draw<00:03:15.680> with

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
that way it's not as hard to draw with

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.970 
that way it's not as hard to draw with
the<00:03:16.430> powder<00:03:16.670> but<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:18.200> powder<00:03:18.410> looks<00:03:18.710> a<00:03:18.830> lot

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
the powder but the powder looks a lot

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.740 
the powder but the powder looks a lot
more<00:03:19.040> natural<00:03:19.730> than<00:03:19.850> a<00:03:19.910> pencil<00:03:20.180> does<00:03:20.570> so

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
more natural than a pencil does so

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.720 
more natural than a pencil does so
that's<00:03:20.930> why<00:03:21.110> I<00:03:21.140> like<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.560> use<00:03:21.770> this<00:03:22.040> more<00:03:22.370> and
