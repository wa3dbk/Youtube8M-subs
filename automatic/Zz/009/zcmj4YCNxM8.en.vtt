as<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> rock<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.969> those<00:01:09.690> seeds<00:01:09.960> were<00:01:10.110> roasted

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
as a rock and those seeds were roasted

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.740 
as a rock and those seeds were roasted
historically<00:01:11.070> by<00:01:11.369> settlers<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> Midwest

historically by settlers in the Midwest

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.590 
historically by settlers in the Midwest
and<00:01:13.020> turned<00:01:13.740> into<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.010> very<00:01:14.610> poor<00:01:14.909> substitute

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
and turned into a very poor substitute

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.080 
and turned into a very poor substitute
for<00:01:15.630> coffee<00:01:16.380> hence<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.460> name<00:01:17.580> Kentucky

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
for coffee hence the name Kentucky

ornamental for the landscape it's very
drought<00:01:21.960> tolerant<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.619> therefore<00:01:23.159> was<00:01:23.640> a

drought tolerant and therefore was a

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.670 
drought tolerant and therefore was a
very<00:01:24.270> good<00:01:24.450> tree<00:01:24.630> along<00:01:24.990> Street<00:01:25.290> settings

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
very good tree along Street settings

to<00:01:28.409> grow<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.670> bark<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.000> also<00:01:30.299> very<00:01:30.479> distinct

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
to grow the bark is also very distinct

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.170 
to grow the bark is also very distinct
it<00:01:31.560> reminds<00:01:31.860> me<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.100> lot<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.549> black<00:01:32.790> cherry

it reminds me a lot of a black cherry

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.260 
it reminds me a lot of a black cherry
but<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> much<00:01:33.659> lighter<00:01:33.960> gray<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.560> color<00:01:35.270> it's

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
but a much lighter gray in color it's

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.710 
but a much lighter gray in color it's
scaly<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:40.340> tends<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.580> break<00:01:42.000> away<00:01:42.180> from<00:01:42.299> the
