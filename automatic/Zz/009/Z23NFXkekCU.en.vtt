first tight end they have to scroll down

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.270 
first tight end they have to scroll down
a<00:02:05.880> little<00:02:06.000> bit<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.899> find<00:02:07.110> Jason<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.649> witness<00:02:08.099> he

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
a little bit to find Jason a witness he

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.850 
a little bit to find Jason a witness he
only<00:02:08.459> caught<00:02:08.789> eight

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
only caught eight

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.170 
only caught eight
and<00:02:09.979> then<00:02:10.340> we're<00:02:10.490> going<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.640> have<00:02:10.789> to<00:02:10.910> scroll

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
and then we're going to have to scroll

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.990 
and then we're going to have to scroll
that<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.420> lot<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:12.650> find<00:02:12.920> Rob<00:02:13.160> Gronkowski

that a lot to find Rob Gronkowski

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.370 
that a lot to find Rob Gronkowski
because<00:02:14.810> he<00:02:14.990> only<00:02:15.230> caught<00:02:15.680> four<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.870> there<00:02:18.050> he

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
because he only caught four so there he

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.650 
because he only caught four so there he
is<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:19.310> again<00:02:19.610> in<00:02:19.790> terms<00:02:19.940> of<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.240> touchdown
