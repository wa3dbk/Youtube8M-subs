we're<00:00:16.710> looking<00:00:16.800> at<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.100> CD<00:00:17.400> MP<00:00:18.230> 7000<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:19.769 
we're looking at this CD MP 7000 so the

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.679 
we're looking at this CD MP 7000 so the
CDJ<00:00:20.160> 700<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.759> our<00:00:20.849> top-of-the-line<00:00:21.089> media

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
CDJ 700 is our top-of-the-line media

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.120 
CDJ 700 is our top-of-the-line media
player<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.050> what<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.289> wanted<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.589> do<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.980> we

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
player and what we wanted to do is we

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.740 
player and what we wanted to do is we
wanted<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.460> get<00:00:23.970> an<00:00:24.089> all-in-one<00:00:24.449> solution

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
wanted to get an all-in-one solution

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.890 
wanted to get an all-in-one solution
that<00:00:25.560> combined<00:00:25.949> our<00:00:26.130> really<00:00:26.900> advanced

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
that combined our really advanced

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.450 
that combined our really advanced
features<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.169> the<00:00:28.320> CGI<00:00:28.589> 700<00:00:29.039> put<00:00:29.369> an

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
features in the CGI 700 put an

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.700 
features in the CGI 700 put an
all-in-one<00:00:29.910> workstation<00:00:30.810> ok<00:00:31.050> ok<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.410> this

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
all-in-one workstation ok ok so this

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.280 
all-in-one workstation ok ok so this
essentially<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.400> C<00:00:32.600> dmp-7000<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.690> to

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
essentially the C dmp-7000 is to

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.529 
essentially the C dmp-7000 is to
separate<00:00:34.829> CDJ<00:00:35.220> 7<00:00:35.520> hundredths<00:00:35.969> with<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
separate CDJ 7 hundredths with a

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.189 
separate CDJ 7 hundredths with a
built-in<00:00:36.960> mixer<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:38.219> that's<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.390> with<00:00:40.020> that

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
built-in mixer so that's and with that

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.410 
built-in mixer so that's and with that
built-in<00:00:40.410> maker<00:00:40.710> with<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> 700<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.120> know

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
built-in maker with the 700 you know

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.630 
built-in maker with the 700 you know
again<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.750> got<00:00:42.899> 2<00:00:43.020> CD<00:00:43.320> slots<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.280> love<00:00:44.520> it

again you got 2 CD slots and I love it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.490 
again you got 2 CD slots and I love it
the<00:00:44.730> USB<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.449> kind<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.660> technology<00:00:45.960> just

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
the USB this kind of technology just

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.770 
the USB this kind of technology just
can't<00:00:46.710> beat<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.100> then<00:00:47.430> an<00:00:47.550> SD<00:00:47.940> card<00:00:48.210> as<00:00:48.359> well

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
can't beat and then an SD card as well

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.660 
can't beat and then an SD card as well
you<00:00:48.840> got<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.199> as<00:00:49.320> well<00:00:49.530> ok<00:00:49.829> cool<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.430> then<00:00:50.519> tell

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
you got it as well ok cool and then tell

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.979 
you got it as well ok cool and then tell
us<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.789> little<00:00:50.850> bit<00:00:51.000> more<00:00:51.149> about<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.480> mixer<00:00:51.899> if

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
us a little bit more about this mixer if

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.180 
us a little bit more about this mixer if
you<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.350> mixer<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.800> three<00:00:53.010> channel

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
you so the mixer is a three channel

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.790 
you so the mixer is a three channel
analog<00:00:53.699> mixer<00:00:54.090> um<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.690> has<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> bunch

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
analog mixer um it has a we have a bunch

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.290 
analog mixer um it has a we have a bunch
of<00:00:55.920> connectivity<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.489> back<00:00:56.730> let's<00:00:57.120> take<00:00:57.269> a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300
