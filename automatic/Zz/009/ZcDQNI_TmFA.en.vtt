what I did with the previous one and
this<00:03:41.590> is<00:03:41.710> basically<00:03:42.100> how<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.340> do<00:03:42.520> overlapping

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210

hair<00:03:43.630> as<00:03:43.900> you<00:03:43.990> can<00:03:44.140> see<00:03:44.260> though<00:03:44.410> that<00:03:44.680> I<00:03:44.710> need

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
hair as you can see though that I need

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.110 
hair as you can see though that I need
to<00:03:44.980> connect<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.370> hair<00:03:45.520> because<00:03:45.850> it's<00:03:46.030> the

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
to connect the hair because it's the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.430 
to connect the hair because it's the
same<00:03:46.300> as<00:03:46.420> a<00:03:46.450> black<00:03:46.630> line<00:03:46.810> so<00:03:47.020> sometimes<00:03:47.350> I

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
same as a black line so sometimes I

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.130 
same as a black line so sometimes I
don't<00:03:47.500> have<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.740> do<00:03:47.860> that<00:03:47.980> but<00:03:48.960> it's<00:03:49.960> pretty

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
don't have to do that but it's pretty

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.680 
don't have to do that but it's pretty
easy<00:03:50.350> shit<00:03:50.710> it's<00:03:51.010> not<00:03:51.100> that<00:03:51.460> hard<00:03:51.640> but<00:03:52.450> you

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
ahead and draw a few lines do you I'm

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.850 
ahead and draw a few lines do you I'm
going<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.030> show<00:05:15.210> you<00:05:15.300> guys<00:05:15.389> a<00:05:15.449> trick<00:05:15.860> normally

when<00:05:16.979> people<00:05:17.010> shade<00:05:17.490> they<00:05:17.849> work<00:05:18.120> left<00:05:18.900> to

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
when people shade they work left to

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.110 
when people shade they work left to
right<00:05:19.289> I<00:05:19.440> mean<00:05:19.669> common<00:05:20.669> knowledge

right I mean common knowledge
growing<00:05:21.750> up<00:05:21.930> you<00:05:22.199> work<00:05:22.440> left<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:22.919> right<00:05:23.010> you

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
growing up you work left to right you

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.779 
growing up you work left to right you
never<00:05:23.490> work<00:05:23.789> backwards<00:05:24.349> but<00:05:25.789> strangely

never work backwards but strangely

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.820 
never work backwards but strangely
enough<00:05:26.909> it<00:05:27.510> actually<00:05:27.930> helps<00:05:28.289> to<00:05:28.470> shade

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
enough it actually helps to shade

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.680 
enough it actually helps to shade
backwards<00:05:29.789> I'm<00:05:30.060> going<00:05:30.240> to<00:05:30.300> show<00:05:30.419> you<00:05:30.510> what<00:05:30.630> I

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
side that do this brilliant shading on

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.740 
side that do this brilliant shading on

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
then the lights going to be like this

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.150 
then the lights going to be like this
and<00:06:20.240> as<00:06:20.390> you<00:06:20.540> can<00:06:20.660> see<00:06:20.720> I<00:06:21.110> can<00:06:21.350> actually<00:06:21.770> see

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
the lines so I can actually see where to

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.380 
the lines so I can actually see where to
move<00:06:25.250> and<00:06:26.380> it<00:06:27.380> works<00:06:28.250> as<00:06:28.430> far<00:06:28.670> back<00:06:28.880> as<00:06:28.940> I<00:06:29.210> want

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 
move and it works as far back as I want

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.040 
move and it works as far back as I want
to<00:06:29.450> go<00:06:29.570> I<00:06:29.600> can<00:06:29.960> keep<00:06:30.140> doing<00:06:30.410> it<00:06:30.500> this<00:06:30.590> way<00:06:32.050> since

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
to go I can keep doing it this way since

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.290 
to go I can keep doing it this way since
there's<00:06:33.320> like<00:06:33.470> a<00:06:33.500> bit<00:06:33.740> of<00:06:33.860> a<00:06:34.040> swoosh<00:06:34.640> going<00:06:35.150> on

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
there's like a bit of a swoosh going on

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.690 
there's like a bit of a swoosh going on
with<00:06:35.510> the<00:06:35.600> hair<00:06:38.800> so<00:06:39.800> the<00:06:40.100> shading<00:06:40.460> will<00:06:40.550> look

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
with the hair so the shading will look

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.620 
with the hair so the shading will look
artistically<00:06:41.330> retarded<00:06:41.870> dumb<00:06:43.450> makes<00:06:44.450> no

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
artistically retarded dumb makes no

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:50.980 
artistically retarded dumb makes no
sense<00:06:46.690> see<00:06:47.690> that<00:06:47.870> looks<00:06:48.800> like<00:06:49.030> dick<00:06:50.030> but<00:06:50.390> you
