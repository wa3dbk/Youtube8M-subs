00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.650
 I remembered from C sharp minor 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:10.520
 the same fingering that I used to do 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:14.690
 smaller if I run it two spaces towards 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.910
 up I'm left as the chord of the do 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.980
 sustained minor we will notice that a 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.700
 As we move forward in the 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.340
 chords 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.680
 become easier to type by 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.420
 two reasons because the closer to 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.420
 Half of the rope is 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.780
 softer is going to be the rope as well 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.170
 a taut wire is much softer 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.660
 in the middle of the wire 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.269
 and points because the frets are going 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.500
 shrinking or the first space is 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.449
 much larger than the eighth 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.690
 space then the hand has to be 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.609
 more closed I'm more in everything in the 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.219
 arm much closer to the body that is 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:58.329
 It is much more natural and also the rope 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:01.920
 is at least tense the counter is that if 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.920
 I have to join with a chord 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.170
 opened the balance much higher but 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.900
 in later videos we will practice 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.900
 these links do sharp minor 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.650
 the three of two fingers of another 24 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.950
 simulating reduced from two in 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.840
 the fifth space and the index finger 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.840
 covers first rope 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.350
 it's important as we go 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.880
 finding with chords more and more more 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.280
 difficult to remove that require more 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.579
 force the fact of maintaining a 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.310
 balance between the two hands if I do not 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.590
 I want to do a lot of strength with my hand 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.990
 left 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.500
 it is essential that you do not press too much 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.300
 strong with my right hand because 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.160
 because the right hand is the one that puts in 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.150
 move the rope if the rope is 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.240
 move a lot 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.550
 to keep her firm behind behind 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.840
 done I will need a lot of strength 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:14.700
 so if I do very little force 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:19.110
 Soft impulse can make the test the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.980
 sub string sounds clearly to low 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.629
 volume but it clearly sounds 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.489
 if I do with the same force 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.879
 and strong pulse the string stops ringing 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:34.330
 because because it has so much energy 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:36.400
 movement of the agreement that collides 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.720
 the fret and empty for the sound 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.239
 immediately then what is it that 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.680
 we have to do try to get 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.360
 a firm position and soft press e 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.620
 try to silence my audience 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.519
 when he is listening to me and typing with 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.519
 firm the streams
