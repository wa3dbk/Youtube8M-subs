00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.209 
we did sous-vide this right up to 130
degrees<00:00:54.319> so<00:00:55.319> the<00:00:55.440> whole<00:00:55.559> thing's<00:00:55.829> been<00:00:55.949> cooked

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
to 130 didn't lose much liquid and now

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.680 
to 130 didn't lose much liquid and now
we're<00:00:59.100> gonna<00:00:59.219> toss<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.670> onto<00:00:59.909> the<00:00:59.999> grill<00:01:00.239> it's

we're gonna toss it onto the grill it's
cooled<00:01:01.050> all<00:01:01.260> right<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.460> actually

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
cooled all right so we can actually

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.210 
cooled all right so we can actually
crisp<00:01:03.179> up<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.510> outside<00:01:03.680> without<00:01:04.680> affecting
