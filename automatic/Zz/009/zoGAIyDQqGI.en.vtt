00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.600
 people are hissing at 80 hd I hope that 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.189
 you are doing something else in this way 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.890
 for christmas vidot on the chain a 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.590
 new review we go to detox review 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.630
 bbva so we start with the pistolero 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.099
 louis soares team version of the season 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.270
 you have statins and who expects to 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.559
 other fashion shows I invite you to 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.300
 pause or challenge 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.690
 back to better observe at the level of 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.130
 team 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.600
 I played them in three teams 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.559
 different then there you are loire 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.600
 it's the team that I found 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.660
 was really the best alone in 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.120
 tip but otherwise I also played them at 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.520
 two scorers and hasten it and that's 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.160
 really single in tip that I find 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.620
 that he's the best at these 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.170
 range between 1 million 500 thousand and 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.880
 2 million 400 thousand on xbox 3 million 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.760
 hundred thousand 4 million 700 thousand on 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.530
 playstation and your super expensive but that's it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.259
 we talk about a player still at 96.2 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.049
 general it's after messi and ronaldo 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.310
 this is the player with robben totti he 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.920
 Here are some of the best players 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.380
 of the game behind the messiah and the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.659
 cristiano ronaldo in their different 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.639
 versions so that's it's one of 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.960
 monsters the game is really very very 

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:23.159
 good and 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.860
 there are still some improvements 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.600
 compared to version 2d of a form 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.830
 this is the 93.2 general version because 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.990
 I did the review there is still 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.460
 a lot of improvements we feel 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.400
 improve your shots and 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.600
 this is the only flaw I found at 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.590
 louis soares so it's not in the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.610
 negative points etc 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.050
 but still have to specify it on the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.090
 most of the games I did with 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.490
 I felt a kind of script then 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.869
 I do not know paranoia or anything else 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.369
 really felt one finally when I 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.619
 playing with I really struggled 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.539
 especially in fact already the guards the 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.490
 most guards were transformed 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.500
 monsters mode ie that 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.600
 I scored a lot of goals with 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.920
 I could have noticed a lot more 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.259
 because I came across guards 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.940
 coming out of the stops that caen since 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.440
 the beginning tifa I had no limit not seen 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.890
 stuff like that and it's true that 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.750
 it was quite disturbing and there are 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.269
 moments where I came across a 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.400
 match for example or not there was a 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.989
 fellaini in front of ballous fellaini 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.360
 catch up with him suarez at the level of the 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.830
 speed and so it's clear that time 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.560
 in time it still poses a lot of 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.410
 problems bah to play with such 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.700
 player also the teams with whom 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.570
 I found that I was doing it 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.420
 rebalance I still had 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.340
 a lot of all in the teams so 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.840
 we will now move to the positive point 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.040
 because that's what interests us the 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.250
 more so at the level of kicks 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.019
 arrested the penalties 97 years penalty 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.630
 free kicks 80 18 years precision of 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.549
 free kicks with 1.99 in effect and 1.96 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.590
 in hitting power the free kicks 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.450
 far away with it's just perfect already 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.370
 old versions of the evening and 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.260
 I really liked the costs 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.880
 free kicks with him so there with 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.760
 stats like you can not imagine what 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.650
 point it's monstrous the strikes I 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.410
 all encompass because here's 99 in 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:09.660
 finish 99 indeed 97 soar 98 in 93 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.640
 cut with 1.96 in hitting power 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.140
 well here's what the keys strikes her 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.120
 very very good with him you can score 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.829
 from just about any position 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.709
 although as I mentioned 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.930
 previously I felt a kind of 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.489
 script at the level of the strikes 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.450
 this is not the strike that started badly this 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.560
 are the guards who made the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.940
 let's get there at the right time I say that we 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.140
 sees the guardian who is there there are 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.070
 moments when the gardians became 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.889
 guards of fifa 15 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.120
 but it's true that from time to time that 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.160
 pose is still a lot of problems 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.540
 technical mans 99 in dribbling game 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.139
 with the 4 stars technical gesture it is 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.919
 madness 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.459
 physically it's a tank here 90 in 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.680
 strength 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.880
 96 in agility 82 years relaxing he takes 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.019
 balloon head he has a good 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.889
 accuracy in the air 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.510
 besides, I put them in their own 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.739
 positive are the aerial games 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.820
 although it's true that I struggled 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.049
 take balloons of the head with him 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.690
 usually when I took balloons 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.100
 of the head with it was really that 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.459
 did not go far I even set a goal of 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.109
 the head 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.500
 good is not necessarily goal or the guy is 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.959
 relax but here's 98 head pressure 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.299
 the stat is there at the physical level 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.910
 here is 90 in strength at the shoulder he is 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.380
 just he's tracking down complicated I'm there 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.729
 really like very much about his 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.100
 legs despite his stats in balance 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:15.449
 quite weak 67 in balance but a little 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.889
 like all players ie from 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:19.290
 this game all the big players of this game 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.180
 we'll say he has some sort of 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.740
 vis that is to say that when he leaves himself 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.690
 fall is to get powers 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.180
 faults well placed jordi free kick 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.310
 or good penaltys it's true that I 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.389
 obtained late on penalty with but the 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.669
 few times when it fell it was this to 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.440
 what 99 years always positioning my 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.490
 place and always makes the good call in 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.440
 the depth is really perfect 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.750
 with this type of player the four 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.340
 star bad foot tall advantage 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.840
 to have a scorer who can strike foot 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.710
 left or right foot there really is 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.509
 no difference with and so that by little 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.669
 almost all evening and the level 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.990
 pass quality obviously 92 years 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.210
 pass on the map 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.680
 I made two assists there are 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.789
 has a capacity account and after that it's 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.259
 true it's not necessarily a pass 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.300
 but I count limits as a 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.650
 goes from here but it's only at the level of 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.759
 passes of he is able to make of 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.280
 very very nice openings I think 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:08.050
 especially to the goals will you have seen him the 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.849
 purpose the species goes deep for 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.560
 cuadrado he finds you passes of 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.210
 time it's just crazy so there 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.080
 you have the balance of the evening bed stoxx 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.819
 in front of your eyes 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.990
 so at the level of the positive points the 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:19.270
 kicks stopped free kicks 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.509
 the penaltys here is perfect typing 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.729
 Finish 99 finish longshot flap 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.490
 I can strike from any 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.020
 position with him the speed I have not 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.370
 spoken but already the suarez laugh me 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.020
 I think he's going super fast 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.880
 but then there with 1.92 in speed on 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.110
 the card is just past it's 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.720
 anything when you do not do 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.130
 scripted of course physically 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.889
 very impressive the controls of 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.000
 ball the head game 81 18 years precision 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.440
 of the head the four stars but the 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.509
 feet positioning always well placed 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.770
 very easy to find on the ground his 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.810
 pass quality that is really 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.340
 amazing the four stars gestures 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.130
 techniques technically it's a treat 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.419
 and finally the punching power is 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.800
 true that I hit me 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.810
 normally it's in but that's what 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.300
 the power is there and so the stats 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.860
 with the suarez 8 games 16 goals from 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.900
 bad luck of the two very good stats but 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.250
 it's true that I find these stats 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.860
 have been skewed in relation to 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.620
 guards who turned themselves into fashion 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.330
 monster face him and so necessarily if 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.620
 you have the credits do not hesitate 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.870
 not to take it because it's 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.340
 always need to play with 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.229
 such players had fatma theater in 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.819
 hd for the review of luis suarez version 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.699
 team of the season I hope this 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:26.530
 review you enjoyed tomorrow new review 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:28.150
 that of rahm s rodrigues version toth 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.409
 maybe there will be parwan todd 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.699
 if I can buy one because 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.710
 it's true that yesterday when I looked 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:34.240
 it was quite complicated to find on the 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.240
 market hoping that we are very much 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.069
 more so tomorrow rundown on and maybe 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.080
 not good 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:42.520
