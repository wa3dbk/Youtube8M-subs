I'm just using pretty hot water I don't
want<00:01:29.710> this<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:30.210> scald<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:33.100> nutrition<00:01:34.060> show

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
want this to scald the nutrition show

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.240 
want this to scald the nutrition show
these<00:01:34.300> nutritious<00:01:34.930> components<00:01:35.680> of<00:01:35.830> this<00:01:35.979> so

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
these nutritious components of this so

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.779 
these nutritious components of this so
I've<00:01:37.000> covered<00:01:37.210> this<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:37.660> let<00:01:37.780> it<00:01:37.899> steep<00:01:38.789> you

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
I've covered this and let it steep you

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.639 
I've covered this and let it steep you
can<00:01:39.940> see<00:01:40.180> it's<00:01:40.330> already<00:01:40.539> starting<00:01:40.690> to<00:01:41.140> turn<00:01:41.320> a

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
can see it's already starting to turn a

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.950 
can see it's already starting to turn a
light<00:01:42.430> greenish<00:01:42.940> Brown<00:01:43.420> that's<00:01:43.660> what<00:01:43.810> this

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
light greenish Brown that's what this

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.359 
light greenish Brown that's what this
tea<00:01:44.170> will<00:01:44.350> end<00:01:44.500> up<00:01:44.649> being<00:01:44.860> so<00:01:44.979> that's<00:01:45.160> two

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
tea will end up being so that's two

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.870 
tea will end up being so that's two
tablespoons<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.270> about<00:01:47.050> so<00:01:48.039> six<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.789> eight

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
tablespoons and about so six to eight

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.249 
tablespoons and about so six to eight
ounces<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.420> hot<00:01:49.720> water

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
ounces of hot water

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.490 
ounces of hot water
let<00:01:50.979> that<00:01:51.100> steep<00:01:51.369> for<00:01:51.580> about<00:01:52.020> five<00:01:53.020> minutes<00:01:53.200> or

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
let that steep for about five minutes or

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.760 
let that steep for about five minutes or
so<00:01:53.649> and<00:01:53.680> then<00:01:53.890> we'll<00:01:54.009> come<00:01:54.130> back<00:01:54.250> check<00:01:54.430> it<00:01:54.580> out

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.110 

okay<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:00.830> it's<00:02:01.040> been<00:02:01.220> about<00:02:01.370> five<00:02:01.640> minutes<00:02:01.670> and

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
okay so it's been about five minutes and

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.460 
okay so it's been about five minutes and
you<00:02:02.210> can<00:02:02.330> see<00:02:02.540> that<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:02.780> color<00:02:02.990> what<00:02:03.260> color

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
you can see that the color what color

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.050 
you can see that the color what color
the<00:02:03.740> water<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.130> turning<00:02:04.400> after<00:02:04.670> it's<00:02:04.910> been

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060
