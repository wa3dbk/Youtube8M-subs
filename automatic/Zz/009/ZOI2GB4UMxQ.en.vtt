00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.779
 I'm here today to explain how 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.360
 install a plugin for our psp 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:12.059
 which is called cx of and which will allow you 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.570
 to show on our internal psp 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.880
 ctf informed then first thing 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.330
 we connect our psp to our pc 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.109
 via usb cable and therefore easy to go 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.630
 mine that already has this plugin 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.490
 installed as you can see the theme is 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.870
 completely different the anti path 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:39.000
 sound like you can hear sounds too 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:44.010
 change see also the volume changes 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.649
 all that cruiser also puts the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.340
 displaying everything he knows the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.809
 folders that basically open like this 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:56.520
 I then have all the games 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.399
 however, they display things a lot 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.000
 this is important this strong 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:09.450
 video is made for her and psp with the full 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.939
 time 6.60 m and or 6.60 all regen 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.720
 of the axis point 60 as you can see 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.909
 here we have theme settings and you 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.540
 you find us without this Filipina a 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.090
 ctf informed me to put it inside you 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.790
 These topics such fact I will never see 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.850
 as you can see many themes around 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.390
 50 that that there was mixture at the link 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.390
 for the audition 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.299
 here 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.299
 see well 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.090
 here then we begin and proceed with 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.539
 sorry for the word game then 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.810
 we open I downloaded it here anyway 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:02:01.509
 you must download this cnd archive 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:04.030
 from the descriptions and where it is strange vi 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:08.440
 advice on desktops 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.629
 because having everything at hand will stop 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.549
 so much because having to deal with the themes as well 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:15.910
 those who showed me first are 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.980
 already integrated here so italy that 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.880
 reggio after weighing many are around 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.890
 out of the 190 thousand here is not required 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.590
 plenty of space on you if you don't want to 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.390
 natal theme if you want to put these 50 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.099
 themes that are practically the most famous 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.680
 that are in circulation 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.290
 then you need 200 10 megabytes of 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.819
 free space 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.420
 ok then let's start first now 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.950
 we enter the cnb plug in folder 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.709
 we have so that we had the paper 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.590
 read we connect our price a 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:03:00.569
 portable connection in connection 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:03:04.950
 choose let's know sb and ttm ok 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.950
 no time weight with me 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.890
 and we will not have to do anything but 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:27.950
 basically go and copy these two 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.990
 folders and open the folder we have the 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.950
 our psp see it already copied 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.660
 succeed you and on your pc 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:43.570
 but we do nothing but go and copy 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:43.570
 inside the faults again first 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:53.620
 now we give ourselves the plugin 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.620
 then we leave the psp 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:09.040
 Now we go on here is this is a 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:12.780
 only ball to psp is normal for psp 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.479
 go it is recommended to follow the other video 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.989
 the one for the psp go to install mct 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.130
 is that they suffer then at this point 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.300
 we go 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:31.840
 think that I find the same deaths 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:37.570
 Now we go on all items or less 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:43.539
 themes as mentioned above and open the psp 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:48.780
 truck on psp and find out which themes 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:52.120
 I fell all these themes we put heart 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:58.199
 on notice in a game of atria like 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:05:03.930
 you can see facts once he said 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:03.930
 we do the safe removal in the psp 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:27.900
 This is the first time we will have to 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:27.900
 go on the bitter psp as before 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:37.479
 now let's go for a simple one 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:47.280
 procedure then pulled this because me 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:47.280
 It turns off so version discipline 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.710
 I can say that this is one 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.350
 typical feature in the base 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:07.330
 public supporters 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:13.060
 let's go to one if his our psp e 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:15.720
 let's go to reset vs 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.720
 and this blog 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.250
 wait for the pee now it will restart 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:36.400
 but you will still have your theme 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:44.590

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:46.870
 go to demo settings and 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.820
 we choose our theme among the 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:55.510
 fifty theme we have a 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:58.740
 disposition put at random we know 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:02.200

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.070

 our new fear is as true as you can 

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:21.340
