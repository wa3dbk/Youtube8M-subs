show you our this is our first foray
into<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.929> pedal<00:00:16.109> world<00:00:16.789> kind<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.910> natural

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
into the pedal world kind of a natural

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.300 
into the pedal world kind of a natural
progression<00:00:18.510> from<00:00:19.080> amps<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.680> pedals<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.189> it's

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
progression from amps to pedals and it's

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.980 
progression from amps to pedals and it's
something<00:00:20.520> we<00:00:20.699> fooled<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.150> for<00:00:21.420> years<00:00:21.720> and

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
to just put out a line of generic pedals

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.990 
to just put out a line of generic pedals
and<00:00:28.439> have<00:00:28.740> them<00:00:28.890> get<00:00:29.010> lost<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> mix<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
and have them get lost in the mix and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.880 
and have them get lost in the mix and
nobody<00:00:30.269> cares<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.810> our<00:00:30.990> goal<00:00:31.260> was<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.470> make<00:00:31.619> two

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
nobody cares so our goal was to make two

nobody cares so our goal was to make two
of<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.070> coolest<00:00:32.250> overdrive<00:00:32.969> pedals<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.480> we

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570

overdose<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.579> actually<00:00:41.879> two<00:00:42.059> pedals<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.540> one

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
overdose is actually two pedals in one

and<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.639> works<00:02:58.909> wonderful<00:02:59.420> for<00:02:59.629> either

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
and it works wonderful for either

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.300 
and it works wonderful for either
cutting<00:03:00.019> out<00:03:00.200> noise<00:03:00.440> or<00:03:00.709> squealing<00:03:01.159> or

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
cutting out noise or squealing or

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.580 
cutting out noise or squealing or
feedback<00:03:01.549> or<00:03:02.060> if<00:03:02.569> you're<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.780> real<00:03:02.989> aggressive

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
feedback or if you're a real aggressive

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.890 
feedback or if you're a real aggressive
you<00:03:04.069> know<00:03:04.099> staccato<00:03:04.579> type<00:03:04.879> player<00:03:05.239> it's

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
you know staccato type player it's

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.050 
you know staccato type player it's
wonderful<00:03:06.829> for<00:03:07.010> that<00:03:07.040> also<00:03:07.400> we<00:03:07.609> have<00:03:07.730> a<00:03:07.760> mid

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
wonderful for that also we have a mid

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.699 
wonderful for that also we have a mid
section<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.810> can<00:03:08.959> switch<00:03:09.230> in<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:09.590> out

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
section that you can switch in and out

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.280 
section that you can switch in and out
similar<00:03:10.189> to<00:03:10.310> our<00:03:10.459> Armageddon<00:03:10.819> amps<00:03:11.420> where<00:03:12.170> you

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
similar to our Armageddon amps where you

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.170 
similar to our Armageddon amps where you
can<00:03:12.470> cut<00:03:12.709> or<00:03:12.950> boost<00:03:13.159> the<00:03:13.430> mid-range<00:03:13.790> and

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
can cut or boost the mid-range and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.849 
can cut or boost the mid-range and
adjust<00:03:14.689> the<00:03:14.810> level<00:03:14.989> so<00:03:15.290> when<00:03:15.439> you<00:03:15.530> switch<00:03:15.620> it

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
adjust the level so when you switch it

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.789 
adjust the level so when you switch it
in<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.099> out<00:03:16.189> with<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.459> pedal<00:03:16.790> button<00:03:17.799> doesn't

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
in and out with the pedal button doesn't

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:33.679 
in and out with the pedal button doesn't
change<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.069> volume<00:03:19.189> so<00:03:19.909> here<00:03:20.480> we<00:03:20.599> go<00:03:20.720> with<00:03:20.870> the

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:41.789 

here's<00:03:34.689> without<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.260> gate<00:03:40.590> so<00:03:41.590> it's<00:03:41.709> pretty

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
here's without the gate so it's pretty

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.440 
here's without the gate so it's pretty
cool<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.250> fast<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.760> all<00:03:42.849> that<00:03:43.030> kind<00:03:43.269> of<00:03:43.329> stuff

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
cool and fast and all that kind of stuff

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:56.380 
cool and fast and all that kind of stuff
the<00:03:44.379> mid-range<00:03:44.709> section

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.820 

so<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:57.480> can<00:03:57.600> switch<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:57.960> in<00:03:58.050> and<00:03:58.200> out<00:03:58.320> one

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
so you can switch it in and out one

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.590 
so you can switch it in and out one
thing<00:03:59.040> it's<00:03:59.190> not<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.610> that's<00:03:59.760> basically<00:04:00.360> what

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
thing it's not and that's basically what

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.520 
thing it's not and that's basically what
that<00:04:00.840> does

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
that does

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.320 
that does
lots<00:04:01.980> of<00:04:02.130> control<00:04:02.610> without<00:04:02.940> being

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
lots of control without being

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330 
lots of control without being
complicated<00:04:04.110> at<00:04:04.320> all<00:04:04.500> anybody<00:04:05.040> can<00:04:05.220> make

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
complicated at all anybody can make

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.850 
complicated at all anybody can make
these<00:04:05.550> things<00:04:05.730> work<00:04:05.880> wonderfully<00:04:06.660> one<00:04:07.650> thing

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
these things work wonderfully one thing

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.610 
these things work wonderfully one thing
we<00:04:07.980> do<00:04:08.130> have<00:04:08.160> on<00:04:08.840> both<00:04:09.840> pedals<00:04:10.170> is<00:04:10.320> a<00:04:10.350> low

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
we do have on both pedals is a low

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.310 
we do have on both pedals is a low
battery<00:04:11.280> indicator<00:04:11.550> and<00:04:12.360> a<00:04:12.660> lot<00:04:12.810> of<00:04:12.930> times<00:04:13.110> you

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
battery indicator and a lot of times you

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.570 
battery indicator and a lot of times you
don't<00:04:13.440> know<00:04:13.620> your<00:04:13.770> stuff<00:04:13.980> starting<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.430> sound

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
don't know your stuff starting to sound

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.070 
don't know your stuff starting to sound
bad<00:04:14.850> just<00:04:15.120> because<00:04:15.360> your<00:04:15.480> batteries<00:04:15.930> are

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
bad just because your batteries are

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.630 
bad just because your batteries are
dying<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:16.440> there's<00:04:16.560> no<00:04:16.709> indication<00:04:17.160> we<00:04:17.489> have

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
dying and there's no indication we have

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.030 
dying and there's no indication we have
an<00:04:17.760> indicator<00:04:18.150> on<00:04:18.390> there<00:04:18.630> that<00:04:19.109> flashes<00:04:19.739> tells

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
an indicator on there that flashes tells

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.460 
an indicator on there that flashes tells
you<00:04:20.160> your<00:04:20.340> battery<00:04:20.580> is<00:04:20.850> getting<00:04:21.000> low<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.630> it

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
you your battery is getting low and it

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.600 
you your battery is getting low and it
warns<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:24.290> consecutively<00:04:25.290> a<00:04:25.410> few<00:04:25.740> times<00:04:26.130> and

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
warns you consecutively a few times and

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.880 
warns you consecutively a few times and
it<00:04:27.270> makes<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.600> warning<00:04:27.990> more<00:04:28.170> obvious<00:04:28.680> and

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
it makes the warning more obvious and

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.500 
it makes the warning more obvious and
then<00:04:28.980> eventually<00:04:29.280> if<00:04:29.610> you're<00:04:29.790> so<00:04:30.000> silly<00:04:30.240> as<00:04:30.480> to

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
then eventually if you're so silly as to

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.600 
then eventually if you're so silly as to
just<00:04:30.870> wait<00:04:31.110> till<00:04:31.350> it<00:04:31.500> dies<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:32.310> pedal

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
just wait till it dies the pedal

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.580 
just wait till it dies the pedal
switches<00:04:33.030> itself<00:04:33.360> out<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.020> lights<00:04:34.260> flash

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
switches itself out and the lights flash

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.770 
switches itself out and the lights flash
and<00:04:34.620> say<00:04:34.980> you're<00:04:35.130> kind<00:04:35.370> of<00:04:35.460> silly<00:04:36.090> for<00:04:36.360> letting

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
and say you're kind of silly for letting

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.840 
and say you're kind of silly for letting
your<00:04:36.900> battery<00:04:37.170> die<00:04:37.320> one<00:04:38.070> thing<00:04:38.250> I<00:04:38.340> do<00:04:38.400> want<00:04:38.820> to

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
your battery die one thing I do want to

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.010 
your battery die one thing I do want to
tell<00:04:39.000> you<00:04:39.120> on<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.270> overdose<00:04:39.630> that<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:39.870> did

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
tell you on the overdose that I did

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.590 
tell you on the overdose that I did
forget<00:04:40.290> I'm<00:04:40.410> sorry<00:04:40.740> there<00:04:41.280> is<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.460> path<00:04:41.940> switch

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
forget I'm sorry there is a path switch

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.960 
forget I'm sorry there is a path switch
on<00:04:43.020> here<00:04:43.770> that<00:04:43.800> allows<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.370> to<00:04:44.460> put<00:04:44.640> the<00:04:44.760> boost

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
on here that allows you to put the boost

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:54.659 
on here that allows you to put the boost
before<00:04:45.480> the<00:04:45.630> overdrive<00:04:46.170> so<00:04:46.890> you

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.860 

boots<00:04:55.669> before<00:04:55.819> the<00:04:56.090> overdrive<00:04:56.449> you<00:04:56.539> get<00:04:56.690> more

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
boots before the overdrive you get more

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.540 
boots before the overdrive you get more
distortion<00:04:57.470> but<00:04:57.590> not<00:04:57.740> necessarily<00:04:58.400> more

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
distortion but not necessarily more

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.800 
distortion but not necessarily more
volume<00:04:59.090> if<00:04:59.360> you<00:04:59.690> reverse<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:00.530> path<00:05:01.280> it<00:05:01.909> puts

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
volume if you reverse the path it puts

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.540 
volume if you reverse the path it puts
the<00:05:02.990> boost<00:05:03.169> after<00:05:03.409> so<00:05:03.889> you<00:05:03.949> can<00:05:04.159> use<00:05:04.310> it<00:05:04.430> as

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
the boost after so you can use it as

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.360 
the boost after so you can use it as
more<00:05:04.729> of<00:05:04.819> a<00:05:04.879> solo<00:05:05.120> boozy

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.980 

for<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.520> overdrive<00:05:09.999> so<00:05:10.210> kind<00:05:10.389> of<00:05:10.449> a<00:05:10.539> lead

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
for the overdrive so kind of a lead

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.089 
for the overdrive so kind of a lead
boosting<00:05:11.409> or<00:05:11.499> whatever

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
boosting or whatever

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.159 
boosting or whatever
it<00:05:12.430> also<00:05:12.550> has<00:05:12.879> jacks<00:05:13.240> where<00:05:13.449> you<00:05:13.539> can<00:05:13.719> separate

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
it also has jacks where you can separate

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.899 
it also has jacks where you can separate
this<00:05:14.409> in<00:05:14.559> the<00:05:14.650> two<00:05:14.830> pedals<00:05:15.189> and<00:05:15.370> patch<00:05:15.550> them<00:05:15.789> in

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909 
this in the two pedals and patch them in
