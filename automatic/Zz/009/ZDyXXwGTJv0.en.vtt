why it's a good base defense one of the
main<00:00:50.579> reasons<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.879> because<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.390> doesn't<00:00:51.690> leave

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
do is spread my defensive lines

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.750

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
sometimes depending on how it goes we're

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.979 
sometimes depending on how it goes we're
going<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.940> get<00:00:57.030> into<00:00:57.269> that<00:00:57.300> later<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.719> when<00:00:57.960> I

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
going to get into that later on when I

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.139 
going to get into that later on when I
will<00:00:58.320> talk<00:00:58.469> about<00:00:58.559> our<00:00:58.649> run<00:00:58.890> defenses<00:00:59.429> but<00:00:59.640> as

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
will talk about our run defenses but as

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.200 
will talk about our run defenses but as
you<00:01:00.390> see<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:01.219> this<00:01:02.219> defense<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.910> very

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
you see here this defense is very

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.180 
you see here this defense is very
balanced<00:01:03.719> when<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.500> put<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.830> there<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.070> see

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
balanced when you put in there you see

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.680 
balanced when you put in there you see
two<00:01:05.430> guys<00:01:05.580> for<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.880> at<00:01:05.940> the<00:01:06.000> quarterback<00:01:06.270> it's

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
two guys for you at the quarterback it's

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.090 
two guys for you at the quarterback it's
kind<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.020> glitchy<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.560> way<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> ploy

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
kind of glitchy the way that the ploy

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.380 
kind of glitchy the way that the ploy
works<00:01:08.370> it's<00:01:08.640> not<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> hundred<00:01:09.240> percent

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
works it's not a hundred percent

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.110 
works it's not a hundred percent
effective<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:11.159> when<00:01:11.370> you<00:01:11.460> can<00:01:11.610> get<00:01:11.760> those<00:01:11.880> two

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
effective but when you can get those two

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.520 
effective but when you can get those two
guys<00:01:12.270> forget<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.659> quarterback<00:01:13.050> only<00:01:13.290> sending

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
guys forget the quarterback only sending

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.950 
guys forget the quarterback only sending
five<00:01:13.770> guys<00:01:14.040> it's<00:01:14.640> pretty<00:01:14.909> effective<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.720> my

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
five guys it's pretty effective in my

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.540 
five guys it's pretty effective in my
opinion<00:01:16.260> it's<00:01:16.680> effective<00:01:17.040> enough<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.460> I'm

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
opinion it's effective enough that I'm

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.580 
opinion it's effective enough that I'm
going<00:01:17.730> to<00:01:17.880> risk<00:01:18.210> every<00:01:18.990> now<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.290> then<00:01:19.410> not

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
going to risk every now and then not

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.840 
going to risk every now and then not
getting<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.980> guy<00:01:20.070> completely<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:20.820> hundred

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
getting the guy completely one hundred

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.000 
getting the guy completely one hundred
percent<00:01:21.090> free<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.570> quarterback<00:01:21.990> that's<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
percent free to quarterback that's a

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.140 
percent free to quarterback that's a
buck<00:01:23.190> because<00:01:23.460> if<00:01:23.550> they<00:01:23.640> block<00:01:23.820> our<00:01:23.940> running

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
buck because if they block our running

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.460 
buck because if they block our running
back<00:01:24.300> against<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.020> still<00:01:25.230> get<00:01:25.350> those

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
back against this and we still get those

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.260 
back against this and we still get those
two<00:01:25.620> guys<00:01:25.770> free<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.580> see<00:01:26.760> there<00:01:26.940> they<00:01:27.090> pick

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
in a deep blue zone purple the defense

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.700 
in a deep blue zone purple the defense
events<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.540> quarterbacks<00:02:18.959> by<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.230> defensive

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
events and quarterbacks by the defensive

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.350 
events and quarterbacks by the defensive
tackle<00:02:20.010> does<00:02:20.190> require<00:02:20.430> some<00:02:20.520> time<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.090> set<00:02:21.270> up

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
tackle does require some time to set up

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.630 
tackle does require some time to set up
but<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.690> think<00:02:21.750> it's<00:02:22.020> worth<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.950> time<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.340> set

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
but I think it's worth the time to set

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.809 
but I think it's worth the time to set
up<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:23.910> learning<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.300> system

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
up and learning the system

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.520 
up and learning the system
and<00:02:24.939> you<00:02:25.150> cycle<00:02:25.569> through<00:02:25.599> these<00:02:25.870> players<00:02:26.170> very

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
and you cycle through these players very

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.530 
and you cycle through these players very
quickly<00:02:26.799> in<00:02:27.010> my<00:02:27.099> opinion<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.640> only<00:02:28.030> player<00:02:28.390> i

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
quickly in my opinion the only player i

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.030 
quickly in my opinion the only player i
really<00:02:28.749> don't<00:02:29.109> cycle<00:02:29.349> through<00:02:29.590> quickly<00:02:29.829> is

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
really don't cycle through quickly is

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.410 
really don't cycle through quickly is
