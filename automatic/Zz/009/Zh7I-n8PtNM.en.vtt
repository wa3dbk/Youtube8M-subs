almost<00:01:21.790> useless<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:23.110> proper<00:01:23.350> Bend<00:01:23.680> off<00:01:23.830> with

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
almost useless the proper Bend off with

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.320 
almost useless the proper Bend off with
some<00:01:24.220> rubber<00:01:24.369> bands<00:01:24.670> there<00:01:25.000> shouldn't<00:01:25.240> be<00:01:25.270> a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
some rubber bands there shouldn't be a

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.260 
some rubber bands there shouldn't be a
problem<00:01:25.570> so<00:01:26.500> firstly<00:01:27.340> we're<00:01:27.700> going<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.060> have<00:01:28.240> a

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
problem so firstly we're going to have a

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.310 
problem so firstly we're going to have a
look<00:01:28.540> at<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:30.509> xt60<00:01:31.509> connector<00:01:31.570> and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
look at this xt60 connector and

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.580 
look at this xt60 connector and
connecting<00:01:32.799> that<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:34.200> speed<00:01:35.200> controller

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
connecting that to the speed controller

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.399 
connecting that to the speed controller
so<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.189> battery<00:01:37.180> you<00:01:37.210> provide<00:01:37.600> touted<00:01:38.140> speed

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
so the battery you provide touted speed

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:46.310 
so the battery you provide touted speed
control<00:01:38.740> so<00:01:39.369> open<00:01:39.700> up<00:01:39.759> that<00:01:39.909> packet

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.600

bond<00:02:15.340> side<00:02:15.550> on<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.730> other<00:02:15.760> side<00:02:16.120> as<00:02:16.180> well<00:02:16.330> but

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
bond side on the other side as well but

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.860 
bond side on the other side as well but
you<00:02:16.840> can<00:02:16.960> easily<00:02:17.110> tell<00:02:17.590> by<00:02:18.130> lining<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.060> up<00:02:19.150> and

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
you can easily tell by lining it up and

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.840 
you can easily tell by lining it up and
a<00:02:19.960> warrant<00:02:20.230> if<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.440> one<00:02:20.620> way<00:02:20.800> lining<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.760> up

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
a warrant if it one way lining it up

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.490 
a warrant if it one way lining it up
with<00:02:22.030> your<00:02:22.150> battery<00:02:22.510> leads<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.020> battery

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
with your battery leads and the battery

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.170 
with your battery leads and the battery
one's<00:02:23.680> already<00:02:23.830> got<00:02:24.070> one<00:02:24.190> on<00:02:24.310> there<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:24.640> the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
one's already got one on there and the

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.450 
one's already got one on there and the
red<00:02:25.390> wire<00:02:25.660> which<00:02:26.050> is<00:02:26.200> positive<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:26.950> going<00:02:27.370> to

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
red wire which is positive is going to

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.070 
red wire which is positive is going to
the<00:02:27.550> flat<00:02:27.790> side<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.420> i'll<00:02:28.480> do<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.720> flat<00:02:28.900> side

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
the flat side so i'll do the flat side

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.960 
the flat side so i'll do the flat side
first<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.530> positive<00:02:29.920> side<00:02:30.100> just<00:02:30.790> going<00:02:30.910> to

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
first the positive side just going to

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:39.810 
first the positive side just going to
click<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.270> in<00:02:31.420> there<00:02:33.990> safe<00:02:34.990> glasses<00:02:35.470> on<00:02:38.820> and

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
click that in there safe glasses on and

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.020 
click that in there safe glasses on and
I'm<00:02:40.270> going<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.420> have<00:02:40.570> my<00:02:40.720> own<00:02:42.030> electronic

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
I'm going to have my own electronic

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.820 
I'm going to have my own electronic
speed<00:02:43.330> control<00:02:43.360> ready<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:43.990> go<00:02:44.140> what<00:02:44.650> I'm<00:02:44.710> going

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
speed control ready to go what I'm going

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.290 
speed control ready to go what I'm going
to<00:02:44.860> do<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.070> just<00:02:45.100> put<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.430> bit<00:02:45.580> of<00:02:45.640> solder<00:02:45.940> into

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
to do is just put a bit of solder into

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.160 
to do is just put a bit of solder into
that<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.930> pulls<00:02:47.170> up<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.620> then<00:02:48.100> stick<00:02:48.460> the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
that so it pulls up and then stick the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.449 
that so it pulls up and then stick the
speed<00:02:50.170> control<00:02:50.260> of<00:02:50.590> red<00:02:50.770> wire<00:02:51.010> into<00:02:51.370> that

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
speed control of red wire into that

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.800 
speed control of red wire into that
positive<00:02:51.880> one<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.030> I'll<00:02:52.209> just<00:02:52.270> lift<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.630> up<00:02:52.720> a

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
positive one so I'll just lift it up a

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.880 
positive one so I'll just lift it up a
little<00:02:52.930> bit<00:02:53.050> like<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:58.200> get<00:02:59.200> my<00:02:59.290> tip<00:02:59.530> nice<00:02:59.709> and

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
little bit like that get my tip nice and

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.070 
little bit like that get my tip nice and
clean<00:03:00.010> just<00:03:00.190> apply<00:03:00.459> a<00:03:00.489> bit<00:03:00.610> of<00:03:00.700> solder<00:03:01.690> to<00:03:01.959> it

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
clean just apply a bit of solder to it

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.180 
clean just apply a bit of solder to it
and<00:03:02.200> whoops<00:03:02.410> we're<00:03:02.590> going<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:02.800> pin<00:03:02.920> on<00:03:03.070> my

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:50.089 
head shrink in a second but I'm going to

00:05:50.089 --> 00:06:16.850 
head shrink in a second but I'm going to
scoop<00:05:50.359> it<00:05:50.449> over<00:05:51.009> tab<00:05:52.009> look<00:05:52.159> at<00:05:52.249> the<00:05:52.339> other<00:05:52.459> side

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.890 

this<00:06:17.460> is<00:06:17.610> the<00:06:17.699> negative<00:06:17.849> side

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.840 

naps<00:06:23.500> over<00:06:23.710> there<00:06:24.100> so<00:06:24.220> it's<00:06:24.370> going<00:06:24.460> to<00:06:24.550> pull<00:06:24.729> it

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
naps over there so it's going to pull it

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.399 
naps over there so it's going to pull it
up<00:06:24.970> a<00:06:25.000> little<00:06:25.150> bit

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:52.210 

and<00:06:28.649> then<00:06:28.949> get<00:06:29.099> that<00:06:29.219> black<00:06:29.429> blade

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.220 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.750 

that's<00:06:53.030> family<00:06:53.480> in<00:06:53.570> place

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:57.760 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.000 

so<00:06:58.330> yes<00:06:58.930> maybe<00:06:59.170> want<00:06:59.440> to<00:06:59.470> check<00:06:59.680> that<00:06:59.710> you've

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010 
so yes maybe want to check that you've

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.820 
so yes maybe want to check that you've
got<00:07:00.190> them<00:07:00.340> nice<00:07:00.820> and<00:07:00.880> and<00:07:01.300> secure<00:07:01.960> I've<00:07:02.590> done

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
got them nice and and secure I've done

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.610 
got them nice and and secure I've done
that<00:07:03.210> now<00:07:04.210> I<00:07:04.240> just<00:07:04.480> want<00:07:04.630> to<00:07:04.690> pull<00:07:04.870> that<00:07:05.050> heat

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620 
that now I just want to pull that heat

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.320 
that now I just want to pull that heat
shrink<00:07:05.920> up<00:07:06.070> and<00:07:06.250> this<00:07:06.400> is<00:07:06.520> still<00:07:06.730> quite<00:07:07.000> hot<00:07:07.180> on

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330 
shrink up and this is still quite hot on

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.510 
shrink up and this is still quite hot on
the<00:07:07.420> terminal<00:07:07.660> so<00:07:08.320> be<00:07:09.010> careful<00:07:09.310> you<00:07:09.400> don't

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 
the terminal so be careful you don't

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.950 
the terminal so be careful you don't
burn<00:07:09.640> yourself<00:07:09.820> but<00:07:10.180> also<00:07:10.240> the<00:07:10.570> heat<00:07:10.720> shrink

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 
burn yourself but also the heat shrink

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.750 
burn yourself but also the heat shrink
and<00:07:11.080> start<00:07:11.260> building<00:07:11.440> straight<00:07:11.860> away<00:07:12.040> those

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:12.760 
and start building straight away those

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:22.209 
and start building straight away those
to<00:07:12.970> my<00:07:13.120> extractor<00:07:13.570> off

00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:22.219 

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:24.499 

and<00:07:23.219> I've<00:07:23.309> got<00:07:23.339> a<00:07:23.550> jetliner<00:07:23.969> but<00:07:24.270> you<00:07:24.330> could

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:24.509 
and I've got a jetliner but you could

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:29.149 
and I've got a jetliner but you could
use<00:07:24.539> the<00:07:26.689> the<00:07:27.689> tip<00:07:28.229> of<00:07:28.259> your<00:07:28.379> styling<00:07:28.860> on<00:07:28.979> I

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:29.159 
use the the tip of your styling on I

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:30.439 
use the the tip of your styling on I
just<00:07:29.279> don't<00:07:29.430> want<00:07:29.550> to<00:07:29.580> get<00:07:29.669> place<00:07:29.879> to<00:07:30.029> come<00:07:30.180> on

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:30.449 
just don't want to get place to come on

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:32.119 
just don't want to get place to come on
the<00:07:30.599> tip<00:07:30.749> of<00:07:30.779> my<00:07:30.870> solder<00:07:31.110> just<00:07:31.830> going<00:07:31.949> to<00:07:32.009> slip

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:32.129 
the tip of my solder just going to slip

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:34.549 
the tip of my solder just going to slip
that<00:07:32.279> up<00:07:32.430> over<00:07:32.580> the<00:07:32.819> connector<00:07:33.719> slip<00:07:34.289> that<00:07:34.439> up

00:07:34.549 --> 00:07:34.559 
that up over the connector slip that up

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:42.140 
that up over the connector slip that up
over<00:07:34.680> the<00:07:34.830> connector<00:07:35.129> to<00:07:35.930> and<00:07:37.430> then<00:07:40.490> just<00:07:41.490> heat

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.150 
over the connector to and then just heat

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.499 
over the connector to and then just heat
that<00:07:42.330> heat<00:07:42.539> shrink<00:07:42.779> up<00:07:42.900> sort<00:07:43.199> wraps<00:07:44.159> around

00:07:44.499 --> 00:07:44.509 
that heat shrink up sort wraps around

00:07:44.509 --> 00:08:07.480 
that heat shrink up sort wraps around
tight<00:07:45.509> around<00:07:45.659> those<00:07:45.900> terminals

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:07.490 

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.550
