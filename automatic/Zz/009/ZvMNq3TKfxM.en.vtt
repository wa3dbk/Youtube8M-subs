00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.979 
ranked 10 and got the bittersteel camo
which<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.710> think<00:00:49.920> was<00:00:50.039> pretty<00:00:50.280> awesome<00:00:50.460> and

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
which I think was pretty awesome and

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.600 
which I think was pretty awesome and
that<00:00:51.989> was<00:00:52.140> mainly<00:00:52.379> due<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.100> fact<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.489> I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
that was mainly due to the fact that I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.950 
that was mainly due to the fact that I
was<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.969> doing<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.510> ton<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:56.510> patrol<00:00:57.510> missions

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
was just doing a ton of patrol missions

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.330 
was just doing a ton of patrol missions
so<00:00:58.320> patrols<00:00:58.710> are<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.190> great<00:00:59.460> way<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.600> earn

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
so patrols are just a great way to earn

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.270 
so patrols are just a great way to earn
some<00:01:02.340> quick<00:01:03.030> reputation<00:01:03.899> especially<00:01:04.559> once

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
some quick reputation especially once

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.969 
some quick reputation especially once
you<00:01:05.339> know<00:01:05.519> how<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.939> them<00:01:06.119> right<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:07.380> yeah

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
you don't want to leave a certain area

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.010 
you don't want to leave a certain area
like<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:02.700> you're<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:02.969> collecting<00:02:03.479> materials

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
like if you're just collecting materials

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.760 
like if you're just collecting materials
and<00:02:04.229> things<00:02:04.259> like<00:02:04.590> that

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
and things like that

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.590 
and things like that
or<00:02:05.920> if<00:02:06.280> you're<00:02:06.460> just<00:02:06.490> doing<00:02:06.789> patrol<00:02:07.240> missions

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
or if you're just doing patrol missions

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.850 
or if you're just doing patrol missions
I<00:02:07.750> generally<00:02:08.619> like<00:02:08.769> to<00:02:08.830> do<00:02:09.099> those<00:02:10.060> first

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
I generally like to do those first

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.559 
I generally like to do those first
simply<00:02:11.860> because<00:02:12.040> when<00:02:12.849> you<00:02:12.970> get<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.150> scouting

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
simply because when you get a scouting

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.080 
simply because when you get a scouting
mission<00:02:13.750> or<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.230> scan<00:02:14.590> mission<00:02:15.069> or<00:02:15.489> even<00:02:15.819> an<00:02:15.940> h

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
mission or a scan mission or even an h

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.960 
mission or a scan mission or even an h
VT<00:02:16.470> they<00:02:17.470> generally<00:02:17.920> just<00:02:18.370> send<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.910> a

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
VT they generally just send you to a

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.380 
VT they generally just send you to a
different<00:02:19.390> area<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:20.400> do<00:02:21.400> those<00:02:21.640> particular

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
different area to do those particular

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.320 
different area to do those particular
patrols<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.830> right<00:02:24.340> here<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.610> actually<00:02:24.819> already

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
patrols so right here I actually already

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.589 
patrols so right here I actually already
did<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.750> harvest<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:27.069> kill<00:02:27.370> mission<00:02:27.549> so<00:02:28.540> I'm

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
did a harvest and a kill mission so I'm

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.170 
did a harvest and a kill mission so I'm
going<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.750> go<00:02:28.870> ahead<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.200> pick<00:02:29.410> up<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:30.180> scouting

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
going to go ahead and pick up a scouting

going to go ahead and pick up a scouting
mission<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.840> scouting<00:02:32.230> mission<00:02:32.470> I'm<00:02:32.560> not

really<00:02:32.890> sure<00:02:33.010> exactly<00:02:33.670> what<00:02:34.360> symbol<00:02:34.989> this<00:02:35.200> is

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
really sure exactly what symbol this is

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.949 
really sure exactly what symbol this is
but<00:02:35.799> the<00:02:35.890> scouting<00:02:36.099> mission<00:02:36.660> symbol<00:02:37.660> kind<00:02:37.840> of

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
but the scouting mission symbol kind of

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.020 
but the scouting mission symbol kind of
looks<00:02:38.140> like<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:39.340> that's<00:02:39.519> going<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.760> send

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
and scan missions last the scan mission

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.250 
and scan missions last the scan mission
kind<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.790> looks<00:02:51.940> like<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.150> it<00:02:52.780> looks<00:02:52.959> like<00:02:53.230> a

kind of looks like this it looks like a

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.009 
kind of looks like this it looks like a
little<00:02:53.760> diamond<00:02:54.760> with<00:02:55.239> like<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.450> little<00:02:55.540> outer

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
little diamond with like a little outer

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.000 
little diamond with like a little outer
lining<00:02:56.860> around<00:02:57.160> it<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:58.599> yeah<00:02:58.959> those<00:02:59.170> are<00:02:59.470> good

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
lining around it so yeah those are good

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.009 
lining around it so yeah those are good
to<00:03:00.160> pick<00:03:00.310> up<00:03:00.519> as<00:03:00.670> you're<00:03:00.970> moving<00:03:01.150> if<00:03:01.540> you<00:03:01.840> want

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
to pick up as you're moving if you want

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.289 
to pick up as you're moving if you want
to<00:03:02.079> move<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.500> different<00:03:02.709> area<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.610> things

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
to move to a different area and things

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.630 
to move to a different area and things
like<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:05.700> then<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:07.060> have<00:03:07.239> your<00:03:07.269> HVT

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
like that and then you have your HVT

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.500 
like that and then you have your HVT
symbol<00:03:09.640> which<00:03:09.819> kind<00:03:10.060> of<00:03:10.120> looks<00:03:10.239> like<00:03:10.389> a

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
symbol which kind of looks like a

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.590 
symbol which kind of looks like a
diamond<00:03:10.980> with<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.010> star<00:03:12.430> in<00:03:12.609> a<00:03:12.700> star<00:03:13.389> in<00:03:13.540> the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
diamond with a star in a star in the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.750 
diamond with a star in a star in the
middle<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.139> and<00:03:14.319> a<00:03:14.709> little<00:03:14.889> ring<00:03:15.489> around

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
middle of it and a little ring around

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.900 
middle of it and a little ring around
the<00:03:16.120> outside<00:03:16.569> of<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.170> diamond<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:18.579> those<00:03:18.730> are

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
the outside of the diamond so those are

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.699 
the outside of the diamond so those are
the<00:03:18.940> five<00:03:19.150> types<00:03:19.480> of<00:03:19.810> patrols<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:20.500> you'll

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
the five types of patrols that you'll

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.270 
the five types of patrols that you'll
actually<00:03:20.829> have<00:03:21.280> kill<00:03:22.150> missions<00:03:23.040> harvest<00:03:24.040> or

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
actually have kill missions harvest or

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.530 
actually have kill missions harvest or
collecting<00:03:24.790> missions<00:03:25.680> scouting<00:03:26.680> missions

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
collecting missions scouting missions

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.920 
collecting missions scouting missions
scan<00:03:28.540> missions<00:03:30.030> which<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.389> think<00:03:31.630> I've<00:03:31.750> pointed

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
scan missions which I think I've pointed

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.660 
scan missions which I think I've pointed
out<00:03:32.139> the<00:03:32.319> scam<00:03:32.530> missions<00:03:32.980> I'm<00:03:33.160> actually<00:03:33.340> doing

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
out the scam missions I'm actually doing

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.490 
out the scam missions I'm actually doing
this<00:03:34.630> video<00:03:34.989> live<00:03:36.209> for<00:03:37.209> whatever<00:03:37.660> reason<00:03:38.109> I

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
this video live for whatever reason I

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.500 
this video live for whatever reason I
just<00:03:38.950> thought<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.400> would<00:03:39.459> be<00:03:39.579> easier<00:03:40.030> not

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
just thought it would be easier not

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.080 
just thought it would be easier not
really<00:03:40.750> sure<00:03:41.069> why<00:03:42.069> hopefully<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:42.849> got

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
really sure why hopefully I got

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.759 
really sure why hopefully I got
everything<00:03:43.329> across<00:03:43.780> clearly<00:03:44.819> but<00:03:46.650> yeah<00:03:47.650> the

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
everything across clearly but yeah the

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.039 
everything across clearly but yeah the
scan<00:03:48.040> missions<00:03:48.459> I'm<00:03:48.700> not<00:03:48.849> really<00:03:49.000> sure<00:03:49.120> what

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
scan missions I'm not really sure what

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.039 
scan missions I'm not really sure what
that<00:03:50.079> symbol<00:03:50.680> is<00:03:50.980> but<00:03:51.340> as<00:03:51.519> like<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.790> little<00:03:52.120> yeah

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
that symbol is but as like a little yeah

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.319 
that symbol is but as like a little yeah
it<00:03:53.109> just<00:03:53.139> looks<00:03:53.440> like<00:03:53.500> this<00:03:53.799> right<00:03:54.010> here<00:03:54.329> so

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
it just looks like this right here so

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.970 
it just looks like this right here so
yeah<00:03:55.510> I<00:03:55.540> generally<00:03:56.049> picked<00:03:56.260> up<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.530> scouting

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
yeah I generally picked up the scouting

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.180 
yeah I generally picked up the scouting
its<00:03:57.130> gain<00:03:57.340> missions<00:03:57.819> after<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:59.290> harvest<00:03:59.590> and

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.220 

kill<00:04:03.190> missions<00:04:03.609> so<00:04:04.389> like<00:04:04.569> right<00:04:04.810> here<00:04:05.049> we<00:04:05.200> have

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
kill missions so like right here we have

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.270

one of the main reasons you want to do
the<00:06:03.380> night<00:06:03.830> falls<00:06:04.070> is<00:06:04.370> simply<00:06:05.240> to<00:06:05.330> get<00:06:05.479> that

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630
