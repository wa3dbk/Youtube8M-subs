00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.169
 hello good two series for the killer 

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:05.879
 welcome to a new video today 

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:09.179
 I bring the beginning of the beginning of a new 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.389
 series is the series that I told you in your 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.879
 moment that I was going to save as a 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.670
 little secret until I started it 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.140
 go up and well here you have it now 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.110
 I explain a little the series is called 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.670
 ronaldinho the creation of the legend and 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.750
 Well basically what we are going to 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.910
 do is with ronaldinho try to score 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.759
 all the goals you have scored in your 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.320
 sports career to date according to 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.859
 wikipedia that is the source that I'm going to 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.949
 He is looking for goals since 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:44.160
 I find it the most reliable according to wikipedia 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:47.339
 has scored 215 goals and good for 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.260
 make it a little more real and let's say it 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.289
 let's say it a little more special the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.890
 series then let's score goals with each 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.329
 in each team that is ronaldinho by 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.719
 example in its stage in the barca 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.879
 scored 97 goals according to wikipedia because no 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.220
 we're just going to score 97 goals with a 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.010
 bird equipment 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.120
 with the maximum number of players 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.130
 possible FC Barcelona with Milan 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.560
 we will do the same but the Italian league and 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.320
 with players from milan with paris 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.550
 saint germain equal all everything already from 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.830
 of that style and good because we will 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.760
 start with the guild of portoalegre that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.010
 is the first the first team that played 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.780
 ronaldinho obviously therefore each team 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.170
 will have every time he plays with a team 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.270
 we will have 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.130
 the kit and the shield and you see how 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.070
 I'm going to buy a ronaldinho from 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.430
 zero or the studs to zero there you see them 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:48.560
 you have seen a little fleetingly they have 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.479
 the studs to zero and well then with that 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.830
 ronaldinho we are going to try to get 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.570
 the 215 goals we will buy also 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.189
 a chemistry letter here I was wrong 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.490
 with pre catalyst and wanted to buy 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.710
 hunter I was wrong the letter since 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.110
 Well, how are we going to use the 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.209
 roll to score goals then you need 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.420
 we need a little bit of rhythm and a 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.700
 little bit of also shooting 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.959
 and well well also tell you that in this 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.959
 series as the goal is to mark 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.970
 with ronaldinho, maybe we're going to 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.650
 abusing ronaldinho obviously and 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.260
 also because all the goals are going to 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.870
 Dodge make spectacular 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.850
 I will also mark some of them surely 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.470
 pass piggy but after all 4 a 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.810
 children in their sports career 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.250
 he has also scored passes equal and 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.720
 Well, there you have the team of 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.180
 guild of cheerful porto with which we go 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.769
 to start the series in the goal 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.030
 we have exit and the doorman 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.940
 really normalito nothing great 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.970
 but good is discard price defense 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:50.260
 for for dams and werley and álex teles 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.030
 I can bear Souza who is a player 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.850
 that I loved the mcd 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.340
 after roberto on the right side the 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.750
 not on the left with the child of the month and 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.080
 today of hooking and up 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.150
 edu vargas and kléber is the guild 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.330
 complete with ronaldinho that really 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.340
 Well, that's what I wanted to do in 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.840
 all the equipment but in all 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.920
 teams that I will have both in the psg 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.410
 like in milan barça 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.660
 but it can not be done with everyone so 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.970
 well then use the maximum of 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:25.430
 possible players for 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:28.430
 for each block let's say goals with the 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.670
 guild we have to score 32 goals before 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.410
 to be able to move to the psg block there 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.360
 you see the first game is against a 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.000
 bbva league team that is pretty 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.710
 well with a record with alexis with 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.200
 Diego Costa 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.080
 and well, let's start the match 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.920
 you are watching the morata shot at 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.780
 stick and the bounce falls to isco that the 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.840
 strength that carries then pierced to the 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.090
 network and everything also tell you what you see 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.280
 the second goal of his head of disk 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.600
 tell you that all the matches that you 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.310
 I will put in this series is because 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.200
 ronaldinho scores some goal I'm not going to 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.850
 put matches that do not mark ronaldinho 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.910
 because otherwise the series will be 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.310
 would lengthen a lot and good because you are 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.100
 watching the goal of kléber to cut 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.390
 distances and it's each time each game 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.270
 that I put you is because ronaldinho 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.830
 minimum score of a goal there you are 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.080
 seeing the goal of ronaldinho the 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.360
 first and good then from here the 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.770
 rival played while you knew times that 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.360
 played the time that there is no you see how it 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.220
 it was stopped and good then I 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.040
 basically what I did was try 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.540
 ensure victory and from 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.100
 there because I did not want to make him more goals 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.730
 he scored with ronaldinho and he was going to 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.430
 mark another also with a ronaldinho in 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.140
 one of those moments that stopped playing and 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.990
 Well, the first three 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.090
 goals the Brazilian player 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:52.120
 and from here I could mark more 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.120
 but good, well, it went, either 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:58.429
 and I think it was not for him to abuse 

00:04:56.809 --> 00:05:00.949
 I scored two goals the debut to score more 

00:04:58.429 --> 00:05:03.379
 in those 10 minutes but I wanted to give him the 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:06.979
 victory and we're already going to the second 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:08.929
 match with goals by ronaldinho in 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.759
 this goal case because it's going to score only 

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:12.949
 a roll will see we play against a team 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.780
 that is a lot of chelsea player and then 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:18.710
 has a vidic 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.380
 richard lescott yes and 20 lescott and 20 that 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.389
 in a defense of five and well then the 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.090
 first equal pass goal surrounded by the 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.740
 edu vargas series to that of ronaldinho and 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.410
 well then I put fast camera because the 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.750
 rival was going to leave the game and good 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.600
 for the second match and the second time 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.430
 the rival in the truth is that 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.560
 there's a long game ahead I do not know 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.660
 why he left but the good thing is that 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.400
 he left and we got the victory and the 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.180
 goal of ronaldinho and good we form to 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.250
 last game of the series that started 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.500
 that will have three games or four in 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.900
 if there is not much to emphasize 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.510
 of the matches and well we are going to 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.310
 play against a team in the league 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.870
 Italian of the series and this match then 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.550
 we are going to lose it there you are seeing the 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.380
 the goal of de rossi gave me a lot of anger 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.720
 for that goal because the truth is a goal 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.760
 that fails you and the defense that does not hurt me 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.750
 he responds very well to what I want 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.480
 do 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.090
 here I went to the attack minute 80 we go 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.700
 follow the sentence with the goal of 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.140
 gervinho but before the end of the 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.260
 Ronaldinho party is going to be the first 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:24.440
 golazo of the series to this wind receives 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.750
 the ball and the ball hits the ball and enters 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.630
 spectacular the shot of ronaldinho but 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.700
 good was going to end the series and good 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.230
 because at the end of each chapter I'm going to 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.770
 put a screenshot of the authors that 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.349
 ronaldinho played games 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.960
 Well, there you are seeing a little bit 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:43.509
 has five goals in the first three 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.940
 the first matches in matches 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:47.289
 I 've put you and well, nothing about 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.090

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:51.430
 the video tell me in the comments if 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:54.240
 the idea of ​​the series is cool and nothing 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.240
 greeting and see you soon 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:01.000
 That has grown 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.000
 Red wine 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 plus 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.500
 forever
