hey guys so today I'll be showing

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.460 
hey guys so today I'll be showing
demonstrating<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:04.110> piston<00:00:04.589> mod<00:00:04.770> for<00:00:05.549> minecraft

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
demonstrating a piston mod for minecraft

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.440 
demonstrating a piston mod for minecraft
so<00:00:07.470> basically<00:00:07.799> what<00:00:08.130> it<00:00:08.160> does<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.670> it<00:00:08.849> pushes<00:00:09.330> a

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
so basically what it does is it pushes a

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.879 
so basically what it does is it pushes a
block<00:00:10.460> one<00:00:11.690> one<00:00:12.690> block<00:00:12.960> away<00:00:13.019> from<00:00:13.320> the

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
block one one block away from the

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.090 
block one one block away from the
original<00:00:14.340> position<00:00:14.429> like<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.289> what's<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.920> can

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
original position like so what's it can

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.670 
original position like so what's it can
be<00:00:17.190> triggered<00:00:17.400> by<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.670> lever<00:00:18.029> or<00:00:18.920> a<00:00:20.900> or<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.310> mutton

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
be triggered by a lever or a or a mutton

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.950 
be triggered by a lever or a or a mutton
it<00:00:25.680> can't<00:00:25.980> put<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.550> can't<00:00:26.820> push<00:00:27.240> or<00:00:27.570> push

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
it can't put it can't push or push

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:40.990 
it can't put it can't push or push
through<00:00:28.320> obsidian<00:00:28.920> dough<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.779> like<00:00:31.099> C<00:00:32.099> or<00:00:39.829> so

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
through obsidian dough so like C or so

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.340 
through obsidian dough so like C or so
you<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.690> could<00:00:42.840> use<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.290> as

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
you can just that you could use that as

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.080 
you can just that you could use that as
a<00:00:45.110> stock<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.800> want<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.070> create<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.489> bridge

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
a stock if you want to create a bridge

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.510 
a stock if you want to create a bridge
just<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.140> somebody<00:00:49.710> made<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> bitch<00:00:50.219> I

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
just like somebody made a bitch I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.470 
just like somebody made a bitch I
believe<00:00:51.379> soft<00:00:52.379> breathing<00:00:52.710> bridge<00:00:52.949> with

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
believe soft breathing bridge with

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.250 
believe soft breathing bridge with
obsidian<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.309> Lamont<00:00:56.960> it<00:00:57.960> could<00:00:58.109> also

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
obsidian and the Lamont it could also

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.000 
obsidian and the Lamont it could also
push<00:00:58.680> upwards<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.609> if<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.239> use<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.600> sand

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
push upwards and if you use it on sand

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.719 
push upwards and if you use it on sand
you'll<00:01:02.010> go<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.979> and<00:01:05.330> it<00:01:06.330> leaves

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
you'll go like that we and it leaves

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.030 
you'll go like that we and it leaves
other<00:01:08.729> blocks<00:01:09.630> not<00:01:09.869> affected<00:01:10.260> by<00:01:10.290> gravity<00:01:10.439> in

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
other blocks not affected by gravity in

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.730 
other blocks not affected by gravity in
here<00:01:11.900> not<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.020> push<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.650> up<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.100> believe<00:01:15.740> we

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
here not so push you up I believe we

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.990 
here not so push you up I believe we
won't<00:01:17.360> take<00:01:18.360> some<00:01:18.570> fall<00:01:18.810> damage<00:01:19.170> though<00:01:19.380> so

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
won't take some fall damage though so

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.300 
won't take some fall damage though so
there<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.030> mind<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.890> another<00:01:22.890> cool

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
there you mind so of that another cool

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.429 
there you mind so of that another cool
thing<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.670> do<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:25.200> create

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
thing you can do with it is can create

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.190 
thing you can do with it is can create
secret<00:01:25.860> drummer<00:01:26.100> passageways<00:01:27.920> like<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:30.200> so

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
secret drummer passageways like here so

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.340 
secret drummer passageways like here so
basically<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.130> Pistons<00:01:32.549> put<00:01:33.000> these

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
basically the Pistons put these

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:43.609 
basically the Pistons put these
bookshelves<00:01:34.729> into<00:01:36.770> another<00:01:38.450> here<00:01:42.200> do<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> blank

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
bookshelves into another here do a blank

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.210 
bookshelves into another here do a blank
space<00:01:43.979> covered<00:01:44.520> by<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> metal<00:01:45.210> block

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.020 

and<00:01:48.850> then<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.360> system<00:01:50.580> owners<00:01:51.580> had<00:01:51.760> triggered

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
and then the system owners had triggered

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.570 
and then the system owners had triggered
by<00:01:52.180> this<00:01:52.360> button<00:01:52.720> and<00:01:52.810> redstone<00:01:53.140> wire<00:01:53.500> push<00:01:54.400> it

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
by this button and redstone wire push it

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.550 
by this button and redstone wire push it
push<00:01:54.730> it<00:01:54.940> pushes<00:01:55.870> it<00:01:56.080> back<00:01:57.000> basically<00:01:58.560> look

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
push it pushes it back basically look

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.970 
push it pushes it back basically look
cake<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:00.730> this<00:02:02.340> pressure<00:02:03.340> pressure<00:02:04.120> plate

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
cake and this pressure pressure plate

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.219 
cake and this pressure pressure plate
hoses<00:02:05.980> be<00:02:06.130> closed<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.880> again<00:02:07.000> when<00:02:07.870> you<00:02:08.050> walk

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
hoses be closed it again when you walk

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.430 
hoses be closed it again when you walk
in<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:10.000> cakes<00:02:10.210> blowing<00:02:10.660> for<00:02:10.840> some<00:02:10.960> reason<00:02:11.290> I

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
in the cakes blowing for some reason I

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.010 
in the cakes blowing for some reason I
don't<00:02:11.620> know<00:02:11.770> why<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:13.000> button<00:02:13.390> allows<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.690> to

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
don't know why this button allows you to

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.700 
don't know why this button allows you to
get<00:02:14.350> out<00:02:14.440> again<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:16.090> yeah<00:02:16.210> that's<00:02:17.110> quite<00:02:17.680> a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
get out again so yeah that's quite a

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.330 
get out again so yeah that's quite a
cool<00:02:17.980> feature<00:02:18.810> now<00:02:19.810> it's<00:02:20.530> I'm<00:02:21.010> not<00:02:21.130> really

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
cool feature now it's I'm not really

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.910 
cool feature now it's I'm not really
that<00:02:21.580> good<00:02:21.910> programming<00:02:22.870> redstone<00:02:23.410> wire<00:02:23.590> so

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
that good programming redstone wire so

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.390 
that good programming redstone wire so
that<00:02:24.190> wasn't<00:02:24.880> too<00:02:24.970> impressive<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.920> if<00:02:27.310> you

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
that wasn't too impressive so if you

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.540 
that wasn't too impressive so if you
want<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.580> know<00:02:28.320> some<00:02:29.320> basic<00:02:29.770> structure<00:02:30.040> did

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
want to know some basic structure did

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.530 
want to know some basic structure did
these<00:02:31.530> are<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.620> Pistons<00:02:33.240> basically<00:02:34.240> I<00:02:34.270> put

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
these are the Pistons basically I put

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.810 
these are the Pistons basically I put
redstone<00:02:34.780> wire<00:02:35.200> near<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.160> button<00:02:36.490> and

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
redstone wire near the button and

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.060 
redstone wire near the button and
redstone<00:02:37.270> wire<00:02:37.570> on<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.110> other<00:02:38.260> piston<00:02:38.860> so

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
redstone wire on the other piston so

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.180 
redstone wire on the other piston so
that<00:02:39.240> is<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.450> trigger<00:02:40.690> both<00:02:41.020> head<00:02:41.770> to<00:02:41.920> trigger

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
that is the trigger both head to trigger

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.240 
that is the trigger both head to trigger
the<00:02:42.730> top<00:02:42.910> in<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.180> bottom<00:02:43.480> piston<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.830> it<00:02:45.130> would

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
the top in the bottom piston so it would

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.460 
the top in the bottom piston so it would
push<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.459> bookshelf<00:02:45.970> that's<00:02:46.870> also<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.290> same

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
push the bookshelf that's also the same

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.040 
push the bookshelf that's also the same
in<00:02:47.650> other<00:02:47.830> side<00:02:48.190> but<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.700> little<00:02:49.630> trickier

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
in other side but a little trickier

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.350 
in other side but a little trickier
because<00:02:50.200> of<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.500> blanks<00:02:50.860> of<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.250> gap<00:02:52.290> here<00:02:53.340> so

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
because of the blanks of the gap here so

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.290 
because of the blanks of the gap here so
same<00:02:55.360> thing<00:02:55.390> except<00:02:56.790> there's<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:57.880> pressure

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
same thing except there's a pressure
