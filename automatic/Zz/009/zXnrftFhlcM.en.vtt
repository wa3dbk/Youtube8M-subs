okay<00:00:05.130> alligators<00:00:05.879> certainly<00:00:06.359> one<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.960> my

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
okay alligators certainly one of my

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.290 
okay alligators certainly one of my
favorite<00:00:07.589> reptiles<00:00:08.069> for<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> number<00:00:09.090> of

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
favorite reptiles for a number of

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.150 
favorite reptiles for a number of
reasons<00:00:09.540> first<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.260> all<00:00:10.380> let's<00:00:10.679> distinguish

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
reasons first of all let's distinguish

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.009 
reasons first of all let's distinguish
alligators<00:00:11.730> from<00:00:11.820> crocodiles<00:00:12.420> they're<00:00:12.870> all

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
alligators from crocodiles they're all

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.350 
alligators from crocodiles they're all
in<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.259> crocodilian<00:00:14.099> family<00:00:14.700> alligators<00:00:15.210> are

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
in the crocodilian family alligators are

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.140 
in the crocodilian family alligators are
a<00:00:15.389> subset<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.139> azog<00:00:16.830> Ariel's<00:00:17.430> Caymans

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
a subset of that azog Ariel's Caymans

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.029 
a subset of that azog Ariel's Caymans
and<00:00:18.390> true<00:00:18.840> crocodiles<00:00:19.439> like<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.800> Nile

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
and true crocodiles like the Nile

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.849 
and true crocodiles like the Nile
crocodile<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.390> that's<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:22.140> differentiator

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
crocodile so that's one differentiator

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.279 
crocodile so that's one differentiator
alligators<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.880> rounded<00:00:24.359> snout<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.779> them

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
alligators have a rounded snout on them

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.040 
alligators have a rounded snout on them
where<00:00:25.470> crocs<00:00:25.949> are<00:00:26.130> more<00:00:26.340> pointed<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.050> really

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
where crocs are more pointed and really

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.779 
where crocs are more pointed and really
alligators<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.800> always<00:00:28.980> say<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.189> was<00:00:29.369> kind<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.730> a

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
alligators I always say I was kind of a

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.880 
alligators I always say I was kind of a
smile<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.390> their<00:00:30.539> face<00:00:30.810> their<00:00:31.260> teeth<00:00:31.590> don't

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
smile to their face their teeth don't

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.680 
smile to their face their teeth don't
normally<00:00:32.369> protrude<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.270> one<00:00:33.450> does

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
normally protrude like this one does

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.590 
normally protrude like this one does
he's<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> young<00:00:34.530> alligator<00:00:35.070> alligators<00:00:35.880> rotate

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
he's a young alligator alligators rotate

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.139 
he's a young alligator alligators rotate
their<00:00:36.780> teeth<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.260> sharks<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.460> get<00:00:38.610> two<00:00:38.879> in

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
their teeth like sharks so we get two in

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.670 
their teeth like sharks so we get two in
our<00:00:39.270> lifetime<00:00:39.780> alligators<00:00:40.290> they<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.530> keep

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
our lifetime alligators they just keep

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.060 
our lifetime alligators they just keep
coming

coming

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.560 
coming
so<00:00:41.340> they're<00:00:41.489> constantly<00:00:41.700> falling<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.450> at

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
so they're constantly falling out at

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.420 
so they're constantly falling out at
this<00:00:42.690> age<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.500> new<00:00:43.680> tooth<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.100> coming

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
this age and a new tooth is coming

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.639 
this age and a new tooth is coming
behind<00:00:44.579> usually<00:00:45.480> crocodiles<00:00:46.230> teeth<00:00:46.469> are

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
behind usually crocodiles teeth are

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.440 
behind usually crocodiles teeth are
sticking<00:00:46.950> out<00:00:47.070> up<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.460> down<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.210> they<00:00:48.300> got

on<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> verge<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.500> extinction<00:01:07.890> due<00:01:08.340> to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
on the verge of extinction due to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.080 
on the verge of extinction due to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
that area of the world eat alligators so

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.830 
that area of the world eat alligators so
there's<00:01:13.979> very<00:01:14.130> very<00:01:14.189> few<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.909> those<00:01:15.360> left<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
there's very very few of those left the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.499 
there's very very few of those left the
rest<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.170> world<00:01:16.350> has<00:01:16.799> crocodiles<00:01:17.670> Caymans

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
but they're one of my favorite creatures

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.969 
but they're one of my favorite creatures
because<00:01:21.360> they're<00:01:21.930> they're<00:01:22.259> nature's<00:01:22.619> perfect

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
because they're they're nature's perfect

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
predator these animals were here 225

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.300 
predator these animals were here 225
million<00:01:27.119> years<00:01:27.360> ago<00:01:28.020> that's<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.650> big<00:01:28.890> number

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
million years ago that's a big number

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.640 
million years ago that's a big number
you<00:01:29.490> know<00:01:29.659> dinosaurs<00:01:30.659> disappeared<00:01:30.869> 65

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
you know dinosaurs disappeared 65

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.980 
you know dinosaurs disappeared 65
million<00:01:32.400> years<00:01:32.430> ago<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.420> first<00:01:33.630> one<00:01:33.840> was

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
million years ago and the first one was

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.370 
million years ago and the first one was
seen<00:01:34.170> about<00:01:34.640> 175<00:01:35.640> million<00:01:36.150> years<00:01:36.360> ago<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.200> what

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
seen about 175 million years ago so what

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.050 
seen about 175 million years ago so what
is<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.619> about<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.920> alligator<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
is it about the alligator and the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.960 
is it about the alligator and the
crocodile<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.960> kept<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.680> alive<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.700> long

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
crocodile that kept it alive for so long

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.789 
crocodile that kept it alive for so long
and<00:01:42.390> really<00:01:42.810> if<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.110> look<00:01:43.229> at<00:01:43.380> fossil<00:01:43.770> records

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
and really if you look at fossil records

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.889 
and really if you look at fossil records
they're<00:01:44.490> pretty<00:01:44.790> much<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.060> same<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:45.750> got<00:01:45.869> a

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
they're pretty much the same it's got a

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.080 
they're pretty much the same it's got a
lot<00:01:46.140> bigger<00:01:46.409> back<00:01:46.799> then<00:01:46.829> well<00:01:47.579> what<00:01:47.909> makes

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
lot bigger back then well what makes

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.389 
lot bigger back then well what makes
them<00:01:48.360> perfect<00:01:48.810> predators<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.500> everything

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
them perfect predators is everything
