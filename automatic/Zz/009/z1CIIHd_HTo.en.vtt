00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:24.079
 May 10 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.390

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.170
 green day

 if called temples and may 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.920
 there are comments 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.410
 for starters so that 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.490
 she has very little cord 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.630
 sheet 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.860
 but but 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.249
 exchange rates 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:42.369
 in that on advancement to find not 

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:43.800
 problem on the internet 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.050
 but the question arises ukrinform 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.350
 is used 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.820
 since he has our fellow citizens 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.590
 but now we have its location with 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.740
 sardines use moe 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.840
 so let's try to make out 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.810
 chord 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.210
 so the first chord is 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.650
 geely 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.190
 Only Astana has big features 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.890
 yes ring finger 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.010
 we will need to put the screen author 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.740
 eliminated against the fact that this time 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.630
 will turn out 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.020
 ring finger pinches one country 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.600
 on the third product 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.900
 middle finger sixth row on 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.740
 third year and 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.439
 I hold my index fingers 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.439
 on the second fist product 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.500
 so good next courts hard 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.140

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.420
 index fingers scandal 1 below 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.740
 below and middle finger 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.049

 indicative of man's third 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.730
 country 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.730

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:16.659
 middle finger 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.659
 fifth fourth line 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:27.839
 roads you begin to believe the device 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.509
 so stalin is alive 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:33.659
 just do not forget the focus of the DJ 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.549
 the ring finger is the same 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.549
 in the third year the second 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:41.329
 what is the device personally 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.989

 in the evening what do you need rotation 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.009
 the price 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:59.459
 that's what happens 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.549
 Mr. Mr. Mubarak 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.549
 still 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:12.319
 fourth 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.720
 percent 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.720
 Chornovil 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:27.779
 stand still court 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:30.309
 skipping 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:33.309
 finger preference 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.349
 the country we have bass largest old 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.859
 fifth 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.889
 how the same thing turns out 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:41.979
 earlier 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:43.249
 fourth 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:45.709
 yes percentage 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.709
 very important 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.049
 distance still court 

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:06.839
 here we start the force that's what he 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.509
 it will not look like this 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:13.929
 fourth 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:16.039
 the third knew 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.600
 tons 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.600
 mm 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.139
 it turns out 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.110
 but there are still courts of elan 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.529
 and bust on it is like colleges 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.529
 I feel like we are starting 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:56.249
 to 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.180
 Well, in general, something else 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.319
 that's what we got in the end 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.110
 percent 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:41.919
 eu 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.150
