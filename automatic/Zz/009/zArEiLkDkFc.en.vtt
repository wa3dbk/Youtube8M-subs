backups six a hundred or his main main

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.340 
backups six a hundred or his main main
thing<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.040> think<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.640> he's<00:02:12.600> representing

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
thing is to think that he's representing

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.110 
thing is to think that he's representing
a<00:02:13.440> medium<00:02:13.800> ace<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.250> Chris<00:02:14.430> top<00:02:14.610> slightly<00:02:14.970> to

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
a medium ace and Chris top slightly to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.460 
a medium ace and Chris top slightly to
check<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.660> him<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.900> if<00:02:15.959> he<00:02:16.050> does<00:02:16.260> he's

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
check it to him and if he does he's

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.570 
check it to him and if he does he's
gonna<00:02:16.560> try<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:16.920> take<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.190> away<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.459> that's

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
gonna try and take it away and that's
