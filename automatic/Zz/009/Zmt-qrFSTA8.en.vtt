 and changes in posture 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.569

 the column she is not born ready 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.970
 the babies born a single curve 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.030
 and throughout development when the child begins to have control in the

 head never had rats and clawed 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.020
 walk 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.500
 these curves that are forming over time 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.500
 to facilitate day-to-day activities in adulthood 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.490
 an adult's spine depends on an appropriate development at this stage of the 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.470
 life 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.620
 the weight and the way of carrying the backpack 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.449
 Can be 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.880
 an important factor in the development of the spine 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.470
 from 6 years of age the child starts preschool carries the backpack and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.160
 one of the first major pri 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.200
 options in which she uses to carry the backpack too bad by signal 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.540
 is to load neither side 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.700
 this discourages too much of the body's muscles 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.510
 gold eventually lifted 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.840
 the trunk muscles began 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.960
 much more tense to be able to balance the weight of the backpack 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.420
 and when you take ap 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.670
 the pope may cause important postural operations with you to see 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.740
 in the image the girl effa chose the site 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.010

 Chinese children this way of carrying a scent 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.290
 but a good option also carries the backpack on both shoulders 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.540
 but worth remembering in some details 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.750

 we do not let I'm kids and know 10% of his body weight 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.659
 this generates an excessive tension in the column 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.459
 hinders with a good positioning of the column produces in movement 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:26.269
 another tip

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:34.829
 even if the actual CGC weight the weight on the spine becomes very large 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.350
 making the shoulders not forward 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.869
 and opted for 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:42.869

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:49.049
 of posture 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.089
 and can prevent that there are from harmful adults to become adult 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:57.160
 that after all we also carry pocket 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.859
