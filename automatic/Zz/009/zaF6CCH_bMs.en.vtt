00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
descent so um yeah I have quite

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.630 
descent so um yeah I have quite
obviously<00:03:22.110> people<00:03:22.860> last<00:03:23.070> knows<00:03:23.250> quite<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.459> lot

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
obviously people last knows quite a lot

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.310 
obviously people last knows quite a lot
because<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:23.970> my<00:03:24.120> skin<00:03:24.330> tone<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.780> do<00:03:24.840> have<00:03:25.170> quite

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
because of my skin tone I do have quite

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.020 
because of my skin tone I do have quite
yellow<00:03:25.530> tone<00:03:25.769> skin<00:03:26.040> but<00:03:26.220> my<00:03:26.340> mum<00:03:26.489> has<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.790> same

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
yellow tone skin but my mum has the same

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.750 
yellow tone skin but my mum has the same
so<00:03:27.269> does<00:03:27.420> my<00:03:27.540> grandparents<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.380> even<00:03:29.040> like<00:03:29.580> my

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
so does my grandparents and even like my

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.550 
so does my grandparents and even like my
dad<00:03:29.940> he<00:03:30.209> tans<00:03:30.480> like<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:30.930> well<00:03:31.170> so<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:31.500> think

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
dad he tans like so well so I think

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.130 
dad he tans like so well so I think
that's<00:03:31.920> probably<00:03:32.040> why<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.580> get<00:03:32.970> quite<00:03:33.209> tan<00:03:33.450> but

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
that's probably why I get quite tan but

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.380 
that's probably why I get quite tan but
yeah<00:03:34.860> just<00:03:35.190> hundred<00:03:35.519> percent<00:03:35.790> British<00:03:36.120> really

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
write with my left hand so I'm

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.580 
write with my left hand so I'm
ambidextrous<00:04:02.640> think<00:04:02.850> that's<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.150> word<00:04:03.299> I

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
ambidextrous think that's the word I

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.080 
ambidextrous think that's the word I
prefer<00:04:04.590> to<00:04:04.739> draw<00:04:04.950> with<00:04:05.130> my<00:04:05.250> left<00:04:05.280> hand<00:04:05.670> and

prefer to draw with my left hand and

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.120 
prefer to draw with my left hand and
write<00:04:06.390> with<00:04:06.510> my<00:04:06.600> right<00:04:06.630> hand<00:04:06.810> but<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.410> can<00:04:07.680> I<00:04:07.709> can

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
write with my right hand but I can I can

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.460 
write with my right hand but I can I can
do<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.310> with<00:04:08.400> though<00:04:08.549> my<00:04:09.329> most<00:04:09.540> positive<00:04:09.989> trait

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
do it with though my most positive trait

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.810 
do it with though my most positive trait
would<00:04:10.739> probably<00:04:11.100> be<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.310> fact<00:04:11.459> that<00:04:11.610> I<00:04:11.670> am

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
would probably be the fact that I am

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.990 
would probably be the fact that I am
quite<00:04:12.239> hardworking<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.650> determined<00:04:14.190> and

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
quite hardworking and determined and

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.030 
quite hardworking and determined and
self-motivated<00:04:15.989> I<00:04:16.140> do<00:04:16.200> kind<00:04:16.560> of<00:04:16.620> push<00:04:16.829> myself

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
self-motivated I do kind of push myself

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.849 
self-motivated I do kind of push myself
quite<00:04:17.400> hard<00:04:17.640> but<00:04:18.269> my<00:04:19.049> most<00:04:19.229> negative<00:04:19.620> is<00:04:19.739> I

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
quite hard but my most negative is I

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:20.900 
quite hard but my most negative is I
worry<00:04:20.160> too<00:04:20.430> much

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
worry too much

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.580 
worry too much
and<00:04:21.000> it's<00:04:21.359> quite<00:04:21.599> off-putting<00:04:22.049> for<00:04:22.440> other

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
and it's quite off-putting for other

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.339 
and it's quite off-putting for other
people<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.910> think<00:04:24.840> it's<00:04:24.930> because<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.169> am<00:04:25.320> a

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
people and I think it's because I am a

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.700 
people and I think it's because I am a
high<00:04:25.560> achiever<00:04:26.070> I

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
high achiever I

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.650 
high achiever I
find<00:04:26.949> it<00:04:27.340> hard<00:04:27.639> not<00:04:27.880> being<00:04:28.060> in<00:04:28.210> control<00:04:28.389> and

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
find it hard not being in control and

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.360 
find it hard not being in control and
I'm<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:28.960> bit<00:04:29.110> of<00:04:29.169> a<00:04:29.229> control<00:04:29.590> freak<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:30.130> I<00:04:30.310> do

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
I'm a bit of a control freak and I do

but<00:05:05.380> I<00:05:05.410> think<00:05:05.590> that's<00:05:05.740> just<00:05:05.800> part<00:05:05.889> of<00:05:06.130> like<00:05:06.340> my

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
but I think that's just part of like my

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.879 
but I think that's just part of like my
whole<00:05:07.300> being<00:05:08.080> a<00:05:08.229> bit<00:05:08.380> of<00:05:08.440> a<00:05:08.500> control<00:05:08.680> freak

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
whole being a bit of a control freak

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.730 
whole being a bit of a control freak
type<00:05:09.370> and<00:05:09.550> my<00:05:10.360> chest<00:05:10.570> piercings<00:05:10.960> did<00:05:11.199> hurt

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
type and my chest piercings did hurt

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.469 
type and my chest piercings did hurt
they<00:05:11.979> were<00:05:12.039> quite<00:05:12.580> painful<00:05:13.120> when<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.240> got<00:05:13.389> them

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
they were quite painful when I got them

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.390 
they were quite painful when I got them
done<00:05:13.660> obviously<00:05:13.870> like<00:05:14.320> all<00:05:14.470> piercings<00:05:14.860> are<00:05:15.099> I

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.589 
done obviously like all piercings are I
think<00:05:15.699> it's<00:05:15.849> really<00:05:15.940> funny<00:05:16.180> question<00:05:16.509> when

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
think it's really funny question when

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.180 
think it's really funny question when
people<00:05:16.810> asked<00:05:17.080> like<00:05:17.229> oh<00:05:17.440> did<00:05:17.650> you<00:05:17.740> start<00:05:17.949> using

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
do and they didn't hurt that much like I

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.260
