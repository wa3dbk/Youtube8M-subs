green I like to do small batches this is

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.610 
green I like to do small batches this is
good<00:03:11.769> enough<00:03:11.920> for<00:03:12.070> me<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.430> do<00:03:12.989> two<00:03:13.989> gallons<00:03:14.500> of

good enough for me to do two gallons of

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.410 
good enough for me to do two gallons of
a<00:03:14.739> test<00:03:15.040> all<00:03:15.459> grain<00:03:15.730> batch<00:03:17.610> so<00:03:18.610> you<00:03:18.670> know<00:03:18.940> it's

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
a test all grain batch so you know it's

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.300 
a test all grain batch so you know it's
good<00:03:19.690> in<00:03:20.620> case<00:03:20.769> you<00:03:20.920> make<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.100> really

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
disgusting beer I mean I would still

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.380 
disgusting beer I mean I would still
drink<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.390> but

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.300 

just<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:29.380> you<00:03:29.470> know<00:03:29.500> nothing<00:03:29.620> hopeful<00:03:30.250> I've

just so you know nothing hopeful I've

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.449 
just so you know nothing hopeful I've
yelling<00:03:30.700> zone<00:03:31.680> also<00:03:32.680> with<00:03:32.800> this<00:03:32.920> pump<00:03:33.250> it's

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
yelling zone also with this pump it's

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.440 
yelling zone also with this pump it's
made<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.819> possible<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:35.610> go<00:03:36.610> from<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.090> hot

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
made it possible to go from the hot

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.730 
made it possible to go from the hot
liquor<00:03:37.660> tank<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:39.670> pump<00:03:39.910> and<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:41.230> can<00:03:41.440> fly

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
liquor tank to the pump and you can fly

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.660 
liquor tank to the pump and you can fly
spurge<00:03:42.690> with<00:03:43.690> this<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.930> I<00:03:46.959> just<00:03:47.410> took<00:03:47.770> the<00:03:47.830> yeah

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
spurge with this so I just took the yeah

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.590 
spurge with this so I just took the yeah
tubing<00:03:49.450> inside<00:03:49.660> this<00:03:50.640> spout<00:03:51.640> on<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:52.000> top<00:03:52.240> and

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
tubing inside this spout on the top and

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.729 
tubing inside this spout on the top and
I<00:03:52.690> also<00:03:52.720> crammed<00:03:53.970> another<00:03:54.970> dial<00:03:55.270> thermometer

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
I also crammed another dial thermometer

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.760 
I also crammed another dial thermometer
inside<00:03:56.739> there<00:03:57.010> so<00:03:57.850> I<00:03:57.880> can<00:03:58.180> easily<00:03:58.630> check<00:03:59.590> the

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
inside there so I can easily check the

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.640 
inside there so I can easily check the
temperature<00:04:00.250> inside<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.820> mash<00:04:01.150> time<00:04:03.090> yeah

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
temperature inside the mash time yeah

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.860 
temperature inside the mash time yeah
also<00:04:05.650> once<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.640> mashing<00:04:07.290> is<00:04:08.290> done<00:04:08.680> I<00:04:09.600> can<00:04:10.600> just

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
also once the mashing is done I can just

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.250 
also once the mashing is done I can just
easily<00:04:11.080> take<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:12.730> tubing<00:04:13.330> from<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.750> hot

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
easily take the tubing from the hot

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.220 
easily take the tubing from the hot
liquor<00:04:14.470> tank<00:04:14.910> put<00:04:15.910> it<00:04:16.090> onto<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.480> spout<00:04:16.780> here

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
liquor tank put it onto the spout here

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.390 
liquor tank put it onto the spout here
and<00:04:17.470> then<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:18.519> can<00:04:18.579> do<00:04:18.820> for<00:04:19.090> locked<00:04:20.100> right<00:04:21.100> into

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
and then I can do for locked right into

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.720 
and then I can do for locked right into
here<00:04:21.669> until<00:04:22.150> I<00:04:22.270> see<00:04:22.480> that<00:04:22.950> you<00:04:23.950> know<00:04:23.980> I<00:04:24.340> can

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
here until I see that you know I can

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.750 
here until I see that you know I can
easily<00:04:25.180> look<00:04:27.960> you<00:04:28.960> tell<00:04:29.110> it's<00:04:29.290> clear<00:04:29.590> so<00:04:30.550> say

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
easily look you tell it's clear so say

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.440 
easily look you tell it's clear so say
this<00:04:30.940> is<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.570> tubing<00:04:32.340> will<00:04:33.340> be<00:04:33.520> recirculating

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
this is the tubing will be recirculating

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.210 
this is the tubing will be recirculating
back<00:04:34.660> in<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:36.130> see<00:04:36.280> that<00:04:36.430> it's<00:04:36.610> clear<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.450> know

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
back in and see that it's clear you know

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.790 
back in and see that it's clear you know
and<00:04:39.220> then<00:04:39.970> it<00:04:40.479> works<00:04:40.720> good<00:04:41.020> so<00:04:41.229> I<00:04:41.260> can<00:04:41.500> use<00:04:41.680> this

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
and then it works good so I can use this

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.969 
and then it works good so I can use this
not<00:04:42.010> only<00:04:42.130> for<00:04:42.520> a<00:04:42.660> strike<00:04:43.660> water<00:04:43.930> pump<00:04:44.710> but<00:04:44.890> I

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
not only for a strike water pump but I

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.790 
not only for a strike water pump but I
can<00:04:45.130> also<00:04:45.280> use<00:04:45.430> it<00:04:45.760> for<00:04:45.790> a<00:04:45.970> fall<00:04:46.180> off<00:04:46.440> and<00:04:47.440> also

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
can also use it for a fall off and also

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.659 
can also use it for a fall off and also
once<00:04:48.250> fall<00:04:48.490> off<00:04:48.700> is<00:04:48.880> finished<00:04:49.419> I<00:04:49.630> can<00:04:50.080> just

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
once fall off is finished I can just

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.140 
once fall off is finished I can just
take<00:04:51.669> the<00:04:51.850> tubing<00:04:52.240> out<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:53.710> put<00:04:54.700> it<00:04:54.790> into<00:04:55.000> my

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
take the tubing out and put it into my

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.460 
take the tubing out and put it into my
brew<00:04:55.330> pot

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.040 

so<00:04:59.280> you<00:04:59.340> know<00:04:59.550> it's<00:04:59.730> pretty<00:04:59.790> good<00:05:02.750> that's<00:05:03.750> my

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.570 
setup as of now I'm really excited about
this<00:05:08.220> pump<00:05:09.530> really<00:05:10.530> excited<00:05:11.040> that<00:05:11.160> I<00:05:11.190> put<00:05:11.460> that

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
this pump really excited that I put that

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.540 
this pump really excited that I put that
thermometer<00:05:12.030> on<00:05:12.900> that<00:05:13.530> brew<00:05:13.800> pot<00:05:16.100> it<00:05:17.100> used<00:05:17.430> to
