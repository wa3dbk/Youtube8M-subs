00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.309
 I also watch some news and very 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.920
 it is interesting to watch on Russian channels 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.040
 more about stories about one character 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.260
 Russian Orthodox Church we are not 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.350
 we will mock the feelings of believers 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.869
 it's wrong but on 1 father you know 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.269
 even called a pop star 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:28.640
 what happened there for some reason and even then 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:32.850
 transfer from gordon invited opponents 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.489
 who would destroy what I want well 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.340
 how would I want people to be interested in 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.629
 that we have a much deeper story 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.030
 I therefore visited you in Tripoli 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.090
 for example, I talked about this in the transfer 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.340
 Gordon that she here excavations in Ukraine 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.469
 5 thousand years BC 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.260
 guys Sumerian state was not 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.719
 even under the Egyptian pyramids is empty 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.940
 there is already nothing that is at this time yet 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.410
 life was not there why aren't we 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.340
 pay attention you have such 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.680
 Professor Shila 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.290
 he for example is very interesting 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.830
 about this they cut it all left 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.860
 just like they are screaming at me there 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.780
 that by the will of such an insult 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.930
 came and was this one 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.490
 I don't want to call him 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.369
 priest priest and therefore 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.430
 that he pop up up and since the time of Pushkin 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.000
 there was always a little ironic tale of 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.310
 the pope and the worker balde Pushkin is brilliant 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 wrote before you re-read 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.000
 understand who should be called dads and 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.100
 Pushkin 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.760
 you can not roll on me and there was such 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.070
 when he said this nonsense and say how well 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.610
 tripoli well how is this nonsense arkaim what nonsense 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.040
 I now saw on the stones of Lake Onezh 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.710
 drawings sorry 25 thousand years before our 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.190
 era and six thousand years before ours and how with 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.940
 this to be 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:01.660
 Well, as with this to be, you recognized that 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.440
 the sun does not go around the earth just 200 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.440
 years ago 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.020
 and recently recognized the solar system 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.759
 guys we can't wait any longer while you 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.660
 Recognize where in the church so much aggression 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.570
 A New Look 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.370
 I generally think that religion is faith 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:22.150
 faith is faith for people 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.030
 spiritualized creative religion she in 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.520
 frame thinking pushes but the difference 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.920
 there is between I can not explain it to people 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.709
 who can not rise above what about 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.660
 we now say many need religion 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.060
 they believe that if you put a candle 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.519
 interest in the bank will increase or what 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.959
 will come to elections in the elections will come uncle 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:48.820
 feed them there is no self must do 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:51.310
 because it is generally dim here, too, I wrote 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.920
 one program with this reasoning here 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.330
 our ancestors are very old very 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.480
 longstanding they spoke first 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:04.269
 peasants never brought people the same 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.950
 fighters sacrificed this later 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.079
 warriors started all our ancestors lived 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.690
 limp you know that in our ancients 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.239
 cities there are no fortress walls they are not thread 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.290
 defended si fortress walls stand by 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.450
 Europe 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.140
 and we soon have the first time when the Crusaders 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:23.620
 heard our ancestors did not fight and said 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:27.450
 we are children of God it is and you are Jesus 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:32.980
 I said the son of God and he said it all 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:36.280
 not a slave and the difference is significant than 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.510
 believer son of god and religious slave 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.090
 god and what's the difference 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.090
 God's servant will make a mess in nature 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.370
 when they go to the kebabs and be sure 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.290
 behind 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.310
 you will not pick up this son of God 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:55.340
 make from because dad created the world to them 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.000
 I can't spoil their dad 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:02.450
 barely a royal room to please except cad 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.720
 bible search just yes yes son was 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:09.470
 Son of God is cheating on his wife and asking 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.290
 forgiveness of someone dinner and God's servant 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.480
 asks the Lord forgive him and Lord 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.230
 he is going to change again and not the son of God 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.900
 will go more 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.680
 or think why the spring is so 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.180
 God forgiven the guys in a crap or you 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.490
 what did they do to me 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.039
 you change them go and ask them 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.490
 Doing this, I solve all my problems with 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:34.880
 they son of God makes his own destiny 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.919
 first of all, but hope that the economy 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.010
 countries use to open 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:43.940
 his opportunities and the servant of God is waiting for his uncle 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:46.280
 coming therefore when slaves in big 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.010
 quantity critical mass of slave 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:54.190
 thinking exceeds faith begins 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.190
 elections and elections never end
