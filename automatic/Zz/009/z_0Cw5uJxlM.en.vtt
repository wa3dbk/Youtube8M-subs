waves nice and early they're not the
actual<00:01:24.350> rid<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> board<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:25.950> co

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
actual rid of the board you can co

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.310 
actual rid of the board you can co
getting<00:01:26.400> relief<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.030> towards<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.420> tail<00:01:27.720> so

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
getting relief in towards the tail so

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.480 
getting relief in towards the tail so
that's<00:01:28.470> just<00:01:28.560> keeping<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.040> as<00:01:29.130> maneuverable

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
that's just keeping it as maneuverable

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.060 
that's just keeping it as maneuverable
as<00:01:29.820> possible<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:31.020> tail<00:01:31.229> shapes<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.799> nice

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
as possible in the tail shapes and nice

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.060 
as possible in the tail shapes and nice
lot<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.460> flowing<00:01:33.320> down<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> tip<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
lot of flowing down to the tip of the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.190 
lot of flowing down to the tip of the
tail<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.939> we've<00:01:36.060> got<00:01:36.180> no<00:01:36.390> stingers<00:01:36.930> there's<00:01:37.110> no

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
tail so we've got no stingers there's no

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.840 
tail so we've got no stingers there's no
interruption<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.100> constant<00:01:38.610> curve

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
interruption to that constant curve

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.410 
interruption to that constant curve
through<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.710> tail<00:01:40.710> into<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> board

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.539 

deep<00:01:45.110> swallowtail<00:01:45.770> just<00:01:46.159> let<00:01:46.310> your<00:01:46.430> old

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
deep swallowtail just let your old

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.230 
deep swallowtail just let your old
school<00:01:47.229> swallowtail<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.820> wouldn't<00:01:49.820> see<00:01:50.030> the

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
school swallowtail I wouldn't see the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.609 
school swallowtail I wouldn't see the
moon<00:01:50.540> string<00:01:50.810> around<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.080> edges<00:01:51.259> and

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
moon string around the edges and

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.920 
moon string around the edges and
underneath<00:01:53.229> we've<00:01:54.229> gotta<00:01:54.409> kill<00:01:54.710> thing<00:01:54.979> set<00:01:55.700> up

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
underneath we've gotta kill thing set up

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.929 
underneath we've gotta kill thing set up
so<00:01:56.930> this<00:01:57.530> particular<00:01:57.649> ball<00:01:58.100> come<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.490> FCS

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
so this particular ball come to the FCS

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.670 
so this particular ball come to the FCS
but<00:01:59.210> I<00:01:59.240> mean<00:01:59.390> you<00:01:59.420> can<00:01:59.570> get<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.840> futures<00:02:00.409> as

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
but I mean you can get the futures as

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.800 
but I mean you can get the futures as
well<00:02:01.070> now<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.549> obviously<00:02:02.030> you'll<00:02:02.360> get<00:02:02.479> a<00:02:02.509> kill

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
well now and obviously you'll get a kill

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.609 
well now and obviously you'll get a kill
Finn<00:02:03.110> it'll<00:02:03.710> be<00:02:03.830> a<00:02:03.860> lightweight<00:02:04.580> kill<00:02:04.880> Finn

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
Finn it'll be a lightweight kill Finn

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.510 
Finn it'll be a lightweight kill Finn
which<00:02:06.619> is<00:02:06.740> just<00:02:06.890> going<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.070> lend<00:02:07.250> itself

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
which is just going to lend itself

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.190 
which is just going to lend itself
really<00:02:07.789> well<00:02:07.909> to<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.860> manufacturing<00:02:09.860> process

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
really well to the manufacturing process

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.170 
really well to the manufacturing process
that<00:02:12.200> basically<00:02:12.530> allows<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.700> supposed<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.150> be

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
that basically allows you supposed to be

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.550 
that basically allows you supposed to be
very<00:02:14.620> good<00:02:15.620> instructor<00:02:16.340> weight<00:02:16.519> ratio<00:02:17.560> we've

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
very good instructor weight ratio we've

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.620 
very good instructor weight ratio we've
got<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:19.010> smaller<00:02:19.640> board<00:02:19.880> like<00:02:20.060> this<00:02:20.090> it's<00:02:20.420> quite

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
got a smaller board like this it's quite

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.390 
got a smaller board like this it's quite
wide<00:02:20.870> it's<00:02:21.230> obviously<00:02:21.590> going<00:02:21.739> to<00:02:21.800> be<00:02:21.980> not<00:02:22.220> as

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
wide it's obviously going to be not as

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.370 
wide it's obviously going to be not as
flexible<00:02:22.819> as<00:02:23.180> some<00:02:23.720> of<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.959> thinner

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
flexible as some of the thinner

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.710 
flexible as some of the thinner
high-performance<00:02:25.280> boards<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:26.269> a<00:02:26.299> good

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
high-performance boards so a good

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.420 
high-performance boards so a good
overall<00:02:27.019> Finn<00:02:27.470> for<00:02:27.620> this<00:02:27.769> board<00:02:28.040> is<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.190> thing

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
overall Finn for this board is a thing

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.800 
overall Finn for this board is a thing
that's<00:02:28.580> going<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.790> create<00:02:28.970> decent

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
that's going to create decent

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.300 
that's going to create decent
flexibility<00:02:30.530> would<00:02:30.769> still<00:02:31.010> be<00:02:31.100> lightweight

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
flexibility would still be lightweight

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.280 
flexibility would still be lightweight
still<00:02:31.880> going<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.060> working<00:02:32.450> smaller<00:02:32.900> surface

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
still going to working smaller surface

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.380 
still going to working smaller surface
not<00:02:33.620> going<00:02:33.769> to<00:02:33.830> wake<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.040> boil<00:02:34.400> so<00:02:34.700> for<00:02:35.330> that

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
not going to wake a boil so for that

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.729 
not going to wake a boil so for that
reason<00:02:35.450> we<00:02:35.780> wouldn't<00:02:35.989> recommend<00:02:36.350> riding<00:02:36.650> this

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
reason we wouldn't recommend riding this

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.890 
reason we wouldn't recommend riding this
with<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.010> big<00:02:37.220> wooden<00:02:37.519> fins<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.090> stick<00:02:38.840> with

with the big wooden fins and stick with
the<00:02:38.989> lightweight<00:02:39.380> kill<00:02:39.769> things<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.280> you'll

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
the lightweight kill things and you'll

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.449 
the lightweight kill things and you'll
find<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.700> perform<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.120> lot<00:02:41.209> better<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:43.220> actual

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
find it perform a lot better the actual

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.570 
find it perform a lot better the actual
edges<00:02:43.760> through<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.090> board<00:02:44.980> supergirls<00:02:45.980> up

towards<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.060> midsection<00:02:47.510> very<00:02:48.200> rounded<00:02:48.739> very

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
towards the midsection very rounded very

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.190 
towards the midsection very rounded very
smooth<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:49.880> that's<00:02:50.420> just<00:02:50.600> making<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:50.989> board

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
smooth and that's just making the board

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.020 
smooth and that's just making the board
for<00:02:51.350> giving<00:02:51.680> allowing<00:02:52.130> it<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.280> be<00:02:52.549> turned

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
for giving allowing it to be turned

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.970 
for giving allowing it to be turned
easily<00:02:53.480> one<00:02:53.630> not<00:02:53.840> moving<00:02:54.200> at<00:02:54.290> high<00:02:54.410> speed<00:02:54.440> and

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
easily one not moving at high speed and

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.979 
easily one not moving at high speed and
so<00:02:55.700> we're<00:02:55.790> going<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:55.970> suit<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.390> intermediates

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
so we're going to suit the intermediates

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.990 
so we're going to suit the intermediates
but<00:02:57.650> as<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:57.890> get<00:02:58.040> your<00:02:58.130> feet<00:02:58.340> further<00:02:58.579> back<00:02:58.820> as

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
but as you get your feet further back as

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.610 
but as you get your feet further back as
with<00:02:59.180> any<00:02:59.269> board<00:02:59.600> it's<00:02:59.870> going<00:03:00.109> to<00:03:00.140> become<00:03:00.320> more

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
with any board it's going to become more

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.500 
with any board it's going to become more
maneuverable<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.640> we<00:03:01.730> start<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.030> ride<00:03:02.329> off

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
maneuverable and we start to ride off

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.110 
maneuverable and we start to ride off
the<00:03:02.540> sharp<00:03:03.079> edge<00:03:03.579> it's<00:03:04.579> a<00:03:04.609> good<00:03:04.790> thing<00:03:04.970> about

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
the sharp edge it's a good thing about

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.849 
the sharp edge it's a good thing about
these<00:03:05.359> epoxy<00:03:05.870> Firewise<00:03:06.320> they<00:03:06.590> can<00:03:06.709> get<00:03:06.829> a

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
these epoxy Firewise they can get a

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.770 
these epoxy Firewise they can get a
really<00:03:07.190> good<00:03:07.220> edge<00:03:07.489> in<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.760> tail<00:03:07.970> which<00:03:08.570> gives

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
really good edge in the tail which gives

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.509 
really good edge in the tail which gives
a<00:03:08.840> good<00:03:08.989> bite<00:03:09.230> through<00:03:09.470> your<00:03:09.650> turns<00:03:09.890> with

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
a good bite through your turns with

keeping the board nice and fast it's

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.280 
keeping the board nice and fast it's
also<00:03:27.829> helping<00:03:28.370> wave<00:03:28.640> entry<00:03:29.060> again<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:30.049> as<00:03:30.170> we

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
also helping wave entry again and as we

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.270 
also helping wave entry again and as we
get<00:03:30.380> down<00:03:30.500> towards<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.859> tail<00:03:31.069> of<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.250> board

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
get down towards the tail of the board

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.190 
get down towards the tail of the board
we've<00:03:31.640> got<00:03:31.850> a<00:03:32.709> definite<00:03:33.790> scoop<00:03:34.790> through<00:03:35.200> other

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
we've got a definite scoop through other

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.479 
we've got a definite scoop through other
side<00:03:36.530> of<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.709> fins<00:03:36.980> we've<00:03:37.190> got<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.310> race

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
side of the fins we've got a race

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:38.979 
side of the fins we've got a race
sections<00:03:37.970> through<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.180> center<00:03:38.600> here<00:03:38.720> and

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
sections through the center here and

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.470 
sections through the center here and
that's<00:03:39.200> allowing<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.620> bottle<00:03:39.980> rock<00:03:40.280> from<00:03:41.060> one

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
that's allowing the bottle rock from one

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.479 
that's allowing the bottle rock from one
thin<00:03:41.780> sealer<00:03:42.139> so<00:03:42.590> we've<00:03:42.709> got<00:03:42.829> race<00:03:43.040> section

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
thin sealer so we've got race section

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.400 
thin sealer so we've got race section
through<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.760> center<00:03:44.209> and<00:03:44.420> then<00:03:44.780> two<00:03:45.019> scoops

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
through the center and then two scoops

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.559 
through the center and then two scoops
either<00:03:45.889> side<00:03:46.280> which<00:03:46.459> is<00:03:46.579> helping<00:03:46.940> for<00:03:47.299> that

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
either side which is helping for that

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.990 
either side which is helping for that

board a small weak surf we're going to

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.520 
board a small weak surf we're going to
keep<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.669> speed<00:04:40.970> up<00:04:41.000> and<00:04:41.630> keep<00:04:41.930> turns<00:04:42.260> going

out<00:04:50.060> there<00:04:50.240> with<00:04:50.330> is<00:04:50.450> so<00:04:50.660> small<00:04:50.930> an<00:04:51.110> average
