00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 nine people i have a shorty today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.400
 for you like your tail or what no 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.840
 No, like my cock around this stupid 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.019
 wortwitz ever anticipate 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.820
 but came up with a short topic now 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.470
 I do not need so much talk 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.480
 I'll always be there when I come in 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.020
 good topic have something really short and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.310
 crisp is mario view behind it 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.160
 I think it's really funny 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.400
 look at it and then look at it today 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.869
 It's about me thinking 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.610
 I wonder if maybe it can be 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.300
 that someday you get too old for 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.980
 is gambling 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.270
 I have always in my comment 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.829
 said and live videos that I am the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.270
 I am of the opinion that I am still old 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.829
 learn a lot but learn 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.309
 I'm not anymore 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.600
 sure 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.820
 and the reason is I have her yesterday 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.949
 need to buy new xbox live and me 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.660
 order that always examples so could 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.520
 Here advertising before profit and there is me 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.879
 sometimes noticed when browsing the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.820
 whole games where i am at nintendo sony 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.189
 and microsoft the respective consoles 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.049
 The game has many good looks 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.840
 I play in any case in the past 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.729
 had missed and I have missed 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.030
 then seen for example bioshock 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.150
 or assassin's creed or this one 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.040
 de france this online rpg shooter 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.710
 I would have bought sooner 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.380
 I can not get everything anymore and because 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.390
 i have baking box right nowadays 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.299
 somehow I only had a few more 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.180
 player multi player multiplayer games 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.700
 and I really love to play 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.130
 like now for example monster hunter 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.189
 or vorge so 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.259
 and somehow in time then 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.540
 with max, for example, each one got us 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.000
 xbox game which was good enough 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.460
 we bought ourselves and so as 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.880
 Adolescents or themselves in their early 20s 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.340
 I certainly had 150 nintendo wii 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.140
 game 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.880
 no matter how bad they were so I was 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.600
 also would probably be the turnover 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.159
 So I did with casual games 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.379
 was always where to get a golden one 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.840
 earn nose I could've easily 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.230
 just bought because want to have as well 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.459
 I also had playstation around the 40th 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.950
 playstation games xbox even more 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.720
 definitely to the 100 and now if I am 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.879
 so i look into my player shelf 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.530
 quite a lot sold and have now 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:27.819
 only highlights like that 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.739
 halo series the uncharted row killzone 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.220
 series and such things I have on 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.500
 begin 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.420
 and just so on or 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.209
 Continuing anyway how 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.049
 at Assassin's creed 1 and 2 I have 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.440
 totally wanted but brotherhood there 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.640
 Has 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.260
 I do not have any more 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.480
 bought because I just do not mind 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.739
 somehow I had understood that even 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.510
 namely would be interested in whether 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.010
 Which of you are now similar in 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.180
 my age pictures are so I am 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.000
 now 28 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.739
 if they already have that feeling 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.180
 I do not need every game anymore 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.549
 and I do not want that at all 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.260
 Do not watch me watch a video 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.880
 or so but actually I want 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.109
 Not 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.940
 and maybe that will eventually happen 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.410
 that at some point maybe even 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.790
 not playing anymore with me 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.069
 I can not imagine 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.690
 because I buy me the new consoles 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.310
 but when I think now so exactly that 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.200
 which I play free now 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.950
 it's really just the next one 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.510
 pokemon lizard and otherwise we would have there 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.609
 just never so much 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.340
 I would like your opinion 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:32.310
 are interested in the topic posts 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.310
 just underneath and yes it's good 1000
