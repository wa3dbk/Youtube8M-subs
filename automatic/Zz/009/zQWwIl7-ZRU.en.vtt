00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.469
 hey people what are ten hetzel 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.360
 group more tutorials and gdf 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.610
 but must ne sorry for that 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.800
 channel now two days or so inactive 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.480
 profit was partly due to the feedback at 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.980
 last video my feedback 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.689
 I hewn at the comments I 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.949
 I will try videos now 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.330
 I upload one hundred 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.830
 percent sure that he celebrate the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.990
 Become and not such in 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.789
 quotes unnecessary videos like 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.060
 Some have titled as the last 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.070
 times 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.450
 and today there is such a glitch of that 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.219
 I can say that everyone is celebrating 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.050
 because through this you can do everything 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.879
 could buy for free in bugatti 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.260
 free of charge you can get all the planes 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.300
 the times for two million 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.860
 he can just buy everything without that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.739
 you lose your money I show you now 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.149
 how it starts is important 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.770
 to mention that you money what 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.360
 They usually smile for the object 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.190
 should also have to have on your account 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.300
 For example, I wanted a bugatti for one 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.460
 then you have to have a million dollars 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.420
 Once on your account, buy yourself 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.489
 after that democracy 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.890
 then you will not lose the money 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.270
 but you still get the object as 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.530
 the first one starts the development 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.479
 lammersdorf and would be from a buddy 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.369
 Very important in the meeting only for 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.689
 players are invited with invitation 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.520
 right in the meeting 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.200
 then press the start button in the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.330
 menu from gta online 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.560
 He goes to the category online and then 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.450
 he changes to the beta phase of the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.159
 editors clearer and other phase there is 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.409
 yes not yet and created afterwards 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.790
 you are a normal deathmatch you are 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.590
 then in this deathmatch you have to get in there 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.729
 Make sure you test this 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.560
 You could do that by just doing her 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.390
 the whole sport points sets the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.070
 Deathmatch simply gives a title etc 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.299
 everything with it the exclamation point 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.579
 next to the individual categories 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.710
 disappear and then you just go 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.540
 test in the category and start the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.220
 Just let me kill you once 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.170
 and keep that pet down 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.420
 pressed and then you finish this 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.860
 just play again in the next reigned 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.390
 Just go back down here 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.369
 and have you done that, you're about to land 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.020
 in another menu and you are in 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.240
 This last mini arrived then goes 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.979
 he's all the way down to gta 5 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.689
 offline that means you land 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.759
 now in offline mode and squeezed there 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.899
 He starts the button and goes to the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.729
 category game 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.020
 There you choose mission again 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.880
 play and play again the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.069
 product so the first mission is possible 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.020
 yes, five story mode are you in there 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.090
 then we wait a short time a10 to ns 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.020
 as expected until you join us 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.250
 move michael 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.630
 that means you can run in circles 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.330
 could shoot tizian now invites you 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.070
 Your buddy from just in the same meeting 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.140
 again, that means very important again 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.090
 in the same meeting where you just in 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.470
 editor created the deathmatch and 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.580
 you take the course invitation to 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.840
 now it can be a bit longer 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.940
 take as usual 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.140
 until long here in the session 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.610
 Do not worry the glitch will 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.420
 Nevertheless , the world is the same in the world 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.310
 be in it 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.900
 and your money is tiled that 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.820
 means you can buy everything without 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.800
 to lose some money 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.970
 and when I say everything, I mean 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.380
 really everything you can 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.970
 buy houses you can buy cars 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.100
 You can also do your shopping 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.990
 You could buy planes 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.490
 Buy we can do everything you 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.870
 even want ammo for your weapons 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.210
 I would suggest you simply want to 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.860
 two relatively expensive and what you all 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.900
 so you can buy for free 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.340
 simply times everything because then he'll 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.600
 In any case, I will not lose anymore 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.010
 Hope in any case, the member state you 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.330

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.800
