00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.730 
loose in their sample department and I
just<00:00:24.029> almost<00:00:24.210> didn't<00:00:24.660> leave<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:25.109> was<00:00:25.560> that

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
package of amazing things that you'll

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.769 
package of amazing things that you'll
see<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.099> coming<00:00:29.220> months<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.630> my

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
see in the coming months but this is my

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.600 
see in the coming months but this is my
hands<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.560> those<00:00:31.800> favorite<00:00:32.250> thing<00:00:32.399> when<00:00:32.489> I

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
hands on those favorite thing when I

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.819 
hands on those favorite thing when I
found<00:00:32.759> all<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.059> was<00:00:33.180> there<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> piece

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
found all I was there this is a piece

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.380 
found all I was there this is a piece
that<00:00:34.860> they<00:00:35.100> designed<00:00:35.430> in-house<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.030> produced

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
that they designed in-house and produced

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.709 
that they designed in-house and produced
for<00:00:36.660> codec<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.610> it's<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.820> double<00:00:39.180> open<00:00:39.510> gate

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
for codec and it's a double open gate

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.200 
for codec and it's a double open gate
with<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> swinger<00:00:40.590> technique<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.250> well<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.030> it's

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
with a swinger technique as well so it's

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.030 
with a swinger technique as well so it's
got<00:00:42.329> four<00:00:42.600> swinger<00:00:42.930> folds<00:00:43.290> plus<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> double

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
got four swinger folds plus a double

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.010 
got four swinger folds plus a double
open<00:00:44.340> gates<00:00:44.550> an<00:00:44.789> open<00:00:45.090> gate<00:00:45.300> if<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.870> watch

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
open gates an open gate if you watch

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.080 
open gates an open gate if you watch
full<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.469> week<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.829> then<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.219> fold<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
full of the week it's then the fold the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.729 
full of the week it's then the fold the
panels<00:00:48.450> fold<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.870> toward<00:00:49.170> each<00:00:49.230> other<00:00:49.350> leg<00:00:49.620> or

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
panels fold in toward each other leg or

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.049 
panels fold in toward each other leg or
your<00:00:49.770> gate<00:00:50.100> fold<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:50.550> then<00:00:50.670> there<00:00:50.789> are<00:00:50.820> two

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
your gate fold but then there are two

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.700 
your gate fold but then there are two
more<00:00:51.210> panels<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.780> fold<00:00:51.989> out<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
more panels that fold out in the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.049 
more panels that fold out in the
opposing<00:00:53.010> directions<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.730> they're<00:00:53.850> pretty

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
opposing directions so they're pretty

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.630 
opposing directions so they're pretty
unusual<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.320> really<00:00:55.559> cool<00:00:55.860> technique

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
unusual but it's a really cool technique

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.180 
unusual but it's a really cool technique
okay<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> double<00:00:58.350> open<00:00:58.800> gate<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.129> it

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
okay so this is a double open gate so it

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.090 
okay so this is a double open gate so it
goes<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.300> out<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.230> check<00:01:01.500> check<00:01:01.920> this

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
goes in out in out so check check this

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.299 
goes in out in out so check check this
out<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.120> cool<00:01:03.359> okay<00:01:03.780> oh<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.129> cover

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
out it's so cool okay oh and the cover

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.160 
out it's so cool okay oh and the cover
says<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:05.850> about<00:01:06.210> time<00:01:06.479> someone<00:01:06.780> removed

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
says it's about time someone removed

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.510 
says it's about time someone removed
time<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.650> distance<00:01:07.979> from<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> print

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
time and distance from the print

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.969 
time and distance from the print
production<00:01:08.670> workflow<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.530> got<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.770> kind

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
production workflow so it got this kind

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.760 
production workflow so it got this kind
of<00:01:11.010> time<00:01:11.280> savings<00:01:11.820> theme<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.409> opens

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
of time savings theme and so it opens

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.109 
of time savings theme and so it opens
like<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:15.200> how<00:01:16.200> amazing<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.430> I'll<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.000> it

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
like this how amazing is that I'll do it

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.200 
like this how amazing is that I'll do it
again<00:01:18.920> so<00:01:19.920> when<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.340> open<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.700> out<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.090> get

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
again so when you open it out you get

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.910 
again so when you open it out you get
these<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.689> clocks<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.500> four<00:01:22.770> different

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
these for clocks with four different

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.969 
these for clocks with four different
time<00:01:23.340> zones<00:01:23.700> San<00:01:24.390> Francisco<00:01:24.869> Denver<00:01:25.080> Chicago

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
time zones San Francisco Denver Chicago

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.320 
time zones San Francisco Denver Chicago
and<00:01:26.189> New<00:01:26.310> York<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.759> they<00:01:26.850> work<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.150> whole

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and New York so they work this whole

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.140 
and New York so they work this whole
time<00:01:27.600> zone<00:01:27.960> time<00:01:28.409> savings<00:01:28.860> concept<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.939> these

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
time zone time savings concept and these

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.929 
time zone time savings concept and these
clocks<00:01:30.600> swing<00:01:31.290> out<00:01:31.530> okay<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.640> swinger

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
clocks swing out okay the swinger

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.569 
clocks swing out okay the swinger
technique<00:01:33.360> there<00:01:33.600> you've<00:01:33.720> got<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.930> score<00:01:34.579> short

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
technique there you've got a score short

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.670 
technique there you've got a score short
score<00:01:35.850> short<00:01:36.119> score<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.720> die<00:01:37.140> right<00:01:37.650> here

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
score short score and a die right here

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.609 
score short score and a die right here
but<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.310> die<00:01:38.640> cuts<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.240> clock<00:01:39.900> out<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.500> there

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
but the die cuts that clock out of there
