 Gamers Review: Assassins Creed Unity 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.600
 Abstergo, the company that specializes in making you 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.660
 relive the lives of their ancestors through the Animus, has prepared a new adventure 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.860
 for you. On this occasion, you will travel to the city 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.860
 of Paris of the 18th century, in particular, at the beginning of the French Revolution. Your objective, 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.180
 will be to find a person who could have the triple-helix genes with which they interact 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.100
 the Assassin Arno Dorian and that could be crucial in the fellowship's investigation. 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.100
 So let's live one of the most important chapters of the legendary war between assassins 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.059
 and Templars in Assassin's Creed Unity. This title marks the arrival of the series for 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.890
 the next generation, and aims to harness the power of both connections 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.890
 graphical and social to offer a little different from previous experience. 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.440
 Arno is a young Parisian who was raised by the noble FranÃ§oise de la Serre, and in love 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.440
 by his daughter and long-time friend Elise de la Serre. But unknowingly, his novel is 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.420
 impossible because, while he has Blood of Killer, Elise has Templar blood. 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.420
 That's why your novel becomes tragedy. The game takes place in an exact recreation of 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.619
 as Paris was then. With majestic palaces and mansions full of nobility luxuries, more 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.920
 streets and neighborhoods where the poverty of the people is expressed and why they decided to overthrow 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.920
 the monarchy. All scenarios are detailed up to 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.920
 more intimate detail including historic sites such as the Palace of Versailles and Notre Dame. 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.920
 Similarly, the streets are full of different factions and clothing including, which implies 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.480
 which was populated city at the time. Although it may seem a little overdone at times. The game 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.840
 uses a new graphics engine that allows dozens and even hundreds of characters 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.810
 on screen at the same time, although most of them have no particular actions. This aspect 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.379
 does not seem perfect, since there will be situations where you pass through as 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.440
 ghosts or some minor character gets stuck and will not let you continue 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.730
 with the mission. As is tradition in the series, you can visit 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.730
 the roofs and walls of the city through parkour, which will help you to escape threats 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.010
 and stealthily approaching your goals. Accounts with different forms to complete 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.180
 a mission, so you should analyze your environment and behavior of key players 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.180
 to make action more appropriate. By earning points on missions, you can buy 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.159
 upgrades in equipment and skills. Or if you prefer, you can also buy them 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.950
 with real money in online stores, saving you the job, plus she takes the play joke, 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.730
 right? Once the city is unlocked, you 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.409
 you can explore to your liking and discover side quests, collections and historical sites. 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.830
 In addition, there are chests that can only be opened through an application on your phone, 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.340
 so if you want to complete the game one hundred percent, it is better to invest additional time, 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.370
 but it should not be. You can do missions cooperatively online 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.349
 with up to 3 people. But if there is a lack of direct communication, they can not coordinate to complete 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:21.859
 the goal and look at what everyone is doing on their part. So we recommend that 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.500
 you play with someone you know. Overall, Assassin's Creed Unity is a good 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:33.050
 game series with many surprises in the plot that can be completed in 20 hours, but 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:40.050
 in terms of technique do not end up convincing us to fulfill all that was promised before departure. 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.710
 It just seems that it lacked polish several details regarding graphics, and micro 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.700
 transactions are forced. As a bonus, we must mention the dubbing 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:58.700
 of Latin America, in which many family voices engaged and succeeded in their performances. 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.500
 I'm Alexandra Vicencio, accompany us on GamersTV to fight for freedom, the revolution just started ..
