at all I think just in general I think
just<00:01:47.679> over<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:47.950> years<00:01:48.100> some<00:01:48.250> things<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:48.550> go

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
just over the years some things you go

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.240 
just over the years some things you go
through<00:01:49.259> doubters<00:01:50.259> things<00:01:50.710> like<00:01:50.860> that<00:01:51.039> it

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
through doubters things like that it

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.120 
kind of a no-brainer and I just think
it's<00:05:06.350> one<00:05:06.440> of<00:05:06.500> those<00:05:06.560> things<00:05:06.620> you<00:05:06.770> learn<00:05:06.979> as

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
it's one of those things you learn as

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.240 
it's one of those things you learn as
you<00:05:07.160> go<00:05:07.310> on<00:05:08.050> you<00:05:09.050> can<00:05:09.200> start<00:05:09.440> as<00:05:09.830> you<00:05:09.950> get<00:05:10.070> older

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
you go on you can start as you get older

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.409 
you go on you can start as you get older
you<00:05:10.340> can<00:05:10.400> start<00:05:10.639> working<00:05:10.790> on<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.090> little

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
you can start working on the little

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.340 
you can start working on the little
things<00:05:11.720> of<00:05:11.870> your<00:05:11.960> craft<00:05:12.229> and<00:05:13.990> so<00:05:14.990> yeah<00:05:15.110> I<00:05:15.139> was<00:05:15.260> a

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
things of your craft and so yeah I was a

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.210 
things of your craft and so yeah I was a
young<00:05:15.440> player<00:05:15.620> maybe<00:05:15.800> don't<00:05:15.979> pay<00:05:16.070> as<00:05:16.160> much

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
young player maybe don't pay as much

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.830 
young player maybe don't pay as much
attention<00:05:16.340> to<00:05:16.729> building<00:05:16.940> an<00:05:17.120> older<00:05:17.330> try<00:05:17.510> to<00:05:17.570> I

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
attention to building an older try to I

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.360 
attention to building an older try to I
really<00:05:18.229> try<00:05:18.320> to<00:05:18.350> make<00:05:18.470> him<00:05:18.590> look<00:05:18.710> like<00:05:18.770> when
