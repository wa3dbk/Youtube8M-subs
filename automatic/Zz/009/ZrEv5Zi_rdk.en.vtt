 gas torch sauce is very 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.970
 Hello everyone, this can today show 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.100
 makeup that was doing on her graduation 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.920
 that is, the makeup that did a few 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.990
 years ago then I didnâ€™t know much and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.160
 especially for graduation I bought my 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.160
 first foundation 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.950
 on my channel 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.020
 from and poverty 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.410
 it's not butter 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.360
 I put light shadows on my eyes 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.580
 using a brown tint drew 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.480
 a kind of loop which carefully 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.480
 shading 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.990
 shipping 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.660
 do not you know 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.550
 on top and put silvery shadows and already 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.550
 shaded them with another brush 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.939
 then I confess I did not have 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.250
 canted brush but it was soft 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.520
 pencil I used to draw thick 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.520
 arrows 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.440
 I teach you dearly 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.440
 cinema hall 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.010
 and our 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.040
 kim chen yna 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.860
 down below 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.920
 then do you want black shadows that i 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:57.190
 neatly distributed throughout the century 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:59.860
 feathering the arrow of my favorite 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.320
 part was to bring white water line 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.540
 Serious I could not even imagine the makeup 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.120
 without this and so with the help of silver 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:14.970
 eye shadow makeup turned out in cold 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:17.420
 shades x 1 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.319
 one of the pallet boy you have 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.079
 Hello, I teach 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.120
 I had a mascara with a huge brush 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.829
 I didn't know how to use false eyelashes 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.579
 to use it did not seem to be something 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:33.280
 unreal water utility thesis perish 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.409
 any way this is not true i didn't have 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.870
 no concealer and brush in due time 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.329
 I just painted over the dark circles 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:47.790
 foundation and eyebrow gel 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:47.790
 I, too, was not by the way and you are on 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.819
 Venus and on 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.900
 and width as 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.870
 but if you look at the photo I have there 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.540
 very clearly drawn cheekbones though 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.260
 before I was even shekasta those now I 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.750
 very strongly competed face here 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.090
 so easy makeup though then I have 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.800
 it took 2 hours probably so 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.110
 I hope you liked my real 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.000
 makeup on prom and don't forget 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.000

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.000
