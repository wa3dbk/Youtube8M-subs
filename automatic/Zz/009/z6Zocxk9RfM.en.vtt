00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.990
 not 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.110
 hello my name is annie casamayou and 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.950
 I am a naturopath 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.799
 today I will explain 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.540
 how to make a cure of clay 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.380
 very simple to prepare 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:24.649
 I will take a teaspoon I 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.649
 use me a teaspoon dargis then 

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:28.880
 it's green clay powder 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:32.689
 clay on film 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.180
 and then I'll pour it in rain 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.309
 a glass of water when you poured 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.129
 clay in the green especially you do not 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.620
 do not stir up that the day before at 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.899
 evening you let rest all night 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.359
 and then in the morning the clay deposit goes 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:51.199
 go down to the bottom of the glass and you go 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:53.510
 drink only the water that floats 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.890
 you will do for 4 to 5 days 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.589
 that's the time that your body 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.989
 gets used to clay and then 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.839
 when the five days have passed if you 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.870
 feel that all is well you go before 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.060
 to drink your glass of clay in the morning 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.700
 you will take the spoon and then 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.570
 stir and at that moment you drink 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.250
 the whole clay and where you have 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.770
 noticed that I used a spoon 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.090
 wooden to make my preparation 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.970
 actually wide he does not like the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.040
 all the contact of the metal on the other hand 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.380
 plan a glass with edges 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.180
 thick enough because it happens that 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.960
 the clay is powerful enough 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.770
 to break the greens too hungry or the 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.070
 crystal glasses 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.260
 the duration of a cure and three weeks 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.420
 it is usually done in the 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.760
 tradition at the time of the changes of 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.850
 season that is to say in the fall and at the 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.830
 spring mainly to the tastes you 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.730
 will see wide he has absolutely nothing 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.400
 unpleasant 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.900
 a pure clay can clean 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.810
 the body 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.660
 she will chase from the body the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.850
 toxic toxins in fact wide it 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.490
 acts as a researcher and she 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.140
 going to go deep tissue 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.790
 dislodge all the toxins that are 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.099
 find and suddenly put them back into 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.099
 traffic to be able to evacuate them 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:16.129
 outward wide he drains a 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.120
 pure of clay purifies so she can 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.640
 heal 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.310
 skin problems for example worries 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.580
 digestive and many other things 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.319
 in fact wide it acts so 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.510
 smart she'll go to the source 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.610
 of dysfunction so if there is a 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.159
 organ or a function that is in default 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.159
 wide he'll go to act at that level 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.989
 wide it acts powerfully you have it 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.659
 well understood that's why there is when 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.810
 even precautions to respect if you 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.129
 have high blood pressure or if you have 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.980

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.260
 intestinal better you refrain from 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.940
 this clay cure of the same if you 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.849
 follow a drug treatment 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.530
 preferred to inform your doctor because it 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.269
 can be interactions between 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.310
 drugs and clay 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.810

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.030
