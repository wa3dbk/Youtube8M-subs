video one of the neat things about this

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.200 
video one of the neat things about this
TV<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.189> your<00:01:05.400> viewing<00:01:05.640> distance<00:01:05.850> has

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
TV is that your viewing distance has

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.330 
TV is that your viewing distance has
dramatically<00:01:06.900> shortened<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.680> before<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
dramatically shortened so before in the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.429 
dramatically shortened so before in the
past<00:01:08.520> we've<00:01:08.880> always<00:01:08.970> sat<00:01:09.409> anywhere<00:01:10.409> from

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
past we've always sat anywhere from

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.580 
past we've always sat anywhere from
three<00:01:11.070> times<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.610> size<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.060> TV<00:01:12.240> back

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
three times the size of the TV back

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.679 
three times the size of the TV back
we've<00:01:13.590> pretty<00:01:13.860> much<00:01:13.920> almost<00:01:14.159> cut<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.640> half

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
we've pretty much almost cut it in half

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.330 
we've pretty much almost cut it in half
so<00:01:15.689> now<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.080> really<00:01:16.380> bring<00:01:16.619> much<00:01:16.890> larger

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
so now you can really bring much larger

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.370 
so now you can really bring much larger
screen<00:01:17.640> size<00:01:17.670> into<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> living<00:01:19.049> room<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380
