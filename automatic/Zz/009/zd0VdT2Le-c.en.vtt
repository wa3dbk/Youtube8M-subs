00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 this week we sit down with the 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.640
 unparalleled chiquis and we put it in front 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.950
 to our cameras so they will talk to you 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.530
 as if you were there with her and 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.570
 it turns out that it does come with everything and this 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.570
 new topic entitled that's not me 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.510
 I have a lot of collection 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.279
 this subject is very different than pigeon 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.750
 white that's not me is a subject that I 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.020
 I wrote with a friend called Julio 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.030
 kings and I prepared a lot to be able 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.750
 sing this song not just by much 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.879
 love but be more mature in the voice 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.680
 locally and they are never going to 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.170
 imagine what is the musical genre that 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.129
 txiki maybe I would never try I think 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.840
 in metal in heavy metal in English 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.860
 Well you have to respect that because then 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.660
 I imagine that because I do not know I do not think that I 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.720
 the chiquis dare not try or 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.450
 a little bit maybe if you do not know I will not 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.550
 Well , we know that maybe she 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.830
 I would never do a duet with mötley crüe 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.660
 but it is preparing very well for 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.670
 someday collaborate with a very person 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.310
 special in your life I want to prepare 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.500
 much to be able to do a duet with my 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.229
 mom said songs that people have not 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.420
 listened to and I wish I could do a 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.080
 I'm in love with her but I feel that it's not the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.360
 moment I want to prepare myself even more 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.270
 I feel that you have to respect your 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.060
 respect her music and for me it's the 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.270
 better the best I say to get to 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.480
 I have to grow a little more 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.850
 mature and then that is that is a method 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.890
 I have not told you much 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.960
 people apart from music like everyone 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.880
 we also go to the movies and they do not go to 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.380
 believe what is your favorite movie there 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.370
 a movie that I love that is 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.370

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.660
 time I see it and rules because the 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:13.040
 message that leads to throw me but also 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:18.490
 this seeing that old movie with me 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.490

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.460

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.390
 and denzel washington 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.800
 we know music was always part of 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.800
 his life and from chiquitita sang this 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.379
 I like a lot of pimpernel I also grew 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.780
 with them listening to them in the car in 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.060
 my dad's car when he cleaned my 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.639
 mom when we lived in camping that I 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.159
 brings many many memories many things 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:02.099
 pretty when I was little I'm 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.230
 impelen to me not many people do not have to 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.109
 To think that I like music like that 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.420
 but then in the music and I tell you that 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.639
 can not stand to dream big at the time 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.700
 to think about concert tours I 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:20.549
 would like to go to japan to do a concert to 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:23.069
 Japan to England I would love that 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.010
 like it is a very beautiful place 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.260
 imagine you feel like right there they go 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.150
 the queens what their mother jenny 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.829
 rivera is no longer with us to 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.980
 chiqui continues to make his guide and example 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:37.799
 to continue I think the opportunity that 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.389
 gave me Chinese and nacho in this do this 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.510
 song with them in recording this song 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:44.129
 with them I feel like it's how I feel 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.109
 that is my mom because my mom wanted 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.209
 a lot and I respect those guys and 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.639
 them to her and I felt like I was a 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.940
 gift from my mom letting me know that 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.860
 she 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.930
 is helping me is opening many 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.750
 doors and that's why I feel that 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.880
 definitely that happened for my mom 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.710
 because I know her at work in your mother 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.270
 and we will soon see chiqui 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.320
 pay tribute to the woman more 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.290
 important in your life 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.620
 njeri 2014 right now I think I'm 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.050
 focused on finishing this album there 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.670
 also for my presentation where I 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.040
 I'm going to present for the first time 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.890
 favor of god in the angels in yen and 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.710
 live 2014 that will be where I will be able to 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.360
 sing three or four songs 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:27.210
 they benefit a song that comes in the 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.740
 album that is dedicated to my mom something that 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.080
 but they do not talk about it being something different 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.830
 but I'm focused on that still not 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.360
 I have tour plans I do not know where yet 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.980
 I believe that for the coming year we 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.750
 let's focus more on that and good
