this is a can board can board is 4 feet
by<00:00:15.320> 4<00:00:16.320> feet<00:00:20.390> it<00:00:21.390> has<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.630> queen<00:00:22.020> at<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.560> center

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.030 

the<00:00:27.900> queen<00:00:28.199> hits<00:00:28.680> by<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.039> striker<00:00:30.769> moves<00:00:31.769> to

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the queen hits by the striker moves to

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.600 
the queen hits by the striker moves to
the<00:00:32.160> front<00:00:32.460> edge<00:00:35.300> rebounds<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:37.219> goes<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
the front edge rebounds and goes to the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:53.300 
the front edge rebounds and goes to the
pockets<00:00:39.059> like<00:00:39.540> this

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.230 

in<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.970> situation<00:00:56.030> there<00:00:57.030> are<00:00:57.060> some

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
in this situation there are some

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.370 
in this situation there are some
questions<00:00:57.840> asked<00:00:58.470> about<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.960> displacement

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
questions asked about the displacement

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.610 
questions asked about the displacement
of<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.980> queen<00:01:03.350> magnitude<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
of the queen magnitude of the

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.670 
of the queen magnitude of the
displacement<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:05.340> the<00:01:05.460> Queen<00:01:06.470> from<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
displacement of the Queen from the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.550 
displacement of the Queen from the
center<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:09.240> different<00:01:09.690> edge<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> first

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
center the different edge is a first

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:28.469 
center the different edge is a first
question

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.149 

so<00:01:28.750> I<00:01:28.780> hope<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.170> motion<00:01:29.530> of<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.740> purine<00:01:30.070> is

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
so I hope the motion of the purine is

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.569 
so I hope the motion of the purine is
clear<00:01:30.460> let<00:01:31.329> us<00:01:31.479> draw<00:01:31.689> it<00:01:31.719> as<00:01:31.990> well

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
clear let us draw it as well

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.670 
clear let us draw it as well
the<00:01:33.579> queen<00:01:33.820> is<00:01:33.850> hit<00:01:34.210> so<00:01:34.600> that<00:01:34.780> it<00:01:34.930> goes<00:01:35.170> it's

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
the queen is hit so that it goes it's

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.469 
the queen is hit so that it goes it's
the<00:01:37.200> top<00:01:38.200> and<00:01:38.500> then<00:01:39.250> rebounds<00:01:39.909> and<00:01:40.090> goes<00:01:40.299> to

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
the top and then rebounds and goes to

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.910 
the top and then rebounds and goes to
the<00:01:40.509> pocket<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:42.340> is<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.700> actual<00:01:43.060> path

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
the pocket this is the actual path

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.460 
the pocket this is the actual path
followed<00:01:44.920> by<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.159> Queen<00:01:45.579> and<00:01:45.850> based<00:01:46.780> on<00:01:47.079> this

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
followed by the Queen and based on this

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.950 
followed by the Queen and based on this
situation<00:01:48.100> there<00:01:48.640> are<00:01:48.670> three<00:01:49.179> questions<00:01:49.659> are

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
situation there are three questions are

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.919 
situation there are three questions are
stupid<00:01:50.850> displacement<00:01:51.850> in<00:01:52.119> all<00:01:52.630> cases

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
stupid displacement in all cases

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.959 
stupid displacement in all cases
magnitude<00:01:53.819> first<00:01:54.819> case<00:01:55.119> from<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:56.079> center<00:01:56.969> to

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
magnitude first case from the center to

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.960 
magnitude first case from the center to
different<00:01:58.390> edge<00:01:59.100> from<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.250> center<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:00.880> the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
different edge from the center to the

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.710 
different edge from the center to the
front<00:02:01.240> edge<00:02:01.479> this<00:02:02.049> itself<00:02:02.470> is<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.799> displacement

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.009 

so<00:02:07.720> how<00:02:07.869> are<00:02:08.049> we<00:02:08.200> going<00:02:08.349> to<00:02:08.729> find<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:09.849> out<00:02:10.019> we

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
so how are we going to find it out we

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.069 
so how are we going to find it out we
are<00:02:11.110> going<00:02:11.319> to<00:02:11.470> use<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.650> law<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.069> reflection<00:02:13.079> law

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
are going to use a law of reflection law

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.949 
are going to use a law of reflection law
of<00:02:14.230> reflection<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.890> followed<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:15.760> in<00:02:15.940> an<00:02:16.630> ideal

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
of reflection is followed in in an ideal

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.660 
of reflection is followed in in an ideal
Karam<00:02:17.590> in<00:02:17.739> an<00:02:18.099> ideal<00:02:18.519> billiard<00:02:19.120> ball<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:20.670> we

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
Karam in an ideal billiard ball and we

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.930 
Karam in an ideal billiard ball and we
assume<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.329> be<00:02:22.360> ideal<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.170> if<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:24.099> draw<00:02:24.670> a

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
assume it to be ideal so if I draw a

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.710 
assume it to be ideal so if I draw a
perpendicular<00:02:25.799> let<00:02:26.799> me<00:02:27.010> use<00:02:27.160> some<00:02:27.720> other

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
perpendicular let me use some other

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.890 
perpendicular let me use some other
color<00:02:29.110> for<00:02:29.380> that<00:02:29.590> if<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.579> saw<00:02:30.849> perpendicular

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.590 

then<00:02:34.900> what<00:02:35.170> does<00:02:35.350> law<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.680> reflection<00:02:35.950> say

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
then what does law of reflection say

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.759 
then what does law of reflection say
this<00:02:37.600> angle<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:39.420> or<00:02:40.420> whatever<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.350> equal<00:02:41.680> to

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
this angle I or whatever is equal to

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.020 
this angle I or whatever is equal to
this<00:02:41.920> angle<00:02:42.130> are

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:54.020 

our<00:02:45.660> objective<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.180> find<00:02:48.510> this<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:53.030> we

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
our objective is to find this and and we

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.640 
our objective is to find this and and we
know<00:02:54.180> this<00:02:54.390> distance<00:02:56.300> if<00:02:57.300> I<00:02:57.510> construct<00:02:57.840> this

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
know this distance if I construct this

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.160 
know this distance if I construct this
triangle<00:03:02.030> then<00:03:03.030> we<00:03:03.060> do<00:03:03.390> know<00:03:03.600> this<00:03:03.810> distance

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
triangle then we do know this distance

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.960 
triangle then we do know this distance
how<00:03:04.680> much<00:03:04.860> is<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.070> distance<00:03:06.920> okay<00:03:07.970> however

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
how much is this distance okay however

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.000 
how much is this distance okay however
can<00:03:09.600> we<00:03:09.780> say<00:03:09.990> this<00:03:10.230> is<00:03:10.380> also<00:03:10.590> 2<00:03:10.890> feet<00:03:12.290> no<00:03:13.290> we

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
can we say this is also 2 feet no we

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:23.300 
can we say this is also 2 feet no we
can't<00:03:14.250> say<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.770> problem<00:03:23.220> is

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
can't say that so the problem is

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.330 
can't say that so the problem is
actually<00:03:23.520> this<00:03:25.160> X<00:03:26.160> let<00:03:26.670> us<00:03:26.790> call<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.030> X<00:03:28.070> if<00:03:29.070> we

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
actually this X let us call it X if we

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.270 
actually this X let us call it X if we
know<00:03:29.459> X<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:30.570> can<00:03:30.750> tell<00:03:31.020> this<00:03:31.290> displacement<00:03:31.800> is

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
know X you can tell this displacement is

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.150 
know X you can tell this displacement is
root<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:33.120> 4<00:03:33.750> 4<00:03:34.230> plus<00:03:34.709> X<00:03:35.100> square<00:03:36.680> now<00:03:37.680> if<00:03:37.830> that<00:03:37.980> is

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
root of 4 4 plus X square now if that is

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:52.680 
root of 4 4 plus X square now if that is
X<00:03:38.340> how<00:03:38.760> much<00:03:39.000> is<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:42.110> 2<00:03:43.110> minus<00:03:43.500> 8

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.330 

now<00:03:53.690> this<00:03:54.080> angle<00:03:54.260> would<00:03:54.620> be<00:03:54.650> equal<00:03:55.070> to<00:03:55.100> this

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
now this angle would be equal to this

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.960 
now this angle would be equal to this
angle<00:03:55.550> and<00:03:56.510> this<00:03:57.100> angle<00:03:58.100> would<00:03:58.400> be<00:03:58.460> equal<00:03:58.610> to

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
angle and this angle would be equal to

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.640 
angle and this angle would be equal to
this<00:03:59.090> angle<00:04:04.720> if<00:04:05.720> you<00:04:05.900> look<00:04:06.080> at<00:04:06.200> these<00:04:06.380> two

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
this angle if you look at these two

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.640 
this angle if you look at these two
triangles<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.880> small<00:04:08.210> and<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.450> big<00:04:08.650> then

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
triangles the small and the big then

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.070 
triangles the small and the big then
this<00:04:09.980> angle<00:04:10.190> is<00:04:10.430> equal<00:04:10.580> to<00:04:10.790> that<00:04:11.030> what<00:04:11.750> angle

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
this angle is equal to that what angle

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.250 
this angle is equal to that what angle
is<00:04:12.200> 90<00:04:12.650> this<00:04:13.040> angle<00:04:13.430> is<00:04:13.520> 90<00:04:14.080> so<00:04:15.080> this

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
is 90 this angle is 90 so this

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:24.030 
is 90 this angle is 90 so this
similarity<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:16.190> is<00:04:16.400> a<00:04:18.609> similarity<00:04:20.829> that<00:04:21.829> means

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
similarity it is a similarity that means

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:33.520 
similarity it is a similarity that means
4<00:04:27.100> divided<00:04:28.100> by<00:04:28.130> 2<00:04:30.190> equal<00:04:31.190> to<00:04:31.220> 2<00:04:31.370> minus<00:04:32.060> X<00:04:32.360> by<00:04:33.169> X

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
4 divided by 2 equal to 2 minus X by X

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:49.979 
4 divided by 2 equal to 2 minus X by X
is<00:04:33.860> this<00:04:34.280> correct

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:49.989 

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:55.389 

it<00:04:50.989> is<00:04:51.199> correct<00:04:51.759> that's<00:04:52.759> it<00:04:53.739> now<00:04:54.739> one<00:04:54.979> can<00:04:55.159> find

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:55.399 
it is correct that's it now one can find

00:04:55.399 --> 00:05:03.429 
it is correct that's it now one can find
X<00:04:56.199> and<00:04:57.819> hence<00:04:58.819> answer<00:04:59.269> the<00:04:59.659> first<00:04:59.869> part<00:05:02.110> X<00:05:03.110> is

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:03.439 
X and hence answer the first part X is

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:12.279 
X and hence answer the first part X is
going<00:05:03.679> to<00:05:03.769> be<00:05:03.919> 2<00:05:04.099> by<00:05:04.309> 3<00:05:05.919> feet<00:05:06.919> so<00:05:10.479> how<00:05:11.479> much<00:05:11.659> will

top

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.309 

what<00:06:09.400> is<00:06:09.550> the<00:06:09.639> displacement<00:06:09.970> from<00:06:10.750> the<00:06:11.020> front

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319 
what is the displacement from the front

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:14.550 
what is the displacement from the front
edge<00:06:11.560> to<00:06:12.009> the<00:06:12.159> hole<00:06:12.509> in<00:06:13.509> this<00:06:13.960> figure<00:06:14.169> it<00:06:14.379> would

be<00:06:15.569> this<00:06:16.569> much

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.730

center to the hole I think that's a

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:48.060 
hole that means the overall displacement
for<00:07:35.639> the<00:07:35.760> whole<00:07:35.940> journey

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:48.070 

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.510 

for<00:07:48.730> that<00:07:48.940> we<00:07:49.510> can<00:07:49.660> construct<00:07:50.160> okay<00:07:51.160> first<00:07:51.370> of

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 
for that we can construct okay first of

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.640 
for that we can construct okay first of
all<00:07:51.610> we<00:07:51.730> want<00:07:51.940> this<00:07:53.670> we<00:07:54.670> want<00:07:54.850> this<00:07:55.530> so<00:07:56.530> we

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:56.650 
all we want this we want this so we

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.610 
all we want this we want this so we
construct<00:07:57.100> this<00:07:57.340> right<00:07:57.730> angle<00:07:58.090> triangle<00:07:58.620> this

00:07:59.610 --> 00:07:59.620 
construct this right angle triangle this

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:07.140 
construct this right angle triangle this
one<00:08:00.480> and<00:08:02.100> this<00:08:03.100> one<00:08:03.160> this<00:08:03.910> this<00:08:04.180> is<00:08:04.540> 2<00:08:05.460> and<00:08:06.460> this

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:07.150 
one and this one this this is 2 and this

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:13.100 
one and this one this this is 2 and this
is<00:08:07.210> also<00:08:08.010> 2<00:08:09.010> so<00:08:09.370> the<00:08:09.490> answer<00:08:09.520> is
