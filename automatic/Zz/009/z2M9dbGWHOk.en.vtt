00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.000
Through this window everything seems new

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The worlds not changing it's just my view

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Spent so much time looking for what I thought was right for me

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But it's only when I gave up that I got what I really need

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And I know it's true

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You're the everything I was missing

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The perfect part of me that I really need

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000
All I've known is new because I found you

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Anticipation is something new

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
When you never had someone to look forward to

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I thought I knew who I was and who I wanted to be

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
But my mind just kept wandering waiting to let me see

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And I know it's true

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
You're the everything I was missing

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The perfect part of me that I really need

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
All I've known is new because I found you

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:58.000
You're the everything I was missing
The perfect part of me that I really need
All I've known is new because I found you
