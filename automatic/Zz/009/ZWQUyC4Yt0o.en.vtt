after that the only way to get her is
through<00:00:46.260> holy<00:00:46.890> wars<00:00:47.250> where<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.329> believe

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
through holy wars where you I believe

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.389 
through holy wars where you I believe
yet<00:00:49.079> did<00:00:50.270> be<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> top<00:00:51.719> 300<00:00:52.590> either<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.250> your

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.180 
wings and they are freaking huge I would
say<00:02:28.130> they're<00:02:28.700> even<00:02:29.050> larger<00:02:30.050> than<00:02:30.080> her<00:02:30.770> if<00:02:31.040> they

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
say they're even larger than her if they

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.340 
say they're even larger than her if they
were<00:02:31.250> fully<00:02:31.670> expanded<00:02:32.239> but<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:33.020> see<00:02:33.170> here

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
were fully expanded but you see here

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.759 
were fully expanded but you see here
they're<00:02:33.620> curved<00:02:34.430> inwards<00:02:35.470> I'm<00:02:36.470> just<00:02:36.680> gonna

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
they're curved inwards I'm just gonna

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:46.949 
they're curved inwards I'm just gonna
show<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:36.980> guys<00:02:37.220> this<00:02:37.400> one

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:54.920 

now<00:02:47.500> here's<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.859> upside

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:03.990 

all<00:02:55.530> right<00:02:56.180> next<00:02:57.180> thing<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:58.040> our<00:02:59.040> belt

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.710 

I<00:03:04.060> guess<00:03:04.780> nothing<00:03:05.260> too<00:03:05.380> special<00:03:05.620> just<00:03:06.210> about

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.760 

and<00:03:10.290> now<00:03:10.410> moving<00:03:11.010> on<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.670> sorts<00:03:12.660> one<00:03:13.500> for

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
and now moving on to the sorts one for

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:25.180 
and now moving on to the sorts one for
her<00:03:13.890> right<00:03:14.100> hand

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:32.860 

here's<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.400> handle<00:03:26.730> for<00:03:26.910> the

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.559 

and<00:03:34.129> finally<00:03:35.129> last<00:03:35.370> thing<00:03:35.580> she<00:03:35.970> comes<00:03:36.180> with<00:03:36.360> is

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
and finally last thing she comes with is

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:48.160 
and finally last thing she comes with is
the<00:03:36.930> sword<00:03:37.200> for<00:03:37.410> other<00:03:37.709> hand

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.140 

and<00:03:49.170> right<00:03:49.680> here<00:03:49.710> about<00:03:50.310> our<00:03:50.340> handle<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.940> can

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
and right here about our handle you can

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.690 
and right here about our handle you can
remove<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.690> so<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:51.990> can<00:03:52.230> put<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.280> in<00:03:53.400> our<00:03:53.520> hand

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
remove it so you can put it in our hand

guys I'm back and yeah I got her fully
assembled<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:05.940> she<00:04:06.330> looks<00:04:06.600> absolutely

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
assembled and she looks absolutely

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.490 
assembled and she looks absolutely
amazing<00:04:07.620> but<00:04:08.690> through<00:04:09.690> assembling<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.290> found

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
amazing but through assembling I found

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.130 
amazing but through assembling I found
out<00:04:10.680> that<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.610> chest<00:04:11.970> plate<00:04:12.120> right<00:04:12.450> here<00:04:12.510> or

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
out that the chest plate right here or

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.070 
out that the chest plate right here or
the<00:04:13.350> chest<00:04:13.590> piece<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.190> her<00:04:14.580> head<00:04:14.820> are<00:04:15.390> all<00:04:15.570> two

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
the chest piece and her head are all two

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.380 
the chest piece and her head are all two
separate<00:04:16.440> pieces<00:04:16.620> so<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:18.000> was<00:04:18.120> how<00:04:18.239> I<00:04:18.269> was

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
separate pieces so that was how I was

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.690 
separate pieces so that was how I was
able<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.900> get<00:04:19.049> her<00:04:19.230> belt<00:04:19.680> on<00:04:19.859> that<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.489> don't

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
able to get her belt on that I don't

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.220 
able to get her belt on that I don't
think<00:04:21.030> I<00:04:21.120> would<00:04:21.269> have<00:04:21.299> been<00:04:21.510> able<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.930> get<00:04:22.109> her

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
think I would have been able to get her

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.730 
think I would have been able to get her
at<00:04:22.350> all

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
at all

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.880 
at all
and<00:04:23.190> that<00:04:23.490> her<00:04:24.030> wings<00:04:24.330> were<00:04:24.840> really<00:04:25.440> hard<00:04:25.680> to

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
and that her wings were really hard to

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.810 
and that her wings were really hard to
get<00:04:26.010> on<00:04:26.420> but<00:04:27.420> on<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.260> source<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:29.010> we're

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
get on but on that the source and we're

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.610 
get on but on that the source and we're
pretty<00:04:30.390> easy<00:04:30.600> and<00:04:31.050> yeah<00:04:32.900> one<00:04:33.900> thing<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:34.260> noticed

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
pretty easy and yeah one thing I noticed

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.560 
pretty easy and yeah one thing I noticed
about<00:04:34.650> this<00:04:34.860> figure<00:04:35.160> is<00:04:35.340> that<00:04:35.370> after<00:04:36.330> putting

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
about this figure is that after putting

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.360 
about this figure is that after putting
on<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.750> wings

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
on the wings

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.120 
on the wings
she<00:04:38.370> found<00:04:39.080> not<00:04:40.080> doing<00:04:40.350> much<00:04:40.500> but<00:04:40.680> she<00:04:40.890> kind<00:04:41.100> of

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
she found not doing much but she kind of

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.940 
she found not doing much but she kind of
wobbled<00:04:41.580> a<00:04:41.760> bit<00:04:41.910> right<00:04:42.090> here<00:04:42.590> so<00:04:43.590> that<00:04:43.620> kind<00:04:43.920> of

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
wobbled a bit right here so that kind of

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.050 
wobbled a bit right here so that kind of
scares<00:04:44.220> me<00:04:44.490> but<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.510> base<00:04:46.340> G<00:04:47.340> has<00:04:47.640> a<00:04:47.670> screw

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
scares me but the base G has a screw

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.240 
scares me but the base G has a screw
that<00:04:48.660> screws<00:04:48.930> around<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.350> doing<00:04:49.560> so<00:04:49.740> hopefully

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
that screws around to doing so hopefully

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.040 
that screws around to doing so hopefully
that<00:04:50.640> keeps<00:04:50.910> her<00:04:53.480> falling<00:04:54.480> off<00:04:54.600> or<00:04:54.840> anything

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
that keeps her falling off or anything

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.800 
that keeps her falling off or anything
bad<00:04:55.520> yeah<00:04:56.520> so<00:04:56.850> I<00:04:56.880> guess<00:04:57.030> I'll<00:04:57.330> show<00:04:57.390> you<00:04:57.570> guys<00:04:57.780> a
