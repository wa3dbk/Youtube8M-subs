00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
another tree trunk you have a lot of

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.040 
another tree trunk you have a lot of
cord<00:02:19.520> here<00:02:19.820> so<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.450> know<00:02:20.570> if<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.840> tree

cord here so you you know if the tree

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.930 
cord here so you you know if the tree
trunks<00:02:21.380> are<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:22.430> can<00:02:22.580> have<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.760> different
