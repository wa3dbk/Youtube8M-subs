no the damage I got this one so that I
can<00:05:06.430> I<00:05:08.889> can<00:05:09.889> taste<00:05:10.190> it<00:05:10.490> I<00:05:11.000> can<00:05:11.539> place<00:05:11.810> this<00:05:12.050> with

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
can I can taste it I can place this with

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:20.560 
can I can taste it I can place this with
the<00:05:12.500> other<00:05:13.060> figures<00:05:14.060> like<00:05:14.389> with<00:05:14.930> heart<00:05:19.570> well

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
the other figures like with heart well

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:27.930 
the other figures like with heart well
and<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.680> legs<00:05:21.889> so<00:05:23.919> really<00:05:24.919> glad<00:05:25.310> to<00:05:25.550> get<00:05:25.789> this

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
and the legs so really glad to get this

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:36.100 
and the legs so really glad to get this
it's<00:05:28.940> big<00:05:30.430> nota<00:05:31.430> ties<00:05:32.530> its<00:05:33.530> way<00:05:34.690> but<00:05:35.690> i<00:05:35.750> think

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
it's big nota ties its way but i think

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.100 
it's big nota ties its way but i think
the<00:05:36.410> arms<00:05:36.889> are<00:05:38.139> small<00:05:39.139> so<00:05:39.830> that's<00:05:40.729> the

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
the arms are small so that's the

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.040 
the arms are small so that's the
downside<00:05:42.639> but<00:05:43.639> rather<00:05:43.880> than<00:05:44.210> that<00:05:44.510> the

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
downside but rather than that the

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:53.020 
downside but rather than that the
figures<00:05:45.410> way<00:05:46.450> so<00:05:48.310> that's<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:49.490> yes<00:05:51.580> see<00:05:52.580> you<00:05:52.729> on

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
figures way so that's it yes see you on

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.779 
figures way so that's it yes see you on
the<00:05:53.380> next<00:05:54.610> video<00:05:55.610> receiving<00:05:56.479> it<00:05:57.460> may<00:05:58.460> take

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
the next video receiving it may take

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.520 
the next video receiving it may take
months<00:05:59.599> before<00:06:00.080> I<00:06:00.740> do<00:06:00.950> another<00:06:01.490> one<00:06:02.180> again

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
months before I do another one again

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:08.370 
months before I do another one again
because<00:06:03.700> series<00:06:04.700> 16<00:06:05.570> I<00:06:05.719> think<00:06:05.990> we'll<00:06:06.260> be<00:06:06.560> out

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
because series 16 I think we'll be out

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.790 
because series 16 I think we'll be out
