look a lot bigger than it usually is

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.390 
look a lot bigger than it usually is
because<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.769> original<00:00:22.769> packaging<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.250> this

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
because the original packaging of this

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.130 
because the original packaging of this
was<00:00:23.580> really<00:00:23.760> really<00:00:24.000> small<00:00:24.330> like<00:00:24.390> breakfast

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
was really really small like breakfast

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.980 
was really really small like breakfast
sighs<00:00:25.619> but<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:26.400> baby<00:00:26.789> packages<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.570> made<00:00:27.869> it

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
sighs but then baby packages and made it

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.070 
sighs but then baby packages and made it
thicker<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.800> cost<00:00:29.099> 199<00:00:29.699> pesos<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.660> little

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
thicker so this cost 199 pesos a little

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.620 
thicker so this cost 199 pesos a little
bit<00:00:31.289> more<00:00:31.710> expensive<00:00:32.130> than<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.550> small<00:00:33.390> one

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
bit more expensive than the small one

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.540 
bit more expensive than the small one
