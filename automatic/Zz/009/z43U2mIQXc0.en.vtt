how it goes okay first step I did
obvious<00:01:20.060> it<00:01:20.149> was<00:01:20.240> jack<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:20.600> up<00:01:20.689> pull<00:01:21.469> the<00:01:21.530> wheel

off throw Jack's down underneath I know
it's<00:01:24.350> not<00:01:24.439> making<00:01:24.619> contact

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369

and what you have to do is take a
screwdriver<00:03:12.400> stick<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:13.519> in<00:03:13.609> that<00:03:13.750> bit<00:03:14.750> of<00:03:14.840> that

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
screwdriver stick it in that bit of that

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.589 
screwdriver stick it in that bit of that
hole<00:03:15.200> right<00:03:15.230> there<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:15.879> separate<00:03:16.879> it<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.180> if

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
hole right there and separate it and if

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.080 
hole right there and separate it and if
you<00:03:17.689> don't<00:03:17.989> tear<00:03:18.319> it<00:03:18.439> up<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:19.400> can<00:03:19.579> reuse<00:03:19.730> it

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
you don't tear it up you can reuse it

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.640 
you don't tear it up you can reuse it
and<00:03:20.239> just<00:03:20.690> squeeze<00:03:20.900> it<00:03:21.019> back<00:03:21.139> together<00:03:21.319> with<00:03:21.500> a

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
and just squeeze it back together with a

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.699 
and just squeeze it back together with a
pair<00:03:21.859> of<00:03:21.940> extended<00:03:23.139> well<00:03:24.139> in<00:03:24.319> fact<00:03:24.470> they're

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
pair of extended well in fact they're

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.349 
pair of extended well in fact they're
long<00:03:25.609> needlenose<00:03:26.650> pliers<00:03:27.650> so<00:03:28.459> I'm<00:03:29.120> going<00:03:29.299> to

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
long needlenose pliers so I'm going to

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.479 
long needlenose pliers so I'm going to
separate<00:03:29.690> that<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:30.109> I<00:03:30.829> can<00:03:31.040> pull<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.310> boot

it looks kinda like a washer and that's

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.140 
it looks kinda like a washer and that's
really<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.780> lock<00:04:17.959> mechanism<00:04:18.560> when<00:04:19.159> this<00:04:19.970> is

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
really the lock mechanism when this is

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.020 
really the lock mechanism when this is
tightened<00:04:20.509> down<00:04:20.859> that<00:04:21.859> gets<00:04:22.039> bent<00:04:22.340> back<00:04:22.550> over

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
tightened down that gets bent back over

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.170 
tightened down that gets bent back over
it<00:04:23.180> and<00:04:23.659> it<00:04:23.780> acts<00:04:23.930> as<00:04:24.110> a<00:04:24.139> locked<00:04:24.409> so<00:04:25.250> we<00:04:25.669> got<00:04:26.090> to

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
it and it acts as a locked so we got to

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.420 
it and it acts as a locked so we got to
rotate<00:04:26.270> those<00:04:26.630> up<00:04:26.900> there's<00:04:27.680> one<00:04:27.860> on<00:04:27.979> top<00:04:28.159> and

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
rotate those up there's one on top and

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.090 
rotate those up there's one on top and
one<00:04:28.550> on<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.729> bottom

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
one on the bottom

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.330 
one on the bottom
and<00:04:29.750> then<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:30.780> can<00:04:30.960> get<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.080> tool<00:04:31.860> on<00:04:32.100> there<00:04:32.220> to

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
and then I can get the tool on there to

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.120 
and then I can get the tool on there to
break<00:04:32.520> it<00:04:32.640> loose<00:04:36.530> well<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.620> make<00:04:37.740> this<00:04:37.890> a<00:04:37.950> lot

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
break it loose well to make this a lot

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.570 
break it loose well to make this a lot
simpler

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
simpler

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.760 
simpler
I<00:04:39.260> broke<00:04:40.260> loose<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.920> outer<00:04:41.730> tie<00:04:42.120> rod<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:42.780> I

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
I broke loose the outer tie rod and I

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.280 
I broke loose the outer tie rod and I
remove<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.190> boot<00:04:44.780> and<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:45.870> can<00:04:46.020> see<00:04:46.140> that

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
remove the boot and you can see that

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.800 
remove the boot and you can see that
little<00:04:46.470> clamp<00:04:46.710> I<00:04:46.860> was<00:04:46.950> telling<00:04:47.190> you<00:04:47.250> about<00:04:47.280> a

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
little clamp I was telling you about a

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.680 
little clamp I was telling you about a
little<00:04:48.810> better<00:04:49.070> and<00:04:50.070> now<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:51.060> next<00:04:51.180> step<00:04:51.330> is

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
little better and now the next step is

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.480 
little better and now the next step is
I'm<00:04:51.870> going<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.050> take<00:04:52.350> this<00:04:53.210> tool<00:04:54.210> out<00:04:54.930> of<00:04:55.080> that

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
I'm going to take this tool out of that

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.090 
I'm going to take this tool out of that
neck<00:04:56.490> kit<00:04:56.700> there<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.590> that<00:04:58.590> will<00:04:58.680> slip<00:04:58.980> up

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
neck kit there and that will slip up

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.990 
neck kit there and that will slip up
around<00:05:01.190> like<00:05:02.190> that<00:05:02.400> and<00:05:02.990> then<00:05:03.990> I'll<00:05:04.110> take<00:05:04.320> this

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
around like that and then I'll take this

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.390 
around like that and then I'll take this
handle<00:05:06.000> which<00:05:06.120> is<00:05:06.350> also<00:05:07.350> out<00:05:07.470> of<00:05:07.500> that<00:05:07.680> tool

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
handle which is also out of that tool

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.030 
handle which is also out of that tool
kit<00:05:08.660> that<00:05:09.660> slips<00:05:10.070> around<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:12.210> inner<00:05:12.360> tie<00:05:12.570> rod

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
kit that slips around the inner tie rod

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.850 
kit that slips around the inner tie rod
and<00:05:14.040> these<00:05:14.250> two<00:05:14.430> hook<00:05:14.790> together<00:05:14.970> and<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:16.590> next

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
and these two hook together and the next

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.670 
and these two hook together and the next
step<00:05:17.010> is<00:05:17.160> I'll<00:05:17.370> take<00:05:17.550> a<00:05:17.820> ratchet<00:05:18.600> or<00:05:18.810> a<00:05:19.440> breaker

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
step is I'll take a ratchet or a breaker

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.850 
step is I'll take a ratchet or a breaker
bar<00:05:19.800> and<00:05:20.400> put<00:05:20.880> in<00:05:20.970> that<00:05:21.090> end<00:05:21.300> and<00:05:21.740> break<00:05:22.740> it

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
bar and put in that end and break it

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.750 
bar and put in that end and break it
loose<00:05:22.890> and<00:05:23.250> remove<00:05:23.520> that<00:05:28.370> and<00:05:29.370> there<00:05:29.580> it<00:05:29.670> is

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
loose and remove that and there it is

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.940 
loose and remove that and there it is
now<00:05:30.330> that<00:05:30.390> I've<00:05:30.540> unthreaded<00:05:31.020> it<00:05:31.140> I<00:05:31.320> wanted<00:05:31.890> to

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
now that I've unthreaded it I wanted to

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.250 
now that I've unthreaded it I wanted to
point<00:05:32.130> out<00:05:32.310> there's<00:05:32.520> that<00:05:32.670> little<00:05:33.260> washer

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
point out there's that little washer

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.290 
point out there's that little washer
thing<00:05:34.470> I<00:05:34.590> was<00:05:34.710> talking<00:05:34.860> about<00:05:35.100> that<00:05:35.910> was<00:05:36.060> bent

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
thing I was talking about that was bent

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.500 
thing I was talking about that was bent
back<00:05:36.540> over<00:05:36.870> these<00:05:36.990> two<00:05:37.260> flat<00:05:38.190> spots<00:05:38.490> the<00:05:39.330> other

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
back over these two flat spots the other

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.430 
back over these two flat spots the other
thing<00:05:39.690> is<00:05:40.190> you'll<00:05:41.190> see<00:05:41.400> there's<00:05:41.610> two<00:05:41.820> little

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
thing is you'll see there's two little

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.770 
thing is you'll see there's two little
notches<00:05:43.940> and<00:05:44.940> kind<00:05:45.150> of<00:05:45.240> see<00:05:45.330> em<00:05:45.390> sticking<00:05:45.690> up

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
notches and kind of see em sticking up

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.380 
notches and kind of see em sticking up
in<00:05:45.870> a<00:05:45.990> little<00:05:46.080> bit<00:05:46.310> those<00:05:47.310> are<00:05:48.000> designed<00:05:48.120> to

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
in a little bit those are designed to

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.570 
in a little bit those are designed to
notch<00:05:48.660> into<00:05:48.960> or<00:05:49.650> slide<00:05:49.920> into<00:05:50.190> those<00:05:50.370> two

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
notch into or slide into those two

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.460 
notch into or slide into those two
cutouts<00:05:50.820> and<00:05:51.570> that's<00:05:51.900> just<00:05:52.080> to<00:05:52.170> keep<00:05:52.290> it

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
cutouts and that's just to keep it

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.010 
cutouts and that's just to keep it
everything<00:05:52.800> from<00:05:52.980> not<00:05:53.640> turning<00:05:54.060> when<00:05:54.780> it<00:05:54.870> goes

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
everything from not turning when it goes

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.470 
everything from not turning when it goes
back<00:05:55.230> together<00:05:55.820> the<00:05:56.820> important<00:05:57.150> part<00:05:57.270> of<00:05:57.330> this

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
back together the important part of this

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.860 
back together the important part of this
too<00:05:57.690> is<00:05:57.930> all<00:05:58.380> this<00:05:58.740> gets<00:05:58.950> thrown<00:05:59.130> away<00:05:59.280> the<00:05:59.870> new

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
too is all this gets thrown away the new

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.300 
too is all this gets thrown away the new
one<00:06:02.120> which<00:06:03.120> that<00:06:03.330> nut<00:06:03.540> doesn't<00:06:03.870> belong<00:06:04.050> there

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
one which that nut doesn't belong there

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.430 
one which that nut doesn't belong there
but<00:06:05.310> nut<00:06:05.520> goes<00:06:05.670> on<00:06:05.850> the<00:06:05.940> end<00:06:07.670> the<00:06:08.670> new<00:06:08.820> one

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
but nut goes on the end the new one

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.070 
but nut goes on the end the new one
comes<00:06:10.440> with<00:06:10.560> that<00:06:11.460> same<00:06:11.730> deal<00:06:11.940> a<00:06:12.180> little

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
comes with that same deal a little

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.510 
comes with that same deal a little
washer<00:06:13.470> so<00:06:14.280> you<00:06:14.370> just<00:06:14.610> slip<00:06:14.760> that<00:06:14.880> on<00:06:15.000> the<00:06:15.090> end

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
washer so you just slip that on the end

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.250 
washer so you just slip that on the end
thread<00:06:17.520> the<00:06:17.640> thread<00:06:17.880> that<00:06:18.240> thread<00:06:18.810> that<00:06:19.020> in

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
thread the thread that thread that in

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.180 
thread the thread that thread that in
and<00:06:19.590> then<00:06:20.370> those<00:06:20.610> little<00:06:20.700> tabs<00:06:21.140> line<00:06:22.140> up<00:06:22.320> once

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
and then those little tabs line up once

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.040 
and then those little tabs line up once
you<00:06:23.250> get<00:06:23.310> to<00:06:23.400> that<00:06:23.520> point<00:06:23.790> slip<00:06:24.570> the<00:06:24.660> tool<00:06:24.840> back

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
you get to that point slip the tool back

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
you get to that point slip the tool back
on<00:06:25.290> and<00:06:25.830> tighten<00:06:26.310> everything<00:06:26.490> up

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.340 

and<00:06:31.460> at<00:06:31.790> this<00:06:31.910> point<00:06:32.150> after<00:06:32.810> I<00:06:33.020> tighten<00:06:33.290> up

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
and at this point after I tighten up

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.910 
and at this point after I tighten up
that<00:06:33.530> nut<00:06:34.000> I<00:06:35.000> use<00:06:35.720> the<00:06:35.870> hammer<00:06:36.080> on<00:06:36.200> one<00:06:36.470> side<00:06:36.710> of

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920 
that nut I use the hammer on one side of

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.670 
that nut I use the hammer on one side of
that<00:06:37.040> little<00:06:37.630> little<00:06:38.630> washer<00:06:38.960> deal<00:06:39.170> I<00:06:39.380> was

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
that little little washer deal I was

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.860 
that little little washer deal I was
able<00:06:39.800> to<00:06:39.950> tap<00:06:40.100> the<00:06:40.280> edge<00:06:40.400> over<00:06:40.640> and<00:06:41.120> the<00:06:41.780> other

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
able to tap the edge over and the other

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.710 
able to tap the edge over and the other
one<00:06:42.110> he's<00:06:42.920> the<00:06:42.950> end<00:06:43.160> of<00:06:43.280> my<00:06:43.340> ratchet<00:06:43.580> and<00:06:44.570> it's

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
one he's the end of my ratchet and it's

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.770 
one he's the end of my ratchet and it's
a<00:06:44.750> pretty<00:06:44.870> tight<00:06:45.110> fit<00:06:45.380> and<00:06:46.190> then<00:06:46.760> I<00:06:47.060> slipped

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
a pretty tight fit and then I slipped

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.660 
a pretty tight fit and then I slipped
the<00:06:47.930> boot<00:06:48.080> on<00:06:48.260> and<00:06:48.620> I<00:06:49.010> pushed<00:06:49.250> it<00:06:49.370> all<00:06:49.490> the<00:06:49.520> way

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:49.670 
the boot on and I pushed it all the way

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.150 
the boot on and I pushed it all the way
in<00:06:49.940> first<00:06:50.440> so<00:06:51.440> I<00:06:51.470> didn't<00:06:51.860> worry<00:06:51.980> about<00:06:52.040> the

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 
in first so I didn't worry about the

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.770 
in first so I didn't worry about the
outer<00:06:52.400> clamp<00:06:52.760> I<00:06:53.060> went<00:06:53.510> to<00:06:53.600> that<00:06:53.750> inner<00:06:53.990> one<00:06:54.200> and

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780 
outer clamp I went to that inner one and

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:02.560 
outer clamp I went to that inner one and
see<00:06:56.780> if<00:06:56.870> I<00:06:56.960> can<00:06:57.110> show<00:06:57.290> you<00:07:00.070> her<00:07:01.070> to<00:07:01.190> see<00:07:01.540> but<00:07:02.540> I

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:02.570 
see if I can show you her to see but I

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.780 
see if I can show you her to see but I
clamped<00:07:03.290> that<00:07:03.410> back<00:07:03.590> down<00:07:03.800> and<00:07:04.070> then<00:07:04.640> I

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.790 
clamped that back down and then I

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.100 
clamped that back down and then I
stretched<00:07:05.090> the<00:07:05.180> boot<00:07:05.360> out<00:07:05.480> there's<00:07:05.780> a<00:07:05.840> groove

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 
stretched the boot out there's a groove

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.490 
stretched the boot out there's a groove
on<00:07:06.650> that<00:07:07.370> shaft<00:07:07.730> and<00:07:08.090> I<00:07:08.900> snapped<00:07:09.170> it<00:07:09.290> into<00:07:09.380> the

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.500 
on that shaft and I snapped it into the

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.610 
on that shaft and I snapped it into the
shaft<00:07:09.740> and<00:07:09.860> then<00:07:09.950> put<00:07:10.100> the<00:07:10.160> clamp<00:07:10.400> back<00:07:10.580> on<00:07:10.790> I

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:11.620 
shaft and then put the clamp back on I

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.280 
shaft and then put the clamp back on I
should<00:07:12.620> also<00:07:12.740> point<00:07:12.890> out<00:07:13.250> that<00:07:13.790> I<00:07:14.360> had<00:07:15.200> the

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:15.290 
should also point out that I had the

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.900 
should also point out that I had the
wheels<00:07:15.500> turn<00:07:15.680> all<00:07:15.860> the<00:07:15.920> way<00:07:16.010> to<00:07:16.070> the<00:07:16.280> left<00:07:16.490> in

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:16.910 
wheels turn all the way to the left in

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.390 
wheels turn all the way to the left in
this<00:07:17.030> case<00:07:17.140> so<00:07:18.140> that<00:07:18.260> this<00:07:18.350> was<00:07:18.590> extended<00:07:19.130> as

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 
this case so that this was extended as

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.550 
this case so that this was extended as
far<00:07:19.550> as<00:07:19.670> I<00:07:19.730> could<00:07:19.790> get<00:07:20.030> it<00:07:20.090> if<00:07:21.020> I<00:07:21.110> try<00:07:21.260> to<00:07:21.320> do<00:07:21.470> it

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 
far as I could get it if I try to do it

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.610 
far as I could get it if I try to do it
otherwise<00:07:21.740> I'd<00:07:22.430> be<00:07:22.580> even<00:07:22.760> further<00:07:22.910> in<00:07:23.180> so<00:07:23.930> at

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:24.620 
otherwise I'd be even further in so at

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.600 
otherwise I'd be even further in so at
this<00:07:24.770> point<00:07:24.950> I'm<00:07:25.100> going<00:07:25.190> to<00:07:25.250> put<00:07:25.400> the<00:07:25.460> outer

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.610 
this point I'm going to put the outer

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.250 
this point I'm going to put the outer
tie<00:07:25.820> rod<00:07:25.850> on<00:07:26.590> I'll<00:07:27.590> adjust<00:07:28.040> based<00:07:28.730> on<00:07:29.260> the

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:30.260 
tie rod on I'll adjust based on the

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.520 
tie rod on I'll adjust based on the
length<00:07:30.560> of<00:07:30.800> the<00:07:31.460> thread<00:07:32.080> that's<00:07:33.080> available

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:33.530 
length of the thread that's available

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.470 
length of the thread that's available
from<00:07:33.620> the<00:07:33.740> original<00:07:34.160> as<00:07:34.820> if<00:07:35.030> they<00:07:35.180> were<00:07:35.240> still

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:35.480 
from the original as if they were still

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.190 
from the original as if they were still
assembled<00:07:35.980> and<00:07:36.980> it<00:07:37.070> gives<00:07:37.220> me<00:07:37.340> gets<00:07:37.550> me<00:07:37.670> close

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:38.200 
assembled and it gives me gets me close

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.690 
assembled and it gives me gets me close
so<00:07:39.200> that<00:07:39.350> it<00:07:39.440> can<00:07:39.530> be<00:07:39.620> driven<00:07:39.770> to<00:07:40.580> the

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:40.700 
so that it can be driven to the

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:47.470 
so that it can be driven to the
alignment<00:07:40.910> shop<00:07:44.110> and<00:07:45.110> there<00:07:45.860> it<00:07:45.950> is<00:07:46.070> I<00:07:46.910> should

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:47.480 
alignment shop and there it is I should

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.980 
alignment shop and there it is I should
point<00:07:47.630> out<00:07:47.780> too<00:07:47.840> that<00:07:47.990> in<00:07:48.710> this<00:07:48.920> outer<00:07:49.300> kit<00:07:50.300> it

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:50.990 
point out too that in this outer kit it

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.110 
point out too that in this outer kit it
comes<00:07:51.020> with<00:07:51.290> a<00:07:51.380> zerk<00:07:51.620> fitting<00:07:51.950> so<00:07:52.700> be<00:07:52.820> careful

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 
comes with a zerk fitting so be careful

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.150 
comes with a zerk fitting so be careful
putting<00:07:53.270> that<00:07:53.450> in<00:07:53.660> and<00:07:54.380> of<00:07:54.620> course<00:07:54.860> you<00:07:55.010> got

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:55.160 
putting that in and of course you got

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.950 
putting that in and of course you got
your<00:07:55.600> castellated<00:07:56.600> nut<00:07:56.750> cotter<00:07:57.590> pin<00:07:57.860> and

00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 
your castellated nut cotter pin and

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.460 
your castellated nut cotter pin and
double-check<00:07:59.960> make<00:08:00.110> sure<00:08:00.230> everything's

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:00.470 
double-check make sure everything's

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.070 
double-check make sure everything's
tight<00:08:00.850> and<00:08:01.850> then<00:08:02.420> it<00:08:02.510> can<00:08:02.570> go<00:08:02.690> to<00:08:02.780> the<00:08:02.840> shop<00:08:03.020> and

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:03.080 
tight and then it can go to the shop and

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.860 
tight and then it can go to the shop and
get<00:08:03.260> the<00:08:03.380> alignment<00:08:03.500> done
