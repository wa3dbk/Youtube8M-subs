testing<00:00:44.850> for<00:00:45.239> xbox<00:00:45.660> one<00:00:45.960> I've<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:47.550> really

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
testing for xbox one I've so we really

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.520 
testing for xbox one I've so we really
don't<00:00:47.940> know<00:00:48.180> when<00:00:48.480> they<00:00:48.570> will<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.809> released<00:00:49.260> I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
don't know when they will be released I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.229 
don't know when they will be released I
was<00:00:50.129> thinking<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.760> they<00:00:50.940> were<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.149> to

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
was thinking that they were going to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.970 
was thinking that they were going to
wait<00:00:51.359> for<00:00:52.160> a<00:00:53.160> couple<00:00:54.000> days<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.679> ps4<00:00:55.679> to<00:00:55.829> beat

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
wait for a couple days for ps4 to beat

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.270 
wait for a couple days for ps4 to beat
into<00:00:56.370> their<00:00:56.550> cert<00:00:56.730> testing<00:00:57.149> before<00:00:57.570> they<00:00:57.870> sent

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
into their cert testing before they sent

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.389 
into their cert testing before they sent
minecraft<00:00:59.600> to<00:01:00.600> xbox<00:01:01.140> one<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.530> be<00:01:01.620> certified

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
minecraft to xbox one to be certified

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.210 
minecraft to xbox one to be certified
testing<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.899> was<00:01:04.470> wrong<00:01:04.650> because<00:01:04.920> they

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
testing but I was wrong because they

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.090 
testing but I was wrong because they
have<00:01:05.400> still<00:01:05.850> yet<00:01:05.910> to<00:01:06.150> set<00:01:06.600> send<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.680> xbox

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
have still yet to set send it to xbox

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.450 
have still yet to set send it to xbox
one<00:01:08.690> I<00:01:09.690> I<00:01:10.370> was<00:01:11.370> thinking<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.730> because<00:01:13.460> Xbox

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
one I I was thinking that because Xbox

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.789 
one I I was thinking that because Xbox
cert<00:01:15.119> testing<00:01:15.509> normally<00:01:15.810> takes<00:01:15.990> about<00:01:16.079> around

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
cert testing normally takes about around

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.899 
cert testing normally takes about around
10<00:01:17.070> days<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:18.470> ps4<00:01:19.470> normally<00:01:19.979> takes<00:01:20.189> around<00:01:20.369> 14

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
10 days and ps4 normally takes around 14

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.550 
10 days and ps4 normally takes around 14
days<00:01:21.090> or<00:01:21.270> two<00:01:21.360> weeks<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:23.479> Pia<00:01:24.479> minecraft<00:01:25.439> has

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
days or two weeks but Pia minecraft has

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
days or two weeks but Pia minecraft has
been<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.860> ps4<00:01:26.100> testing<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.060> quite<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> few<00:01:27.509> days

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.110 
it's going to be released azam or spider
comes<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.860> they<00:02:20.250> really<00:02:20.550> don't<00:02:20.730> know<00:02:20.819> when

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
comes in they really don't know when

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.290 
comes in they really don't know when
it's<00:02:21.239> going<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.390> be<00:02:21.510> released

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
it's going to be released

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.500 
it's going to be released
as<00:02:22.410> we<00:02:23.410> don't<00:02:23.620> either<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.550> I<00:02:24.850> guess<00:02:25.180> they<00:02:25.480> just

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
as we don't either so I guess they just

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.080 
as we don't either so I guess they just
said<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.840> really<00:02:26.260> late<00:02:26.530> release<00:02:27.130> date<00:02:27.370> just<00:02:27.880> so

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
said a really late release date just so

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.540 
said a really late release date just so
they're<00:02:28.270> not<00:02:28.390> wrong<00:02:28.860> because<00:02:29.860> originally

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
they're not wrong because originally

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.730 
they're not wrong because originally
they<00:02:30.910> had<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.270> 19th<00:02:31.690> of<00:02:31.870> August<00:02:32.230> on<00:02:32.350> there<00:02:32.590> and

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
they had the 19th of August on there and

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.170 
they had the 19th of August on there and
then<00:02:33.160> they<00:02:33.250> were<00:02:33.310> wrong<00:02:33.580> there<00:02:33.820> so<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.030> think

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
then they were wrong there so I think

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.000 
then they were wrong there so I think
they<00:02:34.420> set<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:34.660> back<00:02:34.870> pretty<00:02:35.110> far<00:02:35.320> away<00:02:35.470> just<00:02:35.860> so

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
they set it back pretty far away just so

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.860 
they set it back pretty far away just so
they're<00:02:36.160> not<00:02:36.310> wrong<00:02:36.430> but<00:02:36.940> like<00:02:37.090> i<00:02:37.210> said<00:02:37.240> i<00:02:37.450> am

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
they're not wrong but like i said i am

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.050 
they're not wrong but like i said i am
estimating<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.710> it<00:02:38.950> will<00:02:39.070> be<00:02:39.100> both<00:02:39.670> consoles

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
estimating that it will be both consoles

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.110 
estimating that it will be both consoles
will<00:02:40.330> be<00:02:40.660> released<00:02:41.290> early<00:02:42.030> September<00:02:43.030> to
