in<00:00:47.390> this<00:00:47.510> video<00:00:47.810> we<00:00:47.989> take<00:00:48.140> a<00:00:48.200> bone<00:00:48.620> slime

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
in this video we take a bone slime

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.880 
in this video we take a bone slime
that's<00:00:49.370> made<00:00:49.520> by<00:00:49.640> boners<00:00:50.090> okay<00:00:51.050> if<00:00:51.440> I<00:00:51.530> look<00:00:51.800> at

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
that's made by boners okay if I look at

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.000 
that's made by boners okay if I look at
it<00:00:51.950> on<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:53.600> slides<00:00:53.870> make<00:00:54.110> handmade<00:00:54.410> bone

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
it on the slides make handmade bone

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.700 
it on the slides make handmade bone
slides<00:00:55.460> and<00:00:55.940> each<00:00:56.840> one<00:00:57.080> is<00:00:57.110> totally<00:00:57.410> unique

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
slides and each one is totally unique

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.080 
slides and each one is totally unique
and<00:00:57.950> I<00:00:58.100> believe<00:00:58.340> it's<00:00:58.550> made<00:00:58.670> from<00:00:58.879> buffalo

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
and I believe it's made from buffalo

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.530 
and I believe it's made from buffalo
bone<00:00:59.860> and<00:01:00.860> it's<00:01:01.040> an<00:01:01.280> old<00:01:01.489> blues<00:01:01.790> technique<00:01:02.270> to

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
bone and it's an old blues technique to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.540 
bone and it's an old blues technique to
use<00:01:02.570> a<00:01:02.750> polished<00:01:03.470> piece<00:01:03.739> of<00:01:03.920> bone<00:01:04.160> to<00:01:04.369> play

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
use a polished piece of bone to play

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:30.280 
use a polished piece of bone to play
slide<00:01:04.850> guitar<00:01:27.160> and<00:01:28.240> see<00:01:29.240> how<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.990> different

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
slide guitar and see how the different

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.510 
slide guitar and see how the different
materials<00:01:30.740> affect<00:01:31.399> how<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.640> slide<00:01:31.940> sounds<00:01:33.520> so

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
materials affect how the slide sounds so

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.150 
materials affect how the slide sounds so
we'll<00:01:34.670> be<00:01:34.790> comparing<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.330> metal<00:01:35.660> slide<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:36.290> glass

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
we'll be comparing a metal slide a glass

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.779 
we'll be comparing a metal slide a glass
slide<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.539> boners<00:01:38.750> bone<00:01:39.110> slide<00:01:39.789> the

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
slide and the boners bone slide the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.520 
slide and the boners bone slide the
metal<00:01:40.970> is<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.479> heaviest<00:01:41.720> of<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:41.990> free<00:01:42.259> and

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
metal is the heaviest of the free and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.340 
metal is the heaviest of the free and
the<00:01:43.369> bone<00:01:43.549> is<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.850> lightest<00:01:44.240> now<00:01:45.200> although

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
the bone is the lightest now although

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.469 
the bone is the lightest now although
the<00:01:45.619> bone<00:01:46.130> slide<00:01:46.549> is<00:01:46.850> slightly<00:01:47.090> shorter<00:01:47.330> than

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
the bone slide is slightly shorter than

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.870 
the bone slide is slightly shorter than
the<00:01:47.659> other<00:01:47.840> two<00:01:47.990> you<00:01:48.740> still<00:01:48.920> able<00:01:49.040> to<00:01:49.220> fret<00:01:49.580> all

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
the other two you still able to fret all

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.340 
the other two you still able to fret all
the<00:01:50.090> notes<00:01:50.299> across<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.869> width<00:01:51.020> of<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.200> neck

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
the notes across the width of the neck

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:38.450 
the notes across the width of the neck
with<00:01:51.560> ease

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.570 

okay<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:38.940> what<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.210> found<00:02:39.450> from<00:02:39.660> experiment<00:02:40.350> in

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
okay so what I found from experiment in

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.650 
okay so what I found from experiment in
the<00:02:41.580> three<00:02:41.730> different<00:02:41.880> materials<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.480> that

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
the three different materials is that

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.860 
the three different materials is that
the<00:02:42.900> metal<00:02:43.860> slide<00:02:44.190> gives<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.180> most<00:02:45.330> harsh

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
the metal slide gives you the most harsh

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.920 
the metal slide gives you the most harsh
sort<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.530> heavy-handed<00:02:47.100> tone<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:48.720> glass

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
sort of heavy-handed tone the glass

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.070 
sort of heavy-handed tone the glass
slide<00:02:49.350> gives<00:02:49.800> you<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:49.950> brighter<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.209> cleaner

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
slide gives you a brighter and cleaner

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.780 
slide gives you a brighter and cleaner
tone<00:02:52.709> but<00:02:53.520> I<00:02:53.819> think<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:56.190> bone<00:02:56.430> slide

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
tone but I think the the bone slide

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.270 
tone but I think the the bone slide
really<00:02:57.060> does<00:02:57.270> add<00:02:57.740> something<00:02:58.740> different<00:02:58.890> to

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
really does add something different to

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.590 
really does add something different to
the<00:02:59.310> other<00:02:59.490> two<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.940> there's<00:03:00.270> more<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.540> a

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
the other two is there's more of a

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.070 
the other two is there's more of a
warmth<00:03:00.959> for<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:02.070> with<00:03:02.190> more<00:03:02.340> soulful

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
warmth for that with more soulful

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.020 
warmth for that with more soulful
slightly<00:03:04.080> rounded<00:03:04.470> off<00:03:04.590> no<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.459> it's<00:03:05.580> nice

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
slightly rounded off no and it's nice

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.300 
slightly rounded off no and it's nice
and<00:03:06.060> light
