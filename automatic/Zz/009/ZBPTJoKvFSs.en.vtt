the middle of the antlers standing which

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.319 
the middle of the antlers standing which
gives<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.280> probably<00:01:56.670> will<00:01:56.820> give<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.149> lot

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
gives it probably will give it a lot

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.280 
gives it probably will give it a lot
more<00:01:58.820> give<00:01:59.820> make<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> lot<00:02:00.270> sturdier<00:02:00.630> than<00:02:01.049> it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
more give make a lot sturdier than it

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.580 
more give make a lot sturdier than it
would<00:02:01.439> be<00:02:01.619> if<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.829> was<00:02:01.950> broke<00:02:02.159> off<00:02:02.369> flat<00:02:03.590> when

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
would be if it was broke off flat when

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.469 
would be if it was broke off flat when
you<00:02:04.710> blend<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.159> epoxy<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.060> got<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.299> shut

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
right dead center of the time will made

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.140 
right dead center of the time will made
a<00:02:21.420> hard<00:02:21.660> drill<00:02:22.079> but<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.370> will<00:02:23.459> give<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.030> lot

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
a hard drill but it will give it a lot

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.789 
a hard drill but it will give it a lot
more<00:02:24.390> strength<00:02:25.310> there<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.519> folks<00:02:27.799> puppy

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
more strength there it is folks puppy

there

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
there

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.259 
there
tell<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.049> color<00:02:34.290> difference<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:35.209> think<00:02:36.209> it

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
tell the color difference I think it

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.479 
tell the color difference I think it
looks<00:02:36.390> pretty<00:02:36.510> good<00:02:36.660> just<00:02:39.859> a<00:02:40.859> hair<00:02:41.040> shorter

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
looks pretty good just a hair shorter

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.420 
looks pretty good just a hair shorter
that<00:02:41.670> other<00:02:41.910> one<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.750> G<00:02:42.959> two<00:02:43.140> or<00:02:44.100> three<00:02:44.400> I

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
that other one in the G two or three I

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.470 
that other one in the G two or three I
guess<00:02:44.730> you'd<00:02:44.880> say<00:02:46.700> know<00:02:47.700> what<00:02:47.850> I'll<00:02:47.970> do<00:02:48.150> is

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
guess you'd say know what I'll do is

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.930 
guess you'd say know what I'll do is
I'll<00:02:48.750> let<00:02:48.930> that

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
I'll let that

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.280 
I'll let that
I<00:02:50.000> correct<00:02:50.870> for<00:02:51.020> beer<00:02:51.230> down<00:02:51.410> my<00:02:51.560> shirt<00:02:53.290> I'll

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
I correct for beer down my shirt I'll

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.650 
I correct for beer down my shirt I'll
let<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:54.940> harden<00:02:55.940> for<00:02:56.240> a<00:02:56.300> couple<00:02:56.540> hours

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
let that harden for a couple hours

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.560 
let that harden for a couple hours
usually<00:02:57.520> two<00:02:58.520> or<00:02:58.550> three<00:02:58.820> hours<00:02:59.120> it<00:02:59.300> steps

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
usually two or three hours it steps

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.370 
usually two or three hours it steps
pretty<00:03:00.230> firm<00:03:00.500> pretty<00:03:00.890> hard<00:03:01.300> what<00:03:02.300> I'll<00:03:02.420> do<00:03:02.690> is

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
pretty firm pretty hard what I'll do is

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.790 
pretty firm pretty hard what I'll do is
take<00:03:03.710> a<00:03:03.770> scalpel<00:03:04.190> blade<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.780> bundt<00:03:06.170> round

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
take a scalpel blade and a bundt round

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.670 
take a scalpel blade and a bundt round
tool<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:07.640> I'll<00:03:08.180> add<00:03:08.420> some<00:03:08.810> texture<00:03:09.260> like

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
tool and I'll add some texture like

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.790 
tool and I'll add some texture like
these<00:03:10.270> or<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.390> veins<00:03:11.660> ran<00:03:12.020> it<00:03:12.260> through<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.740> it

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
these or the veins ran it through and it
