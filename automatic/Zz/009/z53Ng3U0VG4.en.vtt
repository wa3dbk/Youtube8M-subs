00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.070 

that's<00:01:04.650> necessary<00:01:05.520> to<00:01:05.730> scrape<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.240> sides<00:01:06.480> and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
that's necessary to scrape the sides and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:28.130 
that's necessary to scrape the sides and
to<00:01:08.720> assimilate<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:09.840> much<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.590> can

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.780 

I'm<00:01:29.140> from<00:01:29.350> Oakland<00:01:29.740> face<00:01:29.950> more<00:01:30.250> like<00:01:30.520> this

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
I'm from Oakland face more like this

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.970 
I'm from Oakland face more like this
it's<00:01:31.030> not<00:01:31.240> a<00:01:31.270> hundred<00:01:31.570> percent<00:01:31.690> necessary<00:01:32.650> but

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
it's not a hundred percent necessary but

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.030 
it's not a hundred percent necessary but
if<00:01:33.670> you<00:01:34.000> were<00:01:34.410> if<00:01:35.410> you're<00:01:35.590> wanting<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:35.950> make

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
if you were if you're wanting to make

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.670 
if you were if you're wanting to make
the<00:01:36.280> best<00:01:36.490> mole<00:01:36.730> possible<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:38.170> really<00:01:38.260> need

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
the best mole possible you really need

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.140 
the best mole possible you really need
to<00:01:38.860> be<00:01:39.100> gas<00:01:40.140> when<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.350> mix<00:01:41.950> rubber<00:01:42.550> like<00:01:42.820> this

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
to be gas when you mix rubber like this

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.690 
to be gas when you mix rubber like this
it<00:01:43.870> introduces<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.680> lot<00:01:44.830> of<00:01:44.950> air<00:01:45.220> in<00:01:45.490> the

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
it introduces a lot of air in the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.290 
it introduces a lot of air in the
product<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:48.040> air<00:01:48.130> will<00:01:48.400> create<00:01:48.760> bubbles

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
product and the air will create bubbles

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.530 
product and the air will create bubbles
in<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.570> mold<00:01:49.810> and<00:01:50.350> can<00:01:51.100> cause<00:01:51.340> voids<00:01:52.119> or

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
in the mold and can cause voids or

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.830 
in the mold and can cause voids or
problems<00:01:53.440> in<00:01:53.590> your<00:01:53.710> castings<00:01:54.310> so<00:01:54.720> what<00:01:55.720> we're

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
problems in your castings so what we're

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.270 
problems in your castings so what we're
going<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:55.990> do<00:01:56.140> this<00:01:56.320> mix<00:01:56.590> it<00:01:56.710> one<00:01:56.860> more<00:01:57.040> time

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
going to do this mix it one more time

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.719 
going to do this mix it one more time
and<00:01:57.810> then<00:01:58.810> I'm<00:01:58.930> gonna<00:01:59.050> put<00:01:59.320> it<00:01:59.410> in<00:01:59.560> my<00:01:59.729> vacuum

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
and then I'm gonna put it in my vacuum

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.160 
and then I'm gonna put it in my vacuum
chamber<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:03.670> got<00:02:03.880> this<00:02:04.060> vacuum<00:02:04.750> pump

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
chamber it's got this vacuum pump

chamber it's got this vacuum pump
attached<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.860> it<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:06.130> it'll<00:02:07.000> suck<00:02:07.479> all<00:02:07.660> the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
attached to it and it'll suck all the

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.660 
attached to it and it'll suck all the
air<00:02:07.990> out<00:02:08.020> of<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.410> mold<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.800> make<00:02:08.979> a<00:02:09.009> perfect

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
air out of the mold and make a perfect

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:29.630 
air out of the mold and make a perfect

this<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:31.250> small<00:02:32.250> lesson<00:02:32.550> home<00:02:32.730> made<00:02:33.060> back<00:02:33.930> in

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
this is a small lesson home made back in

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.070 
this is a small lesson home made back in
chamber<00:02:34.710> it's<00:02:35.400> actually<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.030> end<00:02:36.240> cap<00:02:36.630> for<00:02:37.050> a

chamber it's actually the end cap for a
sewer<00:02:37.440> line<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:39.000> bought<00:02:39.210> for<00:02:39.450> about<00:02:39.690> 90

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
sewer line that I bought for about 90

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.820 
sewer line that I bought for about 90
bucks<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.740> then<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.900> added<00:02:42.900> two<00:02:43.110> holes<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:43.770> the

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
bucks and then I added two holes in the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.370 
bucks and then I added two holes in the
fittings<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.610> this<00:02:45.240> is<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.420> vacuum<00:02:45.870> pump<00:02:46.050> that

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
fittings and this is a vacuum pump that

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.620 
fittings and this is a vacuum pump that
I've<00:02:46.500> gotten<00:02:47.070> at<00:02:47.420> WWE<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:49.650> pulls<00:02:50.010> 30

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
I've gotten at WWE and it pulls 30

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.930 
I've gotten at WWE and it pulls 30
inches<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.930> lift<00:02:52.260> which<00:02:52.620> will<00:02:53.580> create<00:02:53.820> a

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
inches of lift which will create a

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.910 
inches of lift which will create a
perfect<00:02:54.360> vacuum<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.050> will<00:02:55.410> get<00:02:55.620> all<00:02:55.650> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
perfect vacuum and that will get all the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.000 
perfect vacuum and that will get all the
bubbles<00:02:56.070> out<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.490> rubber<00:02:56.730> with<00:02:57.740> mold<00:02:58.740> max

don't<00:03:01.260> made<00:03:01.440> myself<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:08.640> get<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.970> see<00:03:09.180> I've<00:03:09.390> got

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
don't made myself to get to see I've got

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:26.720 
don't made myself to get to see I've got
to<00:03:09.660> stand<00:03:09.870> on

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.670 

let's<00:03:27.730> see<00:03:27.849> it<00:03:28.150> was<00:03:28.239> that<00:03:28.420> few<00:03:28.629> minutes<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:28.959> to

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
let's see it was that few minutes to to

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.860 
let's see it was that few minutes to to
vacuum<00:03:30.040> that<00:03:30.190> we've<00:03:30.819> got<00:03:31.000> our<00:03:31.150> we've<00:03:31.660> got<00:03:31.840> a

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
vacuum that we've got our we've got a

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.130 
vacuum that we've got our we've got a
rubber<00:03:32.170> vacuum<00:03:32.769> it's<00:03:33.370> very<00:03:33.640> smooth<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:34.330> we're

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
rubber vacuum it's very smooth and we're

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:49.250 
rubber vacuum it's very smooth and we're
gonna<00:03:35.230> go

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.710 

we<00:03:49.650> won't<00:03:49.860> have<00:03:50.040> enough<00:03:50.099> just<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.150> go<00:03:51.330> with<00:03:51.360> a

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
we won't have enough just to go with a

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:01.320 
we won't have enough just to go with a
tallest<00:03:52.730> piece<00:03:53.730> we<00:03:54.480> shoot<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.230> plenty

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.270 

and<00:04:01.870> see<00:04:02.050> the<00:04:02.110> rubber<00:04:02.380> is<00:04:02.500> very<00:04:02.560> smooth<00:04:03.040> no

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
and see the rubber is very smooth no

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.450 
and see the rubber is very smooth no
bubbles<00:04:04.830> but<00:04:05.830> these<00:04:06.130> pieces<00:04:08.100> all<00:04:09.100> have<00:04:09.430> a

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
bubbles but these pieces all have a

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.580 
bubbles but these pieces all have a
little<00:04:09.760> hole<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.300> attach<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:10.960> a<00:04:10.990> necklace<00:04:11.380> so

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
little hole to attach to a necklace so

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.230 
little hole to attach to a necklace so
what<00:04:12.430> we're<00:04:12.550> going<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.730> do<00:04:12.850> is<00:04:12.970> we're<00:04:13.090> going<00:04:13.180> to

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.280 
what we're going to do is we're going to
put<00:04:13.450> that<00:04:17.610> back<00:04:18.610> in<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:19.030> vacuum<00:04:19.390> chamber<00:04:19.420> so

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
put that back in the vacuum chamber so

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.340 
put that back in the vacuum chamber so
we<00:04:20.410> make<00:04:20.620> sure<00:04:20.860> we<00:04:21.070> get<00:04:21.250> all<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.840> air<00:04:23.050> out<00:04:23.290> of

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
we make sure we get all the air out of
