that<00:00:30.949> it<00:00:31.339> wouldn't<00:00:31.699> be<00:00:31.820> mobile<00:00:32.360> now<00:00:32.960> if<00:00:33.050> we

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
that it wouldn't be mobile now if we

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.980 
that it wouldn't be mobile now if we
look<00:00:33.170> at<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:33.500> Mobile's<00:00:33.920> from<00:00:34.300> 2000<00:00:35.300> there's

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
look at the Mobile's from 2000 there's

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.720 
look at the Mobile's from 2000 there's
quite<00:00:36.140> an<00:00:36.230> old<00:00:36.380> one<00:00:36.620> now<00:00:36.860> you<00:00:37.340> can<00:00:37.490> see<00:00:37.700> that

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
quite an old one now you can see that

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.490 
quite an old one now you can see that
the<00:00:37.970> antenna<00:00:38.330> is<00:00:38.540> actually<00:00:38.870> on<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.020> top<00:00:39.320> of

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
the antenna is actually on the top of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.890 
the antenna is actually on the top of
the<00:00:40.010> case<00:00:40.250> here<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:40.820> then<00:00:41.330> after<00:00:41.660> that<00:00:41.690> they

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
the case here and then after that they

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.750 
the case here and then after that they
started<00:00:42.260> building<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.740> antenna<00:00:43.100> actually<00:00:43.550> in

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
started building the antenna actually in

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.570 
started building the antenna actually in
the<00:00:44.000> case<00:00:44.270> of<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.750> mobile<00:00:45.350> phone<00:00:45.650> this<00:00:46.250> one<00:00:46.520> I

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
the case of the mobile phone this one I

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.510 
the case of the mobile phone this one I
think<00:00:46.760> is<00:00:47.000> from<00:00:47.380> 2003<00:00:48.380> a<00:00:48.680> little<00:00:49.010> bit<00:00:49.160> smaller

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
think is from 2003 a little bit smaller

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.450 
think is from 2003 a little bit smaller
and<00:00:49.910> this<00:00:50.420> one's<00:00:50.660> from<00:00:50.980> 2006<00:00:51.980> and<00:00:52.100> you<00:00:52.190> can<00:00:52.340> see

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
and this one's from 2006 and you can see

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.670 
and this one's from 2006 and you can see
that<00:00:52.490> they're<00:00:52.760> shrinking<00:00:53.150> down<00:00:53.360> in<00:00:53.570> size<00:00:53.780> the

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
that they're shrinking down in size the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.710 
that they're shrinking down in size the
key<00:00:54.830> thing<00:00:54.860> about<00:00:55.130> a<00:00:55.310> mobile<00:00:55.730> phone<00:00:56.060> the<00:00:56.540> thing

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
key thing about a mobile phone the thing

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.510 
key thing about a mobile phone the thing
that<00:00:56.840> makes<00:00:56.990> it<00:00:57.170> mobile<00:00:57.650> is<00:00:57.920> that<00:00:58.220> it<00:00:58.310> uses

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
that makes it mobile is that it uses

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.120 
that makes it mobile is that it uses
radio<00:00:59.000> waves<00:00:59.260> so<00:01:00.260> what<00:01:00.440> are<00:01:00.470> radio<00:01:01.070> waves

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
radio waves so what are radio waves

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.250 
radio waves so what are radio waves
radio<00:01:02.030> waves<00:01:02.060> are<00:01:02.510> part<00:01:02.720> of<00:01:02.870> what's<00:01:03.050> called

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
radio waves are part of what's called

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.100 
radio waves are part of what's called
the<00:01:03.430> electromagnetic<00:01:04.430> spectrum<00:01:04.750> waves<00:01:05.750> of

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
the electromagnetic spectrum waves of

energy made of electric and magnetic
fields<00:01:08.409> in<00:01:09.409> fact<00:01:09.560> there's<00:01:09.740> a<00:01:09.799> whole<00:01:09.979> spectrum

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
fields in fact there's a whole spectrum

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.669 
fields in fact there's a whole spectrum
of<00:01:10.609> these<00:01:10.820> waves<00:01:11.179> starting<00:01:12.020> at<00:01:12.109> radio<00:01:12.409> waves

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:12.679 
of these waves starting at radio waves

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:15.099 
of these waves starting at radio waves
going<00:01:13.399> into<00:01:13.549> the<00:01:13.759> infrared<00:01:14.240> going<00:01:14.810> into<00:01:15.020> the

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
going into the infrared going into the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:17.529 
going into the infrared going into the
visible<00:01:15.289> the<00:01:15.890> ultraviolet<00:01:16.609> x-rays<00:01:17.329> and

visible the ultraviolet x-rays and
cosmic<00:01:18.020> rays<00:01:18.229> all<00:01:18.679> these<00:01:18.920> things<00:01:18.979> are<00:01:19.460> the

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
cosmic rays all these things are the

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.870 
cosmic rays all these things are the
same<00:01:19.609> thing<00:01:20.469> electromagnetic<00:01:21.469> radiation<00:01:22.189> now

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
same thing electromagnetic radiation now

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.399 
same thing electromagnetic radiation now
it<00:01:22.969> turns<00:01:23.030> out<00:01:23.329> there<00:01:23.569> are<00:01:23.689> three<00:01:23.990> things<00:01:24.229> that

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
it turns out there are three things that

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.410 
it turns out there are three things that
are<00:01:24.590> important<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.159> waves<00:01:25.549> there's<00:01:26.299> the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
are important to waves there's the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.539 
are important to waves there's the
wavelength<00:01:26.899> the<00:01:27.409> frequency<00:01:27.679> and<00:01:28.189> the

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
wavelength the frequency and the

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.880 
wavelength the frequency and the
velocity<00:01:28.719> so<00:01:29.719> you've<00:01:29.840> imagined<00:01:30.200> our<00:01:30.530> water

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
velocity so you've imagined our water

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.859 
velocity so you've imagined our water
waves<00:01:31.219> on<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.490> ocean<00:01:31.609> if<00:01:32.149> we<00:01:32.240> put<00:01:32.389> a<00:01:32.420> football

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
waves on the ocean if we put a football

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.109

down<00:01:33.079> on<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.409> ocean<00:01:33.799> as<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:34.130> wave<00:01:34.429> goes<00:01:34.759> past

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
down on the ocean as a wave goes past

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.330 
down on the ocean as a wave goes past
the<00:01:35.359> football<00:01:35.780> bob<00:01:36.139> up<00:01:36.319> and<00:01:36.469> down<00:01:36.590> the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
the football bob up and down the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.069 
the football bob up and down the
frequency<00:01:37.969> is<00:01:38.030> how<00:01:38.299> many<00:01:38.359> times<00:01:38.749> that

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079

football Bob's up and down a second the
wavelength<00:01:42.259> is<00:01:42.469> the<00:01:42.499> different<00:01:43.039> distance

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
wavelength is the different distance

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.539 
wavelength is the different distance
between<00:01:43.999> two<00:01:44.479> peaks<00:01:44.780> of<00:01:45.109> a<00:01:45.229> wave<00:01:45.469> and<00:01:45.799> the

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
between two peaks of a wave and the

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:47.830 
between two peaks of a wave and the
velocity<00:01:46.939> of<00:01:46.969> course<00:01:47.209> is<00:01:47.359> the<00:01:47.479> speed<00:01:47.689> at<00:01:47.719> which

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
velocity of course is the speed at which

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.499 
velocity of course is the speed at which
it<00:01:47.959> goes<00:01:48.289> past<00:01:48.619> now<00:01:49.249> for<00:01:49.459> radio<00:01:49.729> waves<00:01:49.969> you<00:01:50.389> get

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
it goes past now for radio waves you get

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.709 
it goes past now for radio waves you get
a<00:01:50.539> very<00:01:50.749> simple<00:01:51.139> formula<00:01:51.560> actually<00:01:51.679> that<00:01:52.670> the

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
a very simple formula actually that the

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.419 
a very simple formula actually that the
wavelength<00:01:53.719> is<00:01:53.899> given<00:01:54.200> by<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.409> speed<00:01:54.799> /<00:01:55.280> the

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
wavelength is given by the speed / the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.940 
wavelength is given by the speed / the
frequency<00:01:56.090> which<00:01:56.630> approximates<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.770> wave

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
frequency which approximates to the wave

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.940 
frequency which approximates to the wave
length<00:01:58.069> in<00:01:58.429> meters<00:01:58.459> is<00:01:59.259> 300<00:02:00.259> divided<00:02:00.799> by<00:02:00.889> the

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
length in meters is 300 divided by the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.749 
length in meters is 300 divided by the
frequency<00:02:01.639> and<00:02:01.729> megahertz<00:02:03.219> so<00:02:04.219> this<00:02:04.429> is<00:02:04.579> our

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
frequency and megahertz so this is our

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.309 
frequency and megahertz so this is our
little<00:02:04.880> device<00:02:05.359> that's<00:02:05.779> going<00:02:05.959> to<00:02:06.020> pick<00:02:06.200> up

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
little device that's going to pick up

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:08.109 
little device that's going to pick up
the<00:02:06.469> radio<00:02:06.619> waves<00:02:07.069> from<00:02:07.279> the<00:02:07.459> mobile<00:02:07.850> phone

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
the radio waves from the mobile phone

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.359 
the radio waves from the mobile phone
and<00:02:08.420> it's<00:02:09.080> very<00:02:09.319> very<00:02:09.380> simple<00:02:09.800> what<00:02:10.039> we've<00:02:10.190> got

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
and it's very very simple what we've got

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.089 
and it's very very simple what we've got
is<00:02:10.490> a<00:02:10.520> loop<00:02:10.789> of<00:02:10.940> wire<00:02:11.209> we've<00:02:12.170> got<00:02:12.349> an<00:02:12.470> LED<00:02:12.830> light

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
is a loop of wire we've got an LED light

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.699 
is a loop of wire we've got an LED light
and<00:02:13.459> a<00:02:13.819> component<00:02:14.360> called<00:02:14.569> a<00:02:14.810> germanium<00:02:15.260> diode

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
and a component called a germanium diode

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.450 
and a component called a germanium diode
so<00:02:16.400> I've<00:02:16.519> just<00:02:16.549> soldered<00:02:17.060> these

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
so I've just soldered these

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.670 
so I've just soldered these
together<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.940> form<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.210> little<00:02:18.330> circuit<00:02:18.960> what

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
together to form a little circuit what

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.440 
together to form a little circuit what
happens<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.220> when<00:02:20.400> radio<00:02:20.790> waves<00:02:21.030> pass<00:02:21.420> through

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
happens is when radio waves pass through

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.410 
happens is when radio waves pass through
the<00:02:22.020> loop<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.860> loop<00:02:23.040> x<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.520> an<00:02:23.640> antenna<00:02:24.090> and

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
the loop the loop x is an antenna and

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.450 
the loop the loop x is an antenna and
converts<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.260> radio<00:02:25.590> wave<00:02:25.800> into<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.250> voltage

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
converts the radio wave into a voltage

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.880 
converts the radio wave into a voltage
and<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.330> voltage<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:28.050> high<00:02:28.260> enough<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.740> light

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
and that voltage is high enough to light

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.980 
and that voltage is high enough to light
this<00:02:29.070> little<00:02:29.340> LED<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.450> we're<00:02:30.540> going<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.720> show

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
this little LED so we're going to show

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.170 
this little LED so we're going to show
that<00:02:31.020> we're<00:02:31.320> making<00:02:31.470> radio<00:02:32.430> waves<00:02:32.700> with<00:02:33.060> our

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180

on my mobile phone you might be worth

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.490 
on my mobile phone you might be worth

setting it to gsm network rather than

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.330 
setting it to gsm network rather than
the<00:02:43.710> 3g<00:02:44.280> network<00:02:45.740> slightly<00:02:46.740> higher<00:02:46.980> power

put<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.530> near<00:02:52.740> to<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.130> loop<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:54.300> can<00:02:54.450> see

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
put it near to the loop and you can see

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.810 
put it near to the loop and you can see
the<00:02:54.780> LED<00:02:54.990> lights<00:02:55.350> so<00:02:56.220> what<00:02:56.370> we're<00:02:56.520> doing<00:02:56.550> is

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
the LED lights so what we're doing is

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.130 
the LED lights so what we're doing is
we're<00:02:56.970> converting<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.600> radio<00:02:57.930> waves

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
we're converting the radio waves

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.710 
we're converting the radio waves
generated<00:02:58.470> by<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.010> mobile<00:02:59.400> phone<00:02:59.700> the<00:03:00.510> loops

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
generated by the mobile phone the loops

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.140 
generated by the mobile phone the loops
picking<00:03:01.140> up<00:03:01.350> like<00:03:01.590> an<00:03:01.740> antenna<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.460> LED

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
picking up like an antenna and the LED

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.060 
picking up like an antenna and the LED
is<00:03:03.360> lighting<00:03:04.080> showing<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.740> we're<00:03:04.920> creating

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
is lighting showing that we're creating

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.760 
is lighting showing that we're creating
radio<00:03:05.820> waves<00:03:08.960> now<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.020> transfer<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.590> energy

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
radio waves now the transfer of energy

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.130 
radio waves now the transfer of energy
from<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.370> radio<00:03:11.700> waves<00:03:11.970> from<00:03:12.240> a<00:03:12.360> mobile<00:03:12.540> phone

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
from the radio waves from a mobile phone

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.010 
from the radio waves from a mobile phone
into<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:13.950> loop<00:03:14.220> antenna<00:03:14.460> is<00:03:15.000> usually<00:03:15.840> most

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
into the loop antenna is usually most

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.810 
into the loop antenna is usually most
efficient<00:03:16.590> when<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.860> length<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.370> loop<00:03:17.580> is

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
efficient when the length of the loop is

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.110 
efficient when the length of the loop is
a<00:03:18.060> whole<00:03:18.420> wavelength<00:03:18.780> in<00:03:19.410> size<00:03:19.740> so<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:20.730> tried

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
a whole wavelength in size so I tried

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.000 
a whole wavelength in size so I tried
different<00:03:21.450> loops<00:03:21.870> just<00:03:22.500> by<00:03:22.650> using<00:03:22.830> different

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
different loops just by using different

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.340 
different loops just by using different
bits<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.610> wire<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.240> found<00:03:24.450> this<00:03:24.600> one<00:03:24.900> gave

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
bits of wire and I found this one gave

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.200 
bits of wire and I found this one gave
the<00:03:25.500> brightest<00:03:25.920> light<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.550> this<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:26.910> probably

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
the brightest light so this is probably

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.840 
the brightest light so this is probably
one<00:03:27.720> wavelength<00:03:28.020> all<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.890> way<00:03:29.040> around<00:03:29.070> and

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
one wavelength all the way around and

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.580 
one wavelength all the way around and
actually<00:03:30.000> if<00:03:30.210> you<00:03:30.270> measure<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:31.080> comes<00:03:31.350> out

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
actually if you measure it it comes out

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.410 
actually if you measure it it comes out
at<00:03:31.740> about<00:03:31.830> 30<00:03:32.220> centimeters<00:03:32.580> all<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.300> way

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
at about 30 centimeters all the way

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.510 
at about 30 centimeters all the way
around<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:34.320> using<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.740> little<00:03:34.980> formula<00:03:35.370> that

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
around and using a little formula that

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.430 
around and using a little formula that
we<00:03:35.670> discussed<00:03:36.060> earlier<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.870> gives<00:03:37.140> us<00:03:37.320> a

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
we discussed earlier that gives us a

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.160 
we discussed earlier that gives us a
frequency<00:03:38.160> of<00:03:38.310> about<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.970> thousand<00:03:39.630> megahertz

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
frequency of about a thousand megahertz
