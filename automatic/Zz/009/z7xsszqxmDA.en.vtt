00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.309
 I would like to introduce him today the Microsoft with the tool 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.679
 like this one can be certain with the tool 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.939
 the former of a desktop 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:16.970
 Copy 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.839
 so it's called Chatter Graphic 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.300
 the division can speak 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.349
 Franz also screenshots 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.220
 There is also other construction planning 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.619
 with whom Andris Skele can pull 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.619
 there is also a button that wore that collar 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.420
 you can see it 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.340
 one leads for example 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.320
 from the clipboard had a copy round 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.920
 entire screen copied 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.810
 that with the tool a little more comfortable 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.870
 to functions 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.750
 on something very dear Windows 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.230
 we know that this is killing 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.380
 Knipping in 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.380
 then this problem comes Jun 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.250
 and then 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.830
 Surface 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.270
 The rest goes Klopp has now 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.090
 deposited 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.850
 that means that the program 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.520
 ready for copying is 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.939
 and I have no other program open now BZ he heard nothing else 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.030
 with finally that's again 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.460
 Just ounces 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.250
 ddp 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.390
 4 of 4 o'clock this is a program with different fonts 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.880
 can look at 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.790
 but for that 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.399
 in all other video more 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.720
 now clearly that with the tool again 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.090
 and now I can have the sons 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.090
 Desktop Demirci California from Copy 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.390
 Keep the integers pressed 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.770
 and mark this area 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.180
 you can see that very well 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.870
 because of that 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.650
 gray desktop with mine 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.710
 only my best again over gates 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.530
 the rich one copies then 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.730
 not be easy with the Aachener 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.220
 and the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.020
 Main program of Smith the 2 he feels again 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.490
 I can do that now 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.000
 the third highest one is just two different 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.729
 Edit options I have my text Marketeers quite well if they are in one 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.609
 DAX DAX i have copied for example 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.609
 want something like that before life 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.669
 or that could be a list with yellow 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:25.669
 with this pen here you can select other colors OTR pen for example 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.629
 Farmer something black 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.049
 as in Denmark Plauen foundations need to know to distinguish one is 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.849
 could for example 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:34.899
 Brasília 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:35.810
 curl 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.810
 or just an exclamation point anyway 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.739
 if they are the whole 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:43.970
 Picture here everything 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.970
 want to send e-mail here on this 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.679
 give this symbol 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:52.479
 that's only possible with their standards 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:55.779
 e-mail program so that the standards program have set 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.000
 what else can we show in another how to do that? 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.789
 here the clipboard 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:04.659
 For example, now this picture of her I could have in the 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.059
 Clipboard Copy as it is now 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:09.319
 open wine 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.079
 Text who work program 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.079
 so that they too on s pestis ranks 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.760
 and then I would have you my picture and could edit like any other 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:22.289
 others too 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.309
 as she might senate this 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:29.380
 like the desktop scream here and the green instead of a hotel 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.359
 Brands this emergency fire 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.179
 you can change it does not necessarily have to be red 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:35.839
 that's what you do 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:38.899
 under Extras Options 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:40.229
 Here you can 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:43.409
 Choose which color to put on 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.579
 if you have another one now 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.419
 For example, the earliest she goes to the front 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.159
 here of course normal copying 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.419
 Take pictures of Zuse because she does not change 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.329
 that is core disadvantage 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.429
 Loads good 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.989
 We also still have no other choice of option on the one now 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.129
 the relatively logical 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.359
 To save the whole click on the us chain 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:11.859
 or 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.159
 Tenant part 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.059
 save and sa 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:18.059
 the tax raises the whole on the c-class emperor m 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.620
 and all that with me 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.879
 the «Tea for Good Rolf Schumann 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.710
 For example, I have the program here 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.620
 Vitus in Kandersteg way 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.680
 and then I have here 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.620
 I'll tell you some time 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.790
 I could synonymous other formats from Willich RP graphics 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.509
 that goes before the profile of the coped 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.740
 at the top gave 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.840
 had Vettel is also a lately resilient yes 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.610
 Represents the graphic 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.610
 Spokeswoman without number is on 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.120
 ZEEP latte our pace 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.939
 now he can even enter 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:58.879
 program 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:59.910
 to edit 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.600
 5 For example, they mean more functions or want to change more than 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.349
 the meeting TU offers you from home 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.349
 can she is the talk about Schmittgen pots Inc 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.449
 also a freeware program 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.919
 and then you can do that you can work on it by means of a child 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.710
 or they just open it up 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.839
 via the Windows Photo Gallery 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:23.839
 normal watch 

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.889
 OK
