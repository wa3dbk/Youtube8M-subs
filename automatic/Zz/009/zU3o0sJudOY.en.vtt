so just connected that up you plug the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.289 
so just connected that up you plug the
USB<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.540> we'll<00:01:28.320> switch<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.299> send

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
USB in so we'll switch that on and send

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.399 
USB in so we'll switch that on and send
it<00:01:30.420> some<00:01:30.570> code<00:01:34.070> where<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.189> go
