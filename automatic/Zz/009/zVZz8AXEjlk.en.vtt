00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.279
 Hello dear people and warmly 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.919
 welcome to this video where i am 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.219
 show you 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:15.179
 like her at ps3 if you are in that 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.550
 Station around shows how ideas leave 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.460
 the whole is now on the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.410
 version 4.6 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.920
 this is the latest version 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.609
 outside today, the tenth 8 is down 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.880
 mistakes can be seen yes and I have 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.079
 just found out 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.620
 yes, I also found out how 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.110
 you can leave him and I have 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.340
 I have been looking for a very long time and have 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.510
 actually only somehow that 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.950
 found what did not work 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.710
 I just wanted to show you now, we 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.230
 you can lose the whole 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.000
 works very easy and like at 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.539
 many other videos maybe too 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.340
 within the right file one 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.750
 small warning my ps3 it now 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.520
 unfortunately back to normal condition 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.989
 So the fellow demonstrations 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.449
 motiv is because I made it 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.920
 but I have not filmed yet 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.090
 I just want to go this way 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.890
 would do it again it again to 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.840
 demonstrate 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.150
 that should not be a problem because later 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.530
 the steps that follow later 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.420
 Unfortunately, I can not show it now 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.770
 who we are in one you will find them 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.299
 I have to be simple for that 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.060
 apologize that the camera is such a 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.700
 bad bad that maybe it 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.820
 but how much was there but I would 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.380
 my cellphone movies because I am so on 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.630
 show everything you need 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:39.370
 is first a ps3 which is at 46 and 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:46.080
 hold station modem usb drive 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:49.180
 as well as that should be best with 32 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.680
 if yours is not important at 32 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:58.420
 you can just do that and 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.530
 then format also select 32 then 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.660
 he was quick to format and 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.940
 Of course everything will be so 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.430
 of course, all things on your usb 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.210
 change stick but deleted 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.340
 So you need the usb stick on it 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.280
 So make the folder where eps 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.620
 capitalized on us 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.150
 then again a folder with update 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.750
 again all priority 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.800
 Denon we open this now first 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.430
 file here is the link to this file 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.700
 then just network in the description 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:39.130
 and many thanks to the online or daisy 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:42.010

 file the londoner humidity what 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.830
 Do not replace the planning 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:53.370
 He finds you with a click on this 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:56.520
 folder here and there you have this file 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.750
 old building a usb stick 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.300
 all now takes a halt 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.190
 happen 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.190
 I'll cut that right now 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:13.750
 and yes, we'll meet again 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:16.989
 so if you stick to usb stick so 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.900
 like me now, so I'm the one heavy 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.209
 it will be after power then 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:31.200
 you just close the cd usb stick 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:31.200
 just go out or go right-click and 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:47.860
 this thing ps3 throw out in the 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:50.879
 Galleries years fighting I am now 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.250
 just not at home 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:56.110
 I hope that's enough for her first 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.030
 you have to do your ps3 first 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.200
 so i can show you off here 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.200
 are but station 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:09.959
 it is not certain there's weird 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.489
 not this meanwhile what you do 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.489
 you turn off your ps3 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.110
 Now put the usb stick in the 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.360
 right usb port that would be then 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.030
 this one because this one on the first 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:34.190
 Handelsblattes and blue somehow 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:36.350
 things can and do you think this button 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.940
 now pressed that three times 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.860
 has if you now it forces the 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:45.610
 first time get this too because 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.610
 I have the ps3 again from 1 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.150
 2 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:05.039
 now this is how it's all out again 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:10.820
 I had that from you again 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.820
 three times but in the third market the 21st 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:22.390
 ask twice and three this twice 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.560
 you have to wait for that comes the 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.230
 here in such a pure 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.960
 which means stop should a controller 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.460
 connect in the usb cable and the ps 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.950
 It is hard to feel this medium for 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:37.120
 Taste in the case 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:39.630
 Let's just let it go so we come 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:48.700
 here in the safety mode rain 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:50.670
 evelin settings 69 on the sixth 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.950
 Settings Settings 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:56.340
 system update since children stop 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.340
 it 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.090
 and someone who is now in bed and 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:06.350
 at the same time check the start button 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.820
 Not now, because that's it 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.560
 if you happen to do that 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.060
 now in detail you would be her 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.340
 second we do with kiesbett and 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:17.720
 press start button and that would 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:22.880
 maybe take a while and then 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:24.280
 at one time my system update will 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.770
 Installed 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.460
 Literature would have to be 100 percent 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.560
 is 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.300
 and after that it feels like you are 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:37.100
 your ps3 updated normally if that is so 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.910
 comes a second time on the update 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.230
 once installed and then have 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.110
 europeans then everything would have to first 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:48.200
 easy to accept again so invest 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.890
 how it all is and then start your 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.780
 kers 30.9 

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:57.200
 and that's about it 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:07:00.530
 are you back in the normal ps3 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:05.660
