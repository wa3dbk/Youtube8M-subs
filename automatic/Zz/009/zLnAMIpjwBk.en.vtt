00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.429
 a beautiful what is that 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:13.130
 what's that after battleground 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.130
 Please forgive me for that 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.920
 dolph ziggler and his opinion of 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.420
 former high stamp his views 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.879
 reluctantly back and hides possible 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.020
 sent out consequences so he left 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.280
 on his twitter profile in his 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.430
 description of the following sentence 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.750
 capture informant abu dhabi world 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.010
 heavyweight champion dan olds clearer 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.469
 Can you be frustrated over his failed 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.090
 reign barely express but also 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.410
 opposite the wwe own tv 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.170
 design is by no means a winner 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.940
 squeamish the ever- popular live 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.199
 show ces the charming golf and made 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.210
 not just friends 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.470
 Although most fans are happy about 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.729
 so much honesty and also a part 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.110
 the like-minded employee is 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.890
 happy in very small open advocate 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.180
 to have found 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.439
 however, many are 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.630
 responsible over so much openness 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.130
 by no means enthusiastic 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.479
 at the moment it has to be there with some anyway 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.490
 fighting against the backdrops 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.020
 even if supposedly nobody knows exactly 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.060
 where these antipathies come from 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.830
 so you find these openly discharged 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.869
 honesty through a plausible 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:34.290
 reasoning at summerslam won randy 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.900
 orton the wwe gÃ¶de does not work at all 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.790
 not at all dull striker of his mark 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.590
 former commentator instructor 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.750
 said in an interview that at the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.640
 wwe though no words are banned 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.180
 Certain concepts are avoided 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.340
 should 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.430
 as an example he called the term world 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.710
 translates well the corresponding titles 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.270
 the promotion should by no means belt 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.770
 to be called the some spectator 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.540
 otherwise could come up with the idea 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.149
 that I have two teams in the ring around one 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.009
 Garment wings goethe are here 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.590
 only there for pants 2.3 aka 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.340
 literally 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.629
 there are no forbidden words 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.489
 there are a few words that are not 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.090
 but there are good ones for that 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.940
 reasons 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.780
 as an example, a championship is not 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.010
 google a belt holding someone's pants 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.720
 No wrestling could look up 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.930
 ask why do they fight for one 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.000
 Garment if you say you one 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.280
 want to win championship then 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.280
 gives the whole more importance 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.290
 Cody Rhodes is fired and why the 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.700
 chances are dave meltzer wrestling 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.620
 Observer should have been around for some time 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.670
 have conceded that cody for 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.400
 a certain time out of the ring 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.349
 finally , good will be passed 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.519
 marry man until the creative team has 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.680
 However, this planning is not 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.730
 Discussed between the obvious 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.610
 different departments of how 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.049
 currently communicates so miserably 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.299
 rather knew with creative control 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.920
 that's why Cody got married 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.390
 in the short term some scene from the 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.980
 ground tamped so it at the match 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.410
 against randy orton and kulis provisional 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.329
 career, however, is already following 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.400
 his honeymoon freshly rested 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.670
 or suicidal again in the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.670
 climb 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.730
 two weeks ago I expressed mine 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.000
 john cena could be at 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:27.470
 Royal Rumble celebrate his return 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.549
 He should have both together with James 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.560
 due to injury a several months 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.810
 take a break and should be on time 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.340
 to be fit for the traffic lights , however 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.540
 that you look at the usual 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.049
 surprise participant at the rumble 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.000
 looking forward 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.940
 the hot favorite at the moment is six 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.250
 the neg roberts the legend often 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.329
 serious interest in a rambo 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.329
 occurs 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.379
 cassius without the end as chris hero 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.940
 he was in the independent scene at the 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.519
 side of today's antonio cesaro 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.760
 celebrated at nexteer hangman currently fest 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.440
 why because his physique is not that 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.769
 idealtype of a wwe wrestler it 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.730
 he corresponds to his defined 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.129
 meanwhile, without even from the 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.599
 nxt intro deleted 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.459
 He was still standing in memory recently 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.950
 before the jump in the main show now 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.090
 you have to be at nxt live events so 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.419
 not even at the actual show 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.010
 for his colleagues, however, whether the 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.150
 former independence there is one more 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.049
 serious chance gets 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.430
 to be seen 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.229
 At the moment, the responsible ones seem 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.250
 however, every trust in his 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.970
 to have lost a person 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.830
 Of course it is in the back of the head 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.510
 bale that is with these messages the 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.180
 news is the one single editor 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.460
 my little one is especially important 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.740
 considered if he clenched the whole 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:46.490
 huge epochal load of news wants 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:50.479
 then look at www.test.de in this 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:54.979
 until the next full day 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.979
 gloves fuck you
