been experimenting with a bunch of stuff
and<00:01:19.400> so<00:01:20.180> this<00:01:20.390> is<00:01:20.869> juice<00:01:21.799> boot<00:01:22.100> Beauty<00:01:22.700> juice

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329

beauty<00:01:24.009> green<00:01:25.009> apple<00:01:25.700> peel<00:01:26.000> this<00:01:26.329> organic

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
beauty green apple peel this organic

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.870 
beauty green apple peel this organic
peel<00:01:27.020> doesn't<00:01:27.439> mess<00:01:27.590> around<00:01:27.670> natural<00:01:28.670> fruit

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
peel doesn't mess around natural fruit

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.789 
peel doesn't mess around natural fruit
acids<00:01:29.329> dissolve<00:01:29.570> even<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.229> most<00:01:30.350> tenacious

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
acids dissolve even the most tenacious

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.130 
acids dissolve even the most tenacious
dead<00:01:31.369> cells<00:01:31.700> for<00:01:32.270> an<00:01:32.329> immediately<00:01:32.750> brighter

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
dead cells for an immediately brighter

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.069 
dead cells for an immediately brighter
smoother<00:01:33.560> complexion<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:34.909> this<00:01:35.270> is<00:01:35.659> full

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
smoother complexion and so this is full

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.789 
smoother complexion and so this is full
size<00:01:36.320> of<00:01:36.710> this<00:01:36.799> is<00:01:37.040> two<00:01:37.340> ounces<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.000> that<00:01:38.180> is

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
size of this is two ounces and that is

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.530 
size of this is two ounces and that is
$45<00:01:39.799> so<00:01:40.310> this<00:01:40.850> is<00:01:40.880> supposed<00:01:41.210> to<00:01:41.240> be<00:01:41.299> all

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
$45 so this is supposed to be all

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.840 
$45 so this is supposed to be all
organic<00:01:42.229> everything<00:01:42.619> like<00:01:42.740> that<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:43.189> has<00:01:43.220> a

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
organic everything like that it has a

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.690 
organic everything like that it has a
potent<00:01:44.689> alpha<00:01:45.079> and<00:01:45.259> beta<00:01:45.439> hydroxy<00:01:46.100> acid

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
potent alpha and beta hydroxy acid

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.109 
potent alpha and beta hydroxy acid
complex<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:48.549> you<00:01:49.549> know<00:01:49.640> I<00:01:49.670> guess<00:01:49.909> it's<00:01:50.090> just

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
complex so you know I guess it's just

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.429 
complex so you know I guess it's just
like<00:01:50.329> a<00:01:50.360> cream<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:52.369> word<00:01:52.610> peel<00:01:53.439> freaks

the<00:05:22.979> seeds<00:05:23.250> in<00:05:23.400> them<00:05:23.580> and<00:05:23.849> as<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.240> paper

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
the seeds in them and as the paper

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.689 
the seeds in them and as the paper
biodegrades<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.740> wild<00:05:25.979> flowers<00:05:26.280> bloom<00:05:26.520> so

biodegrades the wild flowers bloom so

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.719 
biodegrades the wild flowers bloom so
