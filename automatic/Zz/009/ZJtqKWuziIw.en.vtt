I<00:04:30.940> mean<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.870> non<00:04:31.990> reality<00:04:32.260> it's<00:04:32.590> just<00:04:32.770> it's

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
I mean the non reality it's just it's

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.800 
I mean the non reality it's just it's
just<00:04:33.100> my<00:04:33.310> position<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.150> buttons<00:04:34.450> different

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
just my position the buttons different

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.200 
just my position the buttons different
like<00:04:35.800> it's<00:04:36.010> still<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.520> same<00:04:36.550> controller<00:04:37.060> at

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
like it's still the same controller at

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.430 
like it's still the same controller at
the<00:04:37.270> end<00:04:37.450> of<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.600> day<00:04:37.750> so<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.080> wouldn't<00:04:38.350> really

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
the end of the day so I wouldn't really

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.620 
the end of the day so I wouldn't really
I<00:04:38.740> wouldn't<00:04:39.640> really<00:04:39.760> go<00:04:39.940> against<00:04:40.360> and

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
I wouldn't really go against and

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.390 
I wouldn't really go against and
actually<00:04:40.990> like<00:04:41.140> MLG<00:04:41.560> have<00:04:41.770> them<00:04:41.920> approved<00:04:42.160> as

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400
