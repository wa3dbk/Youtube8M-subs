00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.229 

they're<00:00:33.719> heavy<00:00:34.309> first<00:00:35.309> thing<00:00:35.520> I've<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:35.850> all<00:00:36.120> by

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
they're heavy first thing I've so all by

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.130 
they're heavy first thing I've so all by
myself<00:00:37.070> did<00:00:38.239> I've<00:00:39.239> learned<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.570> lot<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.960> is

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
myself did I've learned a lot this is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.500 
myself did I've learned a lot this is
the<00:00:40.260> first<00:00:40.500> one<00:00:40.739> kind<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.640> messed<00:00:41.879> up<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.480> a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the first one kind of messed up on it a

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.040 
the first one kind of messed up on it a
little<00:00:42.809> bit<00:00:43.520> and<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:45.180> learned<00:00:45.390> from<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.660> on

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
little bit and I learned from that on

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.470 
little bit and I learned from that on
these<00:00:46.170> next<00:00:46.530> two<00:00:46.730> although<00:00:47.730> they're<00:00:48.149> not<00:00:48.329> very

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
these next two although they're not very

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.240 
these next two although they're not very
perfect<00:00:48.960> either<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.800> take<00:00:49.950> clothes<00:00:50.460> looks

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.799 

put<00:00:56.250> some<00:00:56.399> chicken<00:00:56.760> wire<00:00:56.879> down<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> bottom

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
put some chicken wire down on the bottom

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.279 
put some chicken wire down on the bottom
to<00:00:58.260> prevent<00:00:58.730> moles<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.180> other<00:01:00.539> ground

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
to prevent moles and other ground

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.500 
to prevent moles and other ground
rodents<00:01:01.680> from<00:01:02.180> getting<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.329> veggies

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.649 

and

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.179 

I<00:01:08.950> guess<00:01:09.950> that's<00:01:10.130> really<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.670> just<00:01:12.189> figured

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
I guess that's really it just figured

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.309 
I guess that's really it just figured
I'd<00:01:13.310> send<00:01:13.549> you<00:01:13.640> a<00:01:13.670> video<00:01:13.880> instead<00:01:14.270> of<00:01:14.569> pictures

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:15.319 
I'd send you a video instead of pictures

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.469 
I'd send you a video instead of pictures
in<00:01:15.499> an<00:01:15.590> email<00:01:15.679> you<00:01:16.429> want<00:01:16.789> to<00:01:16.850> talk<00:01:17.000> about<00:01:17.030> some

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
in an email you want to talk about some

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.340 
in an email you want to talk about some
of<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:18.189> complications<00:01:19.189> you<00:01:19.429> ran<00:01:19.640> into<00:01:19.670> oh

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
of the complications you ran into oh

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.699 
of the complications you ran into oh
sure<00:01:21.350> complications<00:01:23.049> this<00:01:24.049> wood<00:01:24.259> is<00:01:24.409> really

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:24.709 
sure complications this wood is really

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.940 
sure complications this wood is really
thick<00:01:25.209> these<00:01:26.209> posts<00:01:26.750> are<00:01:26.840> four<00:01:27.229> inches<00:01:27.259> and

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
thick these posts are four inches and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.859 
thick these posts are four inches and
the<00:01:28.130> skill<00:01:28.459> saw<00:01:28.700> I<00:01:28.729> was<00:01:28.969> using<00:01:29.179> was<00:01:29.450> maybe<00:01:29.630> only

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
the skill saw I was using was maybe only

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.219 
the skill saw I was using was maybe only
two<00:01:30.259> inches<00:01:30.670> so<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:32.240> they<00:01:32.390> were<00:01:32.450> heavy<00:01:32.719> heavy

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
two inches so and they were heavy heavy

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.919 
two inches so and they were heavy heavy
pieces<00:01:33.530> they're<00:01:33.920> 20<00:01:34.159> feet<00:01:34.219> long<00:01:34.490> so<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:35.780> was

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
pieces they're 20 feet long so it was

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.199 
pieces they're 20 feet long so it was
difficult<00:01:36.079> to<00:01:36.439> rotate<00:01:36.979> them<00:01:37.189> four<00:01:37.399> times<00:01:37.429> to

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:38.209 
difficult to rotate them four times to

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:40.630 
difficult to rotate them four times to
get<00:01:38.359> a<00:01:38.569> straight<00:01:38.869> cut<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.950> therefore<00:01:40.429> some

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
get a straight cut and therefore some

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.119 
get a straight cut and therefore some
cuts<00:01:40.849> were<00:01:41.030> not<00:01:41.179> straight<00:01:41.860> and<00:01:42.860> same<00:01:43.099> thing

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:43.129 
cuts were not straight and same thing

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:48.550 
cuts were not straight and same thing
with<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.939> side<00:01:44.390> rails<00:01:45.849> and<00:01:47.020> then<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.349> was

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
with the side rails and then it was

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.319 
with the side rails and then it was
really<00:01:49.039> really<00:01:49.640> difficult<00:01:49.969> to<00:01:50.539> screw<00:01:51.439> this<00:01:51.590> in

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
really really difficult to screw this in

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.880 
really really difficult to screw this in
the<00:01:53.329> wood<00:01:53.539> is<00:01:53.750> just<00:01:53.989> crazy<00:01:54.530> hard<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:56.890> it

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
the wood is just crazy hard and it

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.919 
the wood is just crazy hard and it
wasn't<00:01:58.340> until<00:01:58.610> I<00:01:58.670> pretty<00:01:59.119> much<00:01:59.209> finished<00:01:59.569> this

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
wasn't until I pretty much finished this

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.699 
wasn't until I pretty much finished this
box<00:02:00.489> that<00:02:01.899> somebody<00:02:02.899> recommended<00:02:03.439> i<00:02:03.560> use

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
box that somebody recommended i use

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.309 
box that somebody recommended i use
clamps<00:02:04.129> so<00:02:04.969> I'd<00:02:05.149> put<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.420> would<00:02:05.689> clamp<00:02:05.959> there

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
clamps so I'd put a would clamp there

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.160 
clamps so I'd put a would clamp there
and<00:02:06.799> then<00:02:07.009> a<00:02:07.039> would<00:02:07.280> clamp<00:02:07.549> here<00:02:08.019> and<00:02:09.019> then

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
and then a would clamp here and then

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.160 
and then a would clamp here and then
screw<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:09.950> that<00:02:10.280> really<00:02:11.170> helped

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
screw it in and that really helped

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.599 
screw it in and that really helped
tremendously<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:15.530> you<00:02:15.650> can<00:02:15.799> see<00:02:16.010> I<00:02:16.040> have<00:02:16.130> I

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:16.609 
tremendously and you can see I have I

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.319 
tremendously and you can see I have I
use<00:02:17.269> two<00:02:17.540> different<00:02:17.569> types<00:02:18.910> screws<00:02:19.910> actually

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
use two different types screws actually

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.089 
use two different types screws actually
these<00:02:20.480> are<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.660> ones<00:02:20.810> i<00:02:20.930> started<00:02:21.410> with<00:02:21.590> they

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
these are the ones i started with they

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.470 
these are the ones i started with they
were<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.670> 5<00:02:23.030> inch<00:02:23.060> lag<00:02:23.540> screw<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:25.430> the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
were a 5 inch lag screw and the

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.539 
were a 5 inch lag screw and the
threading<00:02:26.480> went<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:27.530> threading<00:02:27.889> was<00:02:28.010> about<00:02:28.250> 4

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
threading went the threading was about 4

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.490 
threading went the threading was about 4
inches<00:02:28.579> so<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.239> last<00:02:29.450> inch<00:02:29.750> wasn't<00:02:30.079> threaded

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
inches so the last inch wasn't threaded

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.839 
inches so the last inch wasn't threaded
and<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.919> was<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.160> part<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.430> was<00:02:31.609> really

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
and that was the part that was really

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.990 
and that was the part that was really
hard<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.090> get<00:02:32.299> in<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:34.160> i<00:02:34.459> switched<00:02:34.730> over<00:02:34.970> to

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
hard to get in and i switched over to

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.879 
hard to get in and i switched over to
these<00:02:35.299> and<00:02:35.630> they<00:02:35.930> worked<00:02:36.139> a<00:02:36.260> lot<00:02:36.380> better<00:02:36.440> and

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:36.889 
these and they worked a lot better and

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.159 
these and they worked a lot better and
they<00:02:37.400> were<00:02:37.489> actually<00:02:37.669> six<00:02:38.030> inches<00:02:38.329> long<00:02:38.540> this

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:39.169 
they were actually six inches long this

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:45.280 
they were actually six inches long this
is<00:02:39.319> 7<00:02:39.739> inches<00:02:39.859> total<00:02:41.889> so<00:02:43.389> that<00:02:44.389> was<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.690> the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
and then that's the tree that's going to

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.059 
and then that's the tree that's going to
