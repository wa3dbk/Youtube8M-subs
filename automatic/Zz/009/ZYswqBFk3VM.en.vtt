00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.719
 [Music] 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.870
 but we had a talk with emiliano the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.119
 two personally 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.310
 and surely we agreed on 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.660
 something that I think for all people 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.660
 river is going to be important 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.990
 is with respect to the contract 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.660
 but that is understood I will try to 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.520
 say it the simplest and most 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.560
 as simple as possible so that it 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.160
 understand well and there is no misunderstanding of 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.160
 part of nothing 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.690
 that we were chatting with him 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.360
 and I told him that this is a club where 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.190
 you condemned and I grew up 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.890
 they educated me 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.710
 practically gave me everything up and that 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.760
 know that we are not at 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.920
 economic 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.369
 make it very clear because this contract 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.280
 it had been done on August 29 just the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.369
 My birthday was already 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.650
 agreements made with respect was 29 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.600
 of August 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.940
 was when the agreement was made with either 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.740
 passarella and with shifts after the 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.740
 time because 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.790
 that there are contractual things that 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.080
 they resolve what the lawyers solve the 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.110
 corresponding people 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.290
 and with emiliano we agreed on 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.740
 that we are going to respect the contract 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.570
 of river for 2 years 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.330
 make it very clear that we are going to 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.000
 Respect the contract for two years 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.150
 so I make both the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.790
 my contract like that of emiliano the one of 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.370
 both 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.930
 at the disposal of the pressure of the new 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.530
 president who assumes 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.630
 it seems to me that on the 17th of the 18th of the month 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.729
 it comes from December we put it to 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.830
 available to them to put the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.830
 figure that create convenient 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.920
 for the body text 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.710
 I clarify it perfectly I think it's the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.430
 from emiliano and mine we put it to 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:28.750
 provision for the new president who 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.940
 put the figure exclusively them 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.090
 of what they want us to win in 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.280
 the keyboard what we deserve to win 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.080
 so there is no misunderstanding with 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.380
 none 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.570
 we were chatting with him 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.540
 let people know that we do not 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.719
 we are economically 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.209
 on the contrary this contract was signed 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.670
 signed the agreement on August 29 I return 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.819
 to repeat it 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.000
 on August 29 it was signed and I have to 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.400
 say that 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.280
 I have to say something for my manager that 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.250
 it would come out in Spanish that was very, very 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.940
 able we were chatting with him and he 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.520
 I explained that what I feel and what 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.960
 We feel the two with Emiliano do 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.490
 because we are not so 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.790
 economic we are only for the 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.319
 prestige 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.349
 then that's why it stays 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.530
 absolutely everyone calm the 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.530
 people that target me are others 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.530
 objectives 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.650
 that the team recovers we have committed 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.590
 lots of mistakes and I assume them 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.890
 completely because I'm the one who put together 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.129
 the team is me the one that the decision 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.870
 tactical as we have to play yes that 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:46.959
 we have made many mistakes 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.700
 but if we are going to deal with mainly 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.920
 the last three games that remain 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.120
 give a different picture of what it is 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.209
 this club 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.830
 what is this club what is what is 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.799
 at a football level the players that 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.299
 we have very little because I know it is very 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.340
 little for the people from above because 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.880
 I was excited and had other 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.590
 expectations 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.590
 but so let's try to 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.240
 again to grab the 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.700
 tonic of what this club is 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.650
 and then try to do it as fast 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.440
 possible but they know what 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.190
 the only one responsible is me for everything 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.190
 who passed this exam 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.560
 so be clear and understand 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.090
 that was all very clear what we say is 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.639
 I had the meeting with him 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.840
 and he knows how perfectly my 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.270
 thinking about this club 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.910
 and in no time I'm going to do something that 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:53.620
 can damage so in that sense 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:53.620
