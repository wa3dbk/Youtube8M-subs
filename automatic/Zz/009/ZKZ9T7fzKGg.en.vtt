00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.640
 wills 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.850
 how about friends here sap in a new 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.920
 moore video of the commodity guys and what 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.800
 that you just saw is practically a 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.150
 variant of a direct brutality as well 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.010
 as I said friends today 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.170
 I come to teach you practically this 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.910
 It's a brutal and you I've seen 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.619
 a long time ago friends but the truth 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.750
 I had not brought them because I did not 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.939
 I went out I did not go out I had tried 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.800
 many times and how will they see in the 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.809
 time and here that I know how much against 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.489
 scorpion the truth does not come out because 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.769
 I was practicing for 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.110
 bring them this video did not work out 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.500
 that I did it in another way and in what 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.760
 it consists then this variant of 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.360
 rectal as they could see at the beginning 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.729
 of the gameplay when I did the brutal it and 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.769
 an acid bubble was formed 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.629
 around around the head of the 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.159
 opponent and practically stays 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.530
 floating in the air that is the variant 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.589
 because for those who know this brutality 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.420
 because practically only he only hits the 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.150
 opponent and leaves her face full of 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.950
 acid and then the opponent falls is the 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.299
 variant is that practically now 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.310
 takes off the opponent's head and 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.960
 is floating in a bubble and how is it 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.940
 we do this because friends 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.040
 for those who do not know then to perform 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.140
 this brutality that's called that was what 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.360
 The only thing they have to do is cause 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.940
 30 percent damage to the opponent with the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.909
 attack east where it will repeat practically 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.070
 it has been to the face and the last blow 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.080
 after they have made 30% of 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.060
 damage because only with this attack 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.890
 conacyt white the last blow has to 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.780
 be equal white acid as you can see 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.640
 now in the gameplay as scorpion 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.700
 it is thus practically with the acid in 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.259
 face and he falls exhausted in the sand and 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.140
 practically dies as I say there 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.300
 I was just training but it did not work out 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.580
 then now here with the gameplay of 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.009
 Jason, if it came out then, how do we do it? 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.490
 practically the variant where he is 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.899
 there is an acid bubble that 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.580
 removes the opponent's head and stays 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.929
 floating then for this variant is 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.640
 pretty easy friends the only thing 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.560
 have to do it 's the same 30 for 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.149
 100 damage to the opponent 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.700
 after that the last blow has to 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.370
 be guasch like this and when they have already 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.319
 practically unchained 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.470
 when they have the last attack friends 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.379
 they have to pass the arrow up and 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.659
 practically the acid will be transformed 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.099
 in a bubble and it will take away his head the 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.620
 opponent that's how the variant is made 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.019
 friends to me I did not leave because in 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.659
 the truth I do not know but what I did friends 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.909
 it was at the time of launching the last attack 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:37.579
 I started dating fast enough times 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.409
 in the arrow up and it came out 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.409
 so what I advise friends is 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.420
 that they do 30% damage with the acid 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.220
 and the last one when they do the last 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.200
 attack that is also like that 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.290
 walsh and start to pass quickly 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.239
 up the arrow up and they 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.739
 I assure you will leave then friends 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.569
 I hope you liked this video 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.519

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.590

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.510
