look<00:00:18.430> at<00:00:18.550> this<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:20.619> vacuum<00:00:21.480> barely<00:00:22.480> has

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
look at this this vacuum barely has

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.390 
look at this this vacuum barely has
anything<00:00:23.140> on<00:00:23.410> there<00:00:23.590> like<00:00:23.740> if<00:00:23.890> you<00:00:24.010> compare

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
anything on there like if you compare

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.400 
anything on there like if you compare
that<00:00:24.430> to<00:00:24.580> the<00:00:24.730> Kirby<00:00:25.180> this<00:00:25.779> is<00:00:25.960> like<00:00:26.140> nothing

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
that to the Kirby this is like nothing

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.279 
that to the Kirby this is like nothing
and<00:00:26.800> I<00:00:27.160> think<00:00:27.430> it's<00:00:27.550> because<00:00:27.910> it<00:00:28.689> has<00:00:28.869> such

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
and I think it's because it has such

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.529 
and I think it's because it has such
amazing<00:00:29.560> suction<00:00:30.460> it<00:00:30.609> just<00:00:30.789> pulls<00:00:31.119> everything

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
amazing suction it just pulls everything

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.479 
amazing suction it just pulls everything
in<00:00:31.869> and<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:34.260> kind<00:00:35.260> of<00:00:35.469> moves<00:00:35.980> like<00:00:36.130> this<00:00:36.430> a

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
in and it kind of moves like this a

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.119 
in and it kind of moves like this a
little<00:00:36.760> you<00:00:37.180> see<00:00:37.450> so<00:00:38.140> as<00:00:38.260> it<00:00:38.469> does<00:00:38.680> that<00:00:38.710> it

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
little you see so as it does that it

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.510 
little you see so as it does that it
loosens<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:40.300> hair<00:00:40.570> off<00:00:41.050> of<00:00:41.440> this<00:00:41.649> and<00:00:42.010> sucks

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
loosens the hair off of this and sucks

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.479 
loosens the hair off of this and sucks
most<00:00:42.820> of<00:00:42.969> that<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:44.500> I<00:00:44.590> love<00:00:44.890> how<00:00:45.070> it<00:00:45.129> has<00:00:45.190> that

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
most of that and I love how it has that

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.139 
most of that and I love how it has that
suction<00:00:45.969> channel<00:00:46.510> for<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.870> sides<00:00:47.140> there<00:00:47.440> too
