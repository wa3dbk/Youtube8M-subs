 We are still with Samsung because Samsung has one percent of meadows 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.360
 trying to get word for other products they delivered and earned 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.460

 Kids battery from extremely flat height extremely chic is the and 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.190
 absolute performance so in this class with this slogan really 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.760
 unique 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.020
 One sees the three devices was built up by a particularly at 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.359
 through his lawyer all summer long 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.019
 its athletic size is so clearly a 13 places five as you said 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.869
 The difference between him and the painter is that he should be very much at the age of 15 

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:52.399
 have a numbers PET and of course in the configuration something else 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.760
 Going higher can be done according to the CDU 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.920
 in the previously published so far mostly that he was very much 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.690
 narrow it is the last to make sure in the summer that she does not visit one 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.760
 others can build water as little as with televisions 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.370
 almost ladies going on is yes that's a one-time thing the more and more move-in 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.120
 takes place in Sam whole line so you can find Sabine others see the clear 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.620
 are positioned underneath 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.740
 here we speak of our plasmons old we are capable in one year 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.960
 14 She should give a 14-inch display to Schafii men 13 2 times 3 inches 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.410
 which is really unique 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.660
 but as the resolution is also Koormann you have more space too 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.770
 best then always to work properly, namely Jan MÃ¤nnig only one 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.730
 bright display in a big display through this edge of the stage but we have 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.530
 also an extremely fast is more and above all a display which also in hd + 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.810
 Resolution is available so there is configuration where really hd + possible 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.450
 is as a resolution 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.780
 who bets on it four notebook manufacturers go more and more 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.800
 about or almost have to be just about it - the displays 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.070
 have these three notebooks coming complete matte display why have 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.960
 you chose because we said the customer should not me myself 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.380
 see so long the thing on the notebook should happen and just like that 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.270
 Product with less than two kilos which I assume that one really looked 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.379
 would like to take 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.259
 Yes that's right 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.979
 hardware-side is probably the newest dual-core Intel 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:17.339
 Authorities are not going to make big shots the Intel processors of 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:19.089
 3 series then in the further the 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.999
 Graphic page I can also play socks with them once in a while 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.199
 Now Porsche does not always have to be in the army seven 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:30.409
 percent series here we put with a gigabyte v at 1 the 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.119
 Switche also wants to talk to the paste for the Landshuter behavior and me 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.119
 think so that one or the other games quite in it 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:41.539
 Hiking in the market in August and how the award winners are snow-white 

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:45.359
 Of course you can acquire specially configured versions 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.719
 but where does it start and where does the price go on? 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:52.179
 So we're talking about per color is very clear then start at 11 9 9 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.619
 and can really go up to 13 49 in the different 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:59.469
 Equipment options available that is not from the beginning of mid-October 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:04.979
 Everything has millions at the one and he himself "If we knifes again 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.479
 Percent has time to come to Berlin to you the devices you look at 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.980
 but also various other products exhibited here at their booth 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.430
 some bands probably open to Germany that is the man 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.710
 dismissed international fair is 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.230
 but if you're on equipment is not home at all and create 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.750
 Of course you will find everything else on our website on Earth
