rest of the series so I never have to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.029 
rest of the series so I never have to
use<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.690> again<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.530> very<00:00:49.770> annoying

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039

silencer on here makes the recoil

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.870 
silencer on here makes the recoil
decreased<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.890> feeling<00:01:38.100> so

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.010 
decreased I I just have a feeling so
I've<00:01:38.939> used<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.329> gun<00:01:39.390> before<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:39.960> a

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
I've used this gun before with a

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.050 
I've used this gun before with a
silencer<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.500> I've<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.740> done<00:01:41.340> amazing<00:01:41.549> with

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
silencer and I've just done amazing with

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.940 
silencer and I've just done amazing with
it<00:01:42.210> now<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.840> don't<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.350> silencer<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
it now I don't have a silencer but I

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.530 
it now I don't have a silencer but I
have<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> grip<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.880> seems<00:01:45.119> like<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.390> has<00:01:45.509> a

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
have a grip and it seems like it has a

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.899 
have a grip and it seems like it has a
lot<00:01:45.930> more<00:01:45.960> recoil<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.829> that's<00:01:47.579> something<00:01:47.759> that

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
lot more recoil so that's something that

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.710 
lot more recoil so that's something that
I<00:01:48.000> might<00:01:48.299> check<00:01:48.570> out<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.990> future<00:01:49.350> oh<00:01:50.720> gosh

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
I might check out in the future oh gosh

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.109 
I might check out in the future oh gosh

off<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.310> war<00:04:09.550> machine<00:04:09.850> don't<00:04:10.570> have<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:10.750> worry

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
off the war machine don't have to worry

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.740 
off the war machine don't have to worry
about<00:04:11.020> getting<00:04:11.230> that<00:04:11.940> on<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:13.000> 10<00:04:13.270> kill<00:04:13.480> streak

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
about getting that on a 10 kill streak

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.840 
about getting that on a 10 kill streak
or<00:04:13.930> gum<00:04:14.110> streak<00:04:14.380> our<00:04:14.770> kill<00:04:15.040> streak<00:04:15.280> I<00:04:15.490> guess

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
or gum streak our kill streak I guess

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.720 
or gum streak our kill streak I guess
doesn't<00:04:16.480> really<00:04:16.540> matter

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
doesn't really matter

well<00:04:18.510> does<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.050> war<00:04:19.230> machine<00:04:19.470> count<00:04:19.710> towards

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
well does the war machine count towards

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.920 
well does the war machine count towards
the<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.700> merciless<00:04:21.120> medal<00:04:21.420> I<00:04:21.480> don't<00:04:21.690> think<00:04:21.870> he

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
the the merciless medal I don't think he
