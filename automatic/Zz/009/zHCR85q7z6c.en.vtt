00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
actually made a video right in half of

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.490 
actually made a video right in half of
my<00:01:04.650> hair<00:01:05.119> with<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> grain<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:07.110> other<00:01:07.260> girl

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
my hair with the grain the other girl

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.830 
my hair with the grain the other girl
other<00:01:07.710> against<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.520> grain<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.420> there<00:01:09.720> was

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
other against the grain and there was

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.170 
other against the grain and there was
very<00:01:10.290> little<00:01:10.500> difference<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.970> could

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
very little difference on so you could

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.240 
very little difference on so you could
not<00:01:12.360> tell<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.110> difference<00:01:13.140> much<00:01:13.650> with

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
not tell the difference much with

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.920 
not tell the difference much with
against<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.760> grain<00:01:14.970> when<00:01:15.540> you're<00:01:15.659> cutting

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
against the grain when you're cutting

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.950 
against the grain when you're cutting
your<00:01:15.990> hair<00:01:16.610> if<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.759> waves<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.450> going<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
your hair if you have waves is going to

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.190 
your hair if you have waves is going to
evenly<00:01:19.770> cut<00:01:20.280> your<00:01:20.490> whole<00:01:20.670> head<00:01:20.909> now<00:01:21.689> with<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
evenly cut your whole head now with the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.050 
evenly cut your whole head now with the
grain<00:01:23.570> sometimes<00:01:24.570> it'll<00:01:25.130> jump<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
grain sometimes it'll jump the the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.670 
grain sometimes it'll jump the the
grooves<00:01:27.780> if<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.080> know<00:01:28.200> how<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.350> talk<00:01:28.530> about

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
grooves if you know how to talk about

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.819 
grooves if you know how to talk about
and<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.790> not<00:01:29.850> gonna<00:01:30.000> be<00:01:30.180> completely<00:01:30.689> even<00:01:31.259> so

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
and it's not gonna be completely even so

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.170 
and it's not gonna be completely even so
that<00:01:31.950> was<00:01:32.070> really<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> only<00:01:32.610> difference<00:01:32.880> I've

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
that was really the only difference I've

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.690 
that was really the only difference I've
noticed<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:33.840> at<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.979> end<00:01:35.130> when<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.340> was<00:01:35.490> done

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
noticed but at the end when I was done

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.390 
noticed but at the end when I was done
both<00:01:36.450> sides<00:01:36.479> still<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.170> waves<00:01:37.439> what

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
both sides still have waves what

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.520 
both sides still have waves what
destroys<00:01:38.939> your<00:01:39.150> waves<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.780> destroys<00:01:40.290> your

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
destroys your waves and destroys your

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.789 
destroys your waves and destroys your
process<00:01:41.130> your<00:01:41.490> progress<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.439> kinda<00:01:43.439> too<00:01:43.619> low

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
process your progress is kinda too low

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.920 
process your progress is kinda too low
and<00:01:44.100> usually<00:01:45.000> that's<00:01:45.119> what<00:01:45.240> happens<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:45.659> it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
and usually that's what happens with it

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.590 
and usually that's what happens with it
against<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.380> grain<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.979> AGG<00:01:47.490> cut<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
against the grain the AGG cut is the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.950 
against the grain the AGG cut is the
farmers<00:01:49.049> or<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.229> people<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.720> know<00:01:51.720> they're

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
farmers or the people you know they're

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.999 
farmers or the people you know they're
cutting<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.310> guard<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.600> grain

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
cutting with a a to guard with the grain

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.700 
cutting with a a to guard with the grain
then<00:01:56.009> they<00:01:56.219> use<00:01:56.520> maybe<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.939> three<00:01:57.420> with<00:01:58.020> against

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
then they use maybe a three with against

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.370 
then they use maybe a three with against
the<00:01:58.740> grain<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.909> that's<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.270> too<00:02:00.450> low<00:02:00.630> and

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
the grain and that's just too low and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.609 
the grain and that's just too low and
that's<00:02:01.649> what<00:02:01.890> mrs.<00:02:02.159> your<00:02:02.369> progress<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.619> mean

off
if<00:02:07.119> you<00:02:07.180> wanted<00:02:07.509> to<00:02:07.739> think<00:02:08.739> about<00:02:08.860> brick<00:02:09.190> dance

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
if you wanted to think about brick dance

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.160 
if you wanted to think about brick dance
I<00:02:09.610> see<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.759> video<00:02:10.060> right<00:02:10.209> he<00:02:10.390> did<00:02:10.569> it<00:02:10.690> where<00:02:11.050> they

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
I see a video right he did it where they

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.900 
I see a video right he did it where they
said<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:11.530> his<00:02:11.650> ways<00:02:11.890> were<00:02:11.920> fake<00:02:12.430> or<00:02:12.640> whatever

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
said that his ways were fake or whatever

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.089 
said that his ways were fake or whatever
so<00:02:13.690> he<00:02:13.750> comb<00:02:13.989> his<00:02:14.140> whole<00:02:14.349> hair<00:02:14.560> out<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:14.890> then

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
so he comb his whole hair out and then
