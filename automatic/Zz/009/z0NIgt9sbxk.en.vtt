00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello you love today there is a new one 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.460
 video of me and that around the topic 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.779
 fingernails 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.250
 maybe you already did that 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.860
 my fingers are some pretty long 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.690
 for being my natural and there 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.519
 I also asked privately quite often 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.540
 I'll do what I do so long 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.430
 Above all, they will not 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.869
 cancel I thought I'll do 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.939
 give you a video about it with mine 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.410
 Experiences and tips I have now 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.350
 just collected for you and 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.849
 I want to tell you now and it is 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.449
 That's why I want ten pieces in the number 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.250
 We start saying and I would like them 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.780
 a bit taken from me 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.180
 straight from school but I have it 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.739
 have previously video tutorial so have 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.680
 I thought we might not be 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.300
 so bad and I can do it anyway 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.200
 do 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.149
 my first tip is one 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.120
 product recommendation and that is what I am talking about 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.039
 from the ultra strong ale hadeler of p 2 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.430
 maybe you can one or the other 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.030
 beautiful 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.160
 that is a blemish harder you are 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.840
 once a week on the nails and that 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.550
 whole repeats her for three weeks 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.559
 made her a full break for one week 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.210
 and with me he has really unbelievable 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.650
 Well, I also have some 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.920
 girlfriends I am already recommended 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.600
 that was real german me right now 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.920
 I think so 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.510
 and he has definitely also 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.790
 Well, maybe it works too 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.580
 what you find that you find normal 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.049
 Im living at P2 in this nail shelf 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.540
 So that's what they are separately 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.130
 shelf and more may be very much any case 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.390
 Well helped and my nails are much 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.729
 become harder by doing so 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.259
 Tip number 2 includes one 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.570
 personal experience of me 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.720
 and I have determined for myself 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.700
 when the nail is painted he is 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.439
 not so fast on tangible is therefore 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.630
 that's easy for example if he is now 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.820
 otherwise it would come later somewhere against 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.409
 that this is a little bit later 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.180
 you then first of the nail polish off before 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.909
 the name itself is attacked and 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.450
 it has always been with me so it always is 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.430
 so I almost never have and 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.229
 painted nails but just when I have time 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.360
 is at home or make nail polish break 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.950
 somehow over the weekend and then do 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.850
 I quickly feel that experience 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.590
 nails are then much more vulnerable 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.270
 Nevertheless, most of you know 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.580
 certainly that nail polish is not that good 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.350
 is for the nail itself and that's why 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.720
 Let's get right to tip number 3 and 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.250
 Although underlay used that subject 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.140
 just protect against discoloration there 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.100
 just intense colors the nails yes 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.790
 attack very strong 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.040
 I'm sorry and yes where are 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.810
 remained then yes that intense 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.610
 colors attack your nails very strongly 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.170
 There are very, very different subject 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.720
 also with different care effect 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.950
 and it just makes yours 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.819
 nail health not so 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.040
 is attacked 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.050
 Tip number four is a little one 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.569
 can change subtleties much you 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.910
 you should be out of health anyway 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.019
 Just start the cuticle regularly 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.940
 push back, of course, now 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.560
 not with the hands or so but with 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.500
 You will find a rosewood stick 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.069
 also everywhere in the drugstore and also 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.620
 elsewhere 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.870
 and then you can just nail your nail 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.209
 a bit further paint what thus 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.799
 an optical extension causes and 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.090
 Of course, they also last longer 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.440
 look and that is our goal 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.120
 Tip 5 I have not yet myself 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.860
 I would like to say that 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.840
 but I have a lot of good things for example 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.920
 I read about that and most of all I have 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.600
 girlfriends in my personal 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.820
 circle around it with very good experiences 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.519
 have made and that I'm talking about 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.560
 For example, biotin biotin gets into 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.680
 tablet form even the drugstore 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.600
 and so on and that their club a 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.970
 Better skin care and also for 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.430
 They like to hair and among other things 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.140
 for a better nail growth 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.810
 because the black are just faster 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.400
 grow and also thicker and as I said 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.959
 My friends have a great time 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.090
 experience and I wanted to 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.480
 in any case, as an alternative 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.100
 call 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.570
 be at number six 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.739
 probably some shake your head 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.840
 because they can not hear it anymore and 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.549
 Although I speak briefly about healthy 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.320
 nutrition nevertheless helps with one 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.760
 healthy nail growth like 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.160
 probably something else 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.109
 healthy food is therefore important 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.549
 can really change a lot so what 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.299
 the skin image concerns everything 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.829
 body 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.490
 but that's another extra 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:05.520
 video theme holds in any case 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.560
 especially mushrooms nuts, fish and fruit 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.170
 vegetables but also dairy for one 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.920
 healthy nail growth and that will be yes 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.410
 say again 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.450
 Tip number eight is that you have your nails 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.130
 only cuts when they are soft and 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.130
 Your nails only file when dry 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.140
 are everything else expensive mega on 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.350
 or split them into different ones 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.220
 layers and that is absolutely 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.170
 ineffective if you grow it long 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.030
 So let's always be careful 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.400
 that your nails are dry if you 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.460
 they wanted to fall soft when you hit them 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.110
 wanted to cut tip number 9 of that 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.820
 I get you a good darts 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.030
 for example, have such a four phases 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.490
 Arrows with one side to clean 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.710
 is a page no a page to 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.230
 cut one hand is to clean one 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.760
 side for smoothing with a to polish 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.380
 you have to have exactly these but 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.240
 fall these are definitely so 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.890
 fall this kind are definitely 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.850
 in my opinion highly recommended me 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.650
 I'll be a new one now 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.350
 Do not buy yourself nice 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.900
 but glass fans are for example 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.700
 Also highly recommended only there it is 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.890
 Type depends on whether we like it with glass 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.450
 wine or not 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.370
 and a good celebration is needed 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.910
 definitely to take care of every good situation 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:18.740
 A t-shirt totally shines on me 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.740
 at the bottom of what is rather unfavorable 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.160
 Tip number 10 is actually a whole 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.920
 very simple thing that is often forgotten 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.990
 The negro simply need it 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.850
 break from a so break of 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.150
 nail polish and care products 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.040
 because there are basically only nails 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.400
 and they just have to 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.290
 can recover from everything and that belongs 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.300
 definitely a healthy nail 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.400
 growth and that's what I wanted you to do 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.110
 say again that 's it 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.910
 from this video I hope you find 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.080
 the tips helpful and if somehow 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.670
 what with you you you something notch 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.960
 I would try so much 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.030
 happy if somehow know me 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.640
 that via instagram for example 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.280
 could me simply because or link 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.760
 or invest or you write me 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.490
 just in the comments I would

 very happy and thank you 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.020

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.640

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.640
 would say until next time bye
