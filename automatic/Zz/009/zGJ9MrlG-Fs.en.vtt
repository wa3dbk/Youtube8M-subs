another<00:03:07.069> problem<00:03:08.620> this<00:03:09.620> pipe<00:03:09.920> right<00:03:10.190> here

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.610 

right<00:03:16.790> under<00:03:17.030> those<00:03:17.180> threads<00:03:17.599> pieces<00:03:18.500> are

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
right under those threads pieces are

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.129 
right under those threads pieces are
breaking<00:03:19.040> off<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:22.660> whenever<00:03:23.660> this<00:03:23.959> is

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
breaking off so whenever this is

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:25.690 
breaking off so whenever this is
unscrewed<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:24.709> always<00:03:24.919> get<00:03:25.069> chunks<00:03:25.340> of<00:03:25.549> metal

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700
