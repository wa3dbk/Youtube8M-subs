00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello welcome to this short number 2 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.929
 we had in the first course 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.230
 photo the three setting parameters of 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.260
 the exposure that was the setting of 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.840
 the opening of the diaphragm the time 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.670
 of exposure and the setting of the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.730
 sensor sensitivity 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.730
 today we remained interested in a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.140
 a little closer to the diatribes that 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.449
 it has three functions 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.669
 so the first one as we already saw 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.469
 it is to let more or less 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.930
 light in the camera for small 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.780
 reminder here between different 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.850
 hide diaphragm versions one has one 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.789
 ivy a notice of enlightenment 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.829
 that is to say that we let two 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.930
 times less light every time 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.670
 that we close our city fragments or 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.309
 twice as healthy in the sense 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.809
 inverse the gat reim also has a function 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.949
 it's the limitation of aberrations 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.640
 lens optics on pretty much 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.320
 all goals the best made the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.880
 best dive will be when to die and 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.259
 your fine mouth between 28 and France 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.960
 that is six settings and the goal 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.320
 of the diaphragm itself very important 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.610
 to arrive their entry schmitt f11 seval 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.689
 you will have the best return and then 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.090
 third point is the setting of the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.829
 depth of field 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.100
 the depth of field is the area of 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.350
 dunes had acceptable time act that 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.119
 we will find around the area of ​​bet 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.970
 on point 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.280
 which will allow us to have a before 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.210
 plan that can be blurred a 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.840
 background that will also be crazy 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.960
 food background or in Cairo so we 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.300
 can see on this picture for example where 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:05.690
 I did the street focus I 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:09.250
 put a small red rectangle 1 the draw 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.959
 of grape him he is perfectly net 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.880
 but none of my grapes that is found 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.370
 on a focal plane a little closer 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.350
 kg are blurry and all that is 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.010
 behind rossi and fluster families 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.400
 the farthest is more crazy 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.130
 the interest is that kraft slab 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.280
 softwood crisis may be good of 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.840
 background image it's really beautiful in 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.130
 value all the bunch of grapes 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.690
 besides, it's really showcasing 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.840
 everything on the same plane 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.519
 focal at hand at the same level as this 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.850
 grape seed this final ie the 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.980
 victim by ci north of chage who is 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.670
 is also because they are on the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.769
 same social plan now if I pass 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.170
 my design at f 16 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.660
 I am going to enlarge my depth of field 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.630
 and my truth zone will be much more 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.060
 important so regularly the picture has 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.590
 life size we notice that everything 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.620
 bind I did the focus at the same 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.860
 place all the grape hands and 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.860
 net 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.269
 the background becomes more puts the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.320
 leaves are sharper is what is 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.390
 a little further even if it's still 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.680
 blur is still a little more 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:26.209
 net on this source so here after 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.959
 if we lose that if we close the ivies 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.549
 progressively he will accept 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.750
 realizes that the depth of field 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:37.880
 is more and more demand I made 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.730
 the photo in priority the diaphragm 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.709
 so we default camera 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.280
 to have exactly the same exposure to 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.140
 correct the shutter speed at 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.819
 whenever I'm doing at sea a 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.760
 extra turn tomorrow 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.129
 the united ummah was one of the 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.319
 springs on speed this year 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.499
 increase the speed of 2 in order to 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.730
 let twice the light 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:04.549
 what makes each of these 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.099
 pictures I have exactly the position 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.019
 so now let's assume that I 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.090
 have made it to me at a distance 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.299
 1 net to take self my grain 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.299
 of grapes 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.919
 so everything that will be on my 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.780
 focal plane that are worth and here at the level 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.090
 of the vertical line that's my point 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.039
 focal all that will be here as if 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:31.009
 it was a wall all this part will be 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:33.830
 net after according to the opening of 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:38.870
 world fra n 1 I increased or reduced 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.400
 at the depth of field so the 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.229
 depth of field no matter what its 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.560
 setting we will have on a third before 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.220
 my focal plane of focus two 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.810
 third 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.080
 after my focal plane of focus 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.320
 which will be the area of acceptable sharpness 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:01.970
 always one-third and two-thirds after a 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.349
 shot before tiab now also a 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.930
 small mistake not to penetrate often 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:08.270
 we are going to make the photo we will make a 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.000
 focus on a subject and then 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.770
 passed the framing before triggering 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.930
 their photos 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:20.389
 if I rotate keeping me the same 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.460
 focus distance i'm shifting 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.849
 simon focal plane because my plan 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.220
 focal 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.259
 it's made for nothing at all 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.240
 what will be so in the setting 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:30.800
 to the point but it's up to all that goes 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.680
 find the very goal that will be 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.590
 with my teacher no him he is right there 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.659
 is like the line we see here 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.719
 for me here ie if I 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:45.050
 rotates and well while keeping a bet 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:48.979
 at the point at which game the focal plane 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.690
 and we notice here he loves you my little 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:54.920
 grape seed but eventually they get 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:57.470
 find in front and 6 world fries 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.850
 very wide open eh well he'll get 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.230
 find in an area of ​​blur it will be 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.990
 so for having net 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.870
 it would have been necessary to correct 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:10.120
 the focus area at the level of the 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:12.800
 mine that we see here in dots 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.600
 that's it then now you're going to me 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.530
 say when I come back in the camera 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:21.020
 photo we do not see the depth of field 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.350
 some cameras if you can 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.150
 drink it 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.180
 what you need to know is they who have 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.770
 looked inside your device 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.720
 photo the diaphragm and the big ones 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.360
 open they do not close as moment that 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.140
 you take your back often next to 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.540
 goals 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.940
 you have a little button in front 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:42.770
 the camera on some reflexes 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.840
 all this which allows to have an overview of 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.100
 depth of field 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.470
 it's then you tap it on 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.520
 biafra he will necessarily allow that the 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.950
 diaphragm closes 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.020
 we would have an image that will be more 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.230
 dark but that will allow you to have 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.640
 an overview of this depth of field 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.440
 and to be able to go 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.780
 the sharpness area a condition 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.490
 opening the diaphragm here thank you 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.430
 I hope that this course will have been 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:10.010
 useful if you have questions 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.330
 do not hesitate to ask us and I will 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.840
 found in the next course present 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.840
 thank you
