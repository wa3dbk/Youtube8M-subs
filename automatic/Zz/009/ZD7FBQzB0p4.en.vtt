this<00:01:33.619> one<00:01:33.800> guy<00:01:33.979> was<00:01:34.160> saying<00:01:34.400> a<00:01:34.580> nut<00:01:34.729> I<00:01:34.880> do

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
this one guy was saying a nut I do

this one guy was saying a nut I do
understand<00:01:35.479> where<00:01:35.630> it's<00:01:35.750> coming<00:01:35.780> from<00:01:36.229> that

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
understand where it's coming from that

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.300 
understand where it's coming from that

several hundred or thousand liters of it
at<00:01:42.500> that<00:01:42.530> pressure<00:01:43.009> would<00:01:44.000> be<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:44.150> very

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
at that pressure would be a very

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.969 
at that pressure would be a very
destructive<00:01:44.780> weapon<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.500> easily<00:01:45.770> cut

Tata<00:01:52.850> is<00:01:52.910> a<00:01:53.000> little<00:01:53.420> bit<00:01:53.540> different<00:01:54.399> but<00:01:55.399> at

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
Tata is a little bit different but at

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.830 
Tata is a little bit different but at
the<00:01:55.789> end<00:01:55.940> of<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.090> day<00:01:56.240> they're<00:01:56.479> not<00:01:56.600> good<00:01:56.810> for

the end of the day they're not good for

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.790 
the end of the day they're not good for
much<00:01:57.110> more<00:01:57.410> than<00:01:57.590> 150<00:01:58.369> psi<00:01:58.850> tops<00:01:59.420> I<00:01:59.780> mean<00:02:00.679> I'm

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
much more than 150 psi tops I mean I'm

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.400 
much more than 150 psi tops I mean I'm

talking burst pressure safe running
pressures<00:02:03.830> about<00:02:04.039> 44<00:02:04.700> 45<00:02:05.860> cold<00:02:07.210> you<00:02:08.210> wouldn't

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
pressures about 44 45 cold you wouldn't

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.320 
pressures about 44 45 cold you wouldn't
want<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.539> go<00:02:08.660> much<00:02:08.840> more<00:02:09.050> than<00:02:09.110> that

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.540 

trucks<00:02:11.990> truck<00:02:12.440> tires<00:02:12.710> are<00:02:12.980> another<00:02:13.190> thing

they're<00:02:13.910> about<00:02:14.150> 100<00:02:14.840> psi<00:02:15.050> running<00:02:15.830> pressure

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
they're about 100 psi running pressure

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.230 
they're about 100 psi running pressure
probably<00:02:16.880> 200<00:02:17.770> maximum<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:19.100> a<00:02:20.000> burst

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
probably 200 maximum and a burst

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.040 
probably 200 maximum and a burst
pressure<00:02:20.569> of<00:02:20.900> many<00:02:21.170> many<00:02:21.440> more<00:02:22.150> so<00:02:23.150> yeah<00:02:23.720> that

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
pressure of many many more so yeah that

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.530 
pressure of many many more so yeah that
worked<00:02:24.230> quite<00:02:24.440> well<00:02:24.910> okay<00:02:25.910> next<00:02:26.180> up<00:02:26.390> we've<00:02:26.510> got

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
worked quite well okay next up we've got

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.920 
worked quite well okay next up we've got
an<00:02:26.690> apple<00:02:26.930> juice<00:02:27.080> bottle<00:02:28.540> let's<00:02:29.540> see<00:02:29.720> if<00:02:29.810> the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
an apple juice bottle let's see if the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:54.559 
an apple juice bottle let's see if the
juice<00:02:30.140> gets<00:02:30.410> loose

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.039 

damn<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.470> shine<00:02:55.650> inside<00:02:56.900> it's<00:02:57.900> not

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
damn and shine inside it's not

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:09.220 
damn and shine inside it's not
rectangular<00:02:58.500> anymore

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:21.610 

you're<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.290> little<00:03:10.500> bit<00:03:10.620> wet<00:03:10.769> there

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:45.580 

these<00:03:22.220> n11<00:03:23.209> surge<00:03:23.540> at<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.870> time<00:03:44.110> okay<00:03:45.110> last<00:03:45.410> one

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
these n11 surge at a time okay last one

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.900 
these n11 surge at a time okay last one
for<00:03:45.830> today

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
for today

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.309 
for today

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
coke bottle out of the cardboard box

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.520 
coke bottle out of the cardboard box
there's<00:03:51.319> also<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:52.900> laminated<00:03:53.900> windscreen<00:03:54.170> in

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
there's also a laminated windscreen in

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.100 
there's also a laminated windscreen in
front<00:03:54.739> of<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:54.860> camera<00:03:55.160> this<00:03:55.280> time<00:03:56.110> low-flying

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
front of the camera this time low-flying

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:55.480 
front of the camera this time low-flying
waters<00:03:57.530> gonna<00:03:57.650> hit<00:03:57.799> me<00:03:57.920> expensive<00:03:58.430> camera

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.710 

I<00:04:56.140> think<00:04:57.140> it's<00:04:57.260> dead<00:04:57.470> man<00:04:58.360> that<00:04:59.360> was<00:04:59.510> pretty

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
I think it's dead man that was pretty

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:10.089 
I think it's dead man that was pretty
awesome

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.499 

funny<00:05:11.099> thing<00:05:11.279> is<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.520> label<00:05:12.180> on<00:05:12.300> either

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
funny thing is the label on either

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.070 
funny thing is the label on either
bottle<00:05:12.930> broke<00:05:13.759> light<00:05:14.759> will<00:05:14.939> still<00:05:15.210> intact<00:05:15.840> and

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
bottle broke light will still intact and

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.980 
bottle broke light will still intact and
glue<00:05:16.969> it's<00:05:17.969> a<00:05:18.060> bit<00:05:18.180> stretch<00:05:18.539> but<00:05:18.810> it<00:05:18.870> hasn't

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
glue it's a bit stretch but it hasn't

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.839 
glue it's a bit stretch but it hasn't
split<00:05:20.240> even<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.330> lid<00:05:21.479> win<00:05:21.659> at<00:05:21.779> the<00:05:21.840> same<00:05:22.050> time

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.300 

wow<00:05:26.849> that's<00:05:27.060> cool
