00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
more reason to believe in him as the

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.980 
more reason to believe in him as the
fall<00:04:30.710> progressed<00:04:31.220> and<00:04:31.490> then<00:04:31.669> where<00:04:32.630> we<00:04:32.750> saw

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
when we let him off to get on base four

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.360 
when we let him off to get on base four
times<00:04:36.500> and<00:04:37.190> from<00:04:37.850> that<00:04:37.970> point<00:04:38.030> on<00:04:38.479> he's<00:04:39.370> been

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.920 
times and from that point on he's been
pretty<00:04:40.580> good<00:04:40.700> about<00:04:40.850> doing<00:04:41.240> that<00:04:41.510> it's<00:04:41.780> been

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
pretty good about doing that it's been

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.740 
pretty good about doing that it's been
very<00:04:42.080> consistent<00:04:42.500> in<00:04:42.830> his<00:04:42.949> workouts<00:04:43.460> and<00:04:43.820> just

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
very consistent in his workouts and just

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.120

to watch him come out here and get on

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.760 
to watch him come out here and get on
base<00:04:46.340> against<00:04:46.760> our<00:04:46.880> pitching<00:04:47.180> and<00:04:47.570> can<00:04:48.560> be<00:04:48.740> a

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
base against our pitching and can be a

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.370 
base against our pitching and can be a
catalyst<00:04:49.729> and<00:04:50.030> be<00:04:50.389> a<00:04:50.419> thorn<00:04:50.780> in<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.080> picture

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380

I think you've always best I can tell
given<00:05:40.209> your<00:05:40.299> catcher's<00:05:40.719> kind<00:05:40.959> of<00:05:41.019> free<00:05:41.169> reign

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:41.379 
given your catcher's kind of free reign

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:43.319 
given your catcher's kind of free reign
to<00:05:41.409> throw<00:05:41.679> behind<00:05:41.829> runners<00:05:42.339> and<00:05:42.549> get<00:05:43.209> after

to throw behind runners and get after

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:44.850 
to throw behind runners and get after
him<00:05:43.479> on<00:05:43.569> the<00:05:43.629> basis<00:05:43.929> how<00:05:44.019> big<00:05:44.199> was<00:05:44.349> Kurt's<00:05:44.619> play

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
him on the basis how big was Kurt's play

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:46.989 
there to get the out momentum changing

00:05:46.989 --> 00:05:48.269 
there to get the out momentum changing
it's<00:05:47.079> like<00:05:47.169> blocking<00:05:47.439> a<00:05:47.589> punt<00:05:47.799> and<00:05:47.889> football

00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:51.939 
bases were loaded we're kind of reeling

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:53.459 
bases were loaded we're kind of reeling
a<00:05:52.029> little<00:05:52.059> bit<00:05:52.449> because<00:05:52.659> we<00:05:52.959> couldn't<00:05:53.169> get<00:05:53.319> an

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:53.469 
a little bit because we couldn't get an

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:55.739 
a little bit because we couldn't get an
out<00:05:53.619> we<00:05:54.099> got<00:05:54.249> a<00:05:54.279> big<00:05:54.519> strikeout<00:05:54.999> from<00:05:55.179> well<00:05:55.449> but

00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:55.749 
out we got a big strikeout from well but

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:57.809 
out we got a big strikeout from well but
then<00:05:56.289> the<00:05:56.469> throw<00:05:56.679> behind<00:05:56.829> kind<00:05:57.519> of<00:05:57.610> killed

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:57.819 
then the throw behind kind of killed

00:05:57.819 --> 00:05:58.949 
then the throw behind kind of killed
that<00:05:57.969> inning<00:05:58.269> because<00:05:58.360> it<00:05:58.539> put<00:05:58.689> a<00:05:58.719> lot<00:05:58.929> of

00:05:58.949 --> 00:05:58.959 
that inning because it put a lot of

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:00.479 
that inning because it put a lot of
pressure<00:05:59.289> on<00:05:59.409> the<00:05:59.709> hit<00:05:59.829> over<00:06:00.039> the<00:06:00.159> base<00:06:00.309> was

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:00.489 
pressure on the hit over the base was

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:02.819 
pressure on the hit over the base was
loaded<00:06:00.759> and<00:06:00.969> two<00:06:01.089> strikes<00:06:01.419> and<00:06:01.659> that<00:06:02.319> was<00:06:02.529> that

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:02.829 
loaded and two strikes and that was that

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:04.289 
loaded and two strikes and that was that
was<00:06:02.949> the<00:06:03.009> difference<00:06:03.249> in<00:06:03.549> that<00:06:03.699> particular<00:06:03.969> in

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:04.299 
was the difference in that particular in

00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:06.600 
was the difference in that particular in
this<00:06:04.809> game<00:06:05.019> was<00:06:05.199> really<00:06:05.439> really<00:06:05.829> it<00:06:06.369> could

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
this game was really really it could

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.519 
this game was really really it could
have<00:06:06.699> gone<00:06:06.849> the<00:06:06.909> other<00:06:07.059> way<00:06:07.239> no<00:06:07.959> question<00:06:08.409> I

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:08.529 
have gone the other way no question I

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:10.319 
have gone the other way no question I
mean<00:06:08.679> we<00:06:08.860> we<00:06:09.339> scored<00:06:09.669> some<00:06:09.879> runs<00:06:09.939> tonight

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:10.329 
mean we we scored some runs tonight

00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:13.079 
mean we we scored some runs tonight
because<00:06:10.629> of<00:06:10.899> our<00:06:11.049> our<00:06:11.349> legs<00:06:11.709> we<00:06:12.309> didn't<00:06:12.939> really

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:13.089 
because of our our legs we didn't really

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:15.539 
because of our our legs we didn't really
manufacture<00:06:13.929> a<00:06:13.959> whole<00:06:14.169> lot<00:06:14.379> with<00:06:14.589> the<00:06:14.679> bat<00:06:14.889> so

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:15.549 
manufacture a whole lot with the bat so

00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:18.119 
manufacture a whole lot with the bat so
that<00:06:15.939> we<00:06:16.539> know<00:06:16.719> exactly<00:06:17.199> what<00:06:17.649> we<00:06:17.829> got<00:06:18.039> from

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:18.129 
that we know exactly what we got from

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:20.459 
that we know exactly what we got from
this<00:06:18.339> game<00:06:18.489> we<00:06:18.639> got<00:06:18.759> to<00:06:18.819> win<00:06:18.939> but<00:06:19.719> it<00:06:20.019> was

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:20.469 
this game we got to win but it was

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:22.259 
this game we got to win but it was
hardly<00:06:20.799> a<00:06:20.949> great<00:06:21.249> performance<00:06:21.759> I<00:06:21.909> would<00:06:22.089> tell

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:22.269 
hardly a great performance I would tell

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:24.419 
hardly a great performance I would tell
you<00:06:22.389> that<00:06:22.449> pecoraro<00:06:23.349> pitched<00:06:23.709> well<00:06:23.949> and<00:06:24.249> I

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:24.429 
you that pecoraro pitched well and I

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:26.069 
you that pecoraro pitched well and I
thought<00:06:24.849> corey<00:06:25.119> williams<00:06:25.299> was<00:06:25.719> good<00:06:25.929> and

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:26.079 
thought corey williams was good and

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:28.289 
thought corey williams was good and
clinard<00:06:26.589> pitch<00:06:26.739> well<00:06:26.979> but<00:06:27.189> outside<00:06:28.089> of<00:06:28.119> the

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:28.299 
clinard pitch well but outside of the

00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:30.779 
clinard pitch well but outside of the
clean<00:06:28.569> defense<00:06:29.129> there<00:06:30.129> wasn't<00:06:30.159> a<00:06:30.579> whole<00:06:30.610> lot

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
clean defense there wasn't a whole lot

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:34.289 
clean defense there wasn't a whole lot
to<00:06:31.119> brag<00:06:31.299> about<00:06:31.360> tonight<00:06:31.899> offensively
