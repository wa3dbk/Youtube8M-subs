00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hello friends , Valery Rudenko himself 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.490
 today we will talk about repairs 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.360
 batteries for the screwdriver 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:16.820
 screwdrivers and other on the market has developed 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:22.130
 such a situation that the Chinese us 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:27.960
 filled with their product in all areas 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:31.460
 Here such elements cadmium they 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.010
 are present in all in general batteries 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.239
 no matter what the production 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.550
 because batteries are likely 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.550
 are collecting everything in china at the moment 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.780
 This one in Germany was about 10 years ago. 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.450
 here is its battery 12 elements remain 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.300
 that is, it turns out 14 volts here in 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:59.760
 Filevskaya it turns out 12 volts here 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:04.260
 here here are 48 volts in general, but these are 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.990
 here's just a paper wrapper 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.150
 they are rated 1 and 2 volts i.e. 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.170
 going depending on what you 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.970
 need a brand cool battery 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.259
 do not buy for $ 50 you can buy 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.409
 for 10 here is such a different shell 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.729
 pull this whole household out and 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.130
 add depending on what you 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.860
 it is necessary that there is less more if 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.680
 less need means need to throw three 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.100
 extra banks from the place just for for 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.979
 If you need more, you can cut it off 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.799
 Here are these banks to solder the memory better 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.460
 copper wire and naturally take 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.560
 special flux for this purpose 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.360
 clean up well and solder but it 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.649
 already another story basically 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.190
 recover items i showed 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.070
 previous video like 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.130
 Well, you can calculate using a tester 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:07.560
 that's what I found he lies with me 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:10.910
 for the game you can take the LED light bulb 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.740
 there is a compute banks which are bad and 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.290
 better throw well you can try 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:21.990
 recover ie recover it 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.730
 at your own risk they say can 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.940
 earn and maybe later 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.340
 a certain time to discharge and easier 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.440
 take a bite and put others 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.570
 If there are 2 batteries, then there are 2 you can 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.310
 collect 1 if buy new ie 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:42.600
 the number of these cans can be found 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.850
 some kind of good that is pick up even 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.830
 ordinary tester that they were in 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:52.680
 in general, all the same well, it's pretty 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.870
 still difficult though approximately possible 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.710
 so that those banks here already 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.670
 located were the same with those who 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.890
 you insert thats all to new meetings 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.570
 go to the homemade site here's the point ru 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.620
 subscribe to the channel ask 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.620
 I will answer all the questions
