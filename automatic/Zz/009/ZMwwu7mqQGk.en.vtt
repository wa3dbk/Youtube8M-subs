for<00:00:11.820> sending<00:00:12.090> me<00:00:12.179> this<00:00:12.360> as<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:13.139> guys<00:00:13.230> know<00:00:13.410> I'm

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
for sending me this as you guys know I'm

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.049 
for sending me this as you guys know I'm
a<00:00:13.650> fan<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.860> McDavid<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.429> say<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.730> all<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:14.940> time

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
a fan of McDavid I say that all the time

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.910 
a fan of McDavid I say that all the time
but<00:00:16.049> they<00:00:16.199> are<00:00:16.320> really<00:00:16.619> one<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
but they are really one of the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.849 
but they are really one of the
originators<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:18.090> hex<00:00:18.480> padding<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.289> think

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
originators of the hex padding I think

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.260 
originators of the hex padding I think
that<00:00:20.010> could<00:00:20.160> cause<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> deep<00:00:20.670> flex<00:00:20.939> but<00:00:21.150> it's

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
that could cause a deep flex but it's

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.150 
that could cause a deep flex but it's
really<00:00:21.420> something<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.380> lot<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.010> other

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
really something that a lot of other

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.370 
really something that a lot of other
companies<00:00:23.580> have<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.960> know<00:00:25.050> trying<00:00:25.350> to

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
companies have you know trying to

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.620 
companies have you know trying to
implement<00:00:25.710> really<00:00:26.130> with<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.670> hexagon

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
implement really with the hexagon

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.250 
implement really with the hexagon
padding<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:29.130> foam<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.779> reason<00:00:31.109> why

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
padding and the foam so the reason why

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.220 
padding and the foam so the reason why
they<00:00:31.769> use<00:00:31.980> hex<00:00:32.399> padding<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.090> because<00:00:33.809> it's

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
they use hex padding is because it's

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.650 
they use hex padding is because it's
completely<00:00:34.860> flexible<00:00:35.250> right<00:00:36.090> if<00:00:36.210> you've<00:00:36.420> seen

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
completely flexible right if you've seen

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.389 
completely flexible right if you've seen
some<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> other<00:00:37.559> designs<00:00:38.160> whether

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
some of the other designs whether

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.979 
some of the other designs whether
company<00:00:38.790> sometimes<00:00:39.120> they<00:00:39.270> put<00:00:39.570> things<00:00:39.809> in

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
company sometimes they put things in

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.200 
company sometimes they put things in
here<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.469> nike<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.160> think<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.520> newest<00:00:41.850> one<00:00:42.000> has

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
here a nike I think the newest one has

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.200 
here a nike I think the newest one has
like<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> swoosh<00:00:42.989> inside<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.969> pad

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
like a swoosh inside of it but this pad

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.440 
like a swoosh inside of it but this pad
right<00:00:45.239> here<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.870> just<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.350> full<00:00:46.920> hex<00:00:47.760> foam

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
right here is just a full hex foam

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.869 
right here is just a full hex foam
padding<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:50.010> I'm<00:00:50.100> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.430> go<00:00:50.520> over<00:00:50.730> in

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
padding and so I'm going to go over in

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.939 
padding and so I'm going to go over in
the<00:00:50.969> review<00:00:51.239> some<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> differences<00:00:52.289> just

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949

some of the most dense it's some of the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.150 
some of the most dense it's some of the
lightest<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.050> it's<00:02:10.530> something<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.860> doesn't

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
lightest and it's something that doesn't

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.220 
lightest and it's something that doesn't
shrink<00:02:11.370> when<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.700> wash<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:12.060> dry<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:12.870> don't

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
shrink when you wash it dry so I don't

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.560 
shrink when you wash it dry so I don't
dry<00:02:13.500> any<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.489> my<00:02:14.580> compressed<00:02:14.940> material<00:02:15.420> when<00:02:15.540> I

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
dry any of my compressed material when I

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.970 
dry any of my compressed material when I
wash<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:16.019> judge<00:02:16.200> because<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.560> don't<00:02:16.709> want<00:02:16.830> to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
wash you judge because I don't want to

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.800 
wash you judge because I don't want to
shrink<00:02:17.220> or<00:02:17.489> ruin<00:02:18.090> or<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.269> don't<00:02:18.329> want<00:02:18.510> things

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
shrink or ruin or I don't want things

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.340 
shrink or ruin or I don't want things
like<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:20.130> screen<00:02:20.519> printed<00:02:20.880> logo<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.810> fade<00:02:22.079> so

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
like this screen printed logo to fade so

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.350 
like this screen printed logo to fade so
I<00:02:22.410> probably<00:02:22.650> won't<00:02:22.860> dry<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.220> either<00:02:23.549> but<00:02:24.239> it

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
I probably won't dry this either but it

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.030 
I probably won't dry this either but it
is<00:02:24.510> actually<00:02:24.989> just<00:02:25.200> took<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.590> on<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.829> drive

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
is actually just took this on the drive

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.440 
is actually just took this on the drive
so<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.459> something<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.880> we<00:02:26.970> dataset<00:02:27.360> you

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
so it is something that we dataset you

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.960 
so it is something that we dataset you
can<00:02:27.690> try<00:02:27.989> that<00:02:28.620> it's<00:02:28.829> not<00:02:29.070> going<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.579> shrink<00:02:29.820> at

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
can try that it's not going to shrink at

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.319 
can try that it's not going to shrink at
all

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
all

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:31.970 
all
one<00:02:30.989> of<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.110> other<00:02:31.290> reasons<00:02:31.410> why<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:31.709> really

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
one of the other reasons why I really

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.100 
one of the other reasons why I really
like<00:02:32.160> this<00:02:32.370> shooters<00:02:32.760> sleeve<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.269> because<00:02:33.959> of

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
like this shooters sleeve is because of

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.470 
like this shooters sleeve is because of
the<00:02:34.260> size<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.070> elbow<00:02:35.280> pad<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.970> actually<00:02:36.239> a

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
the size of the elbow pad is actually a

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.720 
the size of the elbow pad is actually a
smaller<00:02:36.930> pad<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.829> think<00:02:38.280> that's<00:02:38.430> okay

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
smaller pad but I think that's okay

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.550 
smaller pad but I think that's okay
because<00:02:38.880> it's<00:02:39.239> really<00:02:39.510> just<00:02:39.750> covering<00:02:40.290> the

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
because it's really just covering the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.039 
because it's really just covering the
point<00:02:40.860> on<00:02:41.760> your<00:02:41.970> elbow<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.510> something<00:02:42.959> I'm

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
point on your elbow and something I'm

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.410 
point on your elbow and something I'm
going<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.230> show<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.440> when<00:02:43.799> I<00:02:43.829> try<00:02:44.130> on<00:02:44.420> and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
going to show you when I try on and

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.750 
going to show you when I try on and
actually<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:46.110> think<00:02:46.769> you<00:02:47.130> guys<00:02:47.220> all<00:02:47.459> know<00:02:47.610> like

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
actually I think you guys all know like

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.400 
actually I think you guys all know like
Allen<00:02:48.090> Iverson<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.690> know<00:02:48.780> back<00:02:49.019> in<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.260> day

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
Allen Iverson you know back in the day

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.250 
Allen Iverson you know back in the day
he<00:02:49.769> was<00:02:49.920> really<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.430> first<00:02:50.579> person<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:51.299> use<00:02:51.900> a

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
he was really the first person to use a

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.900 
he was really the first person to use a
shooter<00:02:52.500> sleeve<00:02:52.829> and<00:02:53.130> use<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.459> McDavid

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
shooter sleeve and use the McDavid

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.819 
shooter sleeve and use the McDavid
shooter<00:02:54.180> sleeve<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.660> remember<00:02:55.320> getting<00:02:55.500> one

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
shooter sleeve I remember getting one

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.350 
shooter sleeve I remember getting one
back<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.820> think<00:02:57.269> is<00:02:57.360> probably<00:02:57.630> like<00:02:59.360> 2005-2006

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
back I think is probably like 2005-2006

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.120 
back I think is probably like 2005-2006
when<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:00.959> had<00:03:01.200> one<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.470> actually<00:03:01.620> chipped<00:03:02.070> the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
when I had one I actually chipped the

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.310 
when I had one I actually chipped the
bone<00:03:02.190> in<00:03:02.430> my<00:03:02.489> elbow<00:03:02.730> playing<00:03:02.910> basketball<00:03:03.360> so<00:03:04.290> I

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
bone in my elbow playing basketball so I

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.720 
bone in my elbow playing basketball so I
had<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.560> reason<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:04.890> have<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.130> sleeve<00:03:05.459> and

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
had a reason to have a sleeve and

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.490 
had a reason to have a sleeve and
something<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.209> still<00:03:06.510> like<00:03:06.720> today<00:03:06.989> they've

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
something I still like today they've

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.530 
something I still like today they've
come<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.769> long<00:03:07.860> way<00:03:08.280> since<00:03:08.340> back<00:03:08.880> then<00:03:08.910> with<00:03:09.450> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
come a long way since back then with the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.210 
come a long way since back then with the
shooter<00:03:09.810> sleeve<00:03:10.079> reason<00:03:10.799> is<00:03:10.890> they<00:03:11.070> offer

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
shooter sleeve reason is they offer

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.880 
shooter sleeve reason is they offer
three<00:03:11.459> different<00:03:11.549> sizes<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.420> small<00:03:12.989> medium<00:03:13.680> and

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
three different sizes a small medium and

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.860 
three different sizes a small medium and
large<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:14.579> sit<00:03:14.820> on<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.000> website<00:03:15.359> this

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
large that I sit on the website this

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.900 
large that I sit on the website this
happens<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.260> be<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.380> size<00:03:16.650> large<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.310> will<00:03:17.700> stay

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
happens to be a size large I will stay

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.120 
happens to be a size large I will stay
true<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.180> size<00:03:18.480> if<00:03:19.079> you<00:03:19.260> are<00:03:19.410> on<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.620> bubble<00:03:19.799> of

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
true to size if you are on the bubble of

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.190 
true to size if you are on the bubble of
two<00:03:20.340> sizes<00:03:20.609> with<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.540> shooter<00:03:21.810> sleeve<00:03:22.050> you

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
two sizes with the shooter sleeve you

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.170 
two sizes with the shooter sleeve you
definitely<00:03:22.590> want<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.860> go<00:03:22.950> higher<00:03:23.370> the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
definitely want to go higher the

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.869 
definitely want to go higher the
smaller<00:03:24.450> at<00:03:24.780> least<00:03:24.989> in<00:03:25.200> my<00:03:25.590> experience<00:03:25.819> but<00:03:26.819> I

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
smaller at least in my experience but I

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.309 
smaller at least in my experience but I
don't<00:03:27.180> think<00:03:27.359> there's<00:03:27.540> any<00:03:27.689> other<00:03:27.780> brand<00:03:28.230> that

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
don't think there's any other brand that

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.890 
don't think there's any other brand that
offers<00:03:28.409> three<00:03:29.010> sizes<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.700> shorter<00:03:30.299> sleeves<00:03:30.540> so

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
offers three sizes of shorter sleeves so

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.780 
offers three sizes of shorter sleeves so
you<00:03:31.500> guys<00:03:31.680> can<00:03:31.890> actually<00:03:32.010> get<00:03:32.310> something<00:03:32.670> that

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
you guys can actually get something that

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.780 
you guys can actually get something that
actually<00:03:33.000> fits<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:34.189> another<00:03:35.189> difference<00:03:35.670> is

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
actually fits you another difference is

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.179 
actually fits you another difference is
going<00:03:35.939> to<00:03:36.000> be<00:03:36.090> just<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.659> how<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.379> padding<00:03:37.980> is

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:38.189 
going to be just the how the padding is

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.220 
going to be just the how the padding is
put<00:03:38.519> up<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:39.299> unlike<00:03:39.659> some<00:03:39.989> of<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.109> other

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
put up so unlike some of the other

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.589 
put up so unlike some of the other
competitors<00:03:40.560> where<00:03:40.950> it's<00:03:41.579> own<00:03:41.879> and<00:03:42.060> has<00:03:42.299> mesh

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
competitors where it's own and has mesh

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.660 
competitors where it's own and has mesh

and<00:03:44.939> sorry<00:03:45.480> it's<00:03:45.599> not<00:03:45.780> it's<00:03:46.230> not<00:03:46.500> clean

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
and sorry it's not it's not clean

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.879 
and sorry it's not it's not clean
because<00:03:47.519> I've<00:03:47.700> been<00:03:47.790> using<00:03:47.849> it<00:03:48.269> but<00:03:48.709> you<00:03:49.709> can

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
because I've been using it but you can

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.699 
because I've been using it but you can
see<00:03:50.069> here<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.370> how<00:03:50.849> it's<00:03:51.090> sewn<00:03:51.329> in<00:03:51.590> from<00:03:52.590> the

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
see here that how it's sewn in from the

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.929 
see here that how it's sewn in from the
inside<00:03:53.659> and<00:03:54.799> I'll<00:03:55.799> say<00:03:56.010> last<00:03:56.400> reason<00:03:56.790> why<00:03:56.879> I

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:56.939 
inside and I'll say last reason why I

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.940 
inside and I'll say last reason why I
really<00:03:57.120> like<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.569> McDavid<00:03:58.079> arms<00:03:58.379> Lee<00:03:58.560> versus

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
really like the McDavid arms Lee versus

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.530 
really like the McDavid arms Lee versus
some<00:03:59.129> of<00:03:59.159> the<00:03:59.250> other<00:03:59.340> ones<00:03:59.639> it's<00:04:00.209> just<00:04:00.299> going

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
some of the other ones it's just going

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.929 
some of the other ones it's just going
to<00:04:00.599> be<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.840> compressive<00:04:01.439> material<00:04:02.220> it's

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
to be the compressive material it's

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:04.399 
to be the compressive material it's
something<00:04:03.329> it's<00:04:03.389> just<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.689> way<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.930> feels<00:04:04.079> on

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
something it's just the way it feels on

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.479 
something it's just the way it feels on
here<00:04:04.620> so<00:04:04.769> using<00:04:05.159> it<00:04:05.250> for<00:04:05.540> basketball<00:04:06.540> football

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
here so using it for basketball football

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.679 
here so using it for basketball football
obviously<00:04:08.489> one<00:04:08.909> of<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.090> things<00:04:09.269> that<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:09.659> does

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
obviously one of the things that it does

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:11.929 
obviously one of the things that it does
is<00:04:10.109> it<00:04:10.319> reduces<00:04:10.889> fatigue<00:04:11.159> and<00:04:11.639> the<00:04:11.700> arm

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
is it reduces fatigue and the arm

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.819 
is it reduces fatigue and the arm
because<00:04:12.120> it<00:04:12.389> does<00:04:12.540> help<00:04:12.750> with<00:04:13.019> that<00:04:13.169> motion

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
because it does help with that motion

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.860 
because it does help with that motion
but<00:04:14.639> it's<00:04:14.760> something<00:04:14.909> that<00:04:15.030> doesn't<00:04:15.599> slip

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
but it's something that doesn't slip

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.509 
but it's something that doesn't slip
it's<00:04:16.349> never<00:04:16.620> slipped<00:04:16.889> off<00:04:17.039> on<00:04:17.220> where<00:04:17.430> I'm

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
it's never slipped off on where I'm

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.830 
it's never slipped off on where I'm
using<00:04:17.699> and<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:17.970> don't<00:04:18.209> have<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.479> pull<00:04:18.660> it

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
using and I don't have to pull it

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.870 
using and I don't have to pull it
there's<00:04:19.289> no<00:04:19.500> tags<00:04:19.859> on<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.280> inside<00:04:20.639> that

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
there's no tags on the inside that

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.550 
there's no tags on the inside that
you're<00:04:20.970> trying<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.239> cut<00:04:21.479> off<00:04:21.599> or<00:04:21.930> fold<00:04:22.169> in<00:04:22.380> or

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
you're trying to cut off or fold in or

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.469 
you're trying to cut off or fold in or
fold<00:04:22.770> over<00:04:23.099> you<00:04:23.639> know<00:04:23.759> it's<00:04:23.910> just<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.180> really

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
fold over you know it's just a really

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.710 
fold over you know it's just a really
good<00:04:24.750> arm<00:04:25.139> sleeve<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:25.860> it's<00:04:26.039> something<00:04:26.250> that

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
good arm sleeve so it's something that

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.990 
good arm sleeve so it's something that
McDavid<00:04:27.720> makes<00:04:27.960> both<00:04:28.320> pet<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:28.949> unpadded<00:04:29.400> if

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
McDavid makes both pet and unpadded if

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.730 
McDavid makes both pet and unpadded if
you're<00:04:30.240> into<00:04:30.539> those<00:04:30.720> wearing<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.320> unpadded

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
you're into those wearing the unpadded

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.379 
you're into those wearing the unpadded
sleeves<00:04:32.130> I<00:04:32.310> definitely<00:04:32.699> recommend<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.240> their

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
sleeves I definitely recommend it their

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.270 
sleeves I definitely recommend it their
compression<00:04:33.990> but<00:04:34.470> surely<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:34.919> some<00:04:35.130> of<00:04:35.190> the

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
compression but surely is some of the

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.939 
compression but surely is some of the
best<00:04:35.490> that<00:04:35.729> I've<00:04:36.210> ever<00:04:36.449> seen<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:37.020> then<00:04:37.560> just

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
best that I've ever seen and then just

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.219 
best that I've ever seen and then just
the<00:04:38.190> sizing<00:04:38.849> with<00:04:39.000> it<00:04:39.180> so<00:04:39.419> for<00:04:39.690> me<00:04:39.810> again<00:04:40.110> you

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
the sizing with it so for me again you

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.260 
the sizing with it so for me again you
guys<00:04:40.349> know<00:04:40.530> I<00:04:40.560> had<00:04:40.800> a<00:04:40.830> little<00:04:41.070> baby<00:04:41.190> wrist<00:04:41.580> but

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
guys know I had a little baby wrist but

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.689 
guys know I had a little baby wrist but
it's<00:04:42.780> a<00:04:42.900> little<00:04:43.080> loose<00:04:43.349> here<00:04:43.520> so<00:04:44.520> that's<00:04:44.639> the

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
it's a little loose here so that's the

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.790 
it's a little loose here so that's the
only<00:04:44.909> downside<00:04:45.210> but<00:04:46.080> obviously<00:04:46.440> if<00:04:46.500> you<00:04:46.560> pull

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
only downside but obviously if you pull

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.969 
only downside but obviously if you pull
it<00:04:46.830> up<00:04:47.039> a<00:04:47.190> little<00:04:47.370> higher<00:04:47.580> on<00:04:47.610> your<00:04:47.880> arm<00:04:48.979> it's

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
it up a little higher on your arm it's

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.080 
it up a little higher on your arm it's
still<00:04:50.159> going<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.370> cover<00:04:50.580> your<00:04:51.570> elbow<00:04:51.900> here<00:04:52.199> and

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
still going to cover your elbow here and

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.850 
still going to cover your elbow here and
that's<00:04:54.090> going<00:04:54.300> to<00:04:54.360> take<00:04:54.570> care<00:04:54.840> of<00:04:54.870> some<00:04:55.620> of<00:04:55.710> the

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
that's going to take care of some of the

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.339 
that's going to take care of some of the
looseness<00:04:56.039> here<00:04:56.280> so<00:04:56.789> there<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:57.810> have<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.229> you

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
looseness here so there you have it you

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.980 
looseness here so there you have it you
can<00:04:58.500> take<00:04:58.650> a<00:04:58.680> good<00:04:58.919> look<00:04:59.159> at<00:04:59.880> how<00:05:00.090> it<00:05:00.240> is<00:05:00.360> on<00:05:00.720> my

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
can take a good look at how it is on my

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.710 
can take a good look at how it is on my
arm<00:05:01.229> just<00:05:01.639> leave<00:05:02.639> and<00:05:02.849> where<00:05:02.970> that<00:05:03.120> elbow<00:05:03.509> pad

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
arm just leave and where that elbow pad

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.219
