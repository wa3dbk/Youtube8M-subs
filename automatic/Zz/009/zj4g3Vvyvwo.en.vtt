one<00:03:29.459> before<00:03:30.049> so<00:03:31.099> when<00:03:32.099> that<00:03:32.910> happened<00:03:33.450> the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
one before so when that happened the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.599 
one before so when that happened the
adults<00:03:34.349> found<00:03:34.530> out<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.099> kids<00:03:35.340> were

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
adults found out that the kids were

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.960 
adults found out that the kids were
telling<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.440> girl<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.709> attack<00:03:37.980> me<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.430> she

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
telling the girl to attack me and she

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.789 
telling the girl to attack me and she
didn't<00:03:39.239> know<00:03:39.389> what<00:03:39.420> she<00:03:39.599> was<00:03:39.840> doing<00:03:40.290> so<00:03:40.620> I

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
didn't know what she was doing so I

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.159 
didn't know what she was doing so I
don't<00:03:41.010> really<00:03:41.190> blame<00:03:41.430> her<00:03:41.730> but<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.630> was<00:03:42.750> wrong

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
don't really blame her but it was wrong

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.379 
don't really blame her but it was wrong
for<00:03:43.470> those<00:03:43.590> little<00:03:43.799> boys<00:03:44.069> to<00:03:44.519> just<00:03:44.760> tell<00:03:45.060> her

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
for those little boys to just tell her

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.960 
for those little boys to just tell her
to<00:03:45.630> attack<00:03:45.989> me<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.349> after<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.519> kind<00:03:47.849> of

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
to attack me and after that I kind of

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.610 
to attack me and after that I kind of
went<00:03:48.120> through<00:03:48.180> elementary<00:03:48.660> with<00:03:48.989> no<00:03:49.109> friends

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
went through elementary with no friends

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.860 
went through elementary with no friends
I<00:03:49.769> you<00:03:50.280> know<00:03:50.370> I<00:03:50.400> always<00:03:50.579> tried<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.090> be<00:03:51.299> friends

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
I you know I always tried to be friends

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.280 
I you know I always tried to be friends
with<00:03:51.930> everybody<00:03:52.230> but<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.680> was<00:03:52.799> so<00:03:52.919> awkward<00:03:54.290> that

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
with everybody but I was so awkward that

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.500 
with everybody but I was so awkward that
I<00:03:55.530> I<00:03:55.590> think<00:03:55.919> I<00:03:56.099> tried<00:03:56.370> too<00:03:56.579> hard<00:03:56.760> if<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.329> makes

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
I I think I tried too hard if that makes

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.229 
I I think I tried too hard if that makes
sense<00:03:57.750> uh<00:03:58.160> so<00:03:59.160> no<00:03:59.639> one<00:03:59.760> wanted<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.060> be<00:04:00.120> my

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
sense uh so no one wanted to be my

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.080 
sense uh so no one wanted to be my
friend<00:04:00.269> so<00:04:00.810> I<00:04:00.840> ended<00:04:01.169> up<00:04:01.290> playing<00:04:01.560> sports<00:04:02.459> to

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
friend so I ended up playing sports to

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.670 
friend so I ended up playing sports to
hide<00:04:03.269> that<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.540> didn't<00:04:03.870> have<00:04:03.989> anybody<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.560> hang

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
hide that I didn't have anybody to hang

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.589 
hide that I didn't have anybody to hang
out<00:04:04.829> with<00:04:04.950> during<00:04:05.280> recess<00:04:05.910> I<00:04:06.180> would<00:04:06.389> play<00:04:06.569> like

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
out with during recess I would play like

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.800 
out with during recess I would play like
soccer<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.440> basketball<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.700> wall<00:04:09.630> ball

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
soccer and basketball and wall ball

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.110 
soccer and basketball and wall ball
because<00:04:10.230> all<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:10.470> those<00:04:10.739> are<00:04:11.069> team<00:04:11.579> sports<00:04:11.849> and

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
because all of those are team sports and

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.059 
because all of those are team sports and
ones<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:12.930> can<00:04:13.049> stand<00:04:13.530> in<00:04:13.650> line<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.010> you

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
ones that you can stand in line and you

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.440 
ones that you can stand in line and you
don't<00:04:14.099> need<00:04:14.370> to<00:04:14.430> have<00:04:14.639> a<00:04:14.669> friend<00:04:14.970> next<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.329> you

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
don't need to have a friend next to you

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.900 
don't need to have a friend next to you
so<00:04:16.169> that<00:04:16.620> was<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:17.130> easiest<00:04:17.430> way<00:04:17.609> for<00:04:17.639> me<00:04:17.849> to

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
so that was the easiest way for me to

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.089 
so that was the easiest way for me to
hide<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.419> in<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.780> have<00:04:18.930> anybody<00:04:19.320> after<00:04:19.950> that

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
hide that in and have anybody after that

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.219 
hide that in and have anybody after that
we<00:04:20.400> ended<00:04:20.700> up<00:04:20.820> moving<00:04:21.000> out<00:04:21.299> into<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.810> country

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
we ended up moving out into the country

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.409 
we ended up moving out into the country
because<00:04:22.620> we<00:04:22.950> got<00:04:23.159> more<00:04:23.490> land<00:04:23.760> for<00:04:23.880> our<00:04:24.120> horses

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
because we got more land for our horses

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.290 
because we got more land for our horses
so<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:25.080> ended<00:04:25.740> up<00:04:25.890> going<00:04:26.460> through<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.880> summer

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
so I ended up going through the summer

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.730 
so I ended up going through the summer
just<00:04:27.389> like<00:04:27.539> working<00:04:27.840> really<00:04:28.080> hard<00:04:28.199> with<00:04:28.530> my

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
just like working really hard with my

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.279 
just like working really hard with my
Barton<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.520> becoming<00:04:30.360> number<00:04:30.690> one<00:04:30.750> and

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
Barton and becoming number one and

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.580 
Barton and becoming number one and
writing<00:04:31.949> and<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:33.180> had<00:04:33.449> a<00:04:33.479> few<00:04:33.840> girlfriends<00:04:34.169> that

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
writing and I had a few girlfriends that

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.960 
writing and I had a few girlfriends that
were<00:04:34.680> going<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:34.919> be<00:04:35.069> at<00:04:35.190> my<00:04:35.310> new<00:04:35.520> junior<00:04:35.819> high

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
were going to be at my new junior high

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.170 
were going to be at my new junior high
and<00:04:36.300> they<00:04:37.199> were<00:04:37.259> my<00:04:38.069> friends<00:04:38.220> with<00:04:38.669> horses<00:04:38.909> so

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
and they were my friends with horses so

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.909 
and they were my friends with horses so
I<00:04:39.210> figured<00:04:39.539> they<00:04:39.690> would<00:04:39.780> be<00:04:39.840> my<00:04:39.960> friends<00:04:40.319> when

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
I figured they would be my friends when

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.719 
I figured they would be my friends when
I<00:04:40.949> was<00:04:41.190> at<00:04:41.509> school<00:04:42.509> and<00:04:43.039> they<00:04:44.039> were<00:04:44.099> popular

I was at school and they were popular

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.580 
I was at school and they were popular
though<00:04:44.940> they<00:04:45.240> ended<00:04:45.479> up<00:04:45.599> being<00:04:45.810> like<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.319> cool

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.100 
though they ended up being like the cool
girls<00:04:46.919> and<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:47.789> didn't<00:04:48.330> know<00:04:48.419> that<00:04:48.449> because<00:04:48.870> we

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
girls and I didn't know that because we

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.869
