00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.780
 as noted by the tam goal goal is I think 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.969
 I do not know how I'm going to choose 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.370
 Let's take a look here from the side. 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:51.360
 You know what I'm looking at here to see if I can 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.760
 I think it's a goal, I'll be right here. 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.670
 but anyway I went with the goal here we go 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.800
 take a look here my series 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.460
 Let's take a look at this smart 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.460
 right here 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.090
 come on bark is I got 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.760
 get in not getting because i do not know 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.479
 little boy between and hi 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.670
 I went in there and did not pick up the nee plate. 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.030
 Let's get on the plane and get on a 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.140
 clue I'm going to hit clothes do not practice 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.509
 that's it, I did not come to the country, I 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.729
 I'm going to have to say that I want tolerance. 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.180
 the keyboard does not know how the oxy 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.570
 keyboard and boy I 'm well lost 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.060
 here does not hit and when that reaction is 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.289
 about almost proportional to people looks 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.970
 This skill here, what is it? 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.670
 also the scare of my ability 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.930
 While this is neither how I'm going to do it 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.930
 take flight with him 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.899
 I think it's a good hike here. 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.640
 was'll see you in a now you 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:14.769
 here on the track but it will not 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:16.510
 Happen, let's go , boy. 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.209
 now to find out how you got up 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.130
 flight with him I lost control but 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.989
 now everything is going well it was all question 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.110
 of time 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:29.230
 That's when I did not know you put me inside. 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:34.390
 and I have not the faintest idea of the back 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:37.510
 that I could only do some maneuvering 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.380
 I think it is as much as possible the 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.380
 airplane size 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.480
 I'm going to try to make a terrorist attack . 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.790

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.700

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:00.819

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.349
 follow that in 2011 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:08.260
 is a spin spin in the air there 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:10.719
 sell lightly that way is good 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.980

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:21.129
 angle calculation and look all this 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:24.659
 business that she was right and I'm going 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.659
 use it is serious 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.150

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.060
 happening caracas got stuck on top 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.769

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.980
 We did not take anything nor to whom it 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:49.769
 I'll try again, I 'll drop it. 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.769
 I never do this again or try 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.239
 madness 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.870
 Can I get him out of the corner? 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.370
 Can I get out of here? 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.719
 I think it's not even out then I will die 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.290
 die 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:11.530
 the battery is to beat in low love if we 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:15.129
 Imagine if I can control him here. 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.759

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:40.810

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:43.140

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:48.820

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:53.950
