00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.360 

working<00:00:01.170> on<00:00:01.290> these<00:00:01.790> rear<00:00:02.790> calipers

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
working on these rear calipers

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.430 
working on these rear calipers
I<00:00:05.400> haven't<00:00:05.970> popped<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.330> piston<00:00:06.690> yet<00:00:06.930> night<00:00:07.200> I

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
I haven't popped the piston yet night I

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.270 
I haven't popped the piston yet night I
just<00:00:07.620> noticed<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.389> two<00:00:09.570> back<00:00:10.280> brackets

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
just noticed of the two back brackets

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.009 
just noticed of the two back brackets
for<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.519> emergency<00:00:11.910> brake<00:00:12.090> took<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:12.809> one

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
for the emergency brake took this one

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.860 
for the emergency brake took this one
off<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:14.340> was<00:00:14.429> working<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:14.940> other<00:00:15.509> one

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
off and I was working this other one

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.840 
off and I was working this other one
back<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.379> forth<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.160> noticed<00:00:17.580> every<00:00:17.820> time

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
back and forth and I noticed every time

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.700 
back and forth and I noticed every time
I<00:00:18.029> did<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.980> piston<00:00:19.980> moved<00:00:20.220> out<00:00:21.109> further<00:00:22.109> I'm

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
I did a piston moved out further I'm

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.310 
I did a piston moved out further I'm
wondering<00:00:23.160> if<00:00:24.140> she<00:00:25.140> had<00:00:25.170> moved<00:00:25.710> out<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.890> little

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
wondering if she had moved out a little

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.420 
wondering if she had moved out a little
if<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:30.230> just<00:00:31.230> keep<00:00:31.439> working<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.949> back<00:00:32.219> and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
if I can just keep working this back and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.850 
if I can just keep working this back and
forth<00:00:34.010> pop<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.250> piston<00:00:35.700> out<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:37.530> then

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
forth pop of that piston out and then

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:49.520 
forth pop of that piston out and then
that<00:00:40.860> would<00:00:40.980> be<00:00:41.129> alternative<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:48.530> blowing

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
that would be alternative to blowing

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.720 
that would be alternative to blowing
them<00:00:49.649> apart<00:00:50.039> with<00:00:50.160> pressure

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
them apart with pressure

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.260 
them apart with pressure
I<00:00:55.070> don't<00:00:56.070> know<00:00:56.190> how<00:00:56.309> messy<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.210> to

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
I don't know how messy this is going to

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.650 
I don't know how messy this is going to
be<00:00:57.449> when<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.780> opens<00:00:58.820> if<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.090> opens<00:01:00.449> oh<00:01:02.660> it's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
be when it opens if it opens oh it's

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.340 
be when it opens if it opens oh it's
open<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.439> came<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.830> okay<00:01:08.869> a<00:01:09.869> little<00:01:10.110> bit<00:01:10.260> of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
open it came out okay a little bit of

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.929 
open it came out okay a little bit of
mess

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.059 

all<00:01:16.659> right<00:01:17.340> that's<00:01:18.340> interesting

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:20.069 
all right that's interesting

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:25.169 
all right that's interesting
oops<00:01:21.069> more<00:01:21.490> mess<00:01:23.280> well<00:01:24.280> that's<00:01:24.520> one<00:01:24.759> way<00:01:24.789> to<00:01:24.939> do

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
oops more mess well that's one way to do

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.399 
oops more mess well that's one way to do
it<00:01:25.299> I<00:01:25.390> guess<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:28.450> work<00:01:28.569> this<00:01:28.780> guy<00:01:28.990> back<00:01:29.140> and

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
it I guess just work this guy back and

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.800 
it I guess just work this guy back and
forth<00:01:29.679> and<00:01:30.280> it's<00:01:30.429> probably<00:01:30.729> what<00:01:31.179> that<00:01:31.209> is<00:01:31.569> I'm

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
forth and it's probably what that is I'm

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.839 
forth and it's probably what that is I'm
guessing<00:01:32.200> is<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.619> adjuster<00:01:33.429> adjusting<00:01:35.849> every

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:36.849 
guessing is the adjuster adjusting every

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:40.260 
guessing is the adjuster adjusting every
time<00:01:37.119> until<00:01:37.689> it<00:01:37.810> adjusts<00:01:38.200> itself<00:01:38.560> but<00:01:39.270> right

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
time until it adjusts itself but right

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.589 
time until it adjusts itself but right
out<00:01:40.299> of<00:01:40.569> the<00:01:40.899> caliper<00:01:42.090> that's<00:01:43.319> interesting

00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:45.599 
out of the caliper that's interesting

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:48.809 
out of the caliper that's interesting
this<00:01:46.599> again<00:01:47.049> this<00:01:47.229> is<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.530> other<00:01:47.770> caliper<00:01:48.459> I

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
this again this is the other caliper I

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:59.510 
this again this is the other caliper I
haven't<00:01:49.689> done<00:01:49.810> anything<00:01:50.200> with<00:01:50.409> it<00:01:50.590> yet

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.020 

see<00:02:00.520> how<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.700> two<00:02:01.000> brackets<00:02:01.599> are<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:03.549> the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
see how the two brackets are on the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.520 
see how the two brackets are on the
backside<00:02:04.599> the<00:02:07.079> emergency<00:02:08.079> brake<00:02:08.319> or<00:02:08.500> parking

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
backside the emergency brake or parking

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.949 
backside the emergency brake or parking
brake<00:02:08.979> cable<00:02:09.310> goes<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:10.119> sheath<00:02:10.450> of<00:02:10.690> stopped

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
brake cable goes the sheath of stopped

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.580 
brake cable goes the sheath of stopped
here<00:02:11.379> and<00:02:11.560> then<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.769> cable<00:02:12.010> attaches<00:02:12.879> there

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
here and then the cable attaches there

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.130 
here and then the cable attaches there
these<00:02:14.590> two<00:02:14.980> brackets<00:02:15.430> are<00:02:15.579> pulled<00:02:16.140> towards

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
these two brackets are pulled towards

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.539 
these two brackets are pulled towards
one<00:02:17.349> another<00:02:17.379> to<00:02:18.310> apply<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.980> parking<00:02:21.459> brake

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
one another to apply the parking brake

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:30.949 
one another to apply the parking brake
that's<00:02:24.549> a<00:02:24.730> t30<00:02:25.359> I<00:02:25.480> believe

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:40.770 

come<00:02:31.959> on<00:02:32.110> spring<00:02:32.680> oh<00:02:33.010> here<00:02:33.459> we<00:02:33.580> go<00:02:39.720> yeah<00:02:40.720> you

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
come on spring oh here we go yeah you

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.399 
come on spring oh here we go yeah you
got<00:02:41.049> there<00:02:41.290> now<00:02:44.220> when<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:46.170> racket<00:02:47.170> gets

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
got there now when this racket gets

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.759 
got there now when this racket gets
turned<00:02:48.010> or<00:02:48.459> moved<00:02:48.700> by<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.590> parking<00:02:50.590> brake

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
turned or moved by that parking brake

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.949 
turned or moved by that parking brake
cable<00:02:51.750> piston<00:02:52.750> gets<00:02:52.959> pressed<00:02:53.230> out<00:02:54.810> he<00:02:55.810> has<00:02:55.930> the

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
cable piston gets pressed out he has the

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.210 
cable piston gets pressed out he has the
pads<00:02:56.500> where<00:02:56.860> thinner<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.900> piston<00:02:59.560> adjusts

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
pads where thinner the piston adjusts

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.780 
pads where thinner the piston adjusts
itself<00:03:00.610> out<00:03:01.109> automatically<00:03:02.109> and<00:03:02.500> that's<00:03:02.790> the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
itself out automatically and that's the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.490 
itself out automatically and that's the
mechanism<00:03:04.480> I<00:03:04.629> believe<00:03:04.959> we're<00:03:05.140> taking

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
mechanism I believe we're taking

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.940 
mechanism I believe we're taking
advantage<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.190> here<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:10.560> through<00:03:11.560> this<00:03:11.739> case

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
advantage of here so through this case

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.399 
advantage of here so through this case
yeah<00:03:12.579> doesn't<00:03:13.359> want<00:03:13.599> to<00:03:13.720> move<00:03:16.049> give<00:03:17.049> it<00:03:17.170> some

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
yeah doesn't want to move give it some

00:03:17.409 --> 00:04:20.190 
yeah doesn't want to move give it some
convincing

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.780 

there<00:04:20.830> saw<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.400> piston<00:04:21.790> move<00:04:21.940> out<00:04:23.550> so<00:04:24.550> move

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
there saw the piston move out so move

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.200 
there saw the piston move out so move
out<00:04:24.940> again

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.730 

really<00:04:32.100> we<00:04:33.100> just<00:04:33.130> want<00:04:33.640> be<00:04:34.180> nice<00:04:35.050> for<00:04:35.440> trying

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
really we just want be nice for trying

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.630 
really we just want be nice for trying
to<00:04:35.830> do<00:04:36.010> this<00:04:36.280> be<00:04:36.670> easier<00:04:37.060> fusion<00:04:38.370> proper<00:04:39.370> size

be exposed to the atmosphere time I
crank<00:05:16.870> it<00:05:17.050> I'm<00:05:17.200> getting<00:05:17.500> a<00:05:17.590> spray<00:05:18.070> of<00:05:20.370> brake

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.240 

leader<00:05:27.720> the<00:05:28.720> question<00:05:29.200> is<00:05:29.350> as<00:05:29.650> this<00:05:29.830> piston

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
leader the question is as this piston

00:05:30.250 --> 00:06:05.430 
leader the question is as this piston
come<00:05:30.430> down<00:05:30.610> now<00:05:32.100> looks<00:05:33.100> like<00:05:33.190> it<00:05:33.400> might<00:05:33.580> be

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:57.110 

yeah<00:06:06.440> pumping<00:06:07.280> right<00:06:07.430> out<00:06:46.720> there<00:06:47.720> you<00:06:47.840> go
