00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.480
 very well liked 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.330
 I am recovering a little before the camera 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.310

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.970
 shampoo 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.680

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.390
 which i would like to tell it 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.210
 shampoo of some french company 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.920
 which is not in principle can initially 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.820
 I am like my hair was like 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.079

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.910
 matrix after staining color yes and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.020
 rapper good shampoo but I did not give 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.920
 effect you wanted to get 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.200
 natura siberica 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.280
 I also used this shampoo 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.140
 the balm and conditioner are nice but somehow 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.239
 something is wrong then balm principle yes 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.370
 I can say so I shampoo 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.370
 liked the balm did not like 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.970
 spice 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:14.100
 loreal l'oreal that is this mask it 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.440
 shampoo series reper recovery all 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.620
 ok but head fat is not right away 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.680
 literally the next day it's not me 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.440
 I liked it absolutely not 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.810
 I liked this shampoo 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.670
 seen purely by chance and it satisfies 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.330
 all my needs that are me 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.210
 you need to get this green pharma 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.090
 shampoo from which I just stayed 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.600
 crazy you can say so my 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.060
 hair which is so like a feather he 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.460
 makes it so dense so straight 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.890
 overall cool i like the effect 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.050
 which turned out the most amazing 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.950
 which I really did not want to achieve with 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.750
 other shampoos 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.250
 it does not wash my hair every day with this 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.730
 shampoo I got it that is 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.180
 head must be washed once in three 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.850
 of the day 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.159
 It is generally super cool options 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.300
 and 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.790
 Well, in principle, and the first thing for me 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.129
 we will be the same because of this 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.860

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.549
 that my hair is white and I lost 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.840
 from this is some kind of yellow commemoration which 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:31.129
 cost which was shot down and more beautiful on 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.769
 It does not understand what it is in the cramped 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:41.390
