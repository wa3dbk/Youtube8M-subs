a new experience for the students a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.120 
a new experience for the students a

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
major part of that is the considerable

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.189 
major part of that is the considerable
investment<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.730> are<00:00:29.760> now<00:00:30.000> making<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.660> both

investment we are now making in both

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.520 
investment we are now making in both
Harrow<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.130> Marylebone<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.989> don't<00:00:34.200> have

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
Harrow and Marylebone we don't have

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.080 
Harrow and Marylebone we don't have
enough<00:00:34.890> social<00:00:35.100> spaces<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:35.790> don't<00:00:35.969> have

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
enough social spaces we don't have

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.990 
enough social spaces we don't have
enough<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.450> eating<00:00:36.750> spaces<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.770> by<00:00:38.000> doing

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
enough for eating spaces and by doing

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.360 
enough for eating spaces and by doing
really<00:00:39.329> good<00:00:39.570> architecture<00:00:40.290> at<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.950> center

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
really good architecture at the center

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.639 
really good architecture at the center
of<00:00:41.399> all<00:00:41.700> our<00:00:42.030> campuses<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.750> think<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.110> student

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
of all our campuses I think the student

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.930 
of all our campuses I think the student
experience<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.399> going<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.550> become<00:00:44.730> much

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
experience is just going to become much

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.569 
experience is just going to become much
richer<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.480> actually<00:00:45.780> much<00:00:45.930> more<00:00:46.110> enjoyable

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
richer and actually much more enjoyable

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.790 
richer and actually much more enjoyable
with<00:00:47.579> Harrow<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:48.660> means<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.200> space<00:00:49.440> is

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
with Harrow it just means the space is

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.770 
with Harrow it just means the space is
you<00:00:50.610> know<00:00:50.730> they've<00:00:50.910> got<00:00:50.940> transparent

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
you know they've got transparent

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.979 
you know they've got transparent

classrooms of big open space lecture

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.920 
classrooms of big open space lecture
areas<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.670> what<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.030> means<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.510> promotes

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
areas and what that means it promotes

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.590
