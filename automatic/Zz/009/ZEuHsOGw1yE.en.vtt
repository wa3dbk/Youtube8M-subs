00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.249 

I<00:00:13.119> guess<00:00:14.119> the<00:00:14.240> next<00:00:14.449> panel<00:00:14.660> we<00:00:14.750> have<00:00:14.929> is<00:00:15.109> the

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:15.259 
I guess the next panel we have is the

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.620 
I guess the next panel we have is the
tone<00:00:15.469> curve<00:00:15.709> panel<00:00:16.099> which<00:00:16.640> is<00:00:16.849> a<00:00:17.090> graphical

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
tone curve panel which is a graphical

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.659 
tone curve panel which is a graphical
way<00:00:17.779> basically<00:00:18.079> of<00:00:18.410> adjusting<00:00:18.949> the<00:00:19.130> overall

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:19.669 
way basically of adjusting the overall

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.490 
way basically of adjusting the overall
tonal<00:00:19.970> detail<00:00:20.449> in<00:00:20.570> the<00:00:20.630> image<00:00:20.900> so<00:00:21.079> we<00:00:21.169> can<00:00:21.289> kind

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
tonal detail in the image so we can kind

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.560 
tonal detail in the image so we can kind
of<00:00:21.529> adjust<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.070> overall<00:00:22.369> contrast<00:00:22.939> the

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
of adjust the overall contrast the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.780 
of adjust the overall contrast the
exposure<00:00:24.020> the<00:00:24.349> shadows<00:00:24.710> and<00:00:24.829> everything<00:00:24.890> from

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790 
exposure the shadows and everything from

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.450 
exposure the shadows and everything from
this<00:00:26.029> tone<00:00:26.360> curve<00:00:26.570> graph<00:00:26.950> now<00:00:27.950> what<00:00:28.129> you<00:00:28.250> see

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
this tone curve graph now what you see

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.459 
this tone curve graph now what you see
here<00:00:28.489> on<00:00:28.730> this<00:00:28.849> graph<00:00:29.090> is<00:00:29.329> basically<00:00:29.660> the

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:30.469 
here on this graph is basically the

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:32.200 
here on this graph is basically the
levels<00:00:30.829> of<00:00:30.950> luminosity<00:00:31.369> starting<00:00:31.969> from<00:00:32.090> the

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
levels of luminosity starting from the

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.299 
levels of luminosity starting from the
shadows<00:00:32.599> on<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:32.809> Left<00:00:33.110> moving<00:00:34.010> all<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.280> way

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
shadows on the Left moving all the way

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.430 
shadows on the Left moving all the way
to<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:34.550> mid-tones<00:00:35.000> in<00:00:35.329> the<00:00:35.420> middle<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:35.899> then

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
to the mid-tones in the middle and then

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.750 
to the mid-tones in the middle and then
all<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:36.710> way<00:00:36.770> up<00:00:36.800> to<00:00:37.039> the<00:00:37.250> most<00:00:37.399> extreme

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
all the way up to the most extreme

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.000 
all the way up to the most extreme
highlights<00:00:38.239> on<00:00:38.449> the<00:00:38.539> very<00:00:38.719> right<00:00:38.960> side<00:00:39.010> now

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
highlights on the very right side now

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.560 
highlights on the very right side now
how<00:00:40.190> do<00:00:40.250> you<00:00:40.370> adjust<00:00:40.489> the<00:00:40.850> tone<00:00:41.060> curve<00:00:41.329> well

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
how do you adjust the tone curve well

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.660 
how do you adjust the tone curve well
basically<00:00:41.780> you<00:00:41.960> start<00:00:42.290> by<00:00:42.590> adjusting<00:00:43.190> regions

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
basically you start by adjusting regions

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.000 
basically you start by adjusting regions
of<00:00:43.940> your<00:00:44.150> your<00:00:44.480> tone<00:00:44.660> curve<00:00:44.900> so<00:00:45.470> we<00:00:45.590> have<00:00:45.770> four

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
of your your tone curve so we have four

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.410 
of your your tone curve so we have four
different<00:00:46.040> regions<00:00:46.579> one<00:00:46.790> is<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.000> highlights

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
different regions one is the highlights

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.170 
different regions one is the highlights
which<00:00:47.630> is<00:00:47.750> this<00:00:47.899> stuff<00:00:48.170> from<00:00:48.350> 75<00:00:49.010> to<00:00:49.520> 100<00:00:50.030> over

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
which is this stuff from 75 to 100 over

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.850 
which is this stuff from 75 to 100 over
here<00:00:50.210> on<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.510> right<00:00:50.660> side<00:00:50.870> we<00:00:51.649> have<00:00:51.680> the

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
here on the right side we have the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.889 
here on the right side we have the
lights<00:00:52.250> which<00:00:52.670> is<00:00:52.700> basically<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:53.329> higher<00:00:53.600> end

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
lights which is basically the higher end

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.740 
lights which is basically the higher end
of<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.050> mid-tones<00:00:54.530> between<00:00:54.920> 50<00:00:55.220> and<00:00:55.250> 75<00:00:55.750> we

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
of the mid-tones between 50 and 75 we

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.560 
of the mid-tones between 50 and 75 we
have<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.050> darks<00:00:57.470> which<00:00:57.950> are<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:59.149> lower<00:00:59.360> end

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
have the darks which are the lower end

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.569 
have the darks which are the lower end
of<00:00:59.630> the<00:00:59.690> mid-tones<00:01:00.020> between<00:01:00.350> 25<00:01:00.770> and<00:01:00.800> 50<00:01:01.190> and

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
of the mid-tones between 25 and 50 and

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.370 
of the mid-tones between 25 and 50 and
then<00:01:02.000> we<00:01:02.090> have<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.329> shadows<00:01:02.719> which<00:01:02.960> is<00:01:03.140> the

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
then we have the shadows which is the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.910 
then we have the shadows which is the
low<00:01:03.530> side<00:01:03.739> between<00:01:03.950> 0<00:01:04.460> and<00:01:04.699> 25<00:01:05.560> now<00:01:06.560> if<00:01:06.649> I<00:01:06.740> want

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
low side between 0 and 25 now if I want

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.260 
low side between 0 and 25 now if I want
to<00:01:06.979> make<00:01:07.100> adjustments<00:01:07.189> this<00:01:07.790> all<00:01:08.030> I<00:01:08.060> need<00:01:08.210> to

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
to make adjustments this all I need to

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.510 
to make adjustments this all I need to
do<00:01:08.390> is<00:01:08.540> pull<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.840> sliders<00:01:09.350> up<00:01:09.469> or<00:01:09.649> down<00:01:09.829> so

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
do is pull the sliders up or down so

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.249 
do is pull the sliders up or down so
let's<00:01:10.700> say<00:01:10.850> in<00:01:11.030> looking<00:01:11.329> at<00:01:11.390> my<00:01:11.479> image<00:01:11.869> I<00:01:12.049> see

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
let's say in looking at my image I see

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.899 
let's say in looking at my image I see
that<00:01:12.409> my<00:01:12.560> highlights<00:01:12.979> could<00:01:13.249> be<00:01:13.399> a<00:01:13.579> little<00:01:13.819> bit

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
that my highlights could be a little bit

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.370 
that my highlights could be a little bit
brighter<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:14.299> I<00:01:14.509> want<00:01:14.689> to<00:01:14.749> pull<00:01:14.899> my<00:01:14.929> highlights

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
brighter so I want to pull my highlights

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.169 
brighter so I want to pull my highlights
up<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.709> little<00:01:15.859> bit<00:01:16.039> so<00:01:16.700> I'm<00:01:16.759> going<00:01:16.789> to<00:01:16.939> increase

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
up a little bit so I'm going to increase

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:20.219 
up a little bit so I'm going to increase
the<00:01:17.299> highlights<00:01:17.810> say<00:01:18.049> up<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.200> maybe<00:01:18.859> plus<00:01:19.130> 50

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
the highlights say up to maybe plus 50

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.389 
the highlights say up to maybe plus 50
and<00:01:21.229> then<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.859> upper<00:01:22.159> end<00:01:22.249> of<00:01:22.310> the

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
and then the the upper end of the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.010 
and then the the upper end of the
mid-tones<00:01:22.819> maybe<00:01:23.119> I<00:01:23.179> want<00:01:23.359> to<00:01:23.420> pull<00:01:23.630> down<00:01:23.659> to

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
mid-tones maybe I want to pull down to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.940 
mid-tones maybe I want to pull down to
kind<00:01:24.200> of<00:01:24.229> make<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.409> a<00:01:24.560> little<00:01:24.590> bit<00:01:24.859> more

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
kind of make it a little bit more

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.319 
kind of make it a little bit more
dramatic<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.579> just<00:01:25.609> show<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:25.909> little<00:01:26.149> bit<00:01:26.270> more

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
dramatic and just show a little bit more

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.209 
dramatic and just show a little bit more
blue<00:01:26.659> in<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.899> sky<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.649> I<00:01:27.679> want<00:01:27.829> to<00:01:27.859> keep<00:01:28.069> the

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
blue in the sky so I want to keep the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:29.440 
blue in the sky so I want to keep the
clouds<00:01:28.399> white<00:01:28.819> because<00:01:29.149> those<00:01:29.299> are

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
clouds white because those are

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.269 
clouds white because those are
highlights<00:01:29.869> and<00:01:30.109> I<00:01:30.200> want<00:01:30.409> to<00:01:30.560> pull<00:01:30.920> down<00:01:31.069> the

00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:31.279 
highlights and I want to pull down the

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:34.690 
highlights and I want to pull down the
mid-tones<00:01:31.700> to<00:01:32.329> see<00:01:32.509> more<00:01:32.689> blue<00:01:32.959> on<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:34.369> darker

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
mid-tones to see more blue on the darker

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.309 
mid-tones to see more blue on the darker
side<00:01:34.729> line<00:01:35.029> mid-tones<00:01:35.450> I'm<00:01:35.749> gonna<00:01:35.929> increase

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
side line mid-tones I'm gonna increase

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:37.510 
side line mid-tones I'm gonna increase
it<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:36.590> I<00:01:36.679> actually<00:01:36.770> have<00:01:37.100> a<00:01:37.130> little<00:01:37.310> bit<00:01:37.399> more

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
it so I actually have a little bit more

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.730 
it so I actually have a little bit more
detail<00:01:37.999> on<00:01:38.179> that<00:01:38.270> darker<00:01:38.779> side<00:01:39.020> of<00:01:39.289> the

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
detail on that darker side of the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.359 
detail on that darker side of the
mid-tones

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
mid-tones

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.980 
mid-tones
but<00:01:40.609> then<00:01:40.729> on<00:01:40.849> my<00:01:40.880> shadows<00:01:41.420> I<00:01:41.450> actually<00:01:41.689> want

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
but then on my shadows I actually want

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.649 
but then on my shadows I actually want
to<00:01:42.049> make<00:01:42.229> it<00:01:42.490> really<00:01:43.490> kind<00:01:43.849> of<00:01:43.909> contrast<00:01:44.509> II

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
to make it really kind of contrast II

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.480 
to make it really kind of contrast II
and<00:01:44.840> make<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.139> shadows<00:01:45.469> kind<00:01:45.740> of<00:01:45.829> really<00:01:46.249> dark

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
and make the shadows kind of really dark

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.649 
and make the shadows kind of really dark
so<00:01:46.789> I'm<00:01:46.880> gonna<00:01:47.029> lower<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.539> shadows<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:50.479> right

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
so I'm gonna lower the shadows and right

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.059 
so I'm gonna lower the shadows and right
there<00:01:50.840> from<00:01:50.990> this<00:01:51.139> tone<00:01:51.319> curve<00:01:51.529> adjustment<00:01:51.979> so

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
there from this tone curve adjustment so

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:53.919 
there from this tone curve adjustment so
we<00:01:52.189> see<00:01:52.399> I've<00:01:52.639> adjusted<00:01:52.789> my<00:01:53.179> overall<00:01:53.599> exposure

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
we see I've adjusted my overall exposure

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.469 
we see I've adjusted my overall exposure
in<00:01:54.200> contrast<00:01:54.829> without<00:01:55.639> even<00:01:55.909> touching<00:01:56.060> any<00:01:56.419> of

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
in contrast without even touching any of

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.899 
in contrast without even touching any of
the<00:01:56.539> basic<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.799> basic<00:01:57.829> sliders<00:01:58.459> up<00:01:58.549> here<00:01:58.759> so

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
the basic the basic sliders up here so

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.339 
the basic the basic sliders up here so
all<00:01:59.029> my<00:01:59.119> basic<00:01:59.419> sliders<00:01:59.749> are<00:01:59.869> still<00:02:00.079> all<00:02:00.319> a

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
all my basic sliders are still all a

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.649 
all my basic sliders are still all a
default<00:02:00.889> exposure<00:02:01.369> black<00:02:01.789> contrast<00:02:02.419> are<00:02:02.539> all

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
default exposure black contrast are all

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.709 
default exposure black contrast are all
a<00:02:02.689> default<00:02:03.139> yet<00:02:04.069> my<00:02:04.759> overall<00:02:05.179> tone<00:02:05.389> curve<00:02:05.599> has

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
a default yet my overall tone curve has

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.149 
a default yet my overall tone curve has
changed<00:02:06.020> in<00:02:06.079> the<00:02:06.169> overall<00:02:06.409> image<00:02:06.679> exposure

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
changed in the overall image exposure

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.850 
changed in the overall image exposure
and<00:02:07.549> contrast<00:02:07.579> has<00:02:08.300> changed<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.929> follow<00:02:09.679> this

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
and contrast has changed to follow this

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.860 
and contrast has changed to follow this
tone<00:02:10.099> curve<00:02:10.340> now<00:02:11.120> another<00:02:11.360> adjustment<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:11.750> want

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
tone curve now another adjustment I want

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.150 
tone curve now another adjustment I want
to<00:02:11.930> show<00:02:12.020> you<00:02:12.140> guys<00:02:12.200> is<00:02:12.440> these<00:02:12.590> sliders<00:02:13.040> right

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
to show you guys is these sliders right

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.800 
to show you guys is these sliders right
here<00:02:13.340> at<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.489> bottom<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.760> our<00:02:13.790> graph<00:02:14.090> now

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
here at the bottom of our graph now

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.470 
here at the bottom of our graph now
these<00:02:14.930> sliders<00:02:15.319> are<00:02:15.440> set<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.709> 25<00:02:16.190> 50<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:16.730> 75<00:02:17.300> by

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
these sliders are set to 25 50 and 75 by

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.840 
these sliders are set to 25 50 and 75 by
default<00:02:17.930> which<00:02:18.110> identifies<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:19.460> different

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
default which identifies the different

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.020 
default which identifies the different
regions<00:02:20.420> of

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
regions of

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.480 
regions of
of<00:02:21.090> these<00:02:21.330> ranges<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:22.920> basically<00:02:23.250> arranged

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
of these ranges so basically arranged

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.070 
of these ranges so basically arranged
for<00:02:23.610> our<00:02:23.700> highlights<00:02:24.030> right<00:02:24.180> now<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.450> from<00:02:24.600> 75

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
for our highlights right now is from 75

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.890 
for our highlights right now is from 75
to<00:02:25.200> 100<00:02:25.590> but<00:02:25.830> if<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.040> pull<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.520> down<00:02:26.910> it's

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
to 100 but if I pull this down it's

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.630 
to 100 but if I pull this down it's
going<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.290> increase<00:02:28.710> that<00:02:28.980> highlight<00:02:29.430> range

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
going to increase that highlight range

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.280 
going to increase that highlight range
which<00:02:29.820> means<00:02:30.090> whatever<00:02:30.570> adjustments<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.260> I

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
which means whatever adjustments that I

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.320 
which means whatever adjustments that I
make<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:31.770> this<00:02:31.890> highlight<00:02:32.250> range<00:02:32.550> is<00:02:32.790> gonna

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
make in this highlight range is gonna

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.120 
make in this highlight range is gonna
have<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.570> larger<00:02:34.200> effect<00:02:34.290> over<00:02:34.890> now<00:02:35.070> the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
have a larger effect over now the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.490 
have a larger effect over now the
mid-tone<00:02:35.730> area<00:02:36.060> because<00:02:36.420> I've<00:02:36.570> I've<00:02:36.840> had<00:02:37.170> it

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
mid-tone area because I've I've had it

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.710 
mid-tone area because I've I've had it
bleed<00:02:37.770> into<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.100> mid-tone<00:02:38.400> area<00:02:38.700> as<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.510> pull

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
bleed into the mid-tone area as I pull

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.270 
bleed into the mid-tone area as I pull
it<00:02:39.810> up<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.050> other<00:02:40.230> way<00:02:40.440> it's<00:02:40.680> gonna<00:02:40.770> have<00:02:41.070> a

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
it up the other way it's gonna have a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.220 
it up the other way it's gonna have a
lighter<00:02:41.580> effect<00:02:41.790> on<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.330> mid-tone<00:02:42.690> area<00:02:43.020> and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
lighter effect on the mid-tone area and

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.740 
lighter effect on the mid-tone area and
only<00:02:43.560> affect<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.400> most<00:02:44.610> bright<00:02:44.970> areas<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
only affect the most bright areas of the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.080 
only affect the most bright areas of the
image<00:02:46.020> so<00:02:46.260> we<00:02:47.040> can<00:02:47.160> kind<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.370> make<00:02:47.550> micro

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
image so we can kind of make micro

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.120 
image so we can kind of make micro
adjustments<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.840> basically<00:02:49.590> how<00:02:49.890> these

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
adjustments to basically how these

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.860 
adjustments to basically how these
region<00:02:50.790> adjustments<00:02:51.240> are<00:02:51.330> affecting<00:02:51.780> the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
region adjustments are affecting the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.840 
region adjustments are affecting the
overall<00:02:52.200> tone<00:02:52.440> curve<00:02:52.709> by<00:02:53.280> adjusting<00:02:53.700> these

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
overall tone curve by adjusting these

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.960 
overall tone curve by adjusting these
sliders<00:02:54.450> these<00:02:54.780> region<00:02:55.140> sliders<00:02:55.790> now<00:02:56.790> I'm

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
sliders these region sliders now I'm

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.670 
sliders these region sliders now I'm
gonna<00:02:57.060> reset<00:02:57.600> this<00:02:57.720> tone<00:02:57.989> curve<00:02:58.200> by<00:02:58.350> holding

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
gonna reset this tone curve by holding

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.620 
gonna reset this tone curve by holding
alt<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.130> clicking<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.700> reset<00:03:00.090> region<00:03:00.510> it

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
alt and clicking this reset region it

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.080 
alt and clicking this reset region it
takes<00:03:00.870> me<00:03:00.989> back<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.200> our<00:03:01.410> default<00:03:01.739> view<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.489> if

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
takes me back to our default view and if

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.580 
takes me back to our default view and if
you<00:03:03.209> look<00:03:03.360> down<00:03:03.510> here<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:03.900> shows<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.260> point

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
you look down here it shows the point

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.949 
you look down here it shows the point
curve<00:03:04.860> as<00:03:05.070> being<00:03:05.310> medium<00:03:05.640> contrast<00:03:06.180> this

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
curve as being medium contrast this

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.350 
curve as being medium contrast this
probably<00:03:07.680> is<00:03:07.830> most<00:03:07.980> likely<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.459> default<00:03:08.850> tone

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
probably is most likely the default tone

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.550 
probably is most likely the default tone
curve<00:03:09.570> that<00:03:09.660> you're<00:03:09.780> gonna<00:03:09.900> see<00:03:10.200> if<00:03:10.350> that

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
curve that you're gonna see if that

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.020 
curve that you're gonna see if that
comes<00:03:10.770> selected<00:03:11.250> it's<00:03:11.400> basically<00:03:11.640> if<00:03:11.940> you

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
comes selected it's basically if you

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.850 
comes selected it's basically if you
pull<00:03:12.239> down<00:03:12.270> this<00:03:12.480> menu<00:03:12.720> there's<00:03:13.500> three

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
pull down this menu there's three

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.040 
pull down this menu there's three
different<00:03:14.220> kind<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.150> standard<00:03:15.570> tone<00:03:15.780> curves

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
different kind of standard tone curves

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.960 
different kind of standard tone curves
one<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.320> linear<00:03:16.709> linear<00:03:17.100> tone<00:03:17.580> curve<00:03:17.790> which

contrast where it kind of deepens the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
it a little bit more pop enos and one is

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.100 
it a little bit more pop enos and one is
the<00:03:31.350> strong<00:03:31.650> contrast<00:03:32.190> which<00:03:32.340> is<00:03:32.459> another

the strong contrast which is another

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.390 
the strong contrast which is another
preset<00:03:34.110> that's<00:03:34.200> gonna<00:03:34.350> make<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:35.070> image<00:03:35.280> even

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
preset that's gonna make the image even

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.120 
preset that's gonna make the image even
more<00:03:35.730> poppy<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:37.170> if<00:03:37.260> we<00:03:37.410> reset<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:37.920> it's<00:03:38.010> going

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
more poppy so if we reset it it's going

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.729 
more poppy so if we reset it it's going
to<00:03:38.190> default<00:03:38.580> back<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.940> medium<00:03:39.480> contrast<00:03:39.739> now

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
to default back to medium contrast now

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:41.690 
to default back to medium contrast now
there's<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:40.950> couple<00:03:41.130> of<00:03:41.340> ways<00:03:41.430> of<00:03:41.610> adjusting

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
there's a couple of ways of adjusting

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.640 
there's a couple of ways of adjusting
the<00:03:42.060> tone<00:03:42.269> curve<00:03:42.450> we<00:03:42.750> can<00:03:42.780> do<00:03:43.019> it<00:03:43.140> by<00:03:43.260> using<00:03:43.470> the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
the tone curve we can do it by using the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.229 
the tone curve we can do it by using the
graph<00:03:43.860> by<00:03:44.190> just<00:03:44.370> clicking<00:03:44.549> anywhere<00:03:44.970> on<00:03:45.090> the

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
graph by just clicking anywhere on the

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.360 
graph by just clicking anywhere on the
graph<00:03:45.780> on<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:45.989> point<00:03:46.350> in<00:03:46.530> whatever<00:03:46.830> region<00:03:47.190> we

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
graph on a point in whatever region we

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.310 
graph on a point in whatever region we
want<00:03:47.549> so<00:03:48.480> if<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.630> want<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.870> increase<00:03:49.170> the

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
want so if I want to increase the

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.930 
want so if I want to increase the
brightness<00:03:49.440> of<00:03:49.769> my<00:03:49.799> of<00:03:50.160> my<00:03:50.220> highlights<00:03:50.519> all<00:03:50.880> I

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
brightness of my of my highlights all I

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.370 
brightness of my of my highlights all I
got<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.150> do<00:03:51.209> is<00:03:51.329> click<00:03:51.540> on<00:03:51.660> that<00:03:51.720> region<00:03:51.989> and

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
got to do is click on that region and

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.560 
got to do is click on that region and
pull<00:03:53.100> up<00:03:53.340> on<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:53.670> line<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.090> it's<00:03:54.209> gonna<00:03:54.299> pull

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
pull up on that line and it's gonna pull

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.050 
pull up on that line and it's gonna pull
up<00:03:54.690> all<00:03:54.840> my<00:03:54.989> highlights<00:03:55.380> if<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.400> want<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.730> pull

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
up all my highlights if I want to pull

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.030 
up all my highlights if I want to pull
down<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.570> kind<00:03:58.049> of<00:03:58.140> highlights<00:03:58.680> side<00:03:58.829> of<00:03:58.950> my

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
down the kind of highlights side of my

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.100 
down the kind of highlights side of my
mid-tones<00:03:59.459> I'm<00:04:00.120> just<00:04:00.299> gonna<00:04:00.450> click<00:04:00.630> there<00:04:00.870> and

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
mid-tones I'm just gonna click there and

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.680 
mid-tones I'm just gonna click there and
I'm<00:04:01.200> gonna<00:04:01.290> bring<00:04:01.709> it<00:04:01.860> down<00:04:02.070> and<00:04:02.370> so<00:04:03.360> all<00:04:03.570> I'm

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
I'm gonna bring it down and so all I'm

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.750 
I'm gonna bring it down and so all I'm
doing<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:04.079> basically<00:04:04.260> adjusting<00:04:04.980> my<00:04:05.130> my<00:04:05.519> tone

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
doing is basically adjusting my my tone

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.240 
doing is basically adjusting my my tone
curve<00:04:06.000> by<00:04:06.209> adding<00:04:06.570> points<00:04:07.290> on<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.680> line<00:04:07.890> and

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
curve by adding points on the line and

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.340 
curve by adding points on the line and
adjusting<00:04:09.030> those<00:04:09.150> points<00:04:09.600> just<00:04:09.900> how<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.170> would

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
adjusting those points just how it would

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.250 
adjusting those points just how it would
in<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.829> tone<00:04:11.100> curve<00:04:11.310> in<00:04:11.459> Photoshop

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
in a tone curve in Photoshop

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.930 
in a tone curve in Photoshop
okay<00:04:13.260> now<00:04:13.440> yet<00:04:13.739> another<00:04:14.040> way<00:04:14.280> of<00:04:14.549> adjusting

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
okay now yet another way of adjusting

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.460 
okay now yet another way of adjusting
our<00:04:15.030> tone<00:04:15.209> curve<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.630> let<00:04:15.720> me<00:04:15.780> reset<00:04:16.140> that<00:04:16.320> so

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
our tone curve and let me reset that so

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.979 
our tone curve and let me reset that so
we<00:04:16.530> can<00:04:16.650> get<00:04:16.769> back<00:04:16.890> to<00:04:17.100> where<00:04:17.190> we<00:04:17.250> were<00:04:17.400> before

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
we can get back to where we were before

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.940 
we can get back to where we were before
another<00:04:18.989> way<00:04:19.109> of<00:04:19.169> adjusting<00:04:19.290> our<00:04:19.560> tone<00:04:19.769> curve

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
another way of adjusting our tone curve

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.440 
another way of adjusting our tone curve
if<00:04:20.070> we're<00:04:20.220> not<00:04:20.400> familiar<00:04:20.790> with<00:04:21.000> like<00:04:21.209> say

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
if we're not familiar with like say

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.930 
if we're not familiar with like say
knowing<00:04:22.109> okay<00:04:22.290> what<00:04:22.770> exactly<00:04:23.250> our<00:04:23.430> highlights

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
knowing okay what exactly our highlights

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.520 
knowing okay what exactly our highlights
in<00:04:24.060> this<00:04:24.180> image<00:04:24.390> or<00:04:24.690> what<00:04:24.900> exactly<00:04:24.990> are<00:04:25.410> the

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
in this image or what exactly are the

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.650 
in this image or what exactly are the
shadows<00:04:25.830> in<00:04:25.919> this<00:04:26.010> image<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:26.490> can<00:04:27.090> adjust<00:04:27.510> it

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
shadows in this image I can adjust it

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.659 
shadows in this image I can adjust it
visually<00:04:28.200> and<00:04:28.410> so<00:04:28.950> basically<00:04:29.190> I<00:04:29.280> can<00:04:29.370> say<00:04:29.400> well

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
visually and so basically I can say well

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.340 
visually and so basically I can say well
I<00:04:29.700> want<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:30.060> deepen<00:04:30.390> the<00:04:30.510> shadows

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
I want to deepen the shadows

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.710 
I want to deepen the shadows
so<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:31.920> don't<00:04:32.130> necessarily<00:04:32.250> know<00:04:32.790> exactly<00:04:33.420> what

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
so I don't necessarily know exactly what

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.960 
so I don't necessarily know exactly what
area<00:04:34.080> on<00:04:34.230> this<00:04:34.380> line<00:04:34.650> is<00:04:34.860> my<00:04:34.980> shadowy<00:04:35.370> area<00:04:35.730> say

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
area on this line is my shadowy area say

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.390 
area on this line is my shadowy area say
for<00:04:36.180> this<00:04:36.300> for<00:04:36.720> this<00:04:36.810> grill<00:04:37.110> right<00:04:37.290> here<00:04:37.370> but<00:04:38.370> I

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
for this for this grill right here but I

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.830 
for this for this grill right here but I
can<00:04:38.700> select<00:04:38.970> this<00:04:39.030> little<00:04:39.240> point<00:04:39.480> tool<00:04:39.690> which

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
can select this little point tool which

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.040 
can select this little point tool which
basically<00:04:40.080> allows<00:04:40.500> me<00:04:40.710> to<00:04:40.980> adjust<00:04:42.050> visually

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
basically allows me to adjust visually

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.440 
basically allows me to adjust visually
by<00:04:43.260> clicking<00:04:43.680> in<00:04:43.800> my<00:04:43.950> image<00:04:44.280> so<00:04:44.550> let's<00:04:45.240> say<00:04:45.360> if

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
by clicking in my image so let's say if

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.030 
by clicking in my image so let's say if
I<00:04:45.510> want<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.750> brighten<00:04:45.990> my<00:04:46.110> highlight<00:04:46.830> so<00:04:46.980> I'm
