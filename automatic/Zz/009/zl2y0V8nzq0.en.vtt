00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 all back with this topic regarding 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.080
 the terrible the truth contradictions 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.639
 that exist between the mandates 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.179
 directly from god of his own 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.190
 word letter fist and mouth too and that 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.450
 clearly in the catholic church that 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.100
 supposedly they are the big ones 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.840
 representatives of the church and of 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.550
 heading that is to move on to the floor 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.619
 of God according to the verbs of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.660
 commandments would not be paying attention 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.180
 we talked about celibacy where 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.519
 clearly in the bible in different 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.260
 passages as we said the ark not in the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.120
 weddings of Canaan who own Jesus 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.040
 He held as inviting please 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.079
 we do not and we are happy for also 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.480
 what teaches timoteo regarding the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.270
 work of a religious representative of 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.300
 have children and being educated does not have 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.920
 card and everything else were good 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.559
 currently with all the drag of the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.910
 psychosocial psychological problems and 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.160
 of sexual aberrations that has brought 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.469
 apparently celibacy some who do not 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.239
 they could stand is the cardinal himself 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.969
 medina that tries to explain what is the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.609
 posture or justification of the church 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.320
 Catholic to stay chaste pure not 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.320
 the tonic is also preached 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:16.740
 the renunciation of the marital status 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:20.820
 perform lovingly implies consecrating 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.800
 in a state of life that remembers what 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.920
 will happen after death and in 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.900
 the resurrection when jesus says that the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.750
 kingdom of heaven or women 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.450
 they will take husband nor the husbands will take 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.440
 women and those who in this life 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.340
 religious priests who renounce the 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.790
 marriage want to be humbly a 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.340
 testimony of faith in that way of life 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.250
 which is eternal life where no longer 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.720
 there will be marriage as it exists in 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.300
 this earth because the task will have ceased 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.670
 to multiply the sons of god that 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.470
 they come to this world through 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.190
 marriage 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.750
 the truth is that looking like that let's say to 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.420
 bird flight the phrases that the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.850
 need like cords paradise the lion 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.740
 sleep next to the lamb but what 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.140
 man will not take woman or woman mari or 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.810
 let's say I do not answer it for any 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.510
 part in any case simply us 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.280
 if we understand historically because it 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.070
 demanded celibacy and it's because 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.050
 simply when there was a cure to 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.000
 moment of dying all your goods when 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.310
 before they had family they passed his wife and 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.800
 son but now that he died they pass to the 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.900
 church and that add up to 30 million 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.000
 plus 60 million for passenger cars 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.310
 accumulate all accesses of dollars 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.709
 even involved a good listener few 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.200
 words there are also contradictions 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.580
 you reflections you will see here 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.420
 we have one thing in the church 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.420
 clearly come
