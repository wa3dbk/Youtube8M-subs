today we're going to cover the bill
clock<00:00:22.830> it's<00:00:23.720> really<00:00:24.720> really<00:00:24.960> fast<00:00:27.349> and<00:00:28.349> we

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
clock it's really really fast and we

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.009 
clock it's really really fast and we
just<00:00:29.160> grew<00:00:29.340> up<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> f5<00:00:29.820> there<00:00:30.119> bucko<00:00:30.330> okay

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
just grew up the f5 there bucko okay

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.950 
just grew up the f5 there bucko okay
here<00:00:31.140> we<00:00:31.170> go<00:00:31.730> alright<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.030> what<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.750> is

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
here we go alright so what this is

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.190 
here we go alright so what this is
composed<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:35.010> basically<00:00:35.790> just<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.480> command

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
composed of is basically just to command

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.549 
composed of is basically just to command
blocks<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.520> fill<00:00:38.820> command<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.300> it

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
blocks that have a fill command in it

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.990 
blocks that have a fill command in it
these<00:00:40.559> over<00:00:40.800> here<00:00:40.829> are<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> show<00:00:41.790> that

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
these over here are just the show that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.740 
these over here are just the show that
is<00:00:42.090> working<00:00:42.420> their<00:00:42.690> second<00:00:43.170> man's<00:00:43.399> 001<00:00:44.399> and

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
is working their second man's 001 and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.880 
is working their second man's 001 and
safe<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.280> 002<00:00:47.480> okay<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.750> what<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.860> here

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
safe and 002 okay so what we have here

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.540 
safe and 002 okay so what we have here
this<00:00:50.879> top<00:00:51.090> one<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.899> fail<00:00:52.199> command<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:53.010> works

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
this top one is a fail command it works

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.270 
this top one is a fail command it works
just<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> previous<00:00:55.079> video<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
just like in the previous video with the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.150 
just like in the previous video with the
one<00:00:56.910> overall<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.360> fill<00:00:57.539> commands<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.160> there

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
one overall the fill commands and there

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.189 
one overall the fill commands and there
it's<00:00:59.430> pretty<00:00:59.640> simple<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.570> I'll<00:01:00.899> go<00:01:01.170> over

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
it's pretty simple so I'll go over

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.889 
it's pretty simple so I'll go over
briefly<00:01:01.649> here<00:01:02.010> /<00:01:02.910> fills<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.390> command<00:01:03.690> and

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
briefly here / fills the command and

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.590 
briefly here / fills the command and
then<00:01:04.589> i'm<00:01:05.070> using<00:01:05.250> relative<00:01:05.909> coordinates<00:01:06.299> so

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
then i'm using relative coordinates so

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.990 
then i'm using relative coordinates so
the<00:01:06.810> first<00:01:07.020> three<00:01:07.380> till<00:01:07.619> does<00:01:07.830> here<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the first three till does here are the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.340 
the first three till does here are the
first<00:01:09.240> set<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.479> our<00:01:09.630> instance<00:01:10.020> where<00:01:10.229> it

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
first set of our instance where it

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.109 
first set of our instance where it
starts<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.950> fill<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.659> going<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.960> start

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
starts the fill so it's going to start

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.850 
starts the fill so it's going to start
minus<00:01:15.119> one<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.750> y<00:01:16.020> direction<00:01:16.049> which<00:01:16.590> means

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
minus one in y direction which means

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.280 
minus one in y direction which means
just<00:01:17.100> right<00:01:17.340> underneath<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.930> ending

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
just right underneath it and the ending

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.050 
just right underneath it and the ending
block<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:20.250> minus<00:01:20.549> 1<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> Y

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
block is going to be minus 1 in the Y

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.749 
block is going to be minus 1 in the Y
direction<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.659> minus<00:01:22.170> 10<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.619> z<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.610> going

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
direction and minus 10 and z it's going

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.289 
direction and minus 10 and z it's going
to<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.970> filling<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.390> with<00:01:24.659> redstone<00:01:25.170> blocks<00:01:26.299> so

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
to be filling in with redstone blocks so

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.560 
to be filling in with redstone blocks so
and<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.170> second<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:28.530> here<00:01:28.799> is

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
and then the second one here is

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.539 
and then the second one here is
basically<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.960> exact<00:01:31.409> same<00:01:31.710> thing<00:01:31.979> except

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
basically the exact same thing except

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.370 
basically the exact same thing except
instead<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.119> down<00:01:33.390> one<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.810> going<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.200> up

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
instead of down one it's going to be up

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.969 
instead of down one it's going to be up
one<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:37.110> end<00:01:37.259> block<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.650> going<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.890> be

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
one and and the end block is going to be

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.480 
one and and the end block is going to be
up<00:01:38.310> one<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.970> minus<00:01:39.659> ten<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.740> Z<00:01:41.070> direction

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
up one and minus ten in the Z direction

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.330 
up one and minus ten in the Z direction
and<00:01:41.700> we're<00:01:41.820> going<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:41.970> fill<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.360> stone<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.979> it's

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and we're going to fill in stone so it's

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.580 
and we're going to fill in stone so it's
it's<00:01:44.700> basically<00:01:45.000> right<00:01:45.299> here<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.439> all

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
it's basically right here if this is all

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.289 
it's basically right here if this is all
filled<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.950> with<00:01:47.100> stone<00:01:47.340> from<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:48.000> fill

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
filled in with stone from that fill

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.830 
filled in with stone from that fill
command<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:49.320> bottom<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:49.710> stone<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.840> what's

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
command the bottom here stone and what's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.109 
command the bottom here stone and what's
going<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.170> happen<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.829> once<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.399> start<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.939> up

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
going to happen is once I start this up

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.649 
going to happen is once I start this up
it's<00:01:55.079> going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.439> rapidly<00:01:56.369> replace<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.420> line

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
it's going to rapidly replace this line

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.560 
it's going to rapidly replace this line
of<00:01:57.840> stone<00:01:58.079> with<00:01:58.680> red<00:01:59.520> song<00:01:59.700> box<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.240> then

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
of stone with red song box and then

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.420 
of stone with red song box and then
immediately<00:02:00.990> replacing<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.590> stone<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.979> then

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
immediately replacing the stone and then

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.100 
immediately replacing the stone and then
redstone<00:02:02.820> blocks<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.329> over<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:03.930> over<00:02:03.960> again

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
redstone blocks and over and over again

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.459 
redstone blocks and over and over again
really<00:02:05.100> really<00:02:05.250> fast<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:06.180> let's<00:02:06.630> start<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.409> up

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
really really fast so let's start it up

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.749 
really really fast so let's start it up
I<00:02:07.649> gotta<00:02:07.829> get<00:02:07.920> rid<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.160> one<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.310> these<00:02:08.489> stones

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
I gotta get rid of one of these stones

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.999 
I gotta get rid of one of these stones
and<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.509> got<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.720> trigger<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.020> with<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> redstone

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
and I got to trigger it with a redstone

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.339 
and I got to trigger it with a redstone
block<00:02:11.340> are<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.580> ready<00:02:11.790> there<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.540> go<00:02:12.660> as<00:02:12.930> you

immediately<00:02:21.040> turns<00:02:22.030> all<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.390> way<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.510> two<00:02:22.750> and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
immediately turns all the way to two and

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.280 
immediately turns all the way to two and
I<00:02:23.740> put<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.010> back<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.400> now<00:02:25.390> has<00:02:25.810> one<00:02:25.990> in<00:02:26.110> there

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
I put it back and now has one in there

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.820 
I put it back and now has one in there
so<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.430> just<00:02:28.000> goes<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.390> crazy<00:02:28.690> it's<00:02:29.380> really

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
so it just goes like crazy it's really

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.070 
so it just goes like crazy it's really
really<00:02:30.220> fast<00:02:30.520> you<00:02:31.390> may<00:02:31.540> be<00:02:31.600> worrying<00:02:32.020> about

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
really fast you may be worrying about

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.930 
really fast you may be worrying about
leg<00:02:32.440> but<00:02:32.710> I<00:02:32.860> don't<00:02:33.070> really<00:02:33.190> get<00:02:33.370> any<00:02:33.520> leg<00:02:33.670> from

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
leg but I don't really get any leg from

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.200 
leg but I don't really get any leg from
it<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.650> as<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.860> can<00:02:35.980> see<00:02:36.010> up<00:02:36.820> at<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.030> top

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
it and as you can see up at the top

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.990 
it and as you can see up at the top
second<00:02:38.050> line<00:02:38.230> down<00:02:38.500> on<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:38.860> left<00:02:39.040> side<00:02:39.280> 0

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
second line down on the left side 0

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.980 
second line down on the left side 0
chunk<00:02:40.300> updates<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:42.030> it's<00:02:43.030> pretty<00:02:43.450> damn<00:02:43.720> fast

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
chunk updates so it's pretty damn fast

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.440 
chunk updates so it's pretty damn fast
so<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:45.010> turn<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.310> off<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:46.090> got<00:02:46.210> to<00:02:46.300> put<00:02:46.420> a

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
so and to turn it off you got to put a

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.060 
so and to turn it off you got to put a
red<00:02:46.750> sun<00:02:46.900> block<00:02:47.050> on<00:02:47.320> bottom<00:02:47.890> here<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.610> then

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
red sun block on bottom here and then

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.150 
red sun block on bottom here and then
there<00:02:51.070> you<00:02:51.130> go<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.520> then<00:02:52.180> now<00:02:52.900> it's<00:02:53.290> turned

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
there you go and then now it's turned

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.050 
there you go and then now it's turned
off<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.990> eventually<00:02:55.990> those<00:02:56.709> will<00:02:57.010> display<00:02:57.610> go

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
off and eventually those will display go

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.720 
off and eventually those will display go
away<00:02:58.240> from<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.540> chat<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.650> that's<00:03:00.459> how<00:03:00.610> it

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
away from the chat so that's how it

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.600 
away from the chat so that's how it
works<00:03:00.970> now<00:03:01.450> there<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:02.200> one<00:03:02.560> additional<00:03:03.220> thing

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
works now there is one additional thing

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.030 
works now there is one additional thing
is<00:03:04.120> this<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.450> stone<00:03:04.660> on<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:04.990> system<00:03:05.140> alright

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
is this the stone on that system alright

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.400 
is this the stone on that system alright
so<00:03:06.190> let's<00:03:06.340> turn<00:03:06.550> I'll<00:03:06.730> let<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.030> stone<00:03:07.410> there

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
so let's turn I'll let the stone there

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.940 
so let's turn I'll let the stone there
is<00:03:08.650> actually<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.730> order<00:03:10.420> like<00:03:10.990> a<00:03:11.020> order<00:03:11.920> of

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
is actually and order like a order of

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.640 
is actually and order like a order of
operations<00:03:12.550> for<00:03:12.790> this<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:15.400> will<00:03:15.760> start<00:03:16.660> in<00:03:16.930> at

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
operations for this it will start in at

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.620 
operations for this it will start in at
the<00:03:17.950> lowest<00:03:18.310> possible<00:03:19.230> Z<00:03:20.230> direction<00:03:20.800> and<00:03:20.980> head

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
the lowest possible Z direction and head

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.130 
the lowest possible Z direction and head
positively<00:03:22.630> so<00:03:23.640> take<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.670> look<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.150> am<00:03:25.989> looking

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
positively so take a look I am looking

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.680 
positively so take a look I am looking
toward<00:03:26.739> positive<00:03:27.070> Z<00:03:27.610> so<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.390> will<00:03:28.540> actually

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
toward positive Z so it will actually

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.170 
toward positive Z so it will actually
execute<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.830> command<00:03:30.160> at<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.670> end<00:03:30.910> first

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
execute the command at this end first

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.320 
execute the command at this end first
and<00:03:31.709> quickly<00:03:32.709> very<00:03:33.280> very<00:03:33.610> quickly<00:03:33.880> move<00:03:34.300> to

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
and quickly very very quickly move to

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.380 
and quickly very very quickly move to
this<00:03:34.630> end<00:03:34.840> so<00:03:35.530> it<00:03:35.709> goes<00:03:35.860> from<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.220> lowest<00:03:36.640> Z

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
this end so it goes from the lowest Z

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.720 
this end so it goes from the lowest Z
coordinate<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.530> highest<00:03:38.739> Z<00:03:39.250> coordinate

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
coordinate to the highest Z coordinate

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.000 
coordinate to the highest Z coordinate
and<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.000> same<00:03:40.930> thing<00:03:41.140> with<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.290> X<00:03:41.500> direction

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
and the same thing with the X direction

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.620 
and the same thing with the X direction
so<00:03:42.130> if<00:03:42.280> you<00:03:42.400> haven't<00:03:42.760> have<00:03:43.060> it<00:03:43.180> in<00:03:43.330> a<00:03:43.450> different

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
so if you haven't have it in a different

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.140 
so if you haven't have it in a different
direction<00:03:43.870> we'll<00:03:44.590> go<00:03:44.739> from<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.100> lowest<00:03:45.310> X<00:03:45.670> to

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
direction we'll go from the lowest X to

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.110 
direction we'll go from the lowest X to
the<00:03:46.180> highest<00:03:46.480> x<00:03:46.950> okay<00:03:47.950> so<00:03:48.130> let<00:03:48.880> me<00:03:48.970> demonstrate

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
the highest x okay so let me demonstrate

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.539 
the highest x okay so let me demonstrate
that<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.170> we're<00:03:50.350> going<00:03:50.440> to<00:03:50.530> press<00:03:51.040> this<00:03:51.340> button

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
that so we're going to press this button

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.479 
that so we're going to press this button
up<00:03:51.700> here<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:52.480> does<00:03:53.140> very<00:03:53.680> quickly<00:03:53.920> it<00:03:54.250> just

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
up here it does very quickly it just

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.770 
up here it does very quickly it just
does<00:03:54.670> one<00:03:55.000> round<00:03:55.620> as<00:03:56.620> you<00:03:56.799> can<00:03:56.920> see<00:03:57.480> two<00:03:58.480> was

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
does one round as you can see two was

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.660 
does one round as you can see two was
first<00:03:59.049> and<00:03:59.350> then<00:03:59.560> one<00:03:59.799> so<00:04:00.130> if<00:04:00.310> you<00:04:00.400> look<00:04:00.549> at

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
first and then one so if you look at

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.160 
first and then one so if you look at
this<00:04:00.880> two<00:04:01.269> and<00:04:01.830> then<00:04:02.830> one<00:04:03.600> so<00:04:04.600> it<00:04:04.930> goes<00:04:04.989> from

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
this two and then one so it goes from

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.830 
this two and then one so it goes from
the<00:04:05.530> lowest<00:04:05.799> to<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.280> highest<00:04:06.370> E<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:07.000> that's

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
the lowest to the highest E and that's

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.949 
the lowest to the highest E and that's
pretty<00:04:08.110> much<00:04:08.230> it<00:04:08.350> for<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.739> fill<00:04:08.980> clocks<00:04:09.250> now

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
pretty much it for the fill clocks now

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.479 
pretty much it for the fill clocks now
that's<00:04:10.959> how<00:04:11.080> you<00:04:11.110> make<00:04:11.230> them<00:04:11.500> now<00:04:12.130> you<00:04:12.190> can

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
that's how you make them now you can

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.969 
that's how you make them now you can
trigger<00:04:12.730> command<00:04:13.660> blocks<00:04:13.900> bottom<00:04:14.890> top<00:04:16.979> sides

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
trigger command blocks bottom top sides

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.250 
trigger command blocks bottom top sides
all<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.700> way<00:04:18.790> around<00:04:18.880> so<00:04:19.299> you<00:04:19.600> can<00:04:19.989> actually

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
all the way around so you can actually

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.620 
all the way around so you can actually
run<00:04:20.620> many<00:04:21.070> many<00:04:21.280> commands<00:04:21.609> with<00:04:21.880> this<00:04:22.090> very

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
run many many commands with this very

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.040 
run many many commands with this very
very<00:04:22.900> quickly<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:25.180> seems<00:04:25.390> to<00:04:25.599> be<00:04:25.720> incredibly

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050
