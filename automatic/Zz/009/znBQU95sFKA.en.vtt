00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
so yeah it's just a very basic overworld

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.040 
so yeah it's just a very basic overworld
map<00:00:46.489> you<00:00:47.030> jump<00:00:47.269> around<00:00:47.359> from<00:00:47.569> each<00:00:47.809> little

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
map you jump around from each little

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.500 
map you jump around from each little
level<00:00:48.379> canopy<00:00:49.280> chaos<00:00:49.640> but<00:00:50.059> that<00:00:50.210> one's<00:00:50.359> pretty

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
level canopy chaos but that one's pretty

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.270 
level canopy chaos but that one's pretty
chaotic<00:00:50.719> now<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:51.679> cool<00:00:51.859> thing<00:00:52.010> about<00:00:52.039> the

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
chaotic now the cool thing about the

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.700 
chaotic now the cool thing about the
overworld<00:00:52.609> map<00:00:52.760> is<00:00:53.089> you<00:00:53.629> can<00:00:53.870> find<00:00:54.170> secret

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
overworld map is you can find secret

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.410 
overworld map is you can find secret
exits<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.339> different<00:00:55.639> ways<00:00:55.760> to<00:00:55.789> complete

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
exits and different ways to complete

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.270 
exits and different ways to complete
worlds<00:00:57.019> which<00:00:57.409> would<00:00:57.589> then<00:00:57.739> unlock<00:00:58.069> new

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
worlds which would then unlock new

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.979 
worlds which would then unlock new
pathways<00:00:58.729> so<00:00:58.909> as<00:00:59.030> you<00:00:59.149> can<00:00:59.269> see<00:00:59.389> here<00:00:59.690> this

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
pathways so as you can see here this

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.969 
pathways so as you can see here this
weird<00:01:00.879> scary<00:01:01.879> banana<00:01:02.420> statue<00:01:02.839> area<00:01:03.409> I<00:01:03.620> have<00:01:03.859> to

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
find a way to get over there and I

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.270 
find a way to get over there and I
probably<00:01:05.420> do<00:01:05.840> that<00:01:05.990> by<00:01:06.320> beating<00:01:06.650> shipwreck

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280
