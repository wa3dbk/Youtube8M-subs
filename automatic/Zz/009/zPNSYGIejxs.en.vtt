 It is important, for example , when there is b twice in the afternoon 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.950
 If there are no molecules , dividing this period into five translates into one 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.440
 scene 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:42.400

 Furukawa city past sweets 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.980
 It's okay if it 's okay but it's a problem 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:54.670

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.839
 If I pulled it in 3 minutes, I was shooting 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.839

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.540
 I 'm just going to b about 5 from my sister in 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.690
 In the same way 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.690
 In the case of outside, the mode is pushed out once and then the original mode 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:42.610

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.610
 Two times c points are in rank 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.010
 There is a strange feeling that when you lose is a line, but it's dead like this 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.910
 Here is how much if you become 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.360
 Such in - 3 Yeah burden means that a large Donnie Titan is large land of 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:08.130
 But it would be quite different inside 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:10.239
 It's -1, so what is this minus means to go in the opposite direction? 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.280
 The price range does not change 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.230

 But I because the cat position Toka Toka this position is pointing the way to lose the width of the width of Amy mother 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.290
 If it passes through, it is divided into only five gon 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.990
 If it is pulled, it becomes 1 each, so the width is 1 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.990
 If - total started from the opposite when was I 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.950
