middle just to get it secured then once

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.620 
middle just to get it secured then once
you've<00:01:05.070> got<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.790> don't<00:01:06.299> want<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> make

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
you've got that you don't want to make

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.800 
you've got that you don't want to make
sure<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.020> your<00:01:07.760> rocket<00:01:08.760> body<00:01:08.970> will<00:01:09.210> slide<00:01:09.600> on

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
sure that your rocket body will slide on

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.570 
sure that your rocket body will slide on
the<00:01:09.930> tube<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.439> notice<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.010> moved<00:01:11.460> it

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
the tube so you notice I just moved it

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.730 
the tube so you notice I just moved it
up<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.880> back<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.390> forth<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.840> check<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> make

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
up and back and forth and check to make

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.219 
up and back and forth and check to make
sure<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.040> would<00:01:14.189> slide<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.670> tube<00:01:15.020> then<00:01:16.020> you

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
sure it would slide on the tube then you

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.190 
sure it would slide on the tube then you
can<00:01:16.470> go<00:01:16.740> forward<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.600> continue<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.720> tape<00:01:18.960> down

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
can go forward and continue to tape down

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.050 
can go forward and continue to tape down
the<00:01:19.350> seam<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.619> want<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> put<00:01:20.189> tape<00:01:20.400> down<00:01:20.729> on

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the seam you want to put tape down on

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.990 
the seam you want to put tape down on
the<00:01:21.210> entire<00:01:21.570> scene<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.229> whole<00:01:22.409> way<00:01:22.590> up<00:01:23.000> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the entire scene the whole way up the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.969 
the entire scene the whole way up the
rocket<00:01:24.630> body<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
rocket body this is going to be on the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.969 
rocket body this is going to be on the
outside<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.909> want<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.479> tape<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.560> down<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
outside so you want to tape it down to

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.920 
outside so you want to tape it down to
reduce<00:01:29.280> drag<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.640> reduce<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.750> likelihood

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
reduce drag and reduce the likelihood

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.810 
reduce drag and reduce the likelihood
that<00:01:31.229> your<00:01:31.439> rocket<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.159> blow<00:01:32.430> apart

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
that your rocket is going to blow apart

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.910 
that your rocket is going to blow apart
once<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.869> launched<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:36.200> once<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.409> get<00:01:37.650> done

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
once it is launched so once you get done

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.830 
once it is launched so once you get done
with<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.520> can<00:01:38.640> move<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.420> next

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
with this you can move on to the next

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:53.770 
with this you can move on to the next
step<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> rocket<00:01:40.920> body<00:01:41.040> process

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.710 

all<00:01:54.380> right<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:54.979> looks<00:01:55.159> about<00:01:55.729> Don<00:01:56.330> so<00:01:56.600> now

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
all right and it looks about Don so now

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.000 
all right and it looks about Don so now
again<00:01:56.840> just<00:01:57.260> checking<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.590> make<00:01:57.650> sure<00:01:57.740> it

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
again just checking to make sure it

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.670 
again just checking to make sure it
slides<00:01:58.720> at<00:01:59.720> this<00:01:59.900> point<00:02:00.170> now<00:02:00.320> you're<00:02:00.500> going<00:02:00.619> to

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
slides at this point now you're going to

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.530 
slides at this point now you're going to
want<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:00.890> move<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.430> one<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.210> you're<00:02:02.450> going

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
want to move it to one and you're going

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.480 
want to move it to one and you're going
to<00:02:02.630> move<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.900> rocket<00:02:03.290> body<00:02:03.440> to<00:02:03.619> one<00:02:03.950> end<00:02:04.250> of

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
to move the rocket body to one end of

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.070 
to move the rocket body to one end of
the<00:02:04.640> PVC<00:02:05.119> pipe<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:05.570> you<00:02:05.630> want<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.869> put<00:02:05.990> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.609 
pipe right at the edge just like I've
shown<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:08.149> there<00:02:08.420> this<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.350> going<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.530> help

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
shown you there this is going to help

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.820 
shown you there this is going to help
you<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.729> tape<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.600> top<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.440> want<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.680> take

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
you to tape the top and you want to take

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.370 
you to tape the top and you want to take
this<00:02:12.950> top<00:02:13.220> end<00:02:13.459> tightly<00:02:14.209> because<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.260> the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
this top end tightly because this is the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.530 
this top end tightly because this is the
side<00:02:15.590> that's<00:02:15.800> going<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.250> be<00:02:16.880> placed<00:02:17.300> up

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
side that's going to be placed up

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.960 
side that's going to be placed up
against<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.590> launcher<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.220> what's<00:02:19.670> going<00:02:19.880> to

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
against the launcher and what's going to

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.030 
against the launcher and what's going to
take<00:02:20.239> all<00:02:20.420> of<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.750> force<00:02:21.020> of<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.380> air<00:02:21.560> as<00:02:21.830> it

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
take all of the force of the air as it

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.750 
take all of the force of the air as it
is<00:02:22.190> launched<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:23.810> needs<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.200> be<00:02:24.760> wrapped

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
is launched so this needs to be wrapped

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.690 
is launched so this needs to be wrapped
tightly<00:02:26.120> with<00:02:26.450> tape<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:28.280> needs<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.580> be

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
tightly with tape and it needs to be

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.030 
tightly with tape and it needs to be
airtight<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.810> really<00:02:30.200> needs<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.530> be<00:02:30.620> on<00:02:30.739> there

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
airtight it really needs to be on there

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.040 
airtight it really needs to be on there
good<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.280> would<00:02:31.850> say<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.060> few<00:02:32.360> pieces<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.870> tape

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
good I would say a few pieces of tape

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.840 
good I would say a few pieces of tape
going<00:02:33.320> back<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.340> forth<00:02:34.580> in<00:02:34.730> different

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
going back and forth in different

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.930 
going back and forth in different
directions<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:35.660> for<00:02:36.110> this<00:02:36.320> it's<00:02:36.560> it's<00:02:37.400> okay

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
directions and for this it's it's okay

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.390 
directions and for this it's it's okay
to<00:02:38.000> over<00:02:38.540> tape<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:39.080> in<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.650> lot<00:02:39.860> of<00:02:39.890> ways<00:02:40.100> can't

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
to over tape you in a lot of ways can't

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.090 
to over tape you in a lot of ways can't
over<00:02:40.670> tape<00:02:40.910> here<00:02:41.209> because<00:02:42.140> this<00:02:42.319> is<00:02:42.530> really

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
over tape here because this is really

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.920 
over tape here because this is really
the<00:02:43.370> most<00:02:43.550> vital<00:02:43.940> part<00:02:44.180> of<00:02:44.330> your<00:02:44.569> of<00:02:44.870> your

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
the most vital part of your of your

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.479 
the most vital part of your of your
rocket<00:02:45.500> this<00:02:45.620> is<00:02:45.680> what's<00:02:45.950> going<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.130> hold<00:02:46.310> it

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
rocket this is what's going to hold it

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.140 
rocket this is what's going to hold it
all<00:02:46.580> together

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
all together

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.509 
all together
get<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:47.720> on<00:02:47.840> there<00:02:48.019> nice<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.380> tight<00:02:48.620> make<00:02:49.489> sure

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
get it on there nice and tight make sure

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.180 
get it on there nice and tight make sure
it<00:02:49.880> will<00:02:50.090> pull<00:02:50.300> apart<00:02:50.420> and<00:02:50.900> slide<00:02:51.530> easily<00:02:52.069> on

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
it will pull apart and slide easily on

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.720 
it will pull apart and slide easily on
that<00:02:52.600> PVC<00:02:53.600> pipe<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.170> there<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.130> go<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.370> have

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
that PVC pipe and there you go you have

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.000 
that PVC pipe and there you go you have
a<00:02:55.790> completed<00:02:56.360> rocket<00:02:57.080> body<00:02:57.319> and<00:02:57.620> you're<00:02:57.769> ready

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
a completed rocket body and you're ready

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.420 
a completed rocket body and you're ready
for<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.880> next<00:02:58.910> steps
