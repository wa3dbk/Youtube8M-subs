short<00:00:40.230> video<00:00:41.070> clips<00:00:41.340> already<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:43.020> can't

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
short video clips already in I can't

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.639 
short video clips already in I can't
drive<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.340> don't<00:00:44.700> need<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.660> them<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.289> my

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
drive so I don't need to have them on my

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.900 
drive so I don't need to have them on my
iPad<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.690> think<00:00:49.020> 64<00:00:49.860> gigabyte<00:00:50.280> will<00:00:50.700> be

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
iPad so I think 64 gigabyte will be

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.970 
iPad so I think 64 gigabyte will be
enough<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.629> me<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.350> also<00:00:52.680> tried<00:00:52.739> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
enough for me and I have also tried a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.819 
enough for me and I have also tried a
new<00:00:53.340> instant<00:00:54.059> hotspot<00:00:54.570> feature<00:00:54.840> for<00:00:55.350> over<00:00:55.770> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
new instant hotspot feature for over a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.689 
new instant hotspot feature for over a
week<00:00:56.070> now<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:57.690> don't<00:00:58.050> think<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.370> good

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
week now and I don't think it's so good

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.760 
week now and I don't think it's so good
really<00:00:59.730> it<00:01:00.600> should<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:00.930> completely

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
really it should be completely

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.969 
really it should be completely
automatically<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.840> almost<00:01:04.320> is

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
automatically and it almost is

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.270 
automatically and it almost is
completely<00:01:05.939> automatically<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.409> still<00:01:07.799> have

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
completely automatically you still have

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.130 
completely automatically you still have
to<00:01:08.580> choose<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:10.380> iphone<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.659> vivir<00:01:12.659> network

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
to choose the iphone as a vivir network

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.539 
to choose the iphone as a vivir network
on<00:01:13.409> your<00:01:13.619> iPad<00:01:14.280> every<00:01:15.090> time<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.689> want<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.110> use

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
internet and that is kind of awkward to

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.429 
internet and that is kind of awkward to
me<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.030> another<00:01:21.540> thing<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.080> don't<00:01:22.200> like

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439

the<00:01:42.990> instant<00:01:43.439> hotspot<00:01:43.920> feature<00:01:44.149> then<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.479> can't

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
the instant hotspot feature then I can't

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.130 
the instant hotspot feature then I can't
do<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.790> battery<00:01:48.390> life<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
do that because the battery life on the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.580 
do that because the battery life on the
iphone<00:01:49.860> isn't<00:01:50.280> enough<00:01:50.790> for<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.570> complete<00:01:52.290> day

when using the instant hotspot feature

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.510 
when using the instant hotspot feature
so<00:01:56.009> i<00:01:56.040> need<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.200> ipads<00:01:58.219> battery<00:01:59.219> only

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
so i need to have the ipads battery only

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.620 
so i need to have the ipads battery only
when<00:01:59.969> using<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.780> that's<00:02:01.649> why<00:02:01.920> i<00:02:02.520> choose<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
when using it so that's why i choose the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.530 
when using it so that's why i choose the
LTE<00:02:04.079> version<00:02:04.409> instead<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.399> only<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.119> deep

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
LTE version instead of only the deep

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.290 
LTE version instead of only the deep
emotion<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.350> using<00:02:08.039> instant<00:02:08.670> hotspot

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
emotion and using instant hotspot

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.530 
emotion and using instant hotspot
feature<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:10.140> there<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.709> go<00:02:10.970> let's<00:02:11.970> see<00:02:12.180> when<00:02:12.390> I
