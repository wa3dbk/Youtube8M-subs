00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello I have a new video for today 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.359
 you and my makeup routine for 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.280
 this colder season now for 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.019
 the autumn and for the winter what I like 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.190
 Use everything I notice what I do 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.900
 is important and so on 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.730
 I have filmed this for you in the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.049
 principle, but this is now come out 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.060
 I hope you enjoy the video 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.410
 interested and you like and me 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.410
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.110
 in the make-up motifs i start in winter 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.640
 always with the day cream on 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.230
 and then I take one from barea 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.340
 which is for normal and mixed skin and 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.199
 I like the ones for the cold season 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.059
 really like the skin 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.980
 good with moisture and cares 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.120
 besides, she smells really good and me 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.519
 just have the feeling that it is one 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.290
 good basis is for my makeup and 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.300
 then I use my eyes cream 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.530
 that it's the baby moore I do 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.239
 learn now then I buy myself 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.790
 again that of valea I know 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.500
 that this costs five euros and the 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.360
 another about 2 and that about 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.530
 has done the same effect and then 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.060
 I knock the one in and then it can 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.619
 actually start right now 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.300
 with the make-up I use make up 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.950
 not because my skin is insane 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.420
 insanely bad but simple 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.090
 because I do not like that redness 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.050
 I just want to do that 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.910
 like to cover 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.100
 the make-up that I do in winter very much 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.020
 like to use is from manhattan case and 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.250
 that is this network make up it is 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.170
 in the brightest colors even has 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.729
 sun protection factor you see that is very 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.530
 fluid and that's how it feels 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.970
 the skin is so easy on her 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.070
 does not really feel like her makeup 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.050
 On top of that it has also supplied the skin 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.479
 moisture and does not clap just 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.130
 but it covers all the same 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.470
 redness that forms due to the cold 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.630
 From and I like that very much that you 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.520
 then, of course , lets it out 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.020
 also work well and I like 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.849
 the smell of it so I'm with it 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.849
 I have to say completely satisfied 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.570
 which then of course not missing 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.460
 may concealer is this is the one of 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.479
 Maybelline's fit with concealer in the 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.460
 color 15 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.470
 he is almost empty because of that too 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.000
 so I smeared it looks born 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.880
 just a little something on mine 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.170
 finger and then knock it directly 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.480
 one that i use now in winter 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.040
 not my makeup anymore but it does 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.660
 really right with my finger when I am 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.400
 The feeling is that it makes it easy 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.400
 the highest thinker tells power because 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.940
 not a tool, so to speak, the product 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.940
 can swallow 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.780
 to fix my make-up and mine 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.140
 I then use my skin mark 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.730
 I've got steak powder from Rimmel 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.170
 So acers orders if you are 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.310
 at grimma you can now wonder in 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.960
 I do not believe Germany anymore 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.670
 get 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.160
 but you can order that there and 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.780
 then I just tap it everywhere 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.940
 my skin on even under my eyes 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.280
 and in my eyes and then it goes 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.900
 continue to use eyebrows 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.660
 I showed that like that already 1000 times 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.010
 albert eyeshadow quattro and take 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.020
 for the front part of my 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.880
 eyebrow burned this lighter and 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.040
 for the rear part the darker one 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.180
 do brown and then I'll comb them first 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.520
 times through with it the hair in the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.780
 desired position and drive then 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.210
 my eyebrows with this 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.930
 beveled a small brush is it 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.190
 in principle, simply look for the good 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.930
 eyeshadow or on brown brother 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.060
 that you can just do it with your finger 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.050
 what can mend if you somehow 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.050
 be not quite satisfied 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.560
 and of course that's all 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.180
 I always say that I am fixated 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.769
 Hair spray on this acts a little brush 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.810
 and then it was just through and through 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.370
 I'll put hair spray on mine, so to speak 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.230
 eyebrows and that really holds up better 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.659
 as every eyebrow gill and the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.769
 complete day and yes I like this one 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.900
 very much like to be trick then 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.640
 eyebrows finished i wish me then 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.530
 always the make up of the lips because 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.599
 I do not like that at all and 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.540
 dry out and then use of 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.579
 carmax this pomegranate care stick 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.310
 so to speak, I also ordered from us 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.360
 and it smells so wonderfully good 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.920
 you can not always imagine 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.019
 if I unpack that I will always 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.579
 immediately addressed and then goes 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.170
 it continues with my eyes in my eyes 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.000
 Of course, make-up always varies 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.310
 which I am always used 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.959
 my in high executive of eyeshadow 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.639
 is from an essens led but you can 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.260
 then, of course, any other 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.180
 take the somehow silver shimmers 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.859
 and with that, hey, I'm just the one 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.360
 area under my eyebrows sometimes 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.280
 on the eyes in the middle depending on whether 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.990
 the make-up fits and what I actually do 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.789
 also like to do is mine 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.850
 natural lid fold with one 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:33.380
 to emphasize some light brown 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.639
 just dazzle with a dazzling brush 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.669
 I put that in the eye a little bit 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.050
 to give more depth and do that 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.400
 I actually make almost every eye make 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.200
 up fans no matter what I do so that 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.120
 Sometimes the lid fold becomes concrete 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.590
 I also like that only alone and 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.599
 then just when lashes eyelashes 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.650
 You see what eyelashes turn for 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.380
 I wanted to make a difference 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.729
 but like to demonstrate by still and 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.340
 then I do my eyelashes with the 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:58.400
 patrice bed-in for lashes waterproof 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.810
 mascara keeps the momentum easy 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.880
 most beautiful so I'm really 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.710
 I like to make up for it 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.690
 waterproof mascara not so 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.610
 but I think the effect is that 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.919
 simply makes wondering wonderful 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.120
 but I only use it above because below 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.700
 that's way too difficult for me 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.919
 then I am then another 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.870
 one of maybelline 's colossi 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.880
 low volume express oscar old for that 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.010
 actually brush well enough 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.930
 that you get off to a good start and then 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.220
 I'm with the shower and in principle 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.630
 the whole eye make-up already 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.370
 finished and it can go on with the 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.930
 Banks take a glass of the drugstore 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.820
 i really like it from patrice's 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.070
 color rolls royce now I have though 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.020
 from zuewa get a package sent 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.940
 with the new look scale blanches and 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.910
 use the color last laugh here now 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.530
 that is a 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.150
 soon to do with golden shimmer and me 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.820
 think the madder should be beautiful 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.410
 that was on I was just like that and 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.670
 I had to try it right away 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.140
 now in the last days with around 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.820
 I tried and wanted it now 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.470
 just like to demonstrate 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.290
 You see, that gives such a nice 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.940
 such a nice touch of color I 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.040
 then still love to give this 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.930
 office be cool with this pink over the 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.000
 is the color gentle touch and that 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.830
 together just gives one such a 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.760
 Fresh color and I like that crazy 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.070
 So that's the end of it 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.390
 super beautiful blend and then what 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.460
 me of course very important 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.890
 is nice and fresh and of course 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.470
 then i still use my macbook and 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.300
 dream sample I link to you 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.580
 link to it in the info as you that 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.070
 We could have gotten it again 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.490
 so final the concealer under mine 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.920
 eyes 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.720
 I have the feeling that lends his 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.880
 smoothing effect under the eyes is not 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.020
 and I really like that and like you 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.820
 If I look through my hair 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.120
 wash the means through which I finished 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.400
 am 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.700
 That's the finished make-up routine 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.790
 and I'm so happy I have to 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.790
 say 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.509
 like that and that was it again with the 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.060
 video as I said the eyes make up the 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:50.440
 changed about every day and has 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.300
 I also what they wear on the lips 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.740
 I also do not apply because in the 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.780
 That is always the principle 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.909
 different but that's the way it is 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.580
 basic thing I actually almost everyone 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:02.289
 day and I am so actually 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.120
 I'm just happy with that 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:05.560
 get it now is something 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.970
 what the pores a bit
