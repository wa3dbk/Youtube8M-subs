00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740 

I<00:00:00.149> thought<00:00:01.020> this<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.230> a<00:00:01.380> chicken<00:00:02.370> Desiree<00:00:02.750> so

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
I thought this is a chicken Desiree so

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.050 
I thought this is a chicken Desiree so
in<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.049> lesson<00:00:04.560> we<00:00:05.549> are<00:00:05.580> going<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.940> learn

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
in this lesson we are going to learn

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.870 
in this lesson we are going to learn
about<00:00:06.710> so<00:00:07.710> how<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:08.480> generate<00:00:09.480> an<00:00:10.380> array<00:00:10.710> of

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880 
about so how to generate an array of

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.020 
about so how to generate an array of
sorry<00:00:11.880> how<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.090> generate<00:00:12.480> 100<00:00:13.049> random<00:00:13.500> numbers

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
sorry how to generate 100 random numbers

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.540 
sorry how to generate 100 random numbers
and<00:00:15.030> store<00:00:15.330> them<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.570> an<00:00:16.020> array<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.619> print

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
and store them in an array and print

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.300 
and store them in an array and print
them<00:00:17.850> back<00:00:18.180> okay<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:18.990> using<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.470> with<00:00:20.250> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
them back okay so using the with the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.390 
them back okay so using the with the
help<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.580> for<00:00:20.880> loop<00:00:21.029> okay<00:00:22.010> so<00:00:23.010> let<00:00:23.160> me<00:00:23.189> launch

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
help of for loop okay so let me launch

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.050 
help of for loop okay so let me launch
the<00:00:23.670> ID<00:00:25.070> so<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.099> know<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:26.580> are<00:00:26.640> using<00:00:26.789> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the ID so we know that we are using a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.929 
the ID so we know that we are using a
visual<00:00:27.480> studio<00:00:27.779> 2013<00:00:28.260> X<00:00:28.619> +4<00:00:28.949> Window<00:00:29.189> System<00:00:29.369> so

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
visual studio 2013 X +4 Window System so

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.330 
visual studio 2013 X +4 Window System so
already<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.449> have<00:00:30.720> created<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.740> position<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
already I have created a position to the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.790 
already I have created a position to the
name<00:00:32.600> theory<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.719> random<00:00:33.930> numbers<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.380> it

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
name theory of random numbers and it

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.930 
name theory of random numbers and it
causes<00:00:35.070> nothing<00:00:35.460> but<00:00:35.809> y<00:00:36.809> n<00:00:36.870> dot<00:00:37.110> CP<00:00:37.559> 0<00:00:38.399> c5

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
causes nothing but y n dot CP 0 c5

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.360 
causes nothing but y n dot CP 0 c5
so<00:00:39.780> let<00:00:39.899> me<00:00:40.020> add<00:00:40.140> all<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.469> basic<00:00:41.160> stuff<00:00:41.309> like

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
so let me add all the basic stuff like

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.670 
so let me add all the basic stuff like
header<00:00:41.940> files<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.260> forth<00:00:43.500> so

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
header files and so on and so forth so

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.560 
header files and so on and so forth so
ever<00:00:44.309> files<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.789> first<00:00:44.969> half<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.329> is

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
ever files the first half of that is

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.410 
ever files the first half of that is
going<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.989> es<00:00:46.170> tuyo<00:00:46.320> range<00:00:47.090> which<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.149> very

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
going to the es tuyo range which is very

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.639 
going to the es tuyo range which is very
quite<00:00:48.690> common<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:52.170> hash<00:00:52.350> include<00:00:52.739> Konya<00:00:53.610> rich

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.470 

so<00:00:58.649> let<00:00:58.800> me<00:00:58.949> add<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.219> main<00:00:59.370> function<00:00:59.730> joins

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
so let me add the main function joins

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:11.960 
so let me add the main function joins
main<00:01:07.250> returns<00:01:08.250> 0<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:09.810> all<00:01:09.840> these<00:01:10.260> things<00:01:10.970> comes

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
main returns 0 so all these things comes

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.840 
main returns 0 so all these things comes
under<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.479> standards<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.560> coding<00:01:14.340> going<00:01:14.729> to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
under the standards of coding going to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.020 
under the standards of coding going to
the<00:01:14.909> ansi<00:01:15.270> standard<00:01:15.659> okay<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:17.100> now<00:01:17.250> here<00:01:17.909> our

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the ansi standard okay so now here our

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.789 
the ansi standard okay so now here our
intention<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.780> let's<00:01:19.110> put<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
intention is to have let's put it in a

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.190 
intention is to have let's put it in a
comment<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.930> very<00:01:22.080> beginning

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
comment here the very beginning

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.999 
comment here the very beginning
generating<00:01:25.200> random<00:01:25.380> numbers<00:01:28.009> generating

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
generating random numbers generating

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.880 
generating random numbers generating
random<00:01:29.130> numbers<00:01:32.180> storing<00:01:33.180> them<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:35.150> an<00:01:36.150> array

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
random numbers storing them in an array

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.060 
random numbers storing them in an array
okay<00:01:37.909> using<00:01:38.909> four<00:01:39.570> okay<00:01:39.990> then<00:01:40.650> storing<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
okay using four okay then storing the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.149 
okay using four okay then storing the
million<00:01:41.310> array<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.700> using<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.200> okay<00:01:43.200> so

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
million array and using that okay so

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.460 
million array and using that okay so
here<00:01:44.340> our<00:01:44.850> intention<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.570> generate<00:01:45.960> random

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
here our intention is to generate random

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.100 
here our intention is to generate random
numbers<00:01:46.649> using<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.700> rank<00:01:47.880> function<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.509> then

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
numbers using the rank function and then

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.060 
numbers using the rank function and then
store<00:01:49.439> those<00:01:49.740> 100<00:01:50.399> numbers<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.970> into<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
store those 100 numbers in into a

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.069 
store those 100 numbers in into a
integer<00:01:53.070> array<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.700> then<00:01:54.299> print<00:01:54.659> them<00:01:54.810> back

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
integer array and then print them back

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.590 
integer array and then print them back
so<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.399> first<00:01:56.729> let<00:01:57.030> us<00:01:57.090> take<00:01:57.240> an<00:01:57.420> array

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
so to do that first let us take an array

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.550 
so to do that first let us take an array
here<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.590> let's<00:01:58.740> say<00:01:58.950> array<00:01:59.399> is<00:02:00.290> at<00:02:01.290> stake

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
here so let's say array is at stake

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.350 
here so let's say array is at stake
since<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.189> have<00:02:02.280> intended<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.759> stew<00:02:02.939> 100

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
since we have intended to stew 100

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.270 
since we have intended to stew 100
random<00:02:03.990> numbers<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.500> since<00:02:04.740> we<00:02:04.890> need<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.100> take

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
random numbers so since we need to take

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.789 
random numbers so since we need to take
here<00:02:05.490> there<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.119> away<00:02:06.659> individual<00:02:07.320> memory<00:02:07.649> of

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
here there and away individual memory of

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.130 
here there and away individual memory of
hundred<00:02:08.369> numbers<00:02:08.670> here<00:02:08.849> okay<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.780> then<00:02:09.959> let's

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
hundred numbers here okay so then let's

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.540 
hundred numbers here okay so then let's
take<00:02:10.500> another<00:02:10.619> dummy<00:02:11.400> variable<00:02:11.879> let's<00:02:12.360> say<00:02:12.420> I

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
take another dummy variable let's say I

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.700 
take another dummy variable let's say I
and<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.910> loop<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:15.140> for<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.440> one<00:02:15.620> who

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
and the loop so for the one who

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.710 
and the loop so for the one who
purposely<00:02:16.130> okay<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:17.030> now<00:02:17.210> I'm<00:02:17.330> taking<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
purposely okay so now I'm taking the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.200 
purposely okay so now I'm taking the
problem<00:02:18.020> here<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.650> use<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:18.920> for<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.130> zero<00:02:19.340> so

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
problem here so I use it for the zero so

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.030 
problem here so I use it for the zero so
I<00:02:20.240> understand<00:02:20.780> like<00:02:22.150> so<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.210> understand<00:02:24.040> 108

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
I understand like so I understand 108

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.940 
I understand like so I understand 108
plus<00:02:25.190> plus<00:02:25.490> three<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.960> inside<00:02:27.290> this<00:02:27.470> loop<00:02:27.680> what

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
plus plus three so inside this loop what

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.160 
plus plus three so inside this loop what
I'm<00:02:28.040> going<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.340> do<00:02:28.460> is<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.540> use<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.960> rand

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
I'm going to do is so I use the rand

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.260 
I'm going to do is so I use the rand
function<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.800> every<00:02:31.100> generator<00:02:31.940> random

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
function and every generator random

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.590 
function and every generator random
numbers<00:02:32.540> simultaneously<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:33.530> store<00:02:34.310> that

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
numbers simultaneously and store that

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.670 
numbers simultaneously and store that
random<00:02:35.600> number<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:36.680> know<00:02:36.830> every<00:02:37.220> name<00:02:38.000> yeah

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
random number you know every name yeah

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.050 
random number you know every name yeah
so<00:02:39.680> let's<00:02:39.830> say<00:02:39.980> ARR<00:02:40.580> of<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:42.590> equal<00:02:42.770> to<00:02:43.210> R<00:02:44.210> and

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
so let's say ARR of I is equal to R and

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.380 
so let's say ARR of I is equal to R and
percentage<00:02:48.490> hundred<00:02:49.490> weight

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
percentage hundred weight

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.470 
percentage hundred weight
so<00:02:50.990> here<00:02:51.490> orientation<00:02:52.490> is<00:02:52.550> also<00:02:52.670> generate<00:02:53.390> the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
so here orientation is also generate the

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.180 
so here orientation is also generate the
random<00:02:53.600> numbers<00:02:54.050> between<00:02:54.320> one<00:02:54.800> two<00:02:54.920> hundred

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
random numbers between one two hundred

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.950 
random numbers between one two hundred
year<00:02:55.280> okay<00:02:55.460> so<00:02:55.610> generating<00:02:56.390> random<00:02:56.540> number

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
year okay so generating random number

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.480 
year okay so generating random number
starts<00:02:57.230> sweating<00:02:57.440> in<00:02:57.650> put<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:57.980> in<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.160> comment

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
starts sweating in put it in the comment

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.490 
starts sweating in put it in the comment
itself<00:02:58.580> during<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.600> random<00:02:59.870> numbers<00:03:00.200> in<00:03:00.410> the

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
itself during the random numbers in the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.010 
itself during the random numbers in the
brackets<00:03:00.860> if<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.070> say<00:03:01.220> one<00:03:01.460> two<00:03:01.670> hundred<00:03:02.210> so

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
brackets if you say one two hundred so

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.320 
brackets if you say one two hundred so
the<00:03:03.680> last<00:03:03.830> previous<00:03:04.190> couple<00:03:04.820> of<00:03:04.880> lessons<00:03:05.060> we

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
the last previous couple of lessons we

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.390 
the last previous couple of lessons we
have<00:03:05.360> learned<00:03:05.480> how<00:03:05.840> to<00:03:05.870> control<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.800> generate

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
have learned how to control the generate

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.860 
have learned how to control the generate
a<00:03:07.430> random<00:03:07.610> number<00:03:07.790> within<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.300> specific<00:03:08.480> range

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
a random number within a specific range

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.030 
a random number within a specific range
by<00:03:09.110> using<00:03:09.260> this<00:03:09.970> percentage<00:03:11.290> 100<00:03:12.290> this<00:03:12.650> syntax

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
by using this percentage 100 this syntax

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.680 
by using this percentage 100 this syntax
here<00:03:13.130> okay<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:13.580> what<00:03:13.850> happens<00:03:14.150> is<00:03:14.240> as<00:03:14.420> far<00:03:14.600> as

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
here okay so what happens is as far as

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.710 
here okay so what happens is as far as
the<00:03:14.840> random<00:03:15.020> number<00:03:15.410> gets<00:03:16.340> generated

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
the random number gets generated

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.110 
the random number gets generated
automatically<00:03:17.720> it<00:03:18.010> falls<00:03:19.010> onto<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.430> this

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
automatically it falls onto the this

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.550 
automatically it falls onto the this
specific<00:03:20.570> range<00:03:20.870> if<00:03:21.140> you<00:03:21.260> use<00:03:21.380> this

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
specific range if you use this

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.590 
specific range if you use this
percentage<00:03:22.070> funnel<00:03:22.340> here<00:03:22.430> K<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:23.209> what<00:03:23.300> happens

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
percentage funnel here K so what happens

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.910 
percentage funnel here K so what happens
that<00:03:24.020> this<00:03:24.410> rule<00:03:24.680> this<00:03:25.010> loop<00:03:25.310> runs<00:03:25.790> entirely

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
that this rule this loop runs entirely

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.030 
that this rule this loop runs entirely
and<00:03:27.920> stores<00:03:28.370> over<00:03:29.050> random<00:03:30.050> and<00:03:30.470> store<00:03:30.709> so<00:03:30.890> none

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
and stores over random and store so none

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.830 
and stores over random and store so none
of<00:03:31.160> them<00:03:31.280> was<00:03:31.400> immediately<00:03:31.730> inside<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.360> for

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
of them was immediately inside the for

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.660 
of them was immediately inside the for
loop<00:03:32.870> here<00:03:33.080> okay<00:03:33.290> let's<00:03:34.010> take<00:03:34.160> another<00:03:34.430> for

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
loop here okay let's take another for

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.640 
loop here okay let's take another for
loop<00:03:34.820> to<00:03:35.030> make<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.690> code<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:36.110> bit<00:03:36.260> clearer

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
loop to make the code a bit clearer

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.380 
loop to make the code a bit clearer
let's<00:03:37.340> take<00:03:37.520> another<00:03:37.610> loop<00:03:38.030> here

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
let's take another loop here

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.229 
let's take another loop here
that's<00:03:38.570> it<00:03:38.750> for<00:03:38.989> I<00:03:39.200> is<00:03:40.160> equal<00:03:40.190> to<00:03:40.489> zero<00:03:40.730> so<00:03:41.209> I

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
that's it for I is equal to zero so I

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.190 
that's it for I is equal to zero so I
understand<00:03:41.810> that<00:03:42.530> once<00:03:42.739> again<00:03:42.920> and<00:03:43.430> I<00:03:44.300> plus

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
understand that once again and I plus

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.670 
understand that once again and I plus
place<00:03:45.910> right<00:03:46.910> so<00:03:47.120> if<00:03:48.020> you<00:03:48.110> say<00:03:48.260> something<00:03:48.290> like

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
place right so if you say something like

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.949 
place right so if you say something like
this<00:03:48.770> operator<00:03:51.130> percent<00:03:52.130> H<00:03:52.720> suppose<00:03:53.720> engage

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
this operator percent H suppose engage

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.690 
this operator percent H suppose engage
so<00:03:54.590> let's<00:03:54.830> say<00:03:55.010> error<00:03:55.760> of<00:03:56.570> percentage<00:03:57.200> D<00:03:57.739> so

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
so let's say error of percentage D so

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.780 
so let's say error of percentage D so
let's<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:59.570> keep<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.410> message<00:04:00.739> a<00:04:01.040> bit<00:04:01.280> clearer

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
let's to keep the message a bit clearer

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.930 
let's to keep the message a bit clearer
okay<00:04:02.300> so<00:04:02.660> error<00:04:02.900> of<00:04:03.110> percentage<00:04:03.590> D<00:04:03.980> is<00:04:04.610> equal

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
okay so error of percentage D is equal

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.920 
okay so error of percentage D is equal
to<00:04:04.970> 4<00:04:05.270> H<00:04:06.110> D<00:04:06.380> okay

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
to 4 H D okay

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:15.790 
to 4 H D okay
now<00:04:08.930> I<00:04:09.550> come<00:04:10.550> on<00:04:12.340> okay<00:04:14.410> so<00:04:15.410> here<00:04:15.590> what<00:04:15.769> happens

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
now I come on okay so here what happens

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.520 
now I come on okay so here what happens
if<00:04:16.220> you<00:04:16.280> see<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.519> output<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:16.850> get<00:04:17.030> more<00:04:17.530> clear

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
if you see the output you get more clear

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.770 
if you see the output you get more clear
picture<00:04:18.769> here<00:04:19.340> okay<00:04:19.580> so<00:04:19.790> I<00:04:20.269> am<00:04:20.390> just<00:04:20.419> writing

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
picture here okay so I am just writing

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.030 
picture here okay so I am just writing
the<00:04:20.959> program

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
the program

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.660 
the program
okay<00:04:24.220> so<00:04:25.090> if<00:04:25.240> you'll<00:04:25.420> see<00:04:25.570> observed<00:04:25.930> output

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
okay so if you'll see observed output

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.850 
okay so if you'll see observed output
code<00:04:27.670> generated<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.990> array<00:04:29.320> of<00:04:29.500> random

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
code generated the array of random

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.580 
code generated the array of random
numbers<00:04:30.160> starting<00:04:30.460> from<00:04:30.580> zero<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:32.020> ninety<00:04:32.290> 90

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
numbers starting from zero to ninety 90

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.200 
numbers starting from zero to ninety 90
okay<00:04:32.710> so<00:04:33.100> last<00:04:33.310> random<00:04:33.610> number<00:04:33.880> of<00:04:33.970> gets

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
okay so last random number of gets

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.440 
okay so last random number of gets
generated<00:04:34.480> is<00:04:34.810> 91<00:04:35.670> so<00:04:36.670> in<00:04:36.820> between<00:04:37.090> all<00:04:37.270> you

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
generated is 91 so in between all you

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.170 
generated is 91 so in between all you
have<00:04:37.690> each<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:38.620> every<00:04:38.800> for<00:04:39.550> each<00:04:39.790> and<00:04:40.000> every

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
have each and every for each and every

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.060 
have each and every for each and every
index<00:04:40.600> of<00:04:40.930> an<00:04:41.140> array<00:04:41.170> you<00:04:41.470> have<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:41.890> random

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
index of an array you have a random

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.940 
index of an array you have a random
number<00:04:42.310> chocolate<00:04:42.820> okay<00:04:43.270> so<00:04:43.750> as<00:04:44.590> soon<00:04:44.740> as<00:04:44.830> the

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
number chocolate okay so as soon as the

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.560 
number chocolate okay so as soon as the
random<00:04:45.220> number<00:04:45.460> gets<00:04:45.730> generated<00:04:45.970> if<00:04:46.300> we<00:04:46.390> go<00:04:46.510> to

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
random number gets generated if we go to

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
random number gets generated if we go to
the<00:04:46.720> program<00:04:47.880> so<00:04:48.880> go<00:04:49.060> to<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.210> program<00:04:49.590> safe

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
the program so go to the program safe

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.890 
the program so go to the program safe
zone<00:04:50.980> here<00:04:51.250> so<00:04:51.970> as<00:04:52.120> soon<00:04:52.240> as<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:52.570> generate<00:04:52.840> a

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
zone here so as soon as you generate a

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.420 
zone here so as soon as you generate a
random<00:04:53.020> number<00:04:53.260> using<00:04:53.590> this<00:04:53.710> function

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
random number using this function

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.540 
random number using this function
automatically<00:04:55.320> curbstone<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.500> rains<00:04:56.680> to<00:04:56.950> 100

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
automatically curbstone the rains to 100

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.340 
automatically curbstone the rains to 100
and<00:04:57.790> its<00:04:58.000> course<00:04:58.300> automatically<00:04:58.930> in<00:04:59.170> that

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
and its course automatically in that

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.800 
and its course automatically in that
array<00:04:59.680> in<00:04:59.890> particular<00:05:00.460> index<00:05:00.730> okay<00:05:01.120> so<00:05:01.630> for

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
array in particular index okay so for

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.990 
array in particular index okay so for
that<00:05:01.930> reason<00:05:01.990> we<00:05:02.380> have<00:05:02.410> so<00:05:03.190> for<00:05:03.340> area<00:05:03.610> of<00:05:03.700> zero

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
that reason we have so for area of zero

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.600 
that reason we have so for area of zero
we<00:05:04.120> have<00:05:04.150> a<00:05:04.990> random<00:05:05.710> number<00:05:06.010> and<00:05:06.040> then<00:05:06.400> we<00:05:06.490> have

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
we have a random number and then we have

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.520 
we have a random number and then we have
one<00:05:06.850> we<00:05:06.970> have<00:05:07.120> an<00:05:07.210> array<00:05:07.720> of<00:05:07.750> two<00:05:08.170> and<00:05:08.350> so<00:05:08.410> on

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
one we have an array of two and so on

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.980 
one we have an array of two and so on
and<00:05:08.740> so<00:05:08.830> forth<00:05:09.100> sloppy<00:05:09.520> we<00:05:10.090> have<00:05:10.270> obtained<00:05:10.780> in

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
and so forth sloppy we have obtained in

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.890 
and so forth sloppy we have obtained in
this<00:05:11.140> way<00:05:11.200> because<00:05:12.240> to<00:05:13.240> run<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.450> program<00:05:13.570> once

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
this way because to run the program once

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.750 
this way because to run the program once
again<00:05:14.110> so<00:05:14.740> we<00:05:14.860> have<00:05:15.010> obtained<00:05:15.370> in<00:05:15.490> this<00:05:15.640> way

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
again so we have obtained in this way

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.700 
again so we have obtained in this way
because<00:05:15.940> because<00:05:16.660> of<00:05:16.810> this<00:05:16.960> syntax<00:05:17.290> here<00:05:17.500> okay

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
because because of this syntax here okay

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.120 
because because of this syntax here okay
so<00:05:17.920> here<00:05:18.520> we<00:05:18.700> have<00:05:19.500> exactly<00:05:20.500> how<00:05:20.830> you<00:05:21.040> are

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
so here we have exactly how you are

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.510 
so here we have exactly how you are
going<00:05:21.370> to<00:05:21.480> print<00:05:22.480> the<00:05:23.440> random<00:05:23.770> number<00:05:24.040> in<00:05:24.460> that

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
going to print the random number in that

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.570 
going to print the random number in that
way<00:05:24.850> we<00:05:25.000> have<00:05:25.740> later<00:05:26.740> print<00:05:27.130> of<00:05:27.220> statement

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
way we have later print of statement

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.440 
way we have later print of statement
okay<00:05:27.730> so<00:05:28.390> in<00:05:28.600> this<00:05:28.720> way<00:05:28.900> you<00:05:28.960> can<00:05:29.230> generate<00:05:30.450> an

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
okay so in this way you can generate an

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.630 
okay so in this way you can generate an
array<00:05:31.750> of<00:05:31.780> random<00:05:32.290> numbers<00:05:32.620> and<00:05:32.650> store<00:05:33.370> them

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
array of random numbers and store them

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.500 
array of random numbers and store them
in<00:05:33.970> an<00:05:34.150> array<00:05:34.330> print<00:05:35.370> print<00:05:36.370> them<00:05:36.520> back<00:05:36.790> using

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
in an array print print them back using

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.260 
in an array print print them back using
your<00:05:37.860> for<00:05:38.860> okay<00:05:39.100> okay<00:05:39.310> so<00:05:39.910> see<00:05:40.030> in<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:40.180> next

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
your for okay okay so see in the next

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.260 
your for okay okay so see in the next
lesson<00:05:40.600> goodbye
