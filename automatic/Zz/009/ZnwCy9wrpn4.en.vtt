00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
people ask me about Thunderbolt port and

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.690 
people ask me about Thunderbolt port and
they<00:00:04.319> wanted<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.680> make<00:00:04.920> eclipse<00:00:05.339> about

Thunderbolt<00:00:22.609> Thunderbolt<00:00:23.609> ports<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.269> two

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
Thunderbolt Thunderbolt ports is two

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.900 
Thunderbolt Thunderbolt ports is two
times<00:00:24.990> faster<00:00:25.650> than<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.859> USB<00:00:26.869> 3.0<00:00:28.039> is<00:00:29.039> 12

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
times faster than the USB 3.0 is 12

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.290 
times faster than the USB 3.0 is 12
times<00:00:30.150> faster<00:00:30.689> than<00:00:30.720> five<00:00:31.050> words<00:00:31.260> 800<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.300> 20

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
times faster than five words 800 is 20

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.900 
times faster than five words 800 is 20
times<00:00:33.510> faster<00:00:33.780> than<00:00:34.230> USB<00:00:36.380> okay<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:38.640> allows

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
times faster than USB okay and it allows

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.500 
times faster than USB okay and it allows
us<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.210> transfer<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.680> conference<00:00:41.370> file<00:00:41.850> video

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
us to transfer the conference file video

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.130 
us to transfer the conference file video
file<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.140> your<00:00:43.320> display<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.600> might<00:00:45.899> be

like<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.240> instance<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.720> Apple<00:01:10.110> nice<00:01:10.280> trying

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
like for instance if Apple nice trying

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.429 
like for instance if Apple nice trying
to<00:01:11.340> make<00:01:11.460> some<00:01:11.520> stir<00:01:11.820> big<00:01:12.150> apples<00:01:12.840> regular

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
to make some stir big apples regular

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.660 
to make some stir big apples regular
display<00:01:13.799> cinema<00:01:14.460> display<00:01:14.820> screen<00:01:15.439> okay<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:17.369> i

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
display cinema display screen okay so i

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.480 
display cinema display screen okay so i
don't<00:01:18.420> think<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.840> existing<00:01:19.710> mini<00:01:19.830> display<00:01:20.220> is

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
don't think the existing mini display is

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.030 
don't think the existing mini display is
going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:20.880> powerful<00:01:21.420> enough<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:22.770> need

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
going to be powerful enough so we need

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.810 
going to be powerful enough so we need
to<00:01:23.340> Thunderbolt<00:01:24.650> ports<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.580> nothing

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
to Thunderbolt ports that it's nothing

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.649 
to Thunderbolt ports that it's nothing
but<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.689> problem<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:29.240> we<00:01:30.240> need<00:01:30.420> some

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
but the problem is we need some

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.490 
but the problem is we need some
collaborations<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.640> are<00:01:33.170> has<00:01:34.170> run

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
collaborations so if you are has run
