00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hi YouTube um I'll start off by saying

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.930 
hi YouTube um I'll start off by saying
that<00:00:04.020> I<00:00:04.049> didn't<00:00:04.410> always<00:00:04.620> look<00:00:05.130> like<00:00:05.190> I<00:00:05.400> do<00:00:05.580> now

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
that I didn't always look like I do now

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.570 
that I didn't always look like I do now
because<00:00:06.569> I'm<00:00:07.080> just<00:00:07.379> slightly<00:00:07.770> overweight<00:00:08.370> at

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
because I'm just slightly overweight at

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.690 
because I'm just slightly overweight at
this<00:00:08.760> point<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:10.010> didn't<00:00:11.010> even<00:00:11.040> look<00:00:11.340> like<00:00:11.400> this

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
this point I didn't even look like this

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.089 
this point I didn't even look like this
three<00:00:12.150> months<00:00:12.450> ago<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.870> was<00:00:13.290> skinny<00:00:13.559> up<00:00:13.769> until<00:00:14.070> I

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
three months ago I was skinny up until I

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.200 
three months ago I was skinny up until I
was<00:00:14.190> 12<00:00:15.089> or<00:00:15.450> 13<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:16.410> within<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.609> next<00:00:17.789> six

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
was 12 or 13 and within the next six

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.900 
was 12 or 13 and within the next six
years<00:00:18.330> or<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.170> guess<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.250> because<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.730> my

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
years or so I guess just because of my

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.279 
years or so I guess just because of my
puberty<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.840> just<00:00:22.800> gained<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.250> lot<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.460> weight<00:00:24.289> of

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
puberty I just gained a lot of weight of

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.960 
puberty I just gained a lot of weight of
course<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.710> saw<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.070> coming<00:00:26.550> because<00:00:26.789> my

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
course I saw this coming because my

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.779 
course I saw this coming because my
parents<00:00:27.240> are<00:00:27.480> pretty<00:00:27.869> overweight<00:00:28.410> but<00:00:29.400> still

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
parents are pretty overweight but still

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.640 
parents are pretty overweight but still
it's<00:00:30.090> just<00:00:30.359> unsettling<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:31.199> see<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> change

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650
