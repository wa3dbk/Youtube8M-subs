back<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.900> another<00:00:22.140> exciting<00:00:22.439> tutorial<00:00:22.980> today

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
back to another exciting tutorial today

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.310 
back to another exciting tutorial today
we<00:00:24.060> are<00:00:24.119> going<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.330> take<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> look<00:00:24.840> at<00:00:24.960> how<00:00:25.260> to

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
we are going to take a look at how to

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.070 
we are going to take a look at how to
make<00:00:25.590> your<00:00:25.949> water<00:00:26.220> level<00:00:26.490> indicator

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
make your water level indicator

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.720 
make your water level indicator
basically<00:00:28.080> what<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.380> does<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.130> indicates

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
basically what it does is it indicates

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.849 
basically what it does is it indicates
the<00:00:30.029> level<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.660> water<00:00:30.869> as<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.650> water

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the level of a water as the water

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.490 
the level of a water as the water
increases<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.360> before<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> start<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> tutorial

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
increases so before I start the tutorial

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.069 
increases so before I start the tutorial
I<00:00:35.010> want<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> say<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> very<00:00:35.700> big<00:00:36.000> thanks<00:00:36.570> for<00:00:36.870> one

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
upon the level water level you guys now

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.359 
upon the level water level you guys now
I<00:01:33.570> will<00:01:33.810> demonstrate<00:01:33.990> how<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.860> water<00:01:35.070> level

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
I will demonstrate how this water level

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.910 
I will demonstrate how this water level
indicator<00:01:35.700> works<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.900> do<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.530> need

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
indicator works to do that I just need

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.340 
indicator works to do that I just need
to<00:01:38.189> pour<00:01:38.400> some<00:01:38.579> water<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> water<00:01:39.450> jug<00:01:39.780> when

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
to pour some water on the water jug when

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.899 
to pour some water on the water jug when
I<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.070> water<00:01:41.310> level<00:01:41.670> will<00:01:41.880> be

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
I do that the water level will be

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.899 
I do that the water level will be
increased<00:01:42.210> due<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:44.250> LEDs<00:01:44.880> will

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
increased due to that the LEDs will

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.050 
increased due to that the LEDs will
start<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.630> blow<00:01:45.840> according<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.729> you

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
start to blow according to that so you

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:56.580 
start to blow according to that so you
just<00:01:48.360> see<00:01:48.540> now

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.870 

when<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.740> water<00:01:57.979> is<00:01:58.219> 1/4

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
when the water is 1/4

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.190 
when the water is 1/4
the<00:01:59.420> red<00:01:59.719> LED<00:01:59.930> starts<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.740> blow<00:02:05.049> when<00:02:06.049> the

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
the red LED starts to blow when the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.119 
the red LED starts to blow when the
water<00:02:06.439> rises<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:07.310> half<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.720> green<00:02:09.679> energy

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
water rises to half the green energy

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:16.210 
water rises to half the green energy
starts<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:10.640> grow<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:14.660> them<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.140> when<00:02:16.040> the

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
starts to grow and them and when the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.690 
starts to grow and them and when the
water<00:02:16.430> goes<00:02:16.760> 3/4<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:18.319> ellow<00:02:18.620> LED<00:02:19.130> starts<00:02:19.519> to

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
water goes 3/4 the ellow LED starts to

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.750 
water goes 3/4 the ellow LED starts to
glow<00:02:19.849> and<00:02:20.239> when<00:02:21.049> the<00:02:21.170> water<00:02:21.380> was<00:02:21.650> full<00:02:21.950> the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
glow and when the water was full the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.800 
glow and when the water was full the
bustle<00:02:23.120> starts<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.690> activate<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:26.150> guys<00:02:26.390> now<00:02:26.420> I

coming from the quadrille bilateral
switch<00:03:13.799> and<00:03:14.959> basically<00:03:15.959> how<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.409> works<00:03:16.439> is

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
switch and basically how it works is

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.319 
switch and basically how it works is
when<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.730> water<00:03:17.939> is<00:03:18.150> poured<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:19.140> 1/4<00:03:20.329> this

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
when the water is poured to 1/4 this

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.869 
when the water is poured to 1/4 this
wire<00:03:21.599> and<00:03:21.840> this<00:03:22.079> wire<00:03:22.140> is<00:03:22.500> connected<00:03:23.069> by<00:03:23.609> which

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
wire and this wire is connected by which

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.539 
wire and this wire is connected by which
this<00:03:24.269> LED<00:03:24.689> glows<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.290> when<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.310> water

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
this LED glows and when the water

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.339 
this LED glows and when the water
reaches<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.209> 1<00:03:28.700> 1/2<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:30.510> wire<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.049> this<00:03:31.290> wire

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
reaches to 1 1/2 this wire and this wire

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.830 
reaches to 1 1/2 this wire and this wire
gets<00:03:31.739> connected<00:03:32.069> by<00:03:32.609> which<00:03:32.819> this<00:03:33.180> LED<00:03:33.599> glows

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
gets connected by which this LED glows

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.369 
gets connected by which this LED glows
and<00:03:34.109> when<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.920> water<00:03:35.129> reaches<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:35.879> 3/4<00:03:36.420> this

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
and when the water reaches to 3/4 this

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.860 
and when the water reaches to 3/4 this
wire<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:38.129> this<00:03:38.370> wire<00:03:38.519> gets<00:03:38.909> conducted<00:03:39.209> by

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
wire and this wire gets conducted by

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.319 
wire and this wire gets conducted by
which<00:03:40.109> this<00:03:40.469> LED<00:03:40.920> glows<00:03:41.159> and<00:03:41.400> when<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.090> water

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
which this LED glows and when the water

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.690
