00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
the old girl I've got an opportunity to

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.330 
the old girl I've got an opportunity to
assess<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.200> damage<00:01:50.229> and<00:01:50.679> what<00:01:50.860> needs<00:01:51.069> to<00:01:51.159> be

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340

done<00:01:51.550> next<00:01:53.310> I'm<00:01:54.310> happy<00:01:54.640> with<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.850> motor<00:01:55.090> it's

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
done next I'm happy with the motor it's

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.120 
done next I'm happy with the motor it's
not<00:01:55.509> real<00:01:55.780> smooth<00:01:56.110> but<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.500> hasn't<00:01:56.830> even<00:01:56.920> been

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
not real smooth but it hasn't even been

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.070 
not real smooth but it hasn't even been
tuned<00:01:57.429> up<00:01:57.670> yet<00:01:57.940> so<00:01:58.179> once<00:01:58.330> I<00:01:58.479> get<00:01:58.539> it<00:01:58.750> tuned<00:01:58.899> up

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
tuned up yet so once I get it tuned up

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.260 
tuned up yet so once I get it tuned up
it'll<00:01:59.350> probably<00:01:59.530> work<00:01:59.800> better<00:02:00.250> right<00:02:01.090> at<00:02:01.179> the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
it'll probably work better right at the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.760 
it'll probably work better right at the
moment<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.659> won't<00:02:01.869> crank<00:02:02.170> unless<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.470> poor

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
moment it won't crank unless a poor

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.320 
moment it won't crank unless a poor
little<00:02:02.979> gas<00:02:03.130> down<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.520> carburetor<00:02:04.000> so

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
little gas down the carburetor so

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.359 
little gas down the carburetor so
obviously<00:02:05.049> some<00:02:05.350> corporation<00:02:06.009> different

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
obviously some corporation different

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.639 
obviously some corporation different
things<00:02:06.580> like<00:02:06.789> that<00:02:06.849> to<00:02:07.239> be<00:02:07.270> worked<00:02:08.140> out<00:02:08.319> there

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
things like that to be worked out there

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.190 
things like that to be worked out there
it<00:02:09.550> seemed<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:09.940> have<00:02:10.090> stayed<00:02:10.330> cool<00:02:10.569> enough<00:02:10.899> not

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
it seemed to have stayed cool enough not

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.630 
it seemed to have stayed cool enough not
that<00:02:11.319> I<00:02:11.349> went<00:02:11.560> all<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.830> far<00:02:12.099> but<00:02:12.250> that<00:02:12.340> seemed

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
that I went all that far but that seemed

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.229 
that I went all that far but that seemed
to<00:02:12.730> work<00:02:12.879> good<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:15.220> shifter<00:02:15.700> like<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.090> say

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
to work good the the shifter like I say

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.880 
to work good the the shifter like I say
this<00:02:16.420> little<00:02:16.660> thing<00:02:16.810> came<00:02:17.080> loose<00:02:17.379> I<00:02:17.530> tighten

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
this little thing came loose I tighten

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.040 
this little thing came loose I tighten
it<00:02:18.010> back<00:02:18.160> up<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.520> that's<00:02:18.670> good<00:02:19.050> battery

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
it back up and that's good battery

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.750 
it back up and that's good battery
doesn't<00:02:20.319> seem<00:02:20.440> like<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.770> has<00:02:20.890> enough<00:02:21.160> power<00:02:21.400> it

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
doesn't seem like it has enough power it

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.309 
doesn't seem like it has enough power it
might<00:02:21.970> be<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:22.569> batteries<00:02:22.989> not<00:02:23.140> any

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
might be that that batteries not any

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.410 
might be that that batteries not any
good<00:02:23.530> anyway<00:02:23.800> I<00:02:23.920> might<00:02:24.310> wind<00:02:24.849> up<00:02:25.060> having<00:02:25.239> to

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
good anyway I might wind up having to

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.580 
good anyway I might wind up having to
put<00:02:25.629> another<00:02:25.810> one<00:02:25.989> in<00:02:26.140> which<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.410> not<00:02:26.560> a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
put another one in which is not a

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.130 
put another one in which is not a
problem<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.970> only<00:02:28.180> real<00:02:28.330> problem<00:02:28.569> I<00:02:28.750> do<00:02:28.810> have

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
problem the only real problem I do have

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.610 
problem the only real problem I do have
it<00:02:29.290> this<00:02:29.410> one<00:02:29.590> right<00:02:29.770> here<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:31.540> spring<00:02:31.930> mount

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.520 
it this one right here this spring mount
broke<00:02:33.190> loose<00:02:33.660> it's<00:02:34.660> supposed<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.170> look<00:02:35.319> like

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
broke loose it's supposed to look like

the one over there and you can see the

the one over there and you can see the
springs<00:02:37.810> cocked<00:02:38.140> up<00:02:38.410> through<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.739> floor

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.610 
springs cocked up through the floor
kicking<00:02:39.370> my<00:02:39.519> seat<00:02:39.550> over<00:02:39.910> sideways<00:02:40.620> that's

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
kicking my seat over sideways that's

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.809 
kicking my seat over sideways that's
kind<00:02:41.830> of<00:02:41.890> interesting<00:02:42.069> to<00:02:42.400> me<00:02:42.430> because<00:02:42.580> this

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
kind of interesting to me because this

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.720 
kind of interesting to me because this
isn't<00:02:43.090> even<00:02:43.209> my<00:02:43.330> weld<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:44.050> figured<00:02:44.560> if<00:02:45.489> I<00:02:45.640> was

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
isn't even my weld I figured if I was

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.130 
isn't even my weld I figured if I was
going<00:02:45.849> to<00:02:45.910> break<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.090> weld<00:02:46.390> I'd<00:02:46.599> break<00:02:46.840> my<00:02:46.870> own

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
going to break a weld I'd break my own

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.619 
going to break a weld I'd break my own
the<00:02:47.260> oil<00:02:47.290> but<00:02:47.650> instead<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.940> other<00:02:49.150> guys<00:02:49.330> will

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
the oil but instead the other guys will

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.320 
the oil but instead the other guys will
broke<00:02:50.019> so<00:02:50.379> that's<00:02:51.250> not<00:02:51.430> so<00:02:51.580> bad<00:02:51.819> I<00:02:51.849> think<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.209> can

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
broke so that's not so bad I think I can

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.790 
broke so that's not so bad I think I can
kick<00:02:52.450> that<00:02:52.599> back<00:02:52.780> in<00:02:52.959> place<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.230> weld<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.709> up

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
kick that back in place and weld it up

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.619 
kick that back in place and weld it up
so<00:02:54.010> it'll<00:02:54.430> come<00:02:54.519> loose<00:02:54.760> again<00:02:55.090> but<00:02:55.300> I<00:02:55.330> will

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
so it'll come loose again but I will

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.750 
so it'll come loose again but I will
give<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:55.930> try<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.170> see<00:02:56.410> how<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:56.650> goes<00:02:56.680> if<00:02:57.519> not

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
give it a try and see how it goes if not

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.979 
give it a try and see how it goes if not
you<00:02:58.150> know<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.390> worst<00:02:58.510> thing<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:58.810> could

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
you know the worst thing that could

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.690 
you know the worst thing that could
happen<00:02:59.110> is<00:02:59.349> I'd<00:02:59.470> wind<00:02:59.709> up<00:02:59.860> redesigning<00:03:00.430> this

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
happen is I'd wind up redesigning this

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.320 
happen is I'd wind up redesigning this
rear<00:03:01.659> leaf<00:03:01.840> spring<00:03:02.200> setup<00:03:02.500> which<00:03:02.830> is<00:03:02.860> not<00:03:03.330> the

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
rear leaf spring setup which is not the

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.199 
rear leaf spring setup which is not the
end<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:04.599> the<00:03:04.659> world<00:03:04.870> it's<00:03:05.110> certainly<00:03:05.500> doable

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
end of the world it's certainly doable

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.610 
end of the world it's certainly doable
