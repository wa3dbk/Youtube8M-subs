00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.850
 until locally today I'm going 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.850
 to go up to a video 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.039
 overflights sea bream fishing 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.420
 classic sliding fitting so at 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:17.850
 level of the earth network you need 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:23.890
 a man went like this 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.830
 a pearl and so let's call a 30g lead 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.090
 I do not know what his name is 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.400
 that was running on the long and just wire 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.730
 his beautiful you also need a stocking of 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.300
 line 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.370
 two of them g and 80 and 2 meters 50 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.430
 queue that should be enough 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.420
 so to start you take the body 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:47.739
 of a the son that connect where he is so 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.440
 you put the plan on it so that's it 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.510
 so I have such a lot of times on his 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.920
 so dives find so small 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.230
 it's difficult to pass the thread 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.350
 and his backstage very badly me what I 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.540
 do I take my drill like that and 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.509
 I drill to enlarge a little bit 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.549
 so here I am already going to 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.950
 time but do not hesitate to do it 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.719
 know I will deal mostly loses 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.240
 rights 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:16.569
 so there you put son in the in 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:21.609
 the lead you take the pearl the same 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:25.319
 wanting to spin then you take named 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:29.829
 riom so you make a simple game 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:31.420
 you make you turn tell us done 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.200
 part of a dozen tours around the 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.200
 movie like that 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:47.960
 so that should be enough and you 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:50.299
 to loop again we are a little at peace 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:57.229
 the rest pray or leave about 5 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:02:00.350
 min but here's where the conduit is 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.659
 so does lead all this so how 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.090
 say the soul the period serves to block in 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.579
 makes the lead for one who take themselves 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.340
 in it would only touch that which is 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:13.730
 corner and all right now we're going 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.360
 pass at the end of the line so the part 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:21.380
 hung there so are you taking your 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.610
 a pestle like this you do but 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:30.130
 I only want you as I 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:30.130
 watch and hop do you the best 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.850
 ten rounds finally seems me I say ten 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.890
 turns I feel that I do not 5 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:50.890
 I am you and so to you 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:50.890
 but like you put a little 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.490
 you know very well 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:08.219
 you cut the extra cost of girls 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:09.599
 would have wanted cissac denim so is 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:12.420
 now we will make a loop 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:16.590
 the opposite the lan are on the bench the 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.879
 beds a loop infernal loop so 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.349
 you have a loop formed 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.450
 around vote must then do you 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.599
 you all pass you cotton friend vonn 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.669
 must he be a loop you 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.379
 vaudois and the loop that is around 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.480
 douala bout that you created at the beginning 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:36.319
 Well, you put it in the mud 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.480
 that you have around 22 years like that 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.579
 that's it and it's boring it's going great 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.379
 well it's very speed but me what I 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.560
 am m i'm doing a second generation 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.590
 will be second turn on I pass a 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.280
 second time 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.280
 that's it 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.100
 yes a little and the circuit 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.420
 there you can leave a little more 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.690
 you do my job I leave a 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:11.270
 just a little bit more so so 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:16.440
 now that your dinh ba and effect 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:21.150
 so you can re-read comprehensively your 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:26.700
 coordinates between the digital loop 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.260
 so that's it for sea bream 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.669
 high level of taxes you put a 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.919
 little bit of the squid of humor where it 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.290
 walking around at all to sea 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.530
 So here it all if it will make us 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.150
 other videos about sea fishing 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.640
 dismounting videos you will see 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.200
 unleashed videos also about fishing 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.560
 in the river all because I'm fishing in 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.280
 river 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.840
 so here is so do not hesitate if 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.750
 do you like this meteor video I like 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.950
 and subscribe then put 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.919
 comments under the surfaces of 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.020
 videos on the about certain methods of 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.760
 fishing I will try to make videos 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.760
 this is going
