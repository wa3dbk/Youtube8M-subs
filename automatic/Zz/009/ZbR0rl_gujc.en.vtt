00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.890
 hello I'll show you in this video a 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.930
 fantastic flexibility exercise 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.759
 for the back where we're also going 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.780
 to work the cross chains of 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.079
 legs and arms 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.440
 we really stretch practically everything 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:16.440
 the body 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.070
 and I said we stretched but really 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.480
 We are doing a job of 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.739
 mobilization of revitalization of 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.630
 flexibilization but not so much a 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.180
 stretching long in time 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.660
 maintained and prolonged because if you want 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.250
 see that you can find it by writing 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.010
 cross chain stretching without further 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.980
 this is going to be an alternation of that 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.350
 stretch for a few seconds towards 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.079
 each side is worth then we will perform 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.510
 the exercise in lying position mouth 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.729
 up we are going to place the arms in 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.920
 cross and I say the arms because they both go 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.689
 to work when we work each of 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.299
 your legs and let's start with 

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:04.510
 example with this side we are going to rotate the 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.280
 leg to take it there the arm has to 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.810
 leverage with the leg well 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.560
 You see that is not in the same direction 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.650
 is here or is here but exactly 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.900
 in the same direction then return to 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.300
 center you take air 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.780
 and by releasing the air to the address 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.780
 contrary 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:31.890
 and back to the center you take air 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.370
 and when releasing opposite direction 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.680
 you get air if you are going to repeat this 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.810
 perfectly 20-30 times yes and it's a 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.479
 exercise that you are going to work and 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.330
 make very flexible all 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.240
 lumbar muscles but also you go to 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.490
 pull alternating mind of the chain 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.550
 previous of the whole arm that you are 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.890
 working and from the side chain the 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.210
 outer chain of the entire leg that 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.460
 you are working at that moment is 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.130
 say here when we are on this side 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.009
 we are stretching this whole chain 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.420
 we are flexibilizing the and all this 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.060
 chain in addition to rotate and mobilize all 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.730
 the back to a fantastic fantastic 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.810
 fantastic exercise that will help you 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.970
 to relax to feel much more loose the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.459
 back if you further practice with 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.100
 clear frequency is this exercise 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.920
 you can combine it and enter it inside 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.040
 of a whole exercise routine that 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.670
 you can find where here in this you
