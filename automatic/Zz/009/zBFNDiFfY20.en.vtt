 a dispatcher a master and he does it very 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.900
 easy and does not escape if it is easy 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.400
 is that it sleeps tapas and is a table that 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.290

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.880
 Butter can do it 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.310

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.840
 outside to get you a room temperature 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.390
 more or less that you are very soft 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.650
 cells can not melt when used 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.769
 one matter you do something else 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.750
 completely the mind I do not know the reason 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.720
 of course yes 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.880
 thanks that we want to thaw the 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.090
 creams the only thing we do is that it 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.760
 separates the serum from the true fat of 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.340
 true that can work today in 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.390
 search for something down here in peanuts that 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.390
 Do you want peanut muñoz?

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.959
 sugar that the government go to the kitchen 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.870
 volcano meeting discounts the furnace the 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:27.610
 oven has to be an attack of 350 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.590
 degrees fahrenheit 180 senses is very 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.560
 funny and I told them the other day there 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.229
 kitchen companies that stoves them 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.229
 they put nothing else a temperature of 1 2 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:41.110
 3 4 and 5 to many housewives I have 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.450
 asked peanut what is that as well what 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.650
 decided on them but like 350 the 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.750
 medium temperature 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.669
 so I always recommend that 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.820
 put two and a half in these stoves 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.470
 intelligent are about 34 in mom 45 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.690
 they put them like that in the order is to put the 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.789
 temperature 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.860

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.810
 magnet very well then you have to look for 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.150
 You manage a storm to measure the 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.039
 average worker and mobiles the latter 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.110
 the minimum bis molds can 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:11.229
 buy in any store 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.060
 departmentally they sell us and the 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.620
 k corridors can sell them buy in 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.240
 the commodity stores when 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.050
 better also in those paper shops 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.930

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.849
 area of ​​molds there are many very many 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.099
 before these he has more metal 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.860
 there are those from there 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.780
 before they are flexible also if you see it 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.129
 they are good true clearly this is because of their 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.490
 little salt if you do not find the 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:36.610
