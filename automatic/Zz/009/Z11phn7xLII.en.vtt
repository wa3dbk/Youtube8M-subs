00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
yeah this is really significant it's now

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.770 
yeah this is really significant it's now

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.079 
the world's largest passenger jet

operating on the world's longest route I

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.299 
operating on the world's longest route I
caught<00:00:06.660> this<00:00:06.779> as<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.020> history<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.560> their

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
caught this as a history of their

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.850 
caught this as a history of their
driving<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.269> innovation<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:10.019> having<00:00:10.769> these

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
driving the innovation of having these

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.310 
driving the innovation of having these
very<00:00:11.070> long<00:00:11.280> sectors<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.509> we<00:00:12.690> think<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.290> a

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
very long sectors and we think this is a

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.129 
very long sectors and we think this is a
10%<00:00:13.679> growth<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.280> capacity<00:00:14.429> $2<00:00:15.389> it's<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.990> route

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
10% growth in capacity $2 it's a route

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.279 
10% growth in capacity $2 it's a route
we<00:00:16.289> only<00:00:16.410> started<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.070> 2011<00:00:17.840> with<00:00:18.840> more<00:00:19.080> than

we only started in 2011 with more than
double<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> size<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> route<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:20.699> that

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
double the size of the route in that

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.390 
double the size of the route in that
space<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.300> time<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:22.109> allows<00:00:22.320> us<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.710> fly<00:00:22.920> into

what's the North American market like at

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.000 
what's the North American market like at
the<00:00:36.600> moment<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:37.020> course<00:00:37.200> we're<00:00:37.350> seeing<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.680> US

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
the moment of course we're seeing the US

the moment of course we're seeing the US
economy<00:00:38.280> recover<00:00:38.910> quite<00:00:39.660> strongly<00:00:39.960> compared

economy recover quite strongly compared

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.720 
economy recover quite strongly compared
to<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> rest<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> world<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:41.460> we've<00:00:41.550> had

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
to the rest of the world but we've had

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.400 
to the rest of the world but we've had
impediments<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.750> guess<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.200> higher

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
impediments I guess with the higher

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.200 
impediments I guess with the higher
Australian<00:00:44.070> dollar<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.550> Australia

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
Australian dollar in Australia

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.819 
Australian dollar in Australia
I<00:00:45.239> guess<00:00:45.510> hasn't<00:00:45.840> been<00:00:45.960> as<00:00:46.140> an<00:00:46.289> attractive

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
I guess hasn't been as an attractive

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.639 
I guess hasn't been as an attractive
option<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.520> our<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:48.149> inbound<00:00:48.570> visitors<00:00:49.020> yes

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
option for our but inbound visitors yes

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.410 
option for our but inbound visitors yes

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.399 
lousy dollar is actually good for Qantas
one<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.970> encourages<00:01:39.570> less<00:01:39.840> foreign<00:01:40.110> carriers

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
one it encourages less foreign carriers

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.530 
one it encourages less foreign carriers
to<00:01:40.650> operate<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.280> here<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.939> closes<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
to operate in here it closes the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.359 
to operate in here it closes the
competitive<00:01:42.990> disadvantage<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.159> car

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
competitive disadvantage we have in car

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.850 
competitive disadvantage we have in car
space<00:01:44.700> against<00:01:45.450> those<00:01:45.540> competitive<00:01:46.110> carriers

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
space against those competitive carriers

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.039 
space against those competitive carriers
and<00:01:47.100> encourages<00:01:47.939> more<00:01:48.119> Australians<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.869> stay

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
and encourages more Australians to stay

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.319 
and encourages more Australians to stay
at<00:01:49.170> home<00:01:49.320> which<00:01:49.920> because<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.430> 65<00:01:50.880> percent

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
at home which because we have 65 percent

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.630 
at home which because we have 65 percent
of<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.140> Australian<00:01:52.619> market<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.310> mean

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
of the of the Australian market I mean

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.370 
of the of the Australian market I mean
so<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:53.909> get<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.240> proportional<00:01:54.780> benefit<00:01:55.170> out

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
so we get this proportional benefit out

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.469 
so we get this proportional benefit out
of<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:56.460> are<00:01:56.549> seeing<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:56.969> already

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
of that and we are seeing that already

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.929 
of that and we are seeing that already
in<00:01:57.750> our<00:01:57.990> international<00:01:58.380> business<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.310> our

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
in our international business and our

months the same positive meal

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.580 
months the same positive meal
and<00:02:04.030> we<00:02:04.299> think<00:02:04.570> going<00:02:04.720> forward<00:02:05.049> I'll<00:02:05.320> continue

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
and we think going forward I'll continue

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.410 
and we think going forward I'll continue
to<00:02:05.770> see<00:02:05.920> positive<00:02:06.130> yields<00:02:06.700> as<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.180> currency

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
to see positive yields as the currency

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.779 
to see positive yields as the currency

those confidence that we'll see an
improvement<00:02:51.220> in<00:02:51.489> our<00:02:51.580> yield<00:02:51.850> performance<00:02:52.420> we

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
improvement in our yield performance we

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.970 
improvement in our yield performance we
are<00:02:53.319> very<00:02:53.500> well<00:02:53.709> hedged<00:02:54.100> on<00:02:54.340> fuel<00:02:54.700> and

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
are very well hedged on fuel and

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.130 
are very well hedged on fuel and
unconceived<00:02:57.269> in<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.360> short<00:02:58.600> term<00:02:58.810> against
