times trying to see if we can see him in
the<00:01:44.560> scope<00:01:44.799> but<00:01:44.829> we<00:01:45.100> still<00:01:45.310> could<00:01:45.429> only<00:01:45.549> see

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
the scope but we still could only see

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.190 
the scope but we still could only see
the<00:01:45.820> top<00:01:45.969> of<00:01:46.030> their<00:01:46.299> horns<00:01:46.600> as<00:01:46.719> they<00:01:46.840> work<00:01:46.990> back

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200

the top of their horns as they work back
through<00:01:47.439> some<00:01:47.649> really<00:01:47.890> tall<00:01:48.039> brush<00:01:54.569> we<00:01:55.569> could

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
through some really tall brush we could

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.059 
through some really tall brush we could
tell<00:01:55.929> they<00:01:56.079> were<00:01:56.109> slightly<00:01:56.469> alerted<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:56.979> our

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
tell they were slightly alerted to our

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:58.919 
tell they were slightly alerted to our
presence<00:01:57.159> but<00:01:57.969> the<00:01:58.060> wind<00:01:58.240> was<00:01:58.360> so<00:01:58.390> perfect

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
presence but the wind was so perfect

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:59.999

they<00:01:59.020> didn't<00:01:59.319> really<00:01:59.439> know<00:01:59.679> what<00:01:59.770> was<00:01:59.950> going

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.770 
they didn't really know what was going
on<00:02:00.340> so<00:02:00.610> we<00:02:00.700> just<00:02:00.729> continued<00:02:01.299> to<00:02:01.360> try<00:02:01.539> to<00:02:01.569> get

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780
