first<00:00:13.990> let's<00:00:14.680> look<00:00:14.770> at<00:00:14.950> our<00:00:15.010> image<00:00:15.370> the<00:00:15.969> image

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
first let's look at our image the image

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.140 
first let's look at our image the image
size<00:00:17.160> for<00:00:18.160> this<00:00:18.310> particular<00:00:18.460> piece<00:00:18.910> that<00:00:19.090> I

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
size for this particular piece that I

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.300 
size for this particular piece that I
want<00:00:19.300> to<00:00:19.390> print<00:00:19.660> is<00:00:19.840> going<00:00:20.320> to<00:00:20.380> be<00:00:20.560> four<00:00:21.040> feet

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
want to print is going to be four feet

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.630 
want to print is going to be four feet
by<00:00:21.670> three<00:00:22.000> feet<00:00:22.029> which<00:00:22.840> translates<00:00:23.410> into<00:00:23.640> for

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
by three feet which translates into for

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.630 
by three feet which translates into for
Kyle's<00:00:25.149> going<00:00:25.450> across<00:00:25.980> three<00:00:26.980> tiles<00:00:27.220> going

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
Kyle's going across three tiles going

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.229 
Kyle's going across three tiles going
down<00:00:27.849> so<00:00:28.540> my<00:00:28.989> width<00:00:29.349> has<00:00:29.590> to<00:00:29.770> be<00:00:29.860> at<00:00:29.950> least<00:00:30.239> 48

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:31.239 
down so my width has to be at least 48

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.170 
down so my width has to be at least 48
inches<00:00:31.599> or<00:00:31.809> greater<00:00:31.840> in<00:00:32.410> this<00:00:32.829> case<00:00:33.100> it's<00:00:33.579> 53

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
inches or greater in this case it's 53

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.709 
inches or greater in this case it's 53
the<00:00:34.989> height<00:00:35.230> has<00:00:35.530> to<00:00:35.680> be<00:00:35.770> at<00:00:35.860> least<00:00:36.180> 36<00:00:37.180> inches

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
the height has to be at least 36 inches

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.220 
the height has to be at least 36 inches
or<00:00:38.200> greater<00:00:38.230> and<00:00:38.920> in<00:00:39.399> this<00:00:39.520> case<00:00:39.760> it's<00:00:40.030> at<00:00:40.420> 36

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
or greater and in this case it's at 36

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.140 
or greater and in this case it's at 36
inches<00:00:41.880> the<00:00:42.880> resolution<00:00:43.350> has<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.560> be<00:00:44.680> 100<00:00:45.150> ppi

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
inches the resolution has to be 100 ppi

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.920

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
control over the image we can move it

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.219 
control over the image we can move it
anywhere<00:01:36.850> we<00:01:37.630> want<00:01:37.869> now<00:01:38.530> when<00:01:39.190> it<00:01:39.310> came<00:01:39.580> in

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
anywhere we want now when it came in

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.850 
anywhere we want now when it came in
just<00:01:41.229> just<00:01:41.619> as<00:01:41.860> is<00:01:42.159> notice<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.299> ladybug<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
just just as is notice the ladybug the

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.399 
just just as is notice the ladybug the
tentacle<00:01:45.580> is<00:01:45.790> going<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.450> be<00:01:46.540> cut<00:01:46.810> off<00:01:47.020> in<00:01:47.260> one

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
tentacle is going to be cut off in one

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.039 
tentacle is going to be cut off in one
of<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.590> squares<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:48.790> because<00:01:49.450> we<00:01:49.479> pasted<00:01:49.840> them

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
of the squares so because we pasted them

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.940 
of the squares so because we pasted them
too<00:01:50.290> we're<00:01:50.950> able<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.340> move<00:01:51.610> this<00:01:52.000> around<00:01:52.240> and

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
too we're able to move this around and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.850 
too we're able to move this around and
put<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:54.040> in<00:01:54.130> position<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.960> once<00:01:56.260> we<00:01:56.439> get<00:01:56.619> into

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
put it in position so once we get into

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.030 
put it in position so once we get into
position<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:59.110> let<00:01:59.290> go<00:01:59.320> of<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.650> mouse<00:01:59.680> button

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
position we let go of the mouse button

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.590 
position we let go of the mouse button
and<00:02:00.369> we<00:02:01.270> have<00:02:01.450> our<00:02:01.570> file<00:02:01.780> already<00:02:03.360> our<00:02:04.360> next

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
and we have our file already our next

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.260 
and we have our file already our next
step<00:02:04.869> is<00:02:05.080> to<00:02:05.170> save<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.159> file<00:02:06.400> so<00:02:07.030> we<00:02:07.119> can

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
step is to save the file so we can

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.020 
step is to save the file so we can
upload<00:02:07.659> it<00:02:07.869> first<00:02:08.560> we're<00:02:08.739> going<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:08.920> do<00:02:09.099> is<00:02:09.340> get

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
upload it first we're going to do is get

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.690 
upload it first we're going to do is get
rid<00:02:10.299> of<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.569> template<00:02:11.170> layer<00:02:11.379> and<00:02:11.709> I'm<00:02:12.640> going

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
rid of the template layer and I'm going

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.210 
rid of the template layer and I'm going
to<00:02:12.939> click<00:02:13.090> on<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.390> eye<00:02:13.689> icon<00:02:13.799> to<00:02:14.799> hide<00:02:15.040> the
