00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.260
 "Knowing" 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.240
 The theme song of the game "Friends in the table ~ Pure Sweet Heart~" 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.060
 Lyrics: True Song 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.880
 Composition and arrangement: Meis Clauson 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.880
 Song: True Song 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.300
 "Happiness" 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.740
 Have you said it a few times? 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:37.760
 Too many things happening in words are too slow 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.440
 So I have been escaping 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.580
 I heard you say "I am back" 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.580
 It feels like coming back from the past 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.780
 Being strong is not necessary 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.280
 Just continue to shine 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.640
 From the moment of birth 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.240
 never changed 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.540
 When you want to change 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.980
 In fact, it has changed. 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.760
 Thank you for telling me all this. 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.340
 Let me be so convinced 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.780
 Eating delicious food 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:43.420
 Think back to you at such an instant 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:53.120
 The feelings that are generated now may be meaningless. 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.080
 Or maybe it makes sense 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.980
 "Welcome back" Every day that you say to you 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:11.040
 Let me determine my feelings 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.960
 Itâ€™s said that greed is good for everything. 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.560
 Actually it is very easy but 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.720
 This world is always difficult to understand, so it must be frank. 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:40.660
 Although I want to be honest, I can do it? 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.340
 Your own value is at the time of calculation 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.520
 I can feel "I am still alive". 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.220
 Every day is a happy day full of miracles 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.760
 Crying or smiling are happy 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.740
 Imprinting these in my heart has remained the same 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.260
 If you try to open your eyes, you can feel the miracle of light (Prism) 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.160
 If you close your eyes, this universe will enjoy this life! (ENJOY LIFE!) 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.560
 Being strong is not necessary 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.380
 Just continue to shine 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.360
 From the moment of birth 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.960
 never changed 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.460
 When you want to change 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.880
 In fact, it has changed. 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.500
 Thank you for telling me all this. 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.500
 I have already felt it.
