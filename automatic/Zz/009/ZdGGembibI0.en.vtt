00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
psychoanalysis of creativity and

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.650 
psychoanalysis of creativity and
basically<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.800> deals<00:00:32.309> with<00:00:32.610> how<00:00:32.850> people's

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
basically that deals with how people's

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.740 
basically that deals with how people's
backgrounds<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.770> their<00:00:35.660> childhoods<00:00:36.660> have

backgrounds and their childhoods have

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.180 
backgrounds and their childhoods have
influenced<00:00:37.170> what<00:00:37.290> they<00:00:37.410> create<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:37.980> talk

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190

Giacometti
and<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.530> quite<00:00:44.000> remarkable<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.090> these

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and it's quite remarkable in these

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.940 
and it's quite remarkable in these
lectures<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.809> hear<00:00:45.989> about<00:00:46.079> their<00:00:46.350> backgrounds

lectures to hear about their backgrounds

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.549 
lectures to hear about their backgrounds
Giacometti<00:00:47.820> sort<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.360> really<00:00:48.629> stands<00:00:49.110> out<00:00:49.350> in

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
Giacometti sort of really stands out in

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.350 
Giacometti sort of really stands out in
the<00:00:49.649> fact<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.129> there<00:00:50.640> was<00:00:50.760> two<00:00:50.969> separate

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the fact that there was two separate

the fact that there was two separate
occasions<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.899> his<00:00:52.020> lifetime<00:00:52.260> where<00:00:52.829> he<00:00:53.489> went

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
occasions in his lifetime where he went

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.580 
occasions in his lifetime where he went
to<00:00:54.120> bed<00:00:54.239> at<00:00:54.390> night<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:54.899> someone<00:00:55.230> else<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.530> the
