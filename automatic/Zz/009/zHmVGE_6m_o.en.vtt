00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 were more than 190 hours of work 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.750
 intense to try to contain the flames 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.550
 which was considered to be the largest 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.830
 country fire 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.990
 six tanks of the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.750
 fuel storage caught fire 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.779
 the situation came to be compared as 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.150
 try to keep a dragon in a cage and 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.800
 to face such an arduous task in a 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.470
 super heated area 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.510
 only men of fiber and a lot of courage 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:35.309
 we will or have not been champion but the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:38.129
 themselves were thrown over the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.950
 tanks more than 8 billion liters of 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.800
 sea water but in control of it all 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.590
 there were more than 200 men risking 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.480
 own life to end the fire 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.670
 moments of tension that will never be 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.469
 forgotten as this explosion in the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.399
 first day of the accident 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.710
 it was hopeless we had firefighters 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.390
 there three garrisons three vehicles with 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.180
 fire department trimmings 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.869
 working on the side of the company when 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.479
 I saw this event that ended up 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.490
 Overflowing of the liquid is 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.950
 incandescent to the side of the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.830
 company last Friday fire 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.930
 our heroes have ended will be that 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.850
 dragon that looked immortal 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.030
 the work was completed without any 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.250
 victim thanks to the knowledge and 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.850
 of who has been there since the beginning 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.820
 excessive tiredness but with the pleasure of 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.570
 thy duty fulfilled after nine days 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.100
 and interrupts me of mental physical stress 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.770
 rest deserved for those who do not 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.320
 They spared their efforts on the night of the last day 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.250
 the fire they finally got 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.250
 have a meal with confidence 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.200
 and even talk to one's own family 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.420
 Orlando was one of the brigadistas who gave 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.490
 support the fire department that 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.979
 emotional about the concern of the 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.850
 family during work at home 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.240
 My wife, we are now seeing her. 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.770
 hence my son slept with my clothes 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.550
 They did not expect to return and the 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.550
 lady appeared 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.980
 he always with you with the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.470
 situation under control the firemen will 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.960
 continue the aftermath and stay in the 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.090
 place for at least another week until 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.550
 that the company assumes the rest 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.190
 We will leave the team 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.740
 of the fire department here mobilized 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.480
 the sÃ£o paulo team also mobilized 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.730
 for any eventuality 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.430
 after days of much apprehension and fear 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.640
 Thank you very much to everyone who did 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.340
 part of this challenge that, with a lot of 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.310
 determination to complete this work with 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.180
 success 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.130
 in the sense of counting two fields of 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.140
 performance 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:06.800
 the body of the moment one oi proud of 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.209
 to be king 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:20.900
 we got into putting the phone down 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:27.319
 facing the bathroom. 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.319
 firemen and in moments of peace
