neat thing about this rotates so you see
it<00:00:32.820> faces<00:00:33.180> multiple<00:00:33.540> different<00:00:33.870> directions

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
it faces multiple different directions

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.319 
it faces multiple different directions
but<00:00:34.559> when<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.399> right-click<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.850> with<00:00:35.969> armor

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
but when you right-click it with armor

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.959 
but when you right-click it with armor
of<00:00:36.719> course<00:00:37.040> it<00:00:38.040> does<00:00:38.219> exactly<00:00:38.489> what<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.940> think

color of the beacon beam using different
colors<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.409> glass<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.549> let's<00:01:17.700> check<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:17.970> out

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
colors of glass so let's check this out

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.270 
colors of glass so let's check this out
we'll<00:01:18.360> put<00:01:18.540> down<00:01:18.799> blue<00:01:19.799> glass<00:01:20.100> here<00:01:22.159> look<00:01:23.159> at

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
we'll put down blue glass here look at

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.880 
we'll put down blue glass here look at
that<00:01:23.430> we've<00:01:23.700> got<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.119> blue<00:01:24.720> beam<00:01:25.020> now<00:01:25.320> alright

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890

that we've got a blue beam now alright
so<00:01:26.009> let's<00:01:26.130> do<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> red<00:01:26.490> one<00:01:27.890> wait<00:01:28.890> for<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.100> to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
so let's do a red one wait for it to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.330 
so let's do a red one wait for it to
update<00:01:30.320> there<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.409> go<00:01:31.530> now<00:01:31.710> I've<00:01:31.799> got<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.280> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
update there we go now I've got like a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:43.929 
update there we go now I've got like a
purple<00:01:33.030> beam<00:01:33.810> orange<00:01:38.810> orangish<00:01:39.810> color<00:01:40.790> black

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.960 

white<00:01:45.829> so<00:01:46.829> that's<00:01:46.979> pretty<00:01:47.159> cool<00:01:47.250> let's<00:01:47.790> take

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
white so that's pretty cool let's take

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.139 
white so that's pretty cool let's take
away<00:01:48.710> these<00:01:49.710> here<00:01:50.369> now<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> purple

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
away these here now we have a purple

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.649 
away these here now we have a purple
beam<00:01:51.360> stick<00:01:51.810> away<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.049> blue<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.540> a

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
beam stick away the blue and we have a

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.380 
beam stick away the blue and we have a
red<00:01:54.840> beam<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.649> as<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.700> colors<00:01:57.030> do

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
red beam so as you can see the colors do

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.249 
red beam so as you can see the colors do
stack<00:01:58.170> they<00:01:59.180> combine<00:02:00.180> together<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.780> form

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
stack they combine together to form

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.859 
stack they combine together to form
different<00:02:01.829> colors<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.549> could<00:02:02.850> mix<00:02:03.149> let's

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
different colors so you could mix let's

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.969 
different colors so you could mix let's
take<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.140> couple<00:02:04.560> primary<00:02:05.430> colors<00:02:05.909> here<00:02:06.979> what's

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
take a couple primary colors here what's

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.900 
take a couple primary colors here what's
a<00:02:08.039> good<00:02:08.160> one<00:02:08.420> let's<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.690> go<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:09.810> blue<00:02:10.229> and

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
a good one let's just go with blue and

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.980 
a good one let's just go with blue and
yellow

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
yellow

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.590 
yellow
so<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.560> couple<00:02:13.710> primary<00:02:14.250> colors<00:02:14.580> here<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.060> see

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
so a couple primary colors here and see

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.430 
so a couple primary colors here and see
if<00:02:15.630> we<00:02:15.780> can't<00:02:15.990> make<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:17.750> secondary<00:02:18.750> color<00:02:19.110> here

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
if we can't make a secondary color here

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.930 
if we can't make a secondary color here
green<00:02:19.850> let's<00:02:20.850> see<00:02:21.770> look<00:02:22.770> at<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:22.980> took<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.340> lime

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
green let's see look at that took a lime

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.370 
green let's see look at that took a lime
green<00:02:23.970> sort<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.870> thing<00:02:24.990> but<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.230> green

opens up a lot of possibilities oh
that's<00:02:58.410> neat<00:02:58.580> for<00:02:59.660> decorating<00:03:00.660> with<00:03:00.810> beacon

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
that's neat for decorating with beacon

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.530 
that's neat for decorating with beacon
blocks<00:03:01.530> changing<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.700> know<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.030> effects<00:03:03.300> you

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
blocks changing you know the effects you

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.930 
blocks changing you know the effects you
get<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.810> could<00:03:03.960> color<00:03:04.740> code<00:03:05.100> your<00:03:05.460> beacon

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
get you could color code your beacon

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.930 
get you could color code your beacon
effects<00:03:06.450> if<00:03:06.720> you'd<00:03:06.900> like<00:03:07.340> or<00:03:08.340> use<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.700> for<00:03:08.850> any

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
there's supposedly a secret feature as

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.010 
there's supposedly a secret feature as
well<00:03:16.820> but<00:03:17.820> I<00:03:18.030> have<00:03:18.210> no<00:03:18.390> idea<00:03:18.630> what<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:18.780> would

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
well but I have no idea what that would

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.050 
well but I have no idea what that would
be<00:03:19.050> if<00:03:19.980> it's<00:03:20.190> anything<00:03:20.490> like<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.790> previous

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
be if it's anything like the previous

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.270 
be if it's anything like the previous
secret<00:03:21.540> features<00:03:21.900> then<00:03:22.380> it's<00:03:22.710> got<00:03:23.010> something
