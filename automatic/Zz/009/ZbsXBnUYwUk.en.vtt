00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.320 

this<00:00:00.659> right<00:00:00.900> here<00:00:01.110> is<00:00:01.140> my<00:00:01.260> spin<00:00:01.680> move<00:00:11.030> his<00:00:12.030> next

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
this right here is my spin move his next

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.270 
this right here is my spin move his next
move<00:00:12.480> right<00:00:12.690> here<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.019> probably<00:00:13.320> my<00:00:13.769> favorite

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
move right here is probably my favorite

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.189 
move right here is probably my favorite
street<00:00:14.549> ball<00:00:14.730> move<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.719> reason<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:16.020> say

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
street ball move and the reason I say

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.570 
street ball move and the reason I say
it's<00:00:16.350> my<00:00:16.470> favorite<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.010> because<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.430> probably

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
it's my favorite is because it probably

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.250 
it's my favorite is because it probably
works<00:00:17.940> maybe<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> highest<00:00:18.600> percentage<00:00:18.990> time

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
works maybe the highest percentage time

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.950 
works maybe the highest percentage time
out<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.980> any<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.279> my<00:00:20.369> moves<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.939> not<00:00:21.330> only<00:00:21.359> get<00:00:21.750> by

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
out of any of my moves I not only get by

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.870 
out of any of my moves I not only get by
my<00:00:22.140> defender<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.650> bucket<00:00:23.070> but<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.609> do<00:00:23.730> a

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
my defender to the bucket but I do a

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.580 
my defender to the bucket but I do a
move<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> point<00:00:24.810> where<00:00:24.990> he's<00:00:25.140> all<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> way

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
move to a point where he's all the way

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.859 
move to a point where he's all the way
behind<00:00:25.769> me<00:00:26.160> by<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.550> time<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.849> go<00:00:27.000> by<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.660> what

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
behind me by the time I go by and what

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.070 
behind me by the time I go by and what
it<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.289> basically<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.710> spin<00:00:29.099> move<00:00:29.300> but<00:00:30.300> over

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
it is is basically a spin move but over

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.450 
it is is basically a spin move but over
the<00:00:31.170> years<00:00:31.380> when<00:00:31.560> I've<00:00:31.650> been<00:00:31.679> playing<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.219> watch

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
the years when I've been playing I watch

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.299 
the years when I've been playing I watch
people's<00:00:32.880> regular<00:00:33.300> spin<00:00:33.510> moves<00:00:33.750> as<00:00:34.309> opposed

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
people's regular spin moves as opposed

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.700 
people's regular spin moves as opposed
to<00:00:35.520> some<00:00:36.480> people<00:00:36.750> spin<00:00:36.989> moves<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.440> do<00:00:37.559> it

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
to some people spin moves that do it

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.770 
to some people spin moves that do it
great<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.219> good<00:00:38.489> example<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.480> person<00:00:39.750> that

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
great a good example of a person that

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.360 
great a good example of a person that
does<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> great<00:00:40.260> spin<00:00:40.559> moves<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.890> skip<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.250> my

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
does a great spin moves to skip to my

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.549 
does a great spin moves to skip to my
Lou<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.420> reason<00:00:42.750> his<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.020> great<00:00:43.350> is

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
Lou and the reason his is great is

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.860 
Lou and the reason his is great is
because<00:00:44.520> he<00:00:44.640> has<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> set<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.149> move<00:00:45.450> right

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
because he has a set of move right

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.410 
because he has a set of move right
before<00:00:46.230> his<00:00:46.379> spin<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.980> lot<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.760> times<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.270> to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
before his spin a lot of times I like to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.569 
before his spin a lot of times I like to
do<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> wing<00:00:49.050> if<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.070> spin<00:00:50.399> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
do it on the wing if you like to spin to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.279 
do it on the wing if you like to spin to
your<00:00:50.610> right<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.420> want<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.870> be<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> right

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
your right you want to be on the right

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.170 
your right you want to be on the right
wing<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.680> like<00:00:52.829> spin<00:00:53.039> your<00:00:53.190> left<00:00:53.370> be<00:00:54.090> on

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
wing if you like spin your left be on

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.760 
wing if you like spin your left be on
the<00:00:54.270> left<00:00:54.510> wing<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:54.899> you're<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.140> top<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.620> go

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
the left wing if you're up top and go

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.400 
the left wing if you're up top and go
either<00:00:55.920> way<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.910> me<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.050> be<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
either way for me I like to be on the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.439 
either way for me I like to be on the
right<00:00:58.590> wing<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.579> what<00:00:59.760> makes<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.149> spin

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
right wing but what makes this spin

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.020 
right wing but what makes this spin
really<00:01:00.690> work<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.260> right<00:01:02.039> before<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.399> go<00:01:02.699> into<00:01:02.850> it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
really work is right before I go into it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.240 
really work is right before I go into it
I<00:01:03.149> hit<00:01:03.750> them<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> in-and-out<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.710> small

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
I hit them with the in-and-out a small

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.520 
I hit them with the in-and-out a small
quick<00:01:05.790> in-and-out<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.600> freezes<00:01:07.080> them<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
quick in-and-out that freezes them and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.410 
quick in-and-out that freezes them and
allows<00:01:08.159> me<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.490> spin<00:01:08.729> off<00:01:08.909> them<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.299> they'll

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
allows me to spin off them and they'll

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.679 
allows me to spin off them and they'll
be<00:01:09.450> completely<00:01:10.020> behind<00:01:10.140> me<00:01:10.470> coming<00:01:11.400> up<00:01:11.689> it's

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
be completely behind me coming up it's

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.679 
be completely behind me coming up it's
here<00:01:12.990> whatever<00:01:13.619> they<00:01:13.740> set<00:01:13.920> up<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.299> in<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.570> out

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
here whatever they set up is in and out

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.200 
here whatever they set up is in and out
and<00:01:16.650> I'm<00:01:16.740> all<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.950> way<00:01:17.070> around<00:01:17.430> into<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
and I'm all the way around into the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.880 
and I'm all the way around into the
bucket

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:37.319 

he<00:01:25.890> knows<00:01:26.070> he<00:01:26.460> has<00:01:26.490> blast<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.480> my<00:01:27.570> voice

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.660 

the<00:01:37.869> spin<00:01:38.140> move<00:01:38.170> for<00:01:38.560> me<00:01:38.710> was<00:01:38.950> never<00:01:39.189> moved

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
the spin move for me was never moved

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.249 
the spin move for me was never moved
that<00:01:39.820> I<00:01:39.939> ever<00:01:40.119> did<00:01:40.390> until<00:01:40.720> I<00:01:40.750> started<00:01:41.110> playing

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
that I ever did until I started playing

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.440 
that I ever did until I started playing
street<00:01:41.649> ball<00:01:41.680> I<00:01:42.100> had<00:01:42.640> always<00:01:42.820> been<00:01:43.030> a<00:01:43.090> fan<00:01:43.420> of

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
street ball I had always been a fan of

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.510 
street ball I had always been a fan of
the<00:01:43.659> move<00:01:43.869> but<00:01:44.740> I<00:01:44.770> didn't<00:01:45.070> know<00:01:45.159> how<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.310> be

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
the move but I didn't know how to be

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.310 
the move but I didn't know how to be
great<00:01:45.790> at<00:01:45.970> it<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.270> I<00:01:46.390> wasn't<00:01:46.869> familiar<00:01:47.049> with

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
great at it and I wasn't familiar with

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.700 
great at it and I wasn't familiar with
the<00:01:47.500> footwork<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:49.049> when<00:01:50.049> I<00:01:50.080> started<00:01:50.470> in<00:01:50.590> the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
the footwork so when I started in the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.560 
the footwork so when I started in the
street<00:01:50.979> ball<00:01:51.189> and<00:01:51.549> tried<00:01:51.789> to<00:01:51.820> expand<00:01:52.360> on<00:01:52.539> my

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
street ball and tried to expand on my

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.109 
street ball and tried to expand on my
handle<00:01:53.049> and<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:54.399> know<00:01:54.520> learn<00:01:54.759> different

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
handle and you know learn different

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.730 
handle and you know learn different
things<00:01:55.149> I<00:01:55.659> wanted<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.049> learn<00:01:56.200> how<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.409> do<00:01:56.619> the

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
things I wanted to learn how to do the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.230 
things I wanted to learn how to do the
spin<00:01:56.979> move<00:01:57.159> like<00:01:57.369> how<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.670> be<00:01:57.880> great<00:01:58.090> at<00:01:58.210> that

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
spin move like how to be great at that

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.749 
spin move like how to be great at that
move<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:59.080> I<00:01:59.560> noticed<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.009> skip<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.369> my<00:02:00.520> Lou

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
move and I noticed the skip to my Lou

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.550 
move and I noticed the skip to my Lou
probably<00:02:01.570> one<00:02:01.659> of<00:02:01.689> the<00:02:01.810> most<00:02:01.960> famous<00:02:02.200> street

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
probably one of the most famous street

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.889 
probably one of the most famous street
ball<00:02:02.679> players<00:02:02.920> of<00:02:03.070> all<00:02:03.159> time<00:02:03.450> he<00:02:04.450> had<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.750> move

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
ball players of all time he had to move

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.679 
ball players of all time he had to move
down<00:02:05.170> pat<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.799> where<00:02:05.979> when<00:02:06.159> he<00:02:06.280> would<00:02:06.399> spin<00:02:06.700> his

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
down pat to where when he would spin his

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.389 
down pat to where when he would spin his
defender<00:02:08.200> would<00:02:08.319> be<00:02:08.440> all<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.830> way<00:02:08.860> behind<00:02:09.310> him

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
defender would be all the way behind him

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.590 
defender would be all the way behind him
by<00:02:09.549> the<00:02:09.640> time<00:02:09.789> he<00:02:09.910> got<00:02:10.000> done<00:02:10.209> with<00:02:10.299> the<00:02:10.360> move

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
by the time he got done with the move

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.390 
by the time he got done with the move
when<00:02:10.810> he'd<00:02:10.929> be<00:02:11.019> laying<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:11.380> up<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.739> saw<00:02:12.160> one<00:02:12.370> of

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
when he'd be laying it up I saw one of

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.160 
when he'd be laying it up I saw one of
the<00:02:12.519> episodes<00:02:13.030> where<00:02:13.239> he<00:02:13.390> did<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:14.080> know

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
the episodes where he did it you know

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.840 
the episodes where he did it you know
one<00:02:14.350> on<00:02:14.590> one<00:02:14.769> of<00:02:14.799> the<00:02:14.920> ESPN<00:02:15.310> episodes<00:02:15.730> of

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
one on one of the ESPN episodes of

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.789 
one on one of the ESPN episodes of
street<00:02:16.090> ball<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.959> slowed<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.410> down<00:02:17.440> into

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
street ball and I slowed it down into

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.280 
street ball and I slowed it down into
complete<00:02:18.250> slow-mo<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.750> noticed<00:02:20.140> his

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
complete slow-mo and I noticed his

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.380 
complete slow-mo and I noticed his
footwork<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:21.100> I<00:02:21.400> noticed<00:02:21.760> another<00:02:21.940> thing<00:02:22.239> he

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
footwork and I noticed another thing he

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.020 
footwork and I noticed another thing he
did<00:02:22.630> he<00:02:23.230> added<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.620> small<00:02:23.799> in-and-out<00:02:24.400> move<00:02:24.790> to

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
did he added a small in-and-out move to

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.759 
did he added a small in-and-out move to
freeze<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.480> defender<00:02:25.930> right<00:02:26.170> before<00:02:26.470> he<00:02:26.590> did

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
freeze the defender right before he did

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.130 
freeze the defender right before he did
it<00:02:26.890> spin<00:02:27.160> so<00:02:27.970> when<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:28.239> broke<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.660> down<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:28.840> saw

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
it spin so when I broke it down I saw

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.320 
it spin so when I broke it down I saw
the<00:02:29.200> forward<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.830> went<00:02:30.280> straight<00:02:30.400> straight<00:02:31.180> to

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
the forward I went straight straight to

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.210 
the forward I went straight straight to
the<00:02:31.450> gym<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:31.959> I<00:02:32.080> worked<00:02:32.350> on<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.620> for<00:02:32.739> hours<00:02:33.069> and

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
the gym and I worked on it for hours and

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.280 
the gym and I worked on it for hours and
hours<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:34.030> had<00:02:34.209> really<00:02:34.540> patented<00:02:35.049> in<00:02:35.200> a

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
hours and I had really patented in a

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.559 
hours and I had really patented in a
matter<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.620> like<00:02:35.830> probably<00:02:36.610> like<00:02:36.760> 2<00:02:37.030> or<00:02:37.060> 3<00:02:37.360> days

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
matter of like probably like 2 or 3 days

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.500 
matter of like probably like 2 or 3 days
and<00:02:38.340> since<00:02:39.340> then<00:02:39.610> it's<00:02:39.790> been<00:02:39.849> one<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.180> my<00:02:40.269> go-to

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
and since then it's been one of my go-to

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.920 
and since then it's been one of my go-to
moves<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:43.060> know<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.450> that's<00:02:43.630> that's

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
moves and you know and that's that's

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.150 
moves and you know and that's that's
pretty<00:02:44.260> much<00:02:44.470> where<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.739> came<00:02:44.890> from

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
pretty much where it came from

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.670 
pretty much where it came from
spin<00:02:45.549> move
