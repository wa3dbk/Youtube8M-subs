00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.330
 hello to all welcome to a new 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.150
 video today they are playing what is the game of 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.560
 ufc for android well as we see here 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.330
 we have the game the game is a moment 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.429
 good and good as the name says 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.039
 from the struggles you are from the ufc 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.810
 then it is extremely good and good as 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.250
 that will be the game then we will 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.230
 put it so that you see more or 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.960
 less how is it and such here we would have 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.230
 our character and well here we go 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.690
 to start fighting well is the energy 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.670
 I could have more energy if 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.650
 we press here of this energy and 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.600
 then work with this energy that we 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.780
 they will give little by little but this energy 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.180
 it's like to have more life more more 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.550
 so that it works more standing and the soil and 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.600
 all and we're going to give you continue so that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.820
 see the fight we are going to give him a fight 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.210
 and we are going to wait for him to charge the fight 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.420
 and the gameplay in 10 my point of view 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.159
 it's pretty good so there's one that 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.320
 another thing that I would not like your 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.479
 air 'the game but it's pretty good 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.799
 as the one to paste is quite simple if 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.509
 we do like this we already have as a guy a 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.909
 hook and we would have the skills 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.770
 specials that would be these with what 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.420
 they are like special blows, not like that 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.000
 that we can improve for 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.619
 that took it out with much more force 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.640
 roll will be called already and I'm going to 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.530
 end there is 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.630
 then with him it was pretty simple from 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.369
 the clear fight is that every time 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.659
 the characters that are going to leave us for 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.200
 fight because they are going to be much more 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.700
 complicated aids that we get with 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.470
 1500 of life and we just have 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.360
 800 or something like that then it makes us 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.110
 quite complicated but it is achieved 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.110
 of rival 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.360
 over here whatever in the money truth 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.220
 that with money we could buy 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.200
 other characters like here come out 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.979
 these others or we could go to what 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.979
 it would be the store 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.810
 let's go to the store here 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.830
 As in the store, we can buy 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.180
 different things for what they would be 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.890
 our people in this case I'm going to 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.320
 buy of these that would be like to 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.550
 improve the skills that said 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.500
 before we could improve the 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.360
 skills then who do this 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.220
 really and this what we are going to do is 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.850
 just go 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.390
 to our player but 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.170
 deliver let's train it and here what 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.910
 we wanted 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.890
 let's say we want to add this to this one 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.290
 so that he was 4 and got hooked 1 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.480
 everything then we can add it in this 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.500
 this is the most powerful case that I have 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.940
 so let's put this on and this one 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.170
 let's apply let's go so we have 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.850
 us because they are already kicked but I think 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.470
 that these kicks are something of 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.030
 add to this which is like the shortest 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.490
 what do I have then we are going to apply 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.690
 there it is now if we go to those of 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.450
 let's see if I have to 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.130
 add to this yes yes but let's 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.080
 add it looks better to the blows these 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.240
 still here I have for this we are going to apply 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.880
 then as you see, we are improving what 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.550
 that would be our character in this case 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.080
 I already have 1,102 2036 of life each time 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:23.280
 we are adding more lives as you see now 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.230
 added this and then I have 1,118 of life and 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.330
 whereby the game itself is 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.370
 very very good the fights are very good 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.840
 from my point of view 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.180
 well look, I got an attack no 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.890
 for what would be the fight on the ground 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.730
 let's put this fight quickly to 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.400
 see if yes I succeed if I managed to win 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.510
 let's see if we are going to use 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.049
 he has 672 energy and I have less 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.220
 but well let's see how it goes 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:55.950
 today four had floor on it or standing 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.610
 well bastard look gift take is there is 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.000
 dumbass 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.160
 Of course , we could also 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.660
 dodge the blows or if we keep 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.320
 So with our famous 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:15.740
 but it hurts us a bit to hit 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.740
 the shit of the strongest almost 9 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.920
 for that we have to have a good 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:29.510
 calculation in bars now well 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.510
 seeing him often those are pretty hard 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.900
 eye eye's happening to me if I do not have 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.900
 It has so much to me 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.150
 to see see 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.820
 come back comes back or is going to win 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.560
 because it's so clear that if I win 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.660
 because in that part he had me all I have 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.610
 a lot of life the character does not 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.250
 respond when you can continue good 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.350
 Well, the good game is the game 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.660
