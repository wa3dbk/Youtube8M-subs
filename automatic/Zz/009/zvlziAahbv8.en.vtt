00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
I have this beanbag in here that I heat

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.370 
I have this beanbag in here that I heat
up<00:01:47.430> every<00:01:47.850> few<00:01:48.060> hours<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.750> us<00:01:48.930> them<00:01:49.229> to

up every few hours to us them to
simulate<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.130> warmth<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.670> feel<00:01:51.240> if<00:01:51.420> there

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
simulate the warmth and feel if there

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.679 
simulate the warmth and feel if there
are<00:01:51.780> their<00:01:52.170> mother's<00:01:52.500> body<00:01:53.240> it's<00:01:54.240> important

are their mother's body it's important

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.210 
are their mother's body it's important
but<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.930> won't<00:01:55.049> hurt<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.530> hurt<00:01:56.009> them<00:01:56.130> to

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
but it won't hurt it to hurt them to

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.170 
but it won't hurt it to hurt them to
take<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.520> away<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> minute<00:01:57.060> here

the forest floor or a natural
environment<00:02:39.060> for<00:02:39.090> them<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:39.810> anyways<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.500> had

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
environment for them so anyways I had

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.070 
environment for them so anyways I had
decided<00:02:41.190> against<00:02:41.970> naming<00:02:42.390> them<00:02:42.569> but<00:02:42.870> then

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
decided against naming them but then

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.740 
decided against naming them but then
friend<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.069> mine<00:02:44.220> suggested<00:02:44.610> crash<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.569> Eddie

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
friend of mine suggested crash and Eddie

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.890 
friend of mine suggested crash and Eddie
after<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.410> two<00:02:46.590> opossums<00:02:47.549> in<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:48.420> Ice<00:02:48.630> Age

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
after the two opossums in the Ice Age

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.870 
after the two opossums in the Ice Age
movies<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.530> well<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.709> just<00:02:49.859> seemed<00:02:50.070> seemed

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
movies and well it just seemed seemed

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.840 
movies and well it just seemed seemed
too<00:02:51.150> perfect<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.780> resist<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.980> guess<00:02:53.670> we'll

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
too perfect to resist so I guess we'll

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.840 
too perfect to resist so I guess we'll
say<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.299> uh<00:02:54.329> that<00:02:54.720> one<00:02:55.320> is<00:02:55.440> crash<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.160> that

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
say that uh that one is crash and that

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.780 
say that uh that one is crash and that
one<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.180> Eddie<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:58.340> let's<00:02:59.340> just<00:02:59.489> take<00:02:59.609> a<00:02:59.640> look
