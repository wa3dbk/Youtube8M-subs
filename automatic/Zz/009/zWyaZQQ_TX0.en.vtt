00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
the hex head on that turn cam pin is

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.720 
the hex head on that turn cam pin is
machined<00:00:14.049> to<00:00:14.379> the<00:00:14.500> overlap<00:00:14.889> in<00:00:15.100> tolerances

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
machined to the overlap in tolerances

machined to the overlap in tolerances
between<00:00:16.119> a<00:00:16.150> metric<00:00:16.630> socket<00:00:16.930> and<00:00:17.289> an<00:00:17.470> inch

between a metric socket and an inch

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.300 
between a metric socket and an inch
socket<00:00:18.250> so<00:00:18.759> either<00:00:19.000> will<00:00:19.330> work<00:00:19.509> it's<00:00:20.169> a<00:00:20.290> six<00:00:20.560> we

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
socket so either will work it's a six we

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.429 
socket so either will work it's a six we
recommend<00:00:21.759> using<00:00:21.939> a<00:00:22.180> six<00:00:22.419> pointed<00:00:22.810> sockets<00:00:23.290> I

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
recommend using a six pointed sockets I

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.980 
recommend using a six pointed sockets I
keep<00:00:23.680> from<00:00:23.800> stripping<00:00:24.310> that<00:00:24.430> hex<00:00:24.790> head<00:00:25.000> out<00:00:25.210> so

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
keep from stripping that hex head out so

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.260 
keep from stripping that hex head out so
if<00:00:26.080> you<00:00:26.169> go<00:00:26.259> ahead<00:00:26.349> and<00:00:26.500> give<00:00:26.680> it<00:00:26.739> a<00:00:26.800> turn<00:00:27.270> it's

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
if you go ahead and give it a turn it's

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.630 
if you go ahead and give it a turn it's
just<00:00:28.540> a<00:00:28.660> half<00:00:28.869> turn<00:00:29.200> to<00:00:29.860> remove<00:00:30.189> it<00:00:30.340> it's<00:00:30.550> a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
just a half turn to remove it it's a

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.900 
just a half turn to remove it it's a
half<00:00:30.849> turn<00:00:31.119> to<00:00:31.360> install<00:00:31.779> it<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:33.579> can<00:00:33.730> see

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
half turn to install it you can see

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.400 
half turn to install it you can see
there's<00:00:34.120> a<00:00:34.180> ramp<00:00:34.480> on<00:00:34.750> that<00:00:35.050> pin<00:00:37.170> that's<00:00:38.170> what

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
there's a ramp on that pin that's what

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.830 
there's a ramp on that pin that's what
draws<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:39.070> pin<00:00:39.280> down<00:00:39.550> into<00:00:40.149> the<00:00:40.600> adapter

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
draws the pin down into the adapter

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.560 
draws the pin down into the adapter
there's<00:00:41.410> a<00:00:41.469> matching<00:00:42.280> channel<00:00:42.940> and<00:00:43.120> then

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
there's a matching channel and then

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.080 
there's a matching channel and then
there<00:00:43.780> is<00:00:43.900> a<00:00:43.930> rubber<00:00:44.230> lock<00:00:44.650> that<00:00:45.250> seats<00:00:45.700> into

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
there is a rubber lock that seats into

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.569 
there is a rubber lock that seats into
that<00:00:46.450> detent<00:00:49.920> seats<00:00:50.920> in<00:00:51.040> the<00:00:51.130> d-10<00:00:51.430> the

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
that detent seats in the d-10 the

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.670 
that detent seats in the d-10 the
easiest<00:00:51.880> way<00:00:52.150> to<00:00:52.180> see<00:00:52.540> how<00:00:52.780> that<00:00:52.990> works<00:00:53.290> is<00:00:53.530> to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
easiest way to see how that works is to

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.910 
easiest way to see how that works is to
install<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.340> pin<00:00:54.670> with<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:54.940> bucket<00:00:55.900> off<00:00:56.050> so

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
install the pin with the bucket off so

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.479 
install the pin with the bucket off so
if<00:00:57.010> you<00:00:57.130> go<00:00:57.250> ahead<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:57.579> do<00:00:57.700> that<00:00:59.250> you'll<00:01:00.250> watch

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
if you go ahead and do that you'll watch

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.600 
if you go ahead and do that you'll watch
that<00:01:00.850> that<00:01:01.780> rubber<00:01:02.170> will<00:01:02.530> compress<00:01:03.130> it<00:01:03.520> only

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
that that rubber will compress it only

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.719 
that that rubber will compress it only
compresses<00:01:04.149> about<00:01:04.390> 20%<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.439> then<00:01:06.189> once<00:01:06.490> you

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
compresses about 20% and then once you

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.139 
compresses about 20% and then once you
get<00:01:06.909> that<00:01:07.149> half<00:01:07.509> turn<00:01:07.840> complete<00:01:08.939> you'll<00:01:09.939> be

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
get that half turn complete you'll be

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.300 
get that half turn complete you'll be
able<00:01:10.270> to<00:01:10.479> see<00:01:10.659> it<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:10.990> feel<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.619> hit<00:01:12.280> that

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
able to see it and feel it hit that

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.219 
able to see it and feel it hit that
detent<00:01:12.970> and<00:01:13.210> you<00:01:13.600> can<00:01:13.750> see<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.079> rubber

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
detent and you can see the rubber

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.109 
detent and you can see the rubber
relaxes<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.649> in<00:01:17.649> normal<00:01:18.069> operation<00:01:18.639> with<00:01:18.909> the

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
relaxes so in normal operation with the

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.179 
relaxes so in normal operation with the
pin<00:01:19.299> lock<00:01:19.539> the<00:01:19.810> rubber<00:01:20.020> is<00:01:20.319> in<00:01:20.649> a<00:01:20.770> relaxed

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
pin lock the rubber is in a relaxed

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.999 
pin lock the rubber is in a relaxed
state<00:01:21.429> so<00:01:21.789> we<00:01:22.389> don't<00:01:22.600> anticipate<00:01:23.139> any<00:01:23.560> issues

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
state so we don't anticipate any issues

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.940 
state so we don't anticipate any issues
with<00:01:24.280> wear<00:01:24.850> life<00:01:25.149> on<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:26.170> rubber<00:01:26.409> because

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
with wear life on the rubber because

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.489 
with wear life on the rubber because
really<00:01:27.130> rubber<00:01:27.429> is<00:01:27.869> when<00:01:28.869> it<00:01:28.990> is<00:01:29.139> compressed

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:29.499 
really rubber is when it is compressed

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:32.570 
really rubber is when it is compressed
is<00:01:29.920> when<00:01:30.100> it<00:01:30.219> wears<00:01:30.399> out

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
is when it wears out

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.700 
is when it wears out
it's<00:01:33.120> a<00:01:33.270> symmetrical<00:01:33.810> system<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.410> you<00:01:34.470> can

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
it's a symmetrical system so you can

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.920 
it's a symmetrical system so you can
install<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.310> lock<00:01:35.580> on<00:01:35.790> either<00:01:35.820> side<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.750> that

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
install that lock on either side so that

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.360 
install that lock on either side so that
you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.260> install<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.740> pin<00:01:37.950> from<00:01:38.160> either

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
you can install the pin from either

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.940 
you can install the pin from either
