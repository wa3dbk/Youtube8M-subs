00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:21.819 
pictures of what it used to be but

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:25.630 
pictures of what it used to be but
basically<00:01:22.840> I<00:01:23.840> put<00:01:24.439> in<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.770> piece<00:01:25.069> of<00:01:25.250> quarter

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
basically I put in a piece of quarter

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.480 
basically I put in a piece of quarter
inch<00:01:25.670> MDF<00:01:26.000> in<00:01:26.450> here<00:01:26.719> sanded<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.469> smooth<00:01:27.799> after

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
inch MDF in here sanded it smooth after

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.230 
inch MDF in here sanded it smooth after
I<00:01:28.520> did<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:28.939> CA<00:01:29.299> glue<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:30.069> then<00:01:31.069> body<00:01:31.880> filled

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
I did the CA glue and then body filled

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.300 
I did the CA glue and then body filled
it<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:32.750> it<00:01:32.840> would<00:01:32.929> be<00:01:33.110> really<00:01:33.469> smooth<00:01:33.890> I<00:01:34.100> tried

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
it so it would be really smooth I tried

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.679 
it so it would be really smooth I tried
to<00:01:34.429> paint<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:34.759> but<00:01:34.939> it<00:01:35.030> didn't<00:01:35.240> come<00:01:35.329> out<00:01:35.450> very

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
to paint it but it didn't come out very

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.919 
to paint it but it didn't come out very
well<00:01:35.750> so<00:01:36.159> this<00:01:37.159> is<00:01:37.340> just<00:01:37.549> temporary<00:01:37.899> so<00:01:38.899> I

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
well so this is just temporary so I

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.309 
well so this is just temporary so I
thought<00:01:39.259> that<00:01:39.500> I<00:01:39.530> would<00:01:39.890> just<00:01:40.220> do<00:01:40.939> some<00:01:41.319> carbon

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
thought that I would just do some carbon

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.779 
thought that I would just do some carbon
fiber<00:01:42.549> vinyl<00:01:43.549> and<00:01:44.170> it<00:01:45.170> looks<00:01:45.739> pretty<00:01:46.009> good<00:01:46.310> I

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
fiber vinyl and it looks pretty good I

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:47.229 
fiber vinyl and it looks pretty good I
think

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:47.239 
think

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:51.940 
think
so<00:01:48.020> here's<00:01:48.950> what's<00:01:49.189> up<00:01:50.110> five<00:01:51.110> buttons<00:01:51.439> this

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
so here's what's up five buttons this

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.389 
so here's what's up five buttons this
one's<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.369> main<00:01:52.630> turns<00:01:53.630> everything<00:01:53.989> on

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
one's the main turns everything on

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.949 
one's the main turns everything on
including<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.429> LEDs<00:01:55.909> but<00:01:56.179> also<00:01:56.360> powers<00:01:56.780> all

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959 
including the LEDs but also powers all

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.830 
including the LEDs but also powers all
the<00:01:57.079> switches<00:01:57.670> this<00:01:58.670> one's<00:01:58.939> going<00:01:59.179> to<00:01:59.270> be<00:01:59.360> the

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
the switches this one's going to be the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.770 
the switches this one's going to be the
trunk<00:02:00.110> pop<00:02:00.670> much<00:02:01.670> like<00:02:01.849> what<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.209> alarm<00:02:02.509> does

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
trunk pop much like what the alarm does

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.020 
trunk pop much like what the alarm does
I<00:02:03.110> don't<00:02:03.679> have<00:02:03.829> that<00:02:03.979> hooked<00:02:04.189> up<00:02:04.369> yet<00:02:04.579> because

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
I don't have that hooked up yet because

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.889 
I don't have that hooked up yet because
I<00:02:05.409> can't<00:02:06.409> seem<00:02:06.649> to<00:02:06.709> find<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.129> wire<00:02:07.310> that

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
I can't seem to find the wire that

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.470 
I can't seem to find the wire that
operates<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.889> actual<00:02:10.280> trunk<00:02:10.609> pop<00:02:10.819> itself

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
operates it the actual trunk pop itself

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.289 
operates it the actual trunk pop itself
this<00:02:12.470> is<00:02:12.650> actuator<00:02:13.130> up<00:02:13.370> this<00:02:13.639> is<00:02:13.790> actuator

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
this is actuator up this is actuator

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.170 
this is actuator up this is actuator
down<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:14.930> this<00:02:15.739> is<00:02:16.010> going<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.459> be<00:02:16.609> for<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:16.940> eld

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
down and this is going to be for the eld

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.289 
down and this is going to be for the eld
bypass<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.950> don't<00:02:19.459> have<00:02:19.609> this<00:02:19.760> hooked<00:02:20.000> up<00:02:20.120> yet

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
bypass I don't have this hooked up yet

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.410 
bypass I don't have this hooked up yet
either<00:02:20.480> but<00:02:20.930> I<00:02:21.200> thought<00:02:21.889> that<00:02:22.130> five<00:02:22.880> switches

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
either but I thought that five switches

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.240 
either but I thought that five switches
looked<00:02:23.630> better<00:02:23.900> than<00:02:24.139> stopping<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.250> for<00:02:27.250> so

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
looked better than stopping it for so

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.280 
looked better than stopping it for so

cockeyed because of the weight of the
trunk<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.959> so<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.560> doesn't<00:03:48.860> lock<00:03:49.010> which<00:03:49.459> is

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
trunk and so it doesn't lock which is

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.790 
not a big deal I can just have them push
down<00:03:51.350> on<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.560> top<00:03:52.000> or<00:03:53.000> I<00:03:53.050> can<00:03:54.050> get<00:03:54.230> my<00:03:54.380> lazy<00:03:54.650> ass
