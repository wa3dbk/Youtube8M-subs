00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 i 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.719
 very good to all people that such as 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.190
 you are and good as you can see I already have 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.610
 the call of duty black ops' I bought it 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.809
 yesterday yesterday Monday Monday 12 of 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.360
 November one day before the launch 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.180
 official already know that we play them 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.300
 normally they usually leave a day before 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.870
 normal in gametop gamestop and stores 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.790
 Similar 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.210
 Many people had it since the week 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.100
 previous since Friday saturday and good 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.170
 here here is made to delay a little 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.930
 but hey there is not much 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.230
 people to play the truth so good 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.550
 I will teach more or less the interface and 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.350
 the classes that I already have more or less 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.039
 created the streak of points that are not of 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.030
 low now it's by point you do not need 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:52.640
 now in killing people to get a 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.440
 charge or something similar if not for points 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.989
 that is, by taking flags you can already 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.949
 get what you want practically like that 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:04.580
 how good are we going to get to good iron 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.580
 even the micro is the jump that I have the 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.619
 type 25 as main as reflective 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.880
 Extended charger has loaded has expanded 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.290
 to the rapid charge the truth is that the 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.640
 extended charger I do not know when it 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.100
 blocks project appropriates later but to 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.710
 level of dawn 15 and this one in the box 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.770
 now I better connect to carry is 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.380
 10 games and I'm on level 4 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.979
 but it is not more or less how much you have 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.899
 it takes to get to level 15 but 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.730
 quite enough percent is needed 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.160
 I think 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.980
 it goes pretty well the also 25 the truth 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.960
 that the assault rifles in this 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.550
 black ops 2 edition are not there 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.020
 liking a lot will only be saved until the 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:51.490
 25 because the pfa is there 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.360
 so that it is 0 as I said 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.910
 semiautomatic you have to give it to 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.700
 read e 1 every time you want to shoot 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.550
 it does a lot of damage but the maps maybe 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.480
 they do not have the role to use this 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.910
 gun are not all very tiny very 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.290
 It's not too small, but there's a lot 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.510
 movement and has you can come by 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.940
 all sides you can not be in 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.480
 a position with that weapon is not 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.590
 luck is impossible to give us 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.230
 I have used it but I have been told that 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.810
 it is not very final and regretting is 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.240
 Pretty good is the one that comes to you from 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.070
 the beginning but I prefer the 325 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.290
 and then we have here shotguns 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.840
 light machine guns rifles 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:39.020
 precision and specials that is the shield 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.910
 who celebrated that at level 34 674 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.140
 after second I have the fence 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.090
 stable 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.430
 you can have the ballistic knife but 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.800
 I know why at level 49 very late maybe 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.940
 ok then there are the guns that the 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.280
 better is the tag 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.370
 so far for now the best is the 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.920
 tactics that I used the one I was using 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.390
 me and we already managed to launch rockets for the 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.390
 Bitch those who want 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.379
 well I'm going to put axesor to 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.930
 the crossbow can put all this that 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.819
 come here you can put up a zoom 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.370
 to camp with the crossbow the truth 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.019
 is that it had happened to me and already 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.549
 then of advantage, well, the same 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.680
 that in the white are the maybe good 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.100
 with small modifications I have a line 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.950
 hard 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.340
 Coldblood though that resistance 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.340
 electric 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.350
 to greece in the best conditions for 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.960
 paint faster 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.710
 I do not know yet if you can block the 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.910
 improbable skills I have no idea 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.880
 and then connect with the usual ones 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.640
 I have a grenade because I like it 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.650
 delay I like to keep one in my hand 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.970
 and then throw it and I fell where there 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:56.319
 dropped the centex it begins to count 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:59.140
 since you release them and it also sticks 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.910
 and achieve with shin beth and eyes because 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.540
 this one is 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.489
 look at a slut of a slut 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.739
 and then I have in the other class 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.379
 I use that is the submachine gun that the mp7 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.060
 it is very very well close to save 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.090
 those who have the target that everyone 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.359
 put on the mp city go to knock down 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.630
 24/7 leave to freak out be very very 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.900
 well I have already the level 12 raised 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.720
 not competent enough and worth 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.160
 now it has no competence the reader is 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.860
 nefarious of msc has not tried it but I 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.550
 they said that also 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.479
 but I do not know I want to try or to 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.479
 try today 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.030
 to try this because here in the 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.890
 graphics where cadence is damaged the 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.420
 almost precision that you already have better 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:57.230
 numbers that the mp7 is worth then is the 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:05:00.350
 vdw of 57 which is pretty good but it's 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.520
 maybe more for long distance with your 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.630
 rifle that serves for long distances 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.820
 but not 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.490
 does not have that damage that the mpt has 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.150
 short distance and then we have 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.720
 the same in advance 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.970
 I have a reflective look after 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.000
 secondary I have a rocket launcher 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.880
 leaving to the plane is my ranch below 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.120
 a friend 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.650
 let's continue then the rest of the 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.560
 everything personalized perhaps the most 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.230
 Personalized fear is the frank but that 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.750
 this semiautomatic is pretty good 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.750
 you have to give but it's pretty good 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.040
 with three shots that we in the head you 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:47.660
 the loads and one or two and the 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:50.420
 head and then with this already a shot a 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.070
 shot no longer kill I think 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.920
 so 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.900
 we go back to buy consumption that is the 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.139
 snipers will shoot more by winning a 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.240
 threw 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.249
 and then the streaks of knitting I have 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.310
 the next place because I struggle less 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:07.860
 it's a fake and then the attack 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.870
 lightning that is very highly recommended 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.400
 especially if we get together because you 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.499
 loads to the whole team I throw low 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.870
 multiple we go with the lightning attack 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:17.129
 a lot of multiple basses in that 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.159
 that we have not already know all of 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:23.279
 the cox a pose that goes by control 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:26.689
 remote and and it exploits okay and then there's the 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:28.969
 baby who is the lifelong 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:30.200
 the plane that points you enemies in 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:33.650
 mini map 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.820
 is this hunter is very funny to see is 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.000
 like a paper airplane but with 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.500
 explosives you throw them into the air and he goes 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.700
 circling and when you consider someone 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:48.010
 it streaks against him and kills him 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:49.470
 and has not tried anything else because that's a 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.180
 helicopter 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.790
 it's like an attack drone the way to 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:57.009
 morph 3 but by air 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:07:00.520
 since I hit him is a couple of bullets already 

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:03.759
 and you're already burdened, but if not, if you do not 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:06.800
 gives the enemy for charging the fire 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:09.229
 you can do a lot of damage 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.060
 and well we are less interface 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.610
 they have very strict 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.229
 you can edit the code card voucher and 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.870
 good any doubt you put it to me for 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:20.990
 the comments and well see you tomorrow 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:25.330
 that came up in a new video of the black 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.330
 ops a greeting goodbye people
