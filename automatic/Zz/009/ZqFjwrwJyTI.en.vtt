00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 finally let's dance and the 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.930
 most will say who 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.370
 interested because this shit so long 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.510
 bushido is not there I watch the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.740
 Dirty just do not and I have to 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.420
 say like she's just the same 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.650
 own the bushido would join in 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.870
 I would not look the shit, too 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.369
 but there are a few candidates 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.949
 they are always the pan and 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:25.289
 I thought hey catches me last time 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.480
 to new idiots candidates the flag 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.779
 one of the worst people there 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.189
 empathize is elisa armani knows 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.270
 maybe one or the other at 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.370
 qvc shop mush and from earlier 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.890
 meanwhile, this woman is about 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.829
 2013 as stand up comedian along the way 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.230
 its kind yes i am persian and do 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.570
 me about perser funny very innovative 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.360
 immigrants they have over their own 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.059
 make fun of the origin is not so 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.850
 that there are already bad I think 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.980
 that she is absolutely unhappy and shit 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.899
 is what has to happen so after 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.520
 and after a while she will be better 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.890
 but apparently a little more 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.930
 To get acquaintance makes them 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.270
 let's dance with more than look 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.520
 the old one is not bad either 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.060
 I think they are invited everywhere 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.549
 will therefore showcase quotas immigrant 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.409
 I think I puke if they at least 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.259
 The whole thing will not make me happy 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.020
 get upset but puke next 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.869
 interesting candidate katja burkard 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.610
 the proof that you can still do that 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.680
 As a moderator completely attacked 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.470
 unsuitable because you are not right 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.450
 talking can throw you up anyway 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.130
 then and most think 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.350
 who have suddenly slept up yet 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.750
 that is even with the former 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.810
 meanwhile former rtl 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.909
 the editor of the magazine clearly why 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.920
 but that makes it okay you have to go with it 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.090
 Optionally say so you can point me 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.290
 12 actually do not look at it 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.290
 who were not there 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.259
 so good what you do 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:10.970
 Now we have finished 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:12.950
 yes I do not mean me first and then 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.980
 still in the process 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.280
 daniel küblböck my bucket castle 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.290
 or how that means a voice is something 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.599
 meanwhile, but can even win 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.900
 amazingly, but makes frank 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.640
 Sinatra though he actually is me 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.440
 you do not really know what that is 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.540
 But this küblböck does not matter 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.550
 that will certainly be interesting because he 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.019
 will have a huge press like 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.030
 It's always good that he is not 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.739
 again and again as a subject matter expert 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.110
 Junglecamp is where he sees his 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.780
 stupid sow can be insulted and 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.830
 but as usual but good 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.200
 that we use this tv again and again 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.480
 see thank you very much germany 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.959
 or thank you rtl that you 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.930
 this monsters of pop and us always 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:04.099
 panna cotta floats again in the air 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.760
 patriot petri petri dojo I can 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.890
 pronounce 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.280
 most of the audience, of course 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.989
 do not know at all or 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.239
 hey they will say that but the 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.640
 olle the constantly with mario barth 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.560
 turns up where you do not know what 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.040
 which actually does or who that is 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.900
 and what they are looking for the most 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.280
 people are now, so to speak, directly the 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.799
 cars rather infobox I find se 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.859
 the person is not bad but annoys me 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:36.430
 that constantly at the crime scene and man 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.630
 ask yourself or you think aha 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.299
 main thing third thing good 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.900
 I ended up looking at the bathroom 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.989
 puke 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.139
 there's this detlef Steve's this 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.180
 so to speak, the long-lasting face of vox like that 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.489
 one mist after another with those 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.440
 comes and you switch when you join 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.160
 vox constantly passes to his eat 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.940
 have and you think 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.190
 old Swede how many years will he be 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.190
 but still puffed up and down when 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.470
 is he finally sucked it out 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.560
 but no, it is not enough 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.319
 Now he also had to join rtl 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.810
 let's dance be heard 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.690
 1 dokusoap idiot actually only 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.720
 rumschreit and rom does not catch himself 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.060
 gets right in line and as 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.830
 Depp the nation there is or 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.220
 which is supposedly everyone 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.780
 can identify 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.030
 because the people are all so stupid 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.820
 are like that, so I think so 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.190
 puke still such a thing-nothing celebrity 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.090
 But no tail needs the main thing 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.460
 dance 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.350
 I know the rest of the candidates 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.520
 not at all or they are so boring 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.760
 that you actually do not 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.050
 but should mention the above 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.240
 Candidates are in some ways 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.820
 but I am so interesting 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.560
 the bag that I never live in this 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.630
 shit watching 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.330
 Thank you rtl for choosing me 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.700
 did hey dance in the 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.330
 watching celebs everywhere anyway 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.330
 I should annoy me look at it 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.330
 No
