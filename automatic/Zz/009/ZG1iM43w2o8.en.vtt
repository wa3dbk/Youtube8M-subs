the<00:01:45.180> trampoline<00:01:45.660> I<00:01:45.780> guess<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:47.190> is

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
the trampoline I guess and this is

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.670 
the trampoline I guess and this is
actually<00:01:47.730> cyborg<00:01:48.450> mode<00:01:48.690> so<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.320> gives<00:01:49.530> you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
actually cyborg mode so this gives you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.290 
actually cyborg mode so this gives you
the<00:01:49.800> Terminator<00:01:50.400> looking<00:01:50.760> to<00:01:50.820> feel<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.210> your

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
the accelerometer of the Nano makes the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.290 
the accelerometer of the Nano makes the
kaleidoscope<00:03:00.569> change<00:03:01.260> that's<00:03:01.680> pretty<00:03:01.920> cool

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
kaleidoscope change that's pretty cool

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.120 
kaleidoscope change that's pretty cool
I'm<00:03:03.300> rotating<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.019> Nano<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.950> whole

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
I'm rotating the Nano the whole

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.710 
I'm rotating the Nano the whole
kaleidoscope<00:03:05.700> view<00:03:05.880> is<00:03:05.970> changing<00:03:06.330> ala<00:03:06.480> kind

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
kaleidoscope view is changing ala kind

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.860 
kaleidoscope view is changing ala kind
of<00:03:06.810> pan<00:03:07.349> through<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.830> yard<00:03:08.630> that's<00:03:09.630> kind<00:03:09.840> of

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
of pan through the yard that's kind of

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.150 
of pan through the yard that's kind of
cool

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.520 

mere<00:03:13.880> mode<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:14.360> as<00:03:14.480> we<00:03:14.600> can<00:03:14.690> see<00:03:14.750> here<00:03:14.900> there<00:03:15.380> is

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
mere mode so as we can see here there is

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.320 
mere mode so as we can see here there is
actually<00:03:15.860> not<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.310> of<00:03:16.490> Mallory<00:03:16.820> jumping

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
actually not to of Mallory jumping

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.510 
actually not to of Mallory jumping
there's<00:03:17.990> just<00:03:18.140> one<00:03:18.260> but<00:03:18.740> we<00:03:18.860> see<00:03:19.040> two<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.460> the

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
there's just one but we see two and the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.120 
there's just one but we see two and the
farther<00:03:19.790> I<00:03:19.910> move<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.240> camera<00:03:20.710> and<00:03:21.710> if<00:03:21.860> I<00:03:21.950> bring

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
farther I move the camera and if I bring

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.030 
farther I move the camera and if I bring
them<00:03:22.250> closer<00:03:22.490> I<00:03:23.680> think<00:03:24.680> they<00:03:24.740> are<00:03:24.770> almost

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
them closer I think they are almost

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.650 
them closer I think they are almost
becoming<00:03:25.430> one<00:03:25.730> then<00:03:25.940> they<00:03:26.060> disappear<00:03:26.510> when

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
becoming one then they disappear when

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.360 
becoming one then they disappear when
they<00:03:26.720> get<00:03:26.840> too<00:03:26.990> close<00:03:27.110> to<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.860> focal<00:03:28.190> point<00:03:28.220> of

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
they get too close to the focal point of

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.250 
they get too close to the focal point of
the<00:03:28.460> camera<00:03:28.700> there<00:03:28.850> there<00:03:29.840> we<00:03:29.930> go<00:03:32.260> that's

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
the camera there there we go that's

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.180 
the camera there there we go that's
pretty<00:03:33.530> weird

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.580 

oh<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.910> is<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.060> Bulge<00:03:39.390> mode<00:03:39.810> now<00:03:40.260> Mallory

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
oh this is the Bulge mode now Mallory

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.770 
oh this is the Bulge mode now Mallory
really<00:03:40.920> is<00:03:41.070> not<00:03:41.250> 200<00:03:41.880> pounds<00:03:42.210> as<00:03:42.300> she<00:03:42.390> jumps<00:03:42.600> on

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
really is not 200 pounds as she jumps on

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.650 
really is not 200 pounds as she jumps on
this<00:03:42.870> trampoline<00:03:43.940> it<00:03:44.940> kind<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.210> bulges<00:03:45.570> out

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
this trampoline it kind of bulges out

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:57.210 
this trampoline it kind of bulges out
the<00:03:45.840> center<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.440> camera<00:03:46.770> lens<00:03:46.920> here

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.830 

for<00:03:57.790> some<00:03:57.940> blur<00:03:58.120> mode<00:03:58.390> so

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
for some blur mode so

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.140 
for some blur mode so
folks<00:03:59.140> no<00:03:59.560> there<00:03:59.830> is<00:03:59.920> not<00:04:00.099> a<00:04:00.129> focus<00:04:00.640> problem

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
folks no there is not a focus problem

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.600 
folks no there is not a focus problem
with<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.599> Nano<00:04:01.810> this<00:04:02.080> is<00:04:02.200> actually<00:04:02.610> motion

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
with the Nano this is actually motion

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.869 
with the Nano this is actually motion
blur<00:04:04.620> so<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:05.709> kind<00:04:05.890> of<00:04:05.920> makes<00:04:06.069> it<00:04:06.250> blurry<00:04:06.519> every

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
blur so it kind of makes it blurry every

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:15.590 
blur so it kind of makes it blurry every
once<00:04:07.060> in<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.209> while<00:04:07.360> here

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.550 

oh<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:16.140> is<00:04:16.230> called<00:04:16.500> dent<00:04:17.780> I'm<00:04:18.780> not<00:04:19.200> quite<00:04:19.530> sure

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
oh it is called dent I'm not quite sure

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.040 
oh it is called dent I'm not quite sure
what<00:04:20.160> dent<00:04:20.430> means<00:04:22.760> looks<00:04:23.760> like<00:04:23.970> thin<00:04:24.390> compared

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
what dent means looks like thin compared

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.210 
what dent means looks like thin compared
to<00:04:25.230> the<00:04:25.530> Bulge<00:04:27.530> it's<00:04:28.530> kind<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:28.830> weird<00:04:28.860> mode

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
to the Bulge it's kind of a weird mode

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.519 
to the Bulge it's kind of a weird mode
don't<00:04:29.520> really<00:04:29.700> like

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:32.529 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:35.309 

rural<00:04:33.249> mode<00:04:33.489> so<00:04:33.849> as<00:04:33.969> you<00:04:34.089> can<00:04:34.179> see<00:04:34.389> it<00:04:34.659> makes

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:35.319 
rural mode so as you can see it makes

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.829 
rural mode so as you can see it makes
them<00:04:35.559> center<00:04:36.009> of<00:04:36.159> the<00:04:36.389> camera<00:04:37.389> kind<00:04:37.599> of<00:04:37.719> a

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:37.839 
them center of the camera kind of a

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:40.469 
them center of the camera kind of a
twist<00:04:38.789> really<00:04:39.789> looks<00:04:39.999> a<00:04:40.059> little<00:04:40.149> crazy

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
twist really looks a little crazy

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.069 
twist really looks a little crazy
they're<00:04:40.779> kind<00:04:41.109> of<00:04:41.169> like<00:04:41.349> I<00:04:42.689> keep<00:04:43.689> jumping

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:44.079 
they're kind of like I keep jumping

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:47.009 
they're kind of like I keep jumping
there<00:04:44.199> looks<00:04:44.769> funny<00:04:44.979> and<00:04:45.129> twist<00:04:45.939> it<00:04:46.269> makes<00:04:46.929> you

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:47.019 
there looks funny and twist it makes you

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:52.109 
there looks funny and twist it makes you
go<00:04:47.079> like<00:04:47.199> this<00:04:48.179> yeah<00:04:49.179> kind<00:04:49.959> of<00:04:50.019> strange<00:04:51.119> so

00:04:52.109 --> 00:04:52.119 
go like this yeah kind of strange so

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:55.050 
go like this yeah kind of strange so
weird

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.480 

which<00:04:55.750> is<00:04:55.870> pretty<00:04:55.990> cool<00:04:56.230> it<00:04:56.470> just<00:04:56.530> focuses<00:04:57.130> on

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
which is pretty cool it just focuses on

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.280 
which is pretty cool it just focuses on
the<00:04:57.669> center<00:04:58.030> and<00:04:58.150> everything<00:04:58.450> else<00:04:58.600> is<00:04:58.900> a<00:04:58.960> blur

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
the center and everything else is a blur

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.190 
the center and everything else is a blur
around<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.889> outside<00:05:00.690> so<00:05:01.690> let's<00:05:01.870> take<00:05:02.050> it<00:05:02.139> over

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
around the outside so let's take it over

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.270 
around the outside so let's take it over
here<00:05:02.380> to<00:05:02.470> carry<00:05:02.710> out<00:05:02.860> in<00:05:02.919> the<00:05:02.980> middle<00:05:03.130> of<00:05:03.220> the

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
here to carry out in the middle of the

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.650 
here to carry out in the middle of the
grass<00:05:03.700> there<00:05:04.169> she's<00:05:05.169> clear<00:05:05.500> and<00:05:05.800> as<00:05:05.980> you<00:05:06.100> see

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
grass there she's clear and as you see

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.750 
grass there she's clear and as you see
as<00:05:07.660> I<00:05:07.780> move<00:05:07.810> around<00:05:10.919> just<00:05:11.919> focuses<00:05:12.370> in<00:05:12.490> on<00:05:12.580> the

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
as I move around just focuses in on the

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:19.790 
as I move around just focuses in on the
center<00:05:13.300> of<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.750> pitcher

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.540

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
last mode which is stretch kind of makes

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:39.860 
last mode which is stretch kind of makes
the<00:05:26.639> center<00:05:27.090> of<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.330> picture<00:05:27.479> longer<00:05:38.870> and
