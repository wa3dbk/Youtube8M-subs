00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.610
 good morning good 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.279
 today we're going to see how to take advantage of the 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:28.599
 samsung galaxy tab 38.0 is the name of the no 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:33.400
 the code of the smt 310 model therefore 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:36.180
 we will go to download or dean or from here and 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.710
 then we go to download this file 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.970
 perfect now they put you the link in 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.620
 description so don't worry 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.840
 tall 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.340
 ok let's go now let's see first 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.290
 what to do on the tablet and then how 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.070
 know 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:56.940
 knows how to do with order here 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.910
 here we are with the tablets and we will have to go 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.340
 on info on the device and if on the boards 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.470
 we will have to press seven times now saying 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.610
 necessary developer mode of is 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.740
 been activated 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.810
 we will go on developer options and 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.170
 we will have to activate usb debugging 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.720
 once the usb debug is activated you need to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.530
 come back 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.110
 turn off the tablet turn off 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.119
 ok it's basically after turning off the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.170
 tablet must make a series of keys 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:34.170
 which will be the power key volume up 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:38.270
 low volume down and at the key and home key 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.270
 so let's go get them 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.509
 here we are fair to press the button 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.530
 volume up well and now back to the 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.289
 computer to show you or here we are 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.470
 here guys once put the phone 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:59.790
 in download mode and it will have detected it 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.000
 we will have to go to pda note pd analysis a 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.870
 don't send it up 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:21.010
 on the desktop and we will have to take where 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:21.010

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:30.709
 desktop should be lollo too 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.780
 here he is, yes, because we have to 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:42.530
 obviously we have to remove it from the must 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:46.700
 take it out then let's open it here it is 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:52.790
 this perfect md5 file will then come out 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:54.530
 we straiano from here here comes here 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.200
 to say that then I ting is also in 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.830
 this in this file so there are no 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.310
 problems 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.810
 so let's go here, then 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.610
 let's go to open we are all like 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.519
 note that we will have detected a path 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.739
 we will have to scrapped start been between 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.709
 a series of steps you see the covers the 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.940
 his tablet will come out a moment string like 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.540
 in the loading phase 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.540
 however if it is reset it sees three sets 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:31.400
 here is how nice now doing away 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.989

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:55.790
