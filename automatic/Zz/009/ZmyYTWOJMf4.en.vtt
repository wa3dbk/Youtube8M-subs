00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
had the pros and cons but the biggest

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.319 
had the pros and cons but the biggest
con<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.739> all<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.040> them<00:00:41.190> was<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.640> 380<00:00:42.000> caliber

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
con for all of them was the 380 caliber

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.549

and<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.989> know<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.110> would<00:00:43.290> feel<00:00:43.469> more

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
and you know I would feel more

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.990 
and you know I would feel more
comfortable<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.040> nine-millimeter<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.820> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
comfortable to nine-millimeter so I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.799 
comfortable to nine-millimeter so I
bought<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:46.010> lc9<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.489> based<00:00:48.270> off<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
bought this lc9 it's based off of the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.410 
bought this lc9 it's based off of the
LCP<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.260> mean<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> looks<00:00:49.770> very<00:00:50.579> similar<00:00:50.940> -<00:00:51.270> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
LCP I mean it looks very similar - it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.299 
LCP I mean it looks very similar - it
does<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.170> some<00:00:52.410> things<00:00:52.590> else<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:52.949> doesn't

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309

that<00:00:56.160> little<00:00:56.309> catch<00:00:56.550> there<00:00:56.850> which<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:58.070> really

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that little catch there which is really

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.920 
that little catch there which is really
hard<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> release<00:00:59.789> basically<00:01:00.270> impossible<00:01:00.510> to

realized it's the exact same width as an

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.330 
realized it's the exact same width as an
XD<00:02:39.720> S<00:02:39.870> which<00:02:40.319> is<00:02:40.349> made<00:02:40.560> by<00:02:40.590> Springfield<00:02:41.159> and

XD S which is made by Springfield and
it's<00:02:41.430> chambered<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:41.819> 45<00:02:42.209> ACP<00:02:42.359> this<00:02:43.079> is<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.260> 9

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.800 
it's chambered in 45 ACP this is a 9
millimeter<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.189> the<00:02:44.370> 45<00:02:44.700> ACP<00:02:45.269> is<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.569> same

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
millimeter and the 45 ACP is the same

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
width as it that's just crazy to me this

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.190 
width as it that's just crazy to me this
thing<00:02:47.909> should<00:02:48.030> be<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.180> lot<00:02:48.389> skinnier<00:02:48.720> than<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.930> 45

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
thing should be a lot skinnier than a 45

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.770 
thing should be a lot skinnier than a 45
ACP<00:02:49.799> my<00:02:50.220> biggest<00:02:50.400> problem<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:50.879> why<00:02:51.569> would<00:02:51.720> I

seven<00:04:22.320> rounds<00:04:22.620> all<00:04:22.740> through<00:04:22.919> it<00:04:23.039> just<00:04:23.190> like<00:04:23.370> I

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
seven rounds all through it just like I

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.219

expected that little extra click in
there<00:04:25.320> tricked<00:04:25.620> me<00:04:25.710> that<00:04:25.889> one<00:04:26.009> time<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.460> I<00:04:26.970> did

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
there tricked me that one time and I did

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.999 
there tricked me that one time and I did
let<00:04:27.870> it<00:04:27.990> out<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.199> that<00:04:28.350> and<00:04:28.500> then<00:04:28.590> try<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:28.830> pull

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
let it out to that and then try to pull

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.129 
let it out to that and then try to pull
the<00:04:29.100> trigger<00:04:29.250> and<00:04:29.550> it<00:04:29.639> got<00:04:29.759> stuck<00:04:30.060> so<00:04:30.300> that's<00:04:30.990> a
