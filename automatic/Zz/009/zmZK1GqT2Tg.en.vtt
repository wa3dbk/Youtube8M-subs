00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.340
 there are many problems now affecting 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.690
 family 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.949
 You know the family is the cell. 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.140
 of society 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.680
 We call it the maternal cell. 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.859
 mother cell society as well as the network is 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.380
 formed of several connected links 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.840
 if you're cutting those links you 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.660
 destroys the net so the society 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.880
 if you are destroyed the families you 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.129
 destroys society is like our 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.079
 I am not a retired 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.399
 cells but if the cells were being 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.430
 destroyed 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.399
 they become cancerous that happens with 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.210
 the fabric it dies and the person 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.600
 passes away 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.879
 then if the family is destroyed 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.860
 society will be destroyed and what we 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.289
 we are realizing today that society 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.469
 is being destroyed because the family 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.300
 is being destroyed and because the family 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.740
 is being destroyed because the family 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.530
 today no longer follows the law of God 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.040
 God was the one who made the family man. 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.240
 has the woman and told the man and 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.810
 woman grow and multiply 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:26.820
 I will subdue the earth and God will establish 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.909
 laws and regulations for the family exist but 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.829
 unfortunately, modern man no longer wants 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.409
 more to follow God than to follow the 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.750
 their own laws 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.150
 then the marriage that is the basis of 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:44.130
 family it is supported in three points 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:47.009
 the fidelity of the couple to 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.090
 indissolubility of marriage and 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.420
 their children and constitutes the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.840
 family according to God's will 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.210
 first there can be no infidelity 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.869
 there can be adultery 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:08.250
 neither thought nor decoration and less 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:11.870
 still of acts because adultery breaks 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.890
 the adulterous family breaks the marriage 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.160
 swore to another love 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.740
 to put me finger in an alliance that 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.380
 alliance that we married put into the 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.850
 hands means covenant that christ made 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:30.410
 with the church the church is the wife of christ 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.620
 when a married person practices adultery 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.870
 he is breaking this alliance 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.880
 and this covenant is a sign of the covenant of the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.520
 christ with the church 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.030
 so you 're somehow smearing 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.660
 the union of Christ with the church 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.910
 today adultery is a terrible sin is 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.220
 a sin that destroys the family that leads 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.080
 many marriages end up on which our 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.920
 family break up 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:04.530
 another problem that greatly affects the family 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:07.500
 is the separation not always the separation 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.170
 happens because of an adultery not 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.910
 they are often fights of the couple going 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.590
 continuing are often problems 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.850
 unresolved 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.190
 Then you need to remember that 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:24.750
 behind a separation there are consequences 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:27.630
 painful first for the two 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.420
 besides the woman who separates it is as if a 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.660
 plucked another piece of living because 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.000
 a life together and see an intimacy 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.640
 shared life and now they will 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.570
 from the other is fragile and then the 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.120
 children 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:46.290
 That's why Jesus said do not separate the 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.910
 man what god therefore united the couples 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.180
 can not separate 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.150
 we must live a life in God 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.150
 a spiritual life to have strength to 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.799
 do not separate because what gives strength 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.620
 to the position in overcoming the problems 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:04.410
 win the differences win more 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.329
 we disagree that it is often normal in the 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.980
 marriage one thinks in a way of time 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.530
 on the other but to reach a 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.109
 consensus to a unity a color is needed 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.750
 that it is necessary to break the egoism that 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.760
 exists in us in the husband and the woman 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.150
 and whoever gives us the strength to do so is 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.440
 God is grace 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:27.130
 God is statistically proven that 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.620
 only one in every thousand couples who 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.949
 truly love God 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.729
 pray to the church have a life 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.759
 only one in a thousand if 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.229
 separate 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:44.020
 while those couples who do not have 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.840
 God does not have a religious life. 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.880
 I do not go to church or anything 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.289
 percentage of separation is extremely high 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:57.520
 greater is not one in a thousand is one in each 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:05:00.729
 50 is a costly then you need to be 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.820
 cultivate this love for marriage and 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.820
 family
