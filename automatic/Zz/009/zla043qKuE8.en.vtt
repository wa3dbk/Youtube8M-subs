 here the authorâ€™s carving no longer understood 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.169
 but I decided to change my presentation 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:31.589
 I get a small cake from him one 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.589
 did not leave such a feed online 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:45.969
 for the dough we need 400 grams of flour 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:49.320
