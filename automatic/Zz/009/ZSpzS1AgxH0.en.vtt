00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:06.609
 hello good this is a video of my 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:08.200
 creations with hama beats so you do not 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:12.450
 know that they are the flame beats are 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.450
 accounts that I have here a 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.190
 A) Yes 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.260
 and well they put on some molds and you go 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.900
 creating things but we already use a 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.330
 information video about them and some 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.939
 tutorial I'm going to show you what I've 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.590
 done for quite some time and what happens 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.880
 that I 'm not going to teach it because very 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.710
 from little to little because it takes 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.230
 enough time then that does not depend 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.940
 of what you do, I 'm not starting 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.360
 then it is not that you ask me to 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.700
 they have things like that super well excite 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.990
 I 'll show you in order of more or less 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.820
 what is better and what is worse 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.550
 then I'm going to leave you the things that I 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.280
 I think they are more well done than they are 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.710
 the ones that I've done most at the end of 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.600
 of what I was doing because I've 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.660
 stopped doing things until 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.699
 enough time because I lost though 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.760
 I lost in bed and could not do them 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:07.440
 so 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.440
 Estefan, I'm going to start 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.420
 more or less good I have this chick that 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:19.220
 since writer and stress 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.400
 It's pretty bad this puppy 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.410
 a boy 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.410
 the blonde girl and a brunette 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.939

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.899
 invention I have not used molds or anything or 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.310
 be molds ideas that like people and 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.799
 nothing 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.409
 you met teddy bears and tried 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.100
 make it like but I did not get this hello 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:48.420

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:52.430
 this is a maybe like that endless things 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.430
 letters from making an i 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.869
 cupcake 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.380
 this is a symbol of peace that is not 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.380
 here 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.250
 in pink 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:13.560
 a red heart a faith 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.560
 in the heart 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.319
 It's a duckling in the water 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.909
 this is a dog and it's very big and this one 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.670
 it divides it into two parts and it is the first 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.800
 this part then says the other and good 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.660
 I think it fits me pretty well 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.790
 This is a butterfly that what they 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.560
 they broke the antennas that are very 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.990
 small because it's easier to break 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.880
 a tree this kind of flower 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.880
 in this that says love 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.450
 this cycle 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.670
 this other flower 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.670
 for half 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.010
 this is a whale 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.819
 a lollipop 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:08.950
 this watermelon and this one in a 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.950
 pendant then if this one 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.780
 frozen 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.690
 a donut and good and now come the ones 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.610
 are newer than I have done that has 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.040
 copied internet models and those 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.709
 things I have until I have to paste 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.860
 because it's taken off is a camera and 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:31.120
 the goal is embossed is wrong 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.700
 but you see it is waiting 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.680
 these are like candy and I think that 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.560
 they are from some game or something but not now 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.080
 less with a rope 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.590

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.840

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.760

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.460

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.020

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.140

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.360

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.810
