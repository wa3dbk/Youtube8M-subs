 social and cultural rights that 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.360
 transform 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.939
 from the ancient civilizations the 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.789
 social events are intimately 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.990
 related to food and drink 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.570

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.520
 heritage of cultures can be 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.049
 define food as a language that 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.579
 it works as a system of 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.009
 communications and social interactions 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:12.060
 with which messages about 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.060
 society and the individual 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.930
 only the food has been present in the 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.189
 social events through history 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.170
 but also has contributed to the 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.269
 formation of traditions and roles within 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.180
 from each of the different societies 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.189
 for example for African cultures 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.890
 it is forbidden for man to enter the 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:34.530
 cook as this is reserved domain and 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.019
 privileged woman for women 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.700
 African black the kitchen is not only 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.549
 the place where she prepares the food 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.739
 it is also and especially it is a place 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.420

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.040
 the utensils and products of your 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.040
 sovereignty in community life 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.750
 in his need to feed himself 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.750
 human has found nice ways and 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.520
 pleasant to do it, however, not 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.440
 is exempt from external factors such as 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.110
 natural resources as you have 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.040
 the weather the culinary influences of 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.290
 other regions and migration etc. is 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.900
 difficult to imagine European cuisine without 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.850
 the original potato of america or the 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.110
 Italian pasta with tomatoes 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.720
 from america and china pasta 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.340
 nowadays the kitchen is reflected by 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.680
 the syncretism of different cultures 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.170
 that have been related throughout 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.030
 history and globalization 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.700
 technology have facilitated the exchange 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.680
 of products and information thus giving 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.500
 place to a greater opening to kitchens 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.570
 international for example for the 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.430
 Mexican soft drinks are already part of 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.620
