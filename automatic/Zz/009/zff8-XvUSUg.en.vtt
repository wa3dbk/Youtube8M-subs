00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:06.889 

so<00:00:05.609> here's<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:05.910> way<00:00:06.060> that<00:00:06.270> we<00:00:06.359> can<00:00:06.540> kind<00:00:06.660> of<00:00:06.810> get

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
so here's a way that we can kind of get

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.600 
so here's a way that we can kind of get
used<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.230> our<00:00:07.350> core<00:00:07.770> base<00:00:07.980> aligning<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.490> by

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
used to our core base aligning is by

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.669 
used to our core base aligning is by
throwing<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.240> into<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.540> core<00:00:09.809> progression<00:00:10.320> all

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
throwing it into a core progression all

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:18.230 
throwing it into a core progression all
right<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.099> I'm<00:00:11.160> gonna<00:00:11.280> be<00:00:11.400> using<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.940> minor<00:00:17.240> as

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
right so I'm gonna be using a minor as

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.750 
right so I'm gonna be using a minor as
an<00:00:18.840> example<00:00:19.199> all<00:00:19.710> right<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.369> now<00:00:20.520> what<00:00:20.640> I'm

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
rest stay the same next we have C which

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.729 
rest stay the same next we have C which
means<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.940> my<00:00:54.059> pinky<00:00:54.449> stays<00:00:54.690> there<00:00:54.960> my<00:00:55.500> first
