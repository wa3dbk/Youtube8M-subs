00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.890
 welcome to another video 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.149
 we continue we continue with the lessons of 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.280
 guitar for people who have started with 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.020
 the people who want to start and we can 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.869
 follow on this occasion with a video 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.760
 talking about what the tones are 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.410
 Flats out there asked me to send 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.000
 a message asking me yes where it 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.009
 they found the tone of moles if I already 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.810
 We have said that F sharp solo sun 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.099
 sharp and all the tones that were 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.810
 here then where were the flats 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.970
 and the truth then and it happened to us 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.170
 tell them but it's something very easy is 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.030
 something simple something that is not 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.670
 much joke and we're going to try to 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.780
 see it and make it clear in this video ok 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.609
 then I would not moles from gizmo 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.170
 from my definition to the definition that 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.359
 I found them or whether I 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.789
 it is being that the tone that 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.240
 find between two tones between two 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.550
 Greater tones 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.480
 that is found by going through a tone of 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.560
 those a greater tone when lowering a fret 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.560
 ie more 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.460
 using the universal position I know 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.800
 that maybe some did not understand 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.210
 others yes but good is easier to 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.640
 show them with an example 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.550
 ok let's start first of all 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.840
 from sun not what is alone and scam 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.000
 the tone that is between sun and 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:26.220
 between alpha comes being more sustained 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.220
 gentlemen fa sharp is sun is very easy 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.030
 ok and it's the same for example let's 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:37.390
 be in the area between and between sun 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:41.250
 it's been sun sustained this tone 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.250
 it's also flat ok 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.350
 as you can see it is very easy and now 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.020
 let's go to another tone that comes 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.040
 being if we are in a cinema and we are 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.440
 in faith 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:02.290
 we cross this one if one is flat 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.290
 the sharp 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.680
 each 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.310
 ok we are in two because it has no flat 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.360
 it would be like that there simply is not any 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.960
 problem 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.960
 ok we are between ok 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:29.170
 we go through 1 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.170
 D flat here is here is 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:39.269
 we are king and we are in me 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.269
 Eb 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:50.580
 is sustained and sustained 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.280
 ok then I hope no one more or less 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.020
 understood as a summary I'm going to 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.170
 say which are the ones that use the most 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.050
 the most used flats in the 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.989
 current songs because they are being 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:07.950
 is the flat that are the most 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:11.970
 they use B flat the one that is most used 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.590
 also and my flat those three are the ones 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.989
 they will see practically any 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.000
 song or any other song that does not 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.519
 have it not be with greater shades 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.709
 normal and would pass all compass I hope 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.450
 that the subject has explained anything 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.970
 leave me there is a question any question 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.260
 this comment in the video gentlemen this 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.459
 it would be all shopping we help for 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.459
 approach the next video
