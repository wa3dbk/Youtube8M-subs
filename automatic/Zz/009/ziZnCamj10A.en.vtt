mid man-of-the-match card in the African
Cup<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.480> Nations<00:00:42.600> now<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.170> not<00:00:43.260> too

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
Cup of Nations now it's not too

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.290 
Cup of Nations now it's not too
unfortunate<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.550> typically<00:00:44.879> left<00:00:45.059> means

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
unfortunate but typically left means

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.700 
unfortunate but typically left means
don't<00:00:45.570> usually<00:00:45.719> score<00:00:46.079> for<00:00:46.320> me<00:00:46.440> personally

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
don't usually score for me personally

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.889 
don't usually score for me personally
and<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.730> kind<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.969> hard<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.210> judge<00:00:48.539> with<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
and it's kind of hard to judge with a

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.540 
and it's kind of hard to judge with a
left<00:00:49.170> mid<00:00:49.379> because<00:00:49.620> typically<00:00:49.980> they're<00:00:50.370> gonna

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
left mid because typically they're gonna

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.709 
left mid because typically they're gonna
be<00:00:50.670> running<00:00:50.789> up<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.210> down<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.449> field<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
be running up and down the field and

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.000 
be running up and down the field and
they're<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:52.079> basically<00:00:52.350> there<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.590> pass<00:00:52.800> or

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
they're just basically there to pass or

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.549 
they're just basically there to pass or
at<00:00:53.100> least<00:00:53.340> how<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> used<00:00:54.270> them<00:00:54.480> especially<00:00:55.469> in

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
at least how I used them especially in

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.020 
at least how I used them especially in
like<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> four<00:00:55.949> four<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.190> one<00:00:56.640> because<00:00:56.910> usually

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
like a four four one one because usually

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.459 
like a four four one one because usually
my<00:00:57.300> striker<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.750> my<00:00:57.840> centre<00:00:58.079> forward<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
my striker in my centre forward and

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.160 
my striker in my centre forward and
possibly<00:00:59.010> my<00:00:59.160> two<00:00:59.219> sentiments<00:00:59.789> you<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.629> will

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
possibly my two sentiments you know will

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.229 
possibly my two sentiments you know will
be<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> most<00:01:01.649> effective<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.160> me<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.550> my<00:01:02.699> mids

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
be the most effective for me and my mids

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.119 
be the most effective for me and my mids
are<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.539> there<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.899> pass<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.559> had<00:01:04.830> two<00:01:04.979> easy

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
are just there to pass so I had two easy

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.469 
are just there to pass so I had two easy
left<00:01:05.400> mid<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.790> wanted<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> convert<00:01:06.299> him<00:01:06.420> to

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
left mid but we wanted to convert him to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.789 
left mid but we wanted to convert him to
a<00:01:06.570> left<00:01:06.780> forward<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.080> he<00:01:07.140> could<00:01:07.320> get<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
a left forward so he could get on the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.620 
a left forward so he could get on the
scoresheet<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.340> little<00:01:08.549> bit<00:01:08.670> as<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.360> guys<00:01:09.479> can

that<00:01:38.130> did<00:01:38.340> happen<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.700> me<00:01:38.820> while<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.060> was

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
that did happen to me while I was

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.300 
that did happen to me while I was
playing<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:40.200> player<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.710> as<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.220> guys

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
playing with this player so as you guys

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.859 
playing with this player so as you guys
can<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.520> he<00:01:41.939> has<00:01:42.030> some<00:01:42.150> decent<00:01:42.299> ball<00:01:42.630> control

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
can see he has some decent ball control

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.810 
can see he has some decent ball control
so<00:01:43.320> decent<00:01:43.530> dribbling<00:01:44.009> at<00:01:44.100> 85<00:01:44.579> but

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
so decent dribbling at 85 but

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.950 
so decent dribbling at 85 but
unfortunately<00:01:45.270> he<00:01:45.329> does<00:01:45.479> only<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
unfortunately he does only have the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.569 
unfortunately he does only have the
three<00:01:46.140> star<00:01:46.350> schemas<00:01:46.770> three<00:01:47.369> stars

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
three star schemas three stars

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.859 
three star schemas three stars
definitely<00:01:47.790> good<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.210> would<00:01:48.329> be<00:01:48.360> worse<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:48.810> he

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
definitely good it would be worse if he

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.870 
definitely good it would be worse if he
only<00:01:49.020> had<00:01:49.229> two<00:01:49.380> pretty<00:01:49.890> decent<00:01:50.280> shot<00:01:50.430> power<00:01:50.640> at

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
only had two pretty decent shot power at

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.700 
only had two pretty decent shot power at
81<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.479> he<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.659> very<00:01:51.869> effective<00:01:52.229> when<00:01:52.470> he<00:01:52.560> does

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
81 so he is very effective when he does

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.770 
81 so he is very effective when he does
get<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.920> ball<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.340> know<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.210> his<00:01:54.390> foot<00:01:54.630> I

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
have no idea how somebody can be worse

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.780 
have no idea how somebody can be worse
but<00:02:46.210> it<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:46.870> awful<00:02:47.380> so<00:02:47.530> absurd<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.670> only

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
but it is so awful so absurd it only

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.490 
but it is so awful so absurd it only
score<00:02:49.060> seven<00:02:49.360> goals<00:02:49.540> in<00:02:49.630> 13<00:02:49.990> games<00:02:50.110> me<00:02:50.380> and

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
score seven goals in 13 games me and

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.900 
score seven goals in 13 games me and
it's<00:02:50.650> not<00:02:50.770> because<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.220> fact<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.610> he

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
it's not because of the fact that he

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.490 
it's not because of the fact that he
really<00:02:52.210> wasn't<00:02:52.480> getting<00:02:52.720> too<00:02:53.020> many<00:02:53.200> chances

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
really wasn't getting too many chances

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.230 
really wasn't getting too many chances
it<00:02:54.130> was<00:02:54.250> basically<00:02:54.550> due<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:54.910> fact<00:02:55.150> that

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
it was basically due to the fact that

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.330 
it was basically due to the fact that
some<00:02:55.570> of<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.800> some<00:02:56.800> of<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.950> shots<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:57.310> I

a many there's a you know for a ghanaian
and<00:04:13.570> also<00:04:14.080> for<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:15.580> legal<00:04:16.120> Portuguese<00:04:16.540> that

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
and also for the legal Portuguese that

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.270 
and also for the legal Portuguese that
there<00:04:16.780> aren't<00:04:17.020> too<00:04:17.140> many<00:04:17.170> better<00:04:17.650> left<00:04:17.980> mids

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280
