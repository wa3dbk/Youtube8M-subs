00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 How to cut the Iberian ham Cinco Jotas 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 the very important first issue is where to start slicing 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 it would be perfect 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 cut off the whole top 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 to be able to get slices of ham from its various sides 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 four different flavors, four different aromas and aromas 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 inside one, the same ham 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 for home consumption, it's best to start slicing from 'la Maza' 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 preparation 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 we will start cutting 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 we will need a whole set of tools 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 no doubt I think that they are a good friend of everyone who deals with cutting Jamón Ibérico 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 we will need three knives for the cutting time 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 the first one will only serve to start cutting the first layer removal 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 smaller knife for selection 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 and at the very end, a very flexible knife called 'jamonero' 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 to obtain thin slices of Jamon Ibérico ham 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 we take the first knife, we make a small incision 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 at the width of two fingers above the small bone, paying attention to the product 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 another important factor is temperature 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 two storage temperatures of the whole 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 at a time when we have not yet started eating and consuming 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 in the first case the temperature should be between 14 and 18 degrees 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 storage temperature while consuming is very important 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 it should be from 20 to 24 degrees 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 this will affect the organoleptic sensation of the ham 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 as you can see, we're now taking out the top layer of ham 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 but only the part that you will want to eat at this time 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 slicing 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 we cut the first slices that have the most fat 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 they will serve us for the subsequent maintenance of the ham 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 by covering meat that has not been cut yet 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 as you see, we do not use force to cut, 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 just slip the ham gently with a knife 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 we can enjoy the wonderful fragrance of the extraordinary 5J ham 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 you can feel the slice while rubbing 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 how fat easily melts is a sign that the product is of excellent quality 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 at this point we will use the smallest knife 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 where we separate the meat from the existing bone 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 in this way, the knife we ​​cut with slices will not touch the bones, 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 so it will not be exposed to blunting 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 As you can see, the knife does not touch the bone when cutting 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 in the previously selected point just jumps 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 which greatly facilitates cutting 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 now we repeat the previous act of cleansing meat from the first layer 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 at the moment the tip of the knife 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 we separate the layer creating a small channel that has two tasks 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 firstly for aesthetic reasons 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 second - more important, 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 fat and lipids will leak into this place 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 we repeat the activity of chopping the bones, using each piece of ham jamon Iberico 5J 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 How to make the most of the 5J product 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 We have reached the point where we see the entire bone 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 I touch a knife in different places 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 the bone is heard 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 as you can see, we use every scrap of Jamon Iberico Cinco Jotas 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 we turn the ham over 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 we cut the top part 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 when the whole top is cut 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 proceed to cut a small bone 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 first we locate 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 then cut through to the long bone 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 and we break gently without using too much force 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 now the work will be much more convenient 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 we take a small knife 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 and we repeat the act of separating the meat from the bone which will make our work easier 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 now when we continue cutting 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 in an easy way we can get perfectly thin slices 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 as we can see, this part of the ham is slightly different from the previous one 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 it is more muscular, it is equally appetizing 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 we are approaching the end of cutting 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 we left the last part, 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 in my opinion, not fully known, we will use everything in this way 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 At the moment, Jamon Iberico is slightly inclined 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 the slices that we now obtain will be wide, equally appetizing 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 last part 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 using the smallest knife 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 we will cut off the tiny cartilage 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 in this place we can slice ham into slices 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 be small cubes 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 Jamon Iberico was cut up 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 making the most of every piece of meat 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 if we combine the pure race jamon iberico de bellota 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 healthy food 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 what was born in Jabugo 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 we will receive Jamon 5J a real national treasure of Spain
