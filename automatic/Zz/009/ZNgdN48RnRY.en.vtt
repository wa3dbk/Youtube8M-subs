photography to me there's many different

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
really good climbing photograph you want

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.200 
really good climbing photograph you want
to<00:00:39.690> capture<00:00:39.870> good<00:00:40.110> action<00:00:40.700> but<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.850> also<00:00:41.970> want

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
to capture good action but you also want

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.369 
to capture good action but you also want
to<00:00:42.239> try<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:42.630> a<00:00:42.660> balance<00:00:43.020> between<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
to try and get a balance between the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.040 
to try and get a balance between the
action<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.640> landscape<00:00:45.120> incorporating

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the whole holistic thing through into

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.270 
the whole holistic thing through into
the<00:00:48.329> image<00:00:48.600> as<00:00:48.930> well<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.710> capturing<00:00:50.160> the

action is to me the challenge one of the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.450 
action is to me the challenge one of the
the<00:00:55.140> greatest<00:00:55.350> challenges<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.070> climbing

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the greatest challenges in climbing

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.569 
the greatest challenges in climbing
photography<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.239> getting<00:00:58.010> into<00:00:59.010> position<00:00:59.429> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
photography is getting into position to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.250 
photography is getting into position to
get<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.210> angle<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.750> want<00:01:00.929> to<00:01:00.989> get<00:01:01.140> on

get the angle that you want to get on
the<00:01:01.350> client<00:01:01.679> because<00:01:01.890> often<00:01:02.730> there's<00:01:02.940> this

theoretical place out in space that you
really<00:01:05.460> want<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.880> get<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.090> amazing

perspective looking in on the climber
and<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.150> can't<00:01:09.810> get<00:01:10.050> to<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.230> very

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
and you just can't get to that very

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.780 
and you just can't get to that very
easily<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.950> mean<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.280> really<00:01:11.400> want<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> be<00:01:11.760> out

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
perspective as the wall drops away you

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.780 
perspective as the wall drops away you
know<00:01:16.229> over<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.829> years<00:01:16.860> I've<00:01:17.130> tried<00:01:17.369> lots<00:01:17.640> of

know over the years I've tried lots of
different<00:01:18.060> things<00:01:18.240> sometimes<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:18.990> jump

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
different things sometimes you can jump

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.810 
different things sometimes you can jump
out<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:20.040> that's<00:01:20.340> sort<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.700> bit

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
out but that's sort of a bit

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.030 
out but that's sort of a bit
hit-and-miss<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.930> sometimes<00:01:22.500> ways<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.950> you

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
hit-and-miss is sometimes ways that you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.850

photography is trying to get rid of
camera<00:01:36.390> shake<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.670> hold<00:01:38.970> yourself

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
camera shake and and just hold yourself

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
in a position that's stable so you've

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.600 
in a position that's stable so you've
got<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.149> employ<00:01:42.390> little<00:01:42.689> tricks<00:01:42.960> like

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
got to employ little tricks like

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.069 
got to employ little tricks like
connecting<00:01:44.610> your<00:01:44.700> rope<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> rock<00:01:45.479> with

connecting your rope to the rock with
protection<00:01:46.469> so<00:01:47.009> you're<00:01:47.130> not<00:01:47.189> swinging<00:01:47.549> around

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
protection so you're not swinging around

protection so you're not swinging around
in<00:01:47.969> space<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.229> use<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> chest<00:01:49.950> harness<00:01:50.159> in

in space and I use a chest harness in
addition<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.180> normal<00:01:51.299> waist<00:01:51.810> harness<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
addition to the normal waist harness and

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.859 
addition to the normal waist harness and
that<00:01:53.280> just<00:01:53.460> helps<00:01:53.759> me<00:01:53.909> lean<00:01:54.329> back<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.780> it

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
that just helps me lean back and it

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.719 
that just helps me lean back and it
takes<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.170> lot<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.320> my<00:01:55.500> weight<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.549> allows

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
takes a lot of my weight and that allows

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.120 
takes a lot of my weight and that allows
me<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.030> hold<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.329> camera<00:01:57.509> steady<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.289> I<00:01:58.560> find

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
me to hold the camera steady and I find

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.620 
me to hold the camera steady and I find
that<00:01:59.189> pretty<00:01:59.430> much<00:01:59.610> essential<00:02:00.180> for<00:02:00.329> taking

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that pretty much essential for taking

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.639 
that pretty much essential for taking

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
and angle that I've been thinking about

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.720 
and angle that I've been thinking about
for<00:02:11.940> about<00:02:12.300> 12<00:02:12.660> years<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.350> just<00:02:13.730> kept

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.310 
for about 12 years and I just kept
thinking<00:02:14.790> how<00:02:15.240> great<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.810> would<00:02:15.900> be<00:02:15.960> if<00:02:16.110> you

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
thinking how great it would be if you

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.780

about<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.709> digital<00:04:08.340> as<00:04:08.489> well<00:04:08.520> is<00:04:08.850> that<00:04:09.060> the

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
about the digital as well is that the

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.380 
about the digital as well is that the
live<00:04:09.450> view<00:04:10.160> can<00:04:11.160> be<00:04:11.459> really<00:04:11.940> handy<00:04:12.120> for

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
live view can be really handy for

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.390 
live view can be really handy for
getting<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.690> camera<00:04:12.989> into<00:04:13.170> positions<00:04:13.680> which

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
getting the camera into positions which

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
would otherwise be a bit too awkward to

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
get the camera to when I upside down

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.460 
get the camera to when I upside down
before<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.299> took<00:04:18.540> her<00:04:18.630> pretty<00:04:18.930> full<00:04:19.140> kit<00:04:19.380> of

before I took her pretty full kit of
lenses<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:20.040> had<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.250> 70<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:20.970> 200

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
millimeter fisheye so I do a pretty wide

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.629 
millimeter fisheye so I do a pretty wide
selection<00:04:30.240> of<00:04:30.300> lenses<00:04:30.810> there<00:04:31.050> and<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:32.520> know<00:04:32.610> I

part<00:05:08.159> of<00:05:08.250> climbing<00:05:08.610> photography<00:05:09.029> is<00:05:09.120> just

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
part of climbing photography is just

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.179 
part of climbing photography is just
getting<00:05:09.599> out<00:05:09.750> there<00:05:09.779> and<00:05:10.020> trying<00:05:10.319> things<00:05:10.860> the

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:11.189 
getting out there and trying things the

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:12.409 
getting out there and trying things the
most<00:05:11.370> important<00:05:11.789> thing<00:05:11.879> is<00:05:11.969> to<00:05:12.000> have<00:05:12.150> a<00:05:12.240> bit<00:05:12.389> of

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
most important thing is to have a bit of

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.149 
most important thing is to have a bit of
an<00:05:12.539> imagination<00:05:13.020> when<00:05:13.740> you're<00:05:13.830> in<00:05:13.919> a<00:05:13.949> place

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
an imagination when you're in a place

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:15.279 
an imagination when you're in a place
like<00:05:14.189> this<00:05:14.490> I'm<00:05:14.639> always<00:05:14.699> looking<00:05:15.120> around

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
like this I'm always looking around

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.300 
like this I'm always looking around
looking<00:05:16.289> across<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.589> climbs<00:05:16.949> trying<00:05:17.250> to

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
looking across the climbs trying to

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.279 
looking across the climbs trying to
think<00:05:17.460> about<00:05:17.639> angles<00:05:18.029> and<00:05:18.270> backgrounds<00:05:19.139> and

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
think about angles and backgrounds and

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.439 
think about angles and backgrounds and
compositions<00:05:19.949> if<00:05:20.699> you<00:05:20.879> spend<00:05:21.120> a<00:05:21.210> bit<00:05:21.330> of<00:05:21.360> time

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
compositions if you spend a bit of time

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.209 
compositions if you spend a bit of time
in<00:05:21.629> a<00:05:21.839> climbing<00:05:22.169> area<00:05:22.379> you'll<00:05:22.499> eventually<00:05:22.710> see

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 
in a climbing area you'll eventually see

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:25.640 
in a climbing area you'll eventually see
things<00:05:23.550> where<00:05:23.939> different<00:05:24.900> elements<00:05:25.289> kind<00:05:25.560> of

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
things where different elements kind of

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.619 
things where different elements kind of
come<00:05:25.889> together<00:05:26.039> in<00:05:26.969> climbing<00:05:27.270> photography

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:27.629 
come together in climbing photography

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:29.600 
come together in climbing photography
it's<00:05:27.719> a<00:05:27.750> lot<00:05:27.900> of<00:05:27.930> effort<00:05:28.139> sometimes<00:05:28.589> to<00:05:29.039> go<00:05:29.250> to

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
it's a lot of effort sometimes to go to

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.610 
it's a lot of effort sometimes to go to
a<00:05:29.639> place<00:05:29.939> and<00:05:29.969> get<00:05:30.569> into<00:05:30.810> a<00:05:30.870> position<00:05:31.050> but<00:05:31.500> go

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
a place and get into a position but go

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.679 
a place and get into a position but go
and<00:05:31.710> give<00:05:31.860> it<00:05:31.919> a<00:05:31.979> shot<00:05:32.219> try<00:05:32.939> it<00:05:33.000> and<00:05:33.509> you're

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:33.689 
and give it a shot try it and you're

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:42.560 
and give it a shot try it and you're
always<00:05:34.169> learning
