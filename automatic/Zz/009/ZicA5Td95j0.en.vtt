00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:05.659
 ae 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.460
 And then, personally, my name is 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.320
 cristiano damasceno and I 'm here again 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.880
 to be able to speak of the dada and fex pedals 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.680
 Good afternoon guys there 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:34.150
 Today I 'm here with industry ranking is 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:38.280
 a pedal that is a clone of the industry 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.890
 from softex 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.840
 sincerely this pedal here he is 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.020
 spectacular galley 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.500
 so he does a lot for his sound 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.500
 Sincerely spectacular is a pedal where 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:58.989
 we will have to have the controls and the 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:04.629
 It's good to be serious. 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:11.800
 A high level of control leads to teaching and 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:13.990
 versus the effect with the pedal effect and 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:22.150
 a name of nobody 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:25.119
 activations by pass on the carcases of 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.930
 aluminum center negative pattern boss 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.689
 this pedal like I said is spectacular 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.439
 even very very very good of 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.900
 truth 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.509
 let's understand that he does well he can 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.810
 to be simply a klein bust to 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.810
 you 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.009
 this is the clean sound of the guitar 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.460
 is 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.150
 with isla that I said with I thought that 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.960
 no one, right? 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.960
 I opened this 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.380

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.680

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.750
 O 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:52.300

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:54.670
 I know which one is 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.930
 and if I work in the headquarters and game 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.830
 here you will better understand what 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.830
 this staff does to you 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:17.230
 You see, he calls out all that 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.230
 the good frequency is old all is good 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.189
 vibration comes forward with this pedal 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.159
 remembering also that I can give a 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:28.659
 Dirty mess that as I said the archbishop 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:30.989
 if he is not a no one a medium 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.989
 nobody 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.440
 granuloma a little your sun looks 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.660
 the pedal can be used as it said 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.670
 a bust of nobody 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.820
 Alas, pardon pushing your name. 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.690
 second beech can not be used either 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.690
 how to search for klein 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:23.479
 anyway it's a pedal that can do a lot of 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:27.760
 difference in your set date and fex that 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.760
