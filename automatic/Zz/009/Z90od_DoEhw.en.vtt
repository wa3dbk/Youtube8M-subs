00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.320 
like that before you can actually hook
them<00:01:36.950> up<00:01:37.040> their<00:01:37.220> break<00:01:37.400> so<00:01:37.580> it<00:01:37.850> takes<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.210> wee

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
them up their break so it takes a wee

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.880 
them up their break so it takes a wee
while<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.750> get<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.960> dog<00:01:39.140> used<00:01:39.440> to<00:01:39.590> being<00:01:39.800> able

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
could be grill if you did it without any

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.350 
could be grill if you did it without any
thought<00:02:06.980> to<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.220> dog<00:02:07.490> needing<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:07.940> drink<00:02:08.179> or

thought to the dog needing to drink or

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.389 
thought to the dog needing to drink or
need<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.599> go<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.869> toilet<00:02:09.050> or<00:02:09.349> with<00:02:10.069> her<00:02:10.220> and

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
need to go to the toilet or with her and

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.860 
need to go to the toilet or with her and
he<00:02:10.459> thought<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.819> dogs<00:02:11.060> fitness<00:02:11.450> level<00:02:11.750> in

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
he thought the dogs fitness level in

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.110 
he thought the dogs fitness level in
relation<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.440> distance<00:02:12.890> you<00:02:13.069> were<00:02:13.939> back

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
relation to the distance you were back

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.349 
relation to the distance you were back
in<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.359> and<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.980> could<00:02:16.219> be<00:02:16.340> dangerous<00:02:16.730> also<00:02:17.150> if

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:17.359 
in it and it could be dangerous also if

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:18.550 
in it and it could be dangerous also if
you<00:02:17.569> did<00:02:17.749> it<00:02:17.840> in<00:02:17.959> a<00:02:18.049> response

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
you did it in a response

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.870 
you did it in a response
well<00:02:18.739> monitor<00:02:18.890> but<00:02:19.190> if<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.370> purchase<00:02:19.760> the

well monitor but if you purchase the
right<00:02:20.000> equipment<00:02:20.270> we've<00:02:20.750> got<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.080> dogs

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
right equipment we've got the dogs

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.400 
right equipment we've got the dogs
attached<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.830> lucky<00:02:22.099> dog<00:02:22.340> bar<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:23.110> which<00:02:24.110> holds

attached a lucky dog bar and which holds
the<00:02:24.440> dog<00:02:24.620> see<00:02:24.860> if<00:02:24.950> distance<00:02:25.340> away<00:02:25.459> from<00:02:25.550> the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
the dog see if distance away from the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.699 
the dog see if distance away from the
bag<00:02:25.940> it's<00:02:26.239> spring<00:02:26.660> loaded<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.319> takes<00:02:27.530> about

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
bag it's spring loaded so it takes about

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.530 
bag it's spring loaded so it takes about
seventy<00:02:28.340> or<00:02:28.370> eighty<00:02:28.430> percent<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:29.060> dogs<00:02:29.300> per

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
seventy or eighty percent the dogs per

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.250 
seventy or eighty percent the dogs per
load<00:02:29.750> of<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.020> it's<00:02:30.290> attached<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:32.260> under

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
load of it it's attached to the under

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.530 
load of it it's attached to the under
the<00:02:33.380> seat<00:02:33.620> bar<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.220> bike<00:02:34.459> which<00:02:35.239> means

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
the seat bar of the bike which means

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.199 
the seat bar of the bike which means
that<00:02:35.980> it's<00:02:36.980> at<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.280> most<00:02:37.459> stable<00:02:37.670> part<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.150> the

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
that it's at the most stable part of the

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.690 
that it's at the most stable part of the
bike<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:39.680> brakes<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:40.040> we<00:02:40.190> have<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.459> very

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
bike and the brakes that we have a very

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.280 
bike and the brakes that we have a very
well<00:02:40.970> maintained<00:02:41.360> their<00:02:41.599> very<00:02:41.840> well<00:02:42.019> check

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
well maintained their very well check

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.059 
well maintained their very well check
and<00:02:42.819> so<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:44.209> dog<00:02:44.420> isn't<00:02:45.380> likely<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.890> get

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
and so the dog isn't likely to get

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.860 
and so the dog isn't likely to get
injured<00:02:46.340> by<00:02:46.580> mechanical<00:02:47.180> failure<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.690> bag

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
injured by mechanical failure of the bag

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.630 
injured by mechanical failure of the bag
so<00:02:48.080> we<00:02:48.380> do<00:02:48.590> absolutely<00:02:48.830> everything<00:02:49.160> that<00:02:49.519> we

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
so we do absolutely everything that we

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.960 
so we do absolutely everything that we
can<00:02:49.760> do<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.390> make<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.660> see<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.840> third<00:02:51.080> dog<00:02:51.319> and<00:02:51.970> we

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
can do to make it see a third dog and we

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.850 
can do to make it see a third dog and we
certainly<00:02:53.209> wouldn't<00:02:53.870> force<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.380> dog<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.739> do

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
certainly wouldn't force the dog to do

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.860 
certainly wouldn't force the dog to do
it<00:02:54.980> they<00:02:55.069> didn't<00:02:55.370> want<00:02:55.549> to<00:02:55.610> do<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:55.850> I<00:02:56.000> would

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
it they didn't want to do it I would

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.479 
it they didn't want to do it I would
give<00:02:57.049> very<00:02:57.290> strong<00:02:57.590> consideration<00:02:58.100> and

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
give very strong consideration and

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.160 
give very strong consideration and
always<00:02:59.060> ask<00:02:59.209> people<00:02:59.299> for<00:02:59.569> written<00:02:59.900> permission

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
always ask people for written permission

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.630 
always ask people for written permission
before<00:03:00.560> I've<00:03:00.650> even<00:03:00.769> think<00:03:01.160> about<00:03:01.250> doing<00:03:01.489> this

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
before I've even think about doing this

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.150 
before I've even think about doing this
for<00:03:01.819> the<00:03:01.910> dog<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.989> I<00:03:03.319> want<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.769> talk<00:03:03.950> for<00:03:04.099> me

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
for the dog that I want to talk for me

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.089 
for the dog that I want to talk for me
well<00:03:04.340> about<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.610> benefits<00:03:04.790> of<00:03:05.150> it<00:03:05.830> it's<00:03:06.830> one

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
well about the benefits of it it's one

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.920 
well about the benefits of it it's one
