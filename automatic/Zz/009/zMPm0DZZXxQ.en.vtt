00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.530
 hi friends recently in our android 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.630
 insider hands hit the flagship from 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.310
 lenovo smartphone company which 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.020
 quite different from 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.869
 the rest of the modern mobile market 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.480
 it's about I would say the smartphone is still 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.939
 lenovo k900 let's first look at 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.130
 box its contents smartphone i 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.070
 I want to get a little support from there 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.720
 intrigue boxing itself looks very cool in 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.450
 black and red stylish 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.120
 such a huge proud font flaunts 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.640
 model name of the manufacturer and 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.890
 intel is not hard to guess at the base 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.930
 what process is this machine excavated 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.870
 open the box we see absolutely 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.760
 standard but not bad complicated set here 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.890
 the violinist here is neatly placed 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.260
 documentation headphones which is pretty 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.440
 good wire design and sound 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.780
 micro usb and headphone adapter by the way 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.250
 there are additional rubber tips on 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.960
 some forums say that 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.850
 Included are branded liners 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.340
 who just throw here, they even 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.530
 drawn and here we have a little gags 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.990
 it is not clear why go to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.299
 smartphone and immediately express my first 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.090
 wow he's thin only 6 and 9 millimeters 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.399
 the thickness is light at 162 grams and 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.649
 quite unusual big and even 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.539
 I want to call him brutal probably 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.729
 this is because the angles are absolutely straight and 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.469
 not rounded back on top 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.289
 plastic panel is a camera 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.249
 with dual flash and bottom speaker 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.679
 by the way these plastic inserts 

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:40.289
 look like natural metal for it 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.880
 designer plus between them an inset of 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.819
 quality stainless steel with 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.249
 logo lenovo and intel microusb bottom 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.439
 support from playing the microphone and jack for 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:51.869
 headphones on the left side of the rocker 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.749
 volume on the right slot for micro sim and 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.639
 off button buttons are pressed and 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:59.130
 feels quite normal with that 

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:01.200
 no problem a bit about the front 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.090
 there is a front camera for 2 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.859
 megapixels and a bit unusual for 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.049
 android user touch buttons 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.880
 long-click menu navigation 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.160
 which opens the running processes 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.970
 home screen back button and 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.150
 back button 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.780
 go to the screen there is k900 ipies 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.900
 screen with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.420
 a diagonal of 55 inches and he ag 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.269
 I just like comparing for example 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.489
 405 pixel density symbol 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.290
 the screens didnâ€™t really like him 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.939
 quite colorful but under 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.980
 certain angles distorts a little 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:38.310
 colors and brightness sorry for the tautology 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.439
 not the brightest now and guts for 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.099
 processing of processes is responsible intel atom 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:45.120
 z 2580 is a dual-core processor from 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.579
 intel companies 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.010
 k900 is the first application of this 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.810
 chipset on a mobile device usually 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.859
 put on netbooks and tablets under 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.409
 running windows 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.329
 its frequency is 2 gigahertz and this 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.480
 enough to pull up modern 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.500
 toys with good performance 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.389
 his energy consumption is low but 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.099
 Alas, not enough to show 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.620
 Excellent result in battery saving 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.939
 batteries let's see our standard set 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.569
 benchmarks and games 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:14.310
 let's start with the d-flip all smoothly and smoothly 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.560
 almost like clockwork drove into 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.569
 asphalt 8 slows down 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.689
 play a little awkward epic citadel 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.349
 goes at 33 frames per second on ultra 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.290
 settings 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:29.430
 what is worthy and the antutu gave a good one 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.590
 score 19990 8 points interface 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.389
 some places podlagivaet but rather 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.239
 all this because of a bit of a flaw 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.980
 by the will of nova launcher 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.290
 operating system by the way android 4 2 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.480
 1 in the shell there are some very 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.159
 useful settings mode in your pocket 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.530
 which increases the volume when you 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.900
 remove the phone the possibility of waking up 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.849
 smartphones volume buttons lock 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.519
 shaking the phone and waking up 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.909
 after double tapping the screen function 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.310
 work steadily and this plus we turn 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.470
 to the camera there is nothing special though 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.810
 she and 13 megapixels she shoots 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.729
 slightly worse than competitors noisy and 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.199
 smeared but there are lots of different 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:09.510
 settings and filters 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:12.440
 your instagram will be just happy 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.300
 video can record full hd 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.590
 that's just a sample clip shot 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.060
 cloudy weather the battery is installed 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.910
 into two and a half thousand milliamps 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.160
 hours this is barely enough for 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.380
 days to actively use it according to our 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.600
 test full hd video he showed 5 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.250
 hours has not yet issued a plaintive squeak 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.270
 which signaled a low battery 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.910
 and disconnected it is time to conclude 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.280
 its price category is close to budget 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.160
 now lenovo k900 can be found for the price 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.840
 from 16 and a half thousand rubles and it's like 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.060
 once niche for him 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.430
 smartphone is different from the rest of its 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.780
 design subtlety and weight but here in 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.450
 performance he's a bit 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.400
 loses and yes warms up significantly 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.770
 despite the large size k900 is all 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.140
 the same phone and in our opinion it does not play 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.730
 on one field of samsung galaxy but since 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.490
 the second is still a good idea to use as 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.140
 notebook device appreciated 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.850
 people with big hands will appreciate 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.190
 forgive me, Nikolai Sergeevich and 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.190
 looking for male stiffness in design and 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.020
 hardness on it all with you was a egor not 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.880
