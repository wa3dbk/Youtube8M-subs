 Ruslan noise zhigan which already appear 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.570
 among adults I must say that 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.730
 missed guys unfortunately junior 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.830
 Russian Championship in Saransk and the fact is 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.460
 that Ivan got sick seriously he had 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.949
 sinusitis 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.440
 but got the opportunity to speak here 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.440
 and we are for them much more we wish success 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.280
 star is good 1 part 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.810
 2 there is a percentage 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.890
 good position 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.960

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.069

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.469
 pure chicago 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.540
 the final part of the carat confused 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.269
 good lip strange skating rink parallel 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.660
 super shuttle 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.770
 In my humble opinion, they are in order 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.950
 stronger than all whom you have already seen and in general 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.890
 I forgot that this is a junior and it is sharp 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.730
 different is this couple really now 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.390
 watched honestly say constantly 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.950
 Looking tried to find some well 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.530
 what good hook on good 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.360
 parodist that's great guys have prepared 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.910
 technical change such little things that 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.440
 general attention services are turning you 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.900
 you know they almost found honest 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.070
 speaking honestly I didnâ€™t find their little things 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.450
 which one usually finds fault judging here 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.070
 Well done guys coped eat seen 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.850
 let's let a very complicated drove 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.350
 with a hand they made a grab with a leg but 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.190
 maybe a little synchronicity was 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.230
 First consider the replay here all 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.710
 synchronously 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:16.700
 yes here everything is in sync and through the jump 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:19.450
 one more due too well 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.450
 but answer yes 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.599
 very well did not skate a series of blues I 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:32.539
 watched for parallelism you give weave 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:34.220
 and legs and behind the positions very carefully and 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.870
 naturally of course a curtsy here 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.280
 now more repeat absolutely 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.470
 two legs are parallel to look 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:46.190
 free yes sure important is appreciated 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:47.650
 judges, and here the sea 4 counting arc here 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.940
 small of course small-small 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.430
 the amplitude a little difference in the legs was 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.530
 a little bit but it is not at all 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.590
 much we argue the inner edge and 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.770
 outdoor of pure 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:08.599
 purely purely outer edge is so dense 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:12.110
 position is very interesting to work with a guy 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:19.490
 For a long time worked with Khokhlova 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:23.630
 novitsky good standing guys 20 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:26.720
 campuses and the answer see 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.660
 64 65 to 3 points not hospital palette 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.960
 your best result both skated and 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.030
 got what he and all dream 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.129
 the attitude of that time is fair 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:41.259
 reacted correctly to evaluate 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:46.919
 Well, support the hall once the truth is not 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:46.919
 a lot of people will bring hot support
