I<00:01:27.990> said<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.320> Episode<00:01:28.530> one<00:01:28.920> pump<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> contrast

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
I said in Episode one pump the contrast

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.719 
I said in Episode one pump the contrast
that's<00:01:30.780> my<00:01:30.960> style<00:01:31.200> might<00:01:31.890> not<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.189> your<00:01:32.430> style

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
that's my style might not be your style

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
and that's totally fine what I think it

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.240 
and that's totally fine what I think it
makes<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.840> look<00:01:36.960> really<00:01:37.560> great<00:01:37.740> when<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.009> pump

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
makes it look really great when you pump

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.030 
makes it look really great when you pump
the<00:01:38.369> contrast<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.390> see<00:01:39.630> right<00:01:39.659> here

histogram<00:02:12.140> I'm<00:02:12.830> seeing<00:02:13.130> I'm<00:02:13.220> getting<00:02:13.430> a

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
histogram I'm seeing I'm getting a

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.540 
histogram I'm seeing I'm getting a
little<00:02:13.700> bit<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.739> you<00:02:15.739> know<00:02:15.770> a<00:02:16.010> little<00:02:16.400> bit

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
little bit of you know a little bit

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.740 
little bit of you know a little bit
considerable<00:02:17.030> stuff<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.330> looks<00:02:17.510> like<00:02:17.630> it

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
considerable stuff it looks like it

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.750 
considerable stuff it looks like it
might<00:02:17.959> be<00:02:17.989> a<00:02:18.140> little<00:02:18.260> bit<00:02:18.440> overexposed<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.670> I'm

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
might be a little bit overexposed so I'm

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.050 
might be a little bit overexposed so I'm
gonna<00:02:19.850> pull<00:02:20.120> back<00:02:20.270> a<00:02:20.300> little<00:02:20.420> bit<00:02:21.819> just<00:02:22.819> a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
little bit of white here not blown out

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.830 
little bit of white here not blown out
but<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:34.250> looks<00:02:34.459> good<00:02:34.640> looks<00:02:35.180> good<00:02:35.330> looks<00:02:35.480> like

but it looks good looks good looks like
nice<00:02:36.050> nice<00:02:36.470> highlights<00:02:36.910> all<00:02:37.910> right<00:02:38.260> then<00:02:39.260> just

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
nice nice highlights all right then just

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.380 
nice nice highlights all right then just
so<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:39.800> know<00:02:39.920> in<00:02:40.040> case<00:02:40.069> you<00:02:40.310> can't<00:02:40.520> see<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:41.030> just

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
so you know in case you can't see I just

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.380 
so you know in case you can't see I just
took<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.750> down<00:02:42.080> about<00:02:42.260> negative<00:02:43.190> point<00:02:43.580> 2<00:02:43.880> 4

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
took it down about negative point 2 4

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.449 
took it down about negative point 2 4
here<00:02:44.720> on<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.930> exposure<00:02:45.290> not<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:45.980> lot<00:02:46.220> just

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
here on the exposure not a lot just

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.380 
here on the exposure not a lot just
enough<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:47.090> kind<00:02:47.209> of<00:02:47.530> mellow<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.800> out<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:49.040> it

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
enough to kind of mellow it out of it

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.210 
enough to kind of mellow it out of it
all<00:02:50.390> right<00:02:51.190> step<00:02:52.190> number<00:02:52.670> two<00:02:53.709> on<00:02:54.709> us<00:02:54.860> we<00:02:55.010> count

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
all right step number two on us we count

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.059 
all right step number two on us we count
exposure<00:02:55.670> is<00:02:55.940> step<00:02:56.209> number<00:02:56.239> two<00:02:56.870> in<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.830> case

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
exposure is step number two in that case

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.460 
exposure is step number two in that case
this<00:02:58.370> would<00:02:58.550> be<00:02:58.670> step<00:02:58.910> 3<00:02:59.410> doesn't<00:03:00.410> really

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
this would be step 3 doesn't really

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.670 
this would be step 3 doesn't really
matter<00:03:00.739> but<00:03:01.459> we'll<00:03:02.090> go<00:03:02.209> with<00:03:02.239> 3<00:03:02.600> i'm<00:03:03.470> going<00:03:03.620> to

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
matter but we'll go with 3 i'm going to

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.960 
matter but we'll go with 3 i'm going to
go<00:03:03.770> down<00:03:03.950> a<00:03:03.980> little<00:03:04.100> bit<00:03:04.370> in<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:04.520> clarity<00:03:04.850> i'll

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
go down a little bit in the clarity i'll

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.540 
go down a little bit in the clarity i'll
zoom<00:03:05.209> in<00:03:05.360> so<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.510> can<00:03:05.630> see<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:05.900> just<00:03:06.519> go<00:03:07.519> a

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
zoom in so you can see it just go a

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.610 
zoom in so you can see it just go a
little<00:03:07.820> bit<00:03:08.090> on<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.269> clarity<00:03:08.570> soften<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.380> up<00:03:09.470> a

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
little bit on the clarity soften it up a

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.770 
little bit on the clarity soften it up a
bit<00:03:09.650> soften<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.610> up<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:11.030> there<00:03:11.330> we<00:03:11.480> go<00:03:11.630> not<00:03:12.410> bad

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
looks good now let's say we shot at iso

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.070 
looks good now let's say we shot at iso
400<00:03:44.900> 130<00:03:45.900> millimeters<00:03:46.410> f<00:03:46.590> 2.8<00:03:47.930> 648<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:49.050> a
