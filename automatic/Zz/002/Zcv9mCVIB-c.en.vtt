website for 2999 quickly looking over
the<00:00:20.310> case<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:21.029> not<00:00:21.119> going<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.359> win<00:00:21.420> any

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
the case it's not going to win any

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.960 
the case it's not going to win any
awards<00:00:21.750> when<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.680> comes<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.980> design<00:00:23.340> or<00:00:23.550> style

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
awards when it comes to design or style

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.880 
awards when it comes to design or style
it's<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.050> little<00:00:25.380> more<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.680> rugged

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
it's just a little more in the rugged

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.429 
it's just a little more in the rugged
side<00:00:26.269> so<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.330> have<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:28.019> level<00:00:28.410> of

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
side so you have that a level of

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.640 
side so you have that a level of
protection<00:00:28.640> now<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:30.090> has<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> rubbery<00:00:31.170> feel<00:00:31.260> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
protection now it has a rubbery feel to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.200 
protection now it has a rubbery feel to
the<00:00:31.740> back<00:00:31.890> cover<00:00:32.189> here<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.700> as<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> rigid

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the back cover here and as a rigid

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.760 
the back cover here and as a rigid
pattern<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.110> get<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> good<00:00:34.380> grip<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
pattern so you get a good grip in the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.069 
pattern so you get a good grip in the
hand<00:00:35.040> maintains<00:00:35.550> also<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> nice<00:00:36.390> clean<00:00:36.750> finish

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
hand maintains also a nice clean finish

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.170 
hand maintains also a nice clean finish
at<00:00:37.230> all<00:00:37.350> times<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.100> saying<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:39.000> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
at all times and saying that this is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.910 
at all times and saying that this is
more<00:00:39.629> about<00:00:39.750> protecting<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.290> handset<00:00:40.739> it

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
more about protecting the handset it

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.920 
more about protecting the handset it
does<00:00:41.100> add<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.579> considerable<00:00:42.300> amount<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.629> both

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
does add a considerable amount of both

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.680 
does add a considerable amount of both
to<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.290> handsets<00:00:44.010> overall<00:00:44.399> size<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.360> still

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
to the handsets overall size but still

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.479 
to the handsets overall size but still
the<00:00:46.230> compromise<00:00:46.739> made<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.190> fact<00:00:47.399> that

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the compromise made in the fact that

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.580 
the compromise made in the fact that
it's<00:00:47.760> sturdier<00:00:48.149> than<00:00:48.360> most<00:00:48.809> other<00:00:48.989> cases<00:00:49.289> out

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
it's sturdier than most other cases out

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.029 
it's sturdier than most other cases out
there<00:00:50.300> now<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> workmate<00:00:51.989> evolution<00:00:52.530> case<00:00:52.739> is

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
there now the workmate evolution case is

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.639 
there now the workmate evolution case is
a<00:00:53.070> two-part<00:00:53.730> case<00:00:54.180> basically<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.530> an

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
a two-part case basically you have an

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.180 
a two-part case basically you have an
inner<00:00:55.890> inner<00:00:57.379> thermoplastic<00:00:58.379> polyurethane

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
inner inner thermoplastic polyurethane

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.459 
inner inner thermoplastic polyurethane
case<00:00:59.520> which<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> flexible<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.930> gives<00:01:01.289> it

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
case which is the flexible it gives it

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.709 
case which is the flexible it gives it
some<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.770> its<00:01:01.949> impact<00:01:02.370> resistance<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.300> you

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
some of its impact resistance and you

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.020 
some of its impact resistance and you
have<00:01:03.870> an<00:01:04.019> outer<00:01:04.519> polycarbonate<00:01:05.519> frame<00:01:05.820> which

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
have an outer polycarbonate frame which

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.660 
have an outer polycarbonate frame which
gives<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.390> its<00:01:06.659> protective<00:01:07.500> shell<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.250> even<00:01:08.610> if

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
gives it its protective shell so even if

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
gives it its protective shell so even if
you<00:01:08.729> drop<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.150> from<00:01:09.270> some<00:01:09.630> heights<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.530> going

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
you drop it from some heights it's going

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.300 
you drop it from some heights it's going
to<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:11.070> stand<00:01:11.430> most<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.909> them<00:01:13.040> if<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.130> tell

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
to but stand most of them if you tell

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.460 
to but stand most of them if you tell
around<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.700> sides<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.299> case<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.110> covers

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
around the sides of the case it covers

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.200 
around the sides of the case it covers
pretty<00:01:16.710> much<00:01:16.920> everything<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.700> dedicated

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
pretty much everything have dedicated

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.999 
pretty much everything have dedicated
pad<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.659> right<00:01:18.869> there<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.380> also<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> volume

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
pad one right there and also the volume

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.520 
pad one right there and also the volume
control<00:01:20.390> unfortunately<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.630> rather<00:01:21.900> stiff

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
control unfortunately it's rather stiff

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.929 
control unfortunately it's rather stiff
to<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.920> touch<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.340> got<00:01:23.490> really<00:01:23.759> really

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
to the touch they got really really

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.609 
to the touch they got really really
pressing<00:01:24.270> down<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.750> activate<00:01:25.259> them<00:01:25.470> but

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
pressing down to activate them but

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.160 
pressing down to activate them but
everything<00:01:25.860> else<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.130> pretty<00:01:26.340> much<00:01:26.460> covered

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
everything else is pretty much covered

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.840 
everything else is pretty much covered
sufficiently<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.770> micro<00:01:29.070> USB<00:01:29.460> port<00:01:29.490> right

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
sufficiently the micro USB port right

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.460 
sufficiently the micro USB port right
there<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> three<00:01:30.960> half<00:01:31.110> millimeter

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
there you have the three half millimeter

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.740 
there you have the three half millimeter
