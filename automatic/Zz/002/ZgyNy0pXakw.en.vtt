okay<00:00:00.630> let<00:00:00.750> me<00:00:00.810> try<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:01.050> do<00:00:01.260> some<00:00:03.380> modal<00:00:04.380> stuff

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
okay let me try to do some modal stuff

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.980 
okay let me try to do some modal stuff
up<00:00:04.740> this<00:00:04.920> it's<00:00:05.670> not<00:00:06.120> strike<00:00:06.420> it's<00:00:06.569> just<00:00:06.720> one

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
up this it's not strike it's just one

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.360 
up this it's not strike it's just one
way<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.230> approach<00:00:07.410> it's<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:07.950> way<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.099> kind<00:00:08.280> of

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
way to approach it's the way I kind of

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:18.019 
way to approach it's the way I kind of
look<00:00:08.490> at<00:00:08.580> if<00:00:08.700> you<00:00:08.820> think<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.090> modes<00:00:16.670> play<00:00:17.670> force

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
look at if you think of modes play force

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.880 
look at if you think of modes play force
it<00:00:18.240> kind<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.449> hides<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.140> fact<00:00:19.170> further<00:00:19.650> that

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
it kind of hides the fact further that

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.500 
it kind of hides the fact further that
we're<00:00:20.070> trying<00:00:20.250> not<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.670> imply<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.000> kind<00:00:21.449> of

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
we're trying not to imply this kind of

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.460 
we're trying not to imply this kind of
thirds<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.230> try<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> resolution<00:00:23.220> sorry<00:00:24.470> so

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
thirds and try to resolution sorry so

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.170 
thirds and try to resolution sorry so
for<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:28.400> that's<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.580> what<00:00:29.789> right<00:00:32.180> so

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
for so that's so what right so

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.010 
for so that's so what right so
characteristic<00:00:33.870> picture<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.500> D<00:00:34.770> Dorian<00:00:36.020> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
characteristic picture of D Dorian the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.040 
characteristic picture of D Dorian the

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.930 

another<00:00:42.469> way<00:00:42.620> to<00:00:42.649> play<00:00:42.920> modal<00:00:43.250> is<00:00:43.399> you<00:00:43.579> first

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
another way to play modal is you first

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:53.740 
another way to play modal is you first
we<00:00:44.030> can<00:00:44.149> hang<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:44.540> just<00:00:44.690> D<00:00:44.840> minor<00:00:52.540> what<00:00:53.540> when<00:00:53.720> i

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
we can hang and just D minor what when i

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.330 
we can hang and just D minor what when i
do<00:00:53.870> that<00:00:53.960> Crichton<00:00:54.350> I'm<00:00:54.590> kind<00:00:54.800> of<00:00:54.890> blind<00:00:55.129> I'm

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
do that Crichton I'm kind of blind I'm

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.100 
do that Crichton I'm kind of blind I'm
fine<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:56.210> you<00:00:56.300> usually<00:00:56.540> don't<00:00:56.780> want<00:00:56.960> to<00:00:57.019> do

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
fine so you usually don't want to do

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.799 
fine so you usually don't want to do
that<00:00:57.140> but<00:00:57.410> we<00:00:57.710> do<00:00:57.860> that's<00:00:58.040> just<00:00:58.280> what<00:00:58.400> happened

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.210 

so<00:01:02.809> I<00:01:02.839> just<00:01:03.019> hang<00:01:03.290> there<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:03.559> use<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:03.980> pitch

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
so I just hang there and use the pitch

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.249 
so I just hang there and use the pitch
as<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.489> characteristic<00:01:05.360> note<00:01:05.540> in<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.960> modal

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
as a characteristic note in the modal

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.680 
as a characteristic note in the modal
and<00:01:06.350> kind<00:01:06.500> of<00:01:06.590> apply<00:01:06.800> that<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.159> I<00:01:07.509> kept<00:01:08.509> like

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
and kind of apply that so I kept like

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.240 
and kind of apply that so I kept like
seams<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.290> that's<00:01:09.470> always<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:09.830> route<00:01:09.979> every

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
seams and that's always the route every

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.950 
seams and that's always the route every
note<00:01:10.399> just<00:01:10.640> wants<00:01:10.850> to<00:01:10.909> go<00:01:11.030> there<00:01:11.060> but<00:01:11.270> I<00:01:11.570> think

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
note just wants to go there but I think

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.910 
note just wants to go there but I think
of<00:01:12.050> a<00:01:12.110> little<00:01:12.290> different<00:01:12.560> i<00:01:12.590> think<00:01:12.800> is<00:01:12.890> that

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
of a little different i think is that

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.630 
of a little different i think is that
character<00:01:13.399> code<00:01:13.850> becomes<00:01:14.720> a<00:01:15.170> note<00:01:16.130> that<00:01:16.369> wants

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
character code becomes a note that wants

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.430 
character code becomes a note that wants
to<00:01:16.759> if<00:01:17.180> you<00:01:17.330> put<00:01:17.539> it<00:01:17.630> in<00:01:17.720> a<00:01:17.840> core<00:01:18.110> whatever

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
to if you put it in a core whatever

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.499 
to if you put it in a core whatever
chords<00:01:18.770> have<00:01:18.920> that<00:01:19.100> can<00:01:19.280> be<00:01:19.490> of<00:01:19.789> some<00:01:20.270> type<00:01:20.479> of

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
chords have that can be of some type of

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.109 
chords have that can be of some type of
a<00:01:20.720> cadence<00:01:21.110> chords<00:01:21.380> like<00:01:21.590> do<00:01:22.399> you<00:01:22.520> mind<00:01:22.700> ur<00:01:22.850> you

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
a cadence chords like do you mind ur you

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.100 
a cadence chords like do you mind ur you
want<00:01:23.300> to<00:01:23.360> hear<00:01:23.509> that<00:01:23.690> I<00:01:25.660> hear<00:01:26.660> that<00:01:26.960> is<00:01:27.080> a

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
want to hear that I hear that is a

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.090 
want to hear that I hear that is a
cadence<00:01:28.539> not<00:01:29.539> don't<00:01:30.020> think<00:01:30.229> tritone

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
cadence not don't think tritone

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.499 
cadence not don't think tritone
resolving<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.820> lot<00:01:31.970> of<00:01:32.030> stuff<00:01:32.179> we're<00:01:32.360> just

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
resolving a lot of stuff we're just

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.359 
resolving a lot of stuff we're just
thinking<00:01:32.600> of<00:01:32.780> character<00:01:33.590> SD<00:01:33.770> cards<00:01:34.100> that<00:01:34.190> want

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
thinking of character SD cards that want

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.550 
thinking of character SD cards that want
to<00:01:34.429> go<00:01:34.520> back<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.700> help<00:01:35.060> imply<00:01:35.390> dedran<00:01:38.560> right

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
to go back to help imply dedran right

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.960 
to go back to help imply dedran right
the<00:01:39.770> other<00:01:39.920> one<00:01:40.039> would<00:01:40.159> be<00:01:40.190> it's<00:01:40.490> also<00:01:40.700> that

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
the other one would be it's also that

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:55.819 
the other one would be it's also that
piece<00:01:41.149> also<00:01:45.759> so<00:01:46.759> you<00:01:46.880> think<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.149> melody<00:01:49.780> see

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.899 

there's<00:01:56.829> the<00:01:56.950> other<00:01:57.130> one<00:01:57.219> what's<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.789> other

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
there's the other one what's the other

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:22.589 
there's the other one what's the other
two<00:01:58.119> nizz<00:01:58.299> impressions<00:02:08.519> there's<00:02:09.519> the<00:02:09.670> B<00:02:21.599> and

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
two nizz impressions there's the B and

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.300 
two nizz impressions there's the B and
you<00:02:22.690> are<00:02:22.810> still<00:02:23.019> be<00:02:23.230> going<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:23.860> there's<00:02:24.250> a

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
you are still be going to a so there's a

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.059 
you are still be going to a so there's a
it's<00:02:24.670> kind<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.030> harmonic<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:26.200> creates

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
it's kind of a harmonic it creates

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.009 
it's kind of a harmonic it creates
harmonic<00:02:27.489> move<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:27.910> with<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:28.450> pitch<00:02:28.750> in

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
harmonic move in with the pitch in

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.990 
harmonic move in with the pitch in
whatever<00:02:29.319> cord<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:30.010> can't<00:02:30.250> use<00:02:30.430> like<00:02:30.670> any<00:02:30.849> of

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
whatever cord you can't use like any of

whatever cord you can't use like any of
the<00:02:31.060> other<00:02:31.090> can't<00:02:31.840> use<00:02:31.959> like<00:02:32.079> a<00:02:32.110> g7<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:32.739> know

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
the other can't use like a g7 you know

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.140 
the other can't use like a g7 you know
it<00:02:32.980> has<00:02:33.099> to<00:02:33.250> be<00:02:33.400> in<00:02:33.549> it<00:02:33.640> because<00:02:33.730> it's<00:02:33.970> our

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
it has to be in it because it's our

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.089 
it has to be in it because it's our
truck<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:34.720> tritone<00:02:35.140> is<00:02:35.290> just<00:02:35.470> too<00:02:35.709> hard<00:02:35.980> to

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
truck the tritone is just too hard to

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:42.030 
truck the tritone is just too hard to
hear<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:39.370> just<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:41.319> could<00:02:41.500> hear<00:02:41.680> if<00:02:41.890> you

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
hear it's just you you could hear if you

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.440 
hear it's just you you could hear if you
work<00:02:42.220> i<00:02:42.370> mean<00:02:42.519> if<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:42.730> get<00:02:42.880> good<00:02:43.030> at<00:02:43.209> playing

especially wants a dominant core because

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.670 
especially wants a dominant core because
it<00:03:01.060> implies<00:03:01.209> at<00:03:01.540> least<00:03:01.900> two<00:03:02.079> you<00:03:02.200> get<00:03:02.319> used<00:03:02.560> to

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
it implies at least two you get used to

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.349

playing<00:03:02.829> it<00:03:03.040> with<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:03.910> anyway<00:03:04.120> if<00:03:04.180> you<00:03:04.269> go

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
playing it with it so anyway if you go

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.479 
playing it with it so anyway if you go
to<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.480> that's<00:03:04.780> one<00:03:04.989> concept<00:03:05.410> so<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:05.590> can<00:03:06.040> do

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
to that that's one concept so I can do

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.540 
to that that's one concept so I can do
no<00:03:06.609> longer

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:35.380

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
so I just record a hit w Dorian so I

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.180 
so I just record a hit w Dorian so I
start<00:03:35.750> combining<00:03:35.930> night<00:03:36.500> I'm<00:03:36.739> gonna<00:03:36.890> use<00:03:37.010> the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
start combining night I'm gonna use the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.250 
start combining night I'm gonna use the
note<00:03:37.400> as<00:03:37.640> a<00:03:37.670> character<00:03:38.150> your<00:03:38.330> seat<00:03:38.540> pitch<00:03:38.780> so

to have any kind of motion I just want a
noodle<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:45.980> minor<00:03:46.190> I<00:03:46.310> can<00:03:46.549> now<00:03:46.670> see<00:03:59.290> you<00:04:00.290> see

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
this till to find the boat I'm just now

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.200 
this till to find the boat I'm just now
i'm<00:04:24.620> using<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:25.070> pitch<00:04:25.280> as<00:04:25.460> a<00:04:25.490> characteristic

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
i'm using the pitch as a characteristic

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.719 
i'm using the pitch as a characteristic
tone<00:04:26.630> of<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.080> mode<00:04:27.260> that's<00:04:27.530> 11<00:04:27.860> played<00:04:28.099> so

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
tone of the mode that's 11 played so

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.310 
tone of the mode that's 11 played so
another<00:04:28.910> way<00:04:29.120> i<00:04:29.150> could<00:04:29.389> play<00:04:29.539> it<00:04:29.690> is<00:04:29.840> if<00:04:30.110> we<00:04:30.200> go

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
another way i could play it is if we go

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.529 
another way i could play it is if we go
to<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.440> next<00:04:30.560> step<00:04:30.740> we<00:04:31.010> think<00:04:31.220> of<00:04:31.310> this<00:04:31.789> I'm

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
to the next step we think of this I'm

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:33.879 
to the next step we think of this I'm
gonna<00:04:32.690> change<00:04:32.930> keys<00:04:33.200> on<00:04:33.349> you<00:04:33.470> but<00:04:33.590> if<00:04:33.680> we<00:04:33.770> think

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
gonna change keys on you but if we think

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.060 
gonna change keys on you but if we think
of<00:04:34.010> this<00:04:34.130> more<00:04:34.490> corn<00:04:34.880> we're<00:04:35.060> now<00:04:35.240> ready<00:04:35.419> to<00:04:36.380> be

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.980 
of this more corn we're now ready to be
fun<00:04:38.380> to<00:04:39.380> ever<00:04:39.800> think<00:04:40.039> I'm<00:04:40.190> Ricky<00:04:40.490> Ricky

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:15.259 
I'm kind of using pictures but when I

different<00:07:42.499> I'm<00:07:42.680> trying<00:07:43.009> to<00:07:43.099> think<00:07:43.159> of<00:07:43.579> each

00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879 
different I'm trying to think of each

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:46.149 
different I'm trying to think of each
one<00:07:44.149> of<00:07:44.180> those<00:07:44.300> not<00:07:44.569> as<00:07:44.749> a<00:07:44.779> sub<00:07:45.110> 5<00:07:45.319> resolving<00:07:45.860> by

00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:46.159 
one of those not as a sub 5 resolving by

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:48.009 
one of those not as a sub 5 resolving by
mixing<00:07:46.639> the<00:07:46.699> two<00:07:46.909> I<00:07:46.939> do<00:07:47.059> to<00:07:47.240> use<00:07:47.389> both<00:07:47.629> I<00:07:47.809> mean

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:48.019 
mixing the two I do to use both I mean

00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:49.809 
mixing the two I do to use both I mean
that's<00:07:48.529> what<00:07:48.829> the<00:07:49.099> funnel<00:07:49.369> point<00:07:49.550> if<00:07:49.729> you're

00:07:49.809 --> 00:07:49.819 
that's what the funnel point if you're

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:51.009 
that's what the funnel point if you're
going<00:07:49.939> to<00:07:49.999> use<00:07:50.179> modal<00:07:50.449> you<00:07:50.599> have<00:07:50.719> to<00:07:50.809> say<00:07:50.959> so

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:51.019 
going to use modal you have to say so

00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:53.049 
going to use modal you have to say so
stricken<00:07:51.469> jazz<00:07:51.829> and<00:07:52.399> we<00:07:52.519> use<00:07:52.729> modal

stricken jazz and we use modal
interchange<00:07:53.479> to<00:07:53.719> change<00:07:54.079> all<00:07:54.529> the<00:07:54.619> time<00:07:54.679> so

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:55.099 
interchange to change all the time so

taking that same concept and when I solo
all<00:07:57.589> I'll<00:07:58.219> mix<00:07:58.699> the<00:07:58.909> terminal<00:07:59.360> so<00:07:59.419> it's<00:07:59.539> not

00:07:59.649 --> 00:07:59.659 
all I'll mix the terminal so it's not
