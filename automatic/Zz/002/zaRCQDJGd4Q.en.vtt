yeah<00:06:05.910> insides<00:06:06.570> actually<00:06:06.900> possible<00:06:07.230> that's

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
yeah insides actually possible that's

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.940 
yeah insides actually possible that's
crazy<00:06:08.370> and<00:06:12.290> another<00:06:13.290> thing<00:06:13.500> that<00:06:13.530> makes<00:06:13.770> it<00:06:13.860> a

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
crazy and another thing that makes it a

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.510 
crazy and another thing that makes it a
sport<00:06:14.340> is<00:06:15.230> this<00:06:16.230> little<00:06:16.530> the<00:06:16.560> airfoil<00:06:17.280> on<00:06:17.430> the

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
back here a little low spoiler so there

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.470
