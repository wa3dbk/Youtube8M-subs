00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
I'll plug it in show you guys how it

00:01:38.180 --> 00:02:05.600 
I'll plug it in show you guys how it
works

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.609 

ok

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
ok

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.460 

and<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:10.420> might<00:02:10.629> notice<00:02:10.869> that<00:02:10.989> there's<00:02:11.319> no

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
and you might notice that there's no

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.930 
and you might notice that there's no
keyboard<00:02:11.769> or<00:02:12.159> mouse<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:13.739> actually<00:02:14.739> have<00:02:15.129> this

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
keyboard or mouse I actually have this

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.500 
keyboard or mouse I actually have this
keyboard<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.599> mouse<00:02:16.720> they<00:02:17.709> control<00:02:18.510> this

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
keyboard and mouse they control this

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.470 
keyboard and mouse they control this
computer

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.790 

if<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:23.019> can<00:02:23.170> see<00:02:23.379> that

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.700 

but<00:02:26.340> whatever<00:02:27.240> this<00:02:27.690> computer<00:02:28.170> turns<00:02:28.440> on

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
but whatever this computer turns on

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.680 
but whatever this computer turns on
they're<00:02:29.610> connected<00:02:30.210> through<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.480> program

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
they're connected through a program

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.640 
they're connected through a program
called<00:02:30.900> synergy<00:02:31.820> so<00:02:32.820> I<00:02:33.240> can<00:02:33.900> control<00:02:34.320> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
called synergy so I can control the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.750 
called synergy so I can control the
computers<00:02:35.310> with<00:02:35.700> one<00:02:36.090> keyboard<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.960> one<00:02:37.200> mouse

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
computers with one keyboard in one mouse

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.310 
computers with one keyboard in one mouse
and<00:02:38.760> I'll<00:02:38.850> show<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.480> then<00:02:39.780> when<00:02:40.200> this

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
and I'll show you that then when this

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.720 
and I'll show you that then when this
starts<00:02:40.680> up

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.320 

you<00:02:45.180> can<00:02:45.300> see<00:02:45.480> it's<00:02:45.629> mounted<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.319> normal

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
you can see it's mounted on a normal

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.030 
you can see it's mounted on a normal
splat<00:02:49.170> spearing<00:02:49.620> monitor<00:02:50.190> stand

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:02.740 

that's<00:02:53.489> running<00:02:53.849> windows<00:02:54.209> XP

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:29.050 

that's<00:03:03.080> quite<00:03:03.290> noisy

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.110 

and<00:03:29.239> once<00:03:29.660> this<00:03:29.870> starts<00:03:30.020> up<00:03:30.470> here<00:03:30.830> now<00:03:31.489> synergy

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
and once this starts up here now synergy

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.730 
and once this starts up here now synergy
is<00:03:32.239> active

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
is active

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.000 
is active
