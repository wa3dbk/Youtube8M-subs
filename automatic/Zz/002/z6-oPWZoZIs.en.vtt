off this pack of ogres and well
happening<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.489> if<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.910> well<00:00:45.239> obviously<00:00:45.450> this

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
happening is if it well obviously this

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.600 
happening is if it well obviously this
is<00:00:45.899> officers<00:00:46.379> still<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> little<00:00:47.190> bit<00:00:47.340> booger

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
is officers still a little bit booger

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.029 
is officers still a little bit booger
but<00:00:48.210> bring<00:00:48.450> them<00:00:48.600> closer<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.140> bark<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.680> he'll

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
but bring them closer to bark and he'll

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.850 
but bring them closer to bark and he'll
eat<00:00:50.579> them<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.050> bark<00:00:52.050> then<00:00:52.260> demands

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
eat them and bark then demands

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.670 
eat them and bark then demands
assistance<00:00:53.850> he<00:00:54.300> he<00:00:54.539> wants<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.899> be<00:00:55.020> fed<00:00:55.260> augers

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
assistance he he wants to be fed augers

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.790 
assistance he he wants to be fed augers
so<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:56.610> killed<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.879> ogres<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.559> pick<00:00:58.559> them<00:00:58.739> up

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
so we killed the ogres and pick them up

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.799 
so we killed the ogres and pick them up
basically<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.430> you'll<00:00:59.820> drag<00:01:00.149> them<00:01:00.359> over<00:01:00.690> to

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
basically and you'll drag them over to

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.569 
basically and you'll drag them over to
the<00:01:00.930> pit<00:01:01.140> where<00:01:01.170> Baracus<00:01:01.800> he'll<00:01:02.160> eat<00:01:02.370> them

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the pit where Baracus he'll eat them

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.820 
the pit where Baracus he'll eat them
from<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.229> you<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:04.260> keep<00:01:04.589> repeating

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
from you and you just keep repeating

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.520 
from you and you just keep repeating
that<00:01:05.250> until<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.790> fed<00:01:06.030> him<00:01:06.119> 10<00:01:06.510> August<00:01:06.990> now

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
that until you fed him 10 August now

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.200 
that until you fed him 10 August now
obviously<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.100> alpha<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.520> still<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> little

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
obviously it's alpha it's still a little

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.780 
obviously it's alpha it's still a little
bit<00:01:09.510> booger<00:01:10.070> when<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.159> pick<00:01:11.280> up<00:01:11.369> an<00:01:11.490> old<00:01:11.610> ghost

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
bit booger when you pick up an old ghost

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.100 
bit booger when you pick up an old ghost
sometimes<00:01:12.180> I'll<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.479> kind<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.720> stand<00:01:13.020> there

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
sometimes I'll just kind of stand there

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.730 
sometimes I'll just kind of stand there
and<00:01:13.470> not<00:01:14.250> do<00:01:14.460> anything<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.540> did<00:01:15.780> then<00:01:15.960> DC<00:01:16.590> in

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and not do anything and I did then DC in

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.190 
and not do anything and I did then DC in
when<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.490> fed<00:01:17.700> him<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:17.939> ogre<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> did<00:01:18.930> fall

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
when I fed him that ogre so I did fall

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.429 
when I fed him that ogre so I did fall
from<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.590> sky<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.850> died<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:22.140> carry<00:01:22.350> him

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
from the sky and died but we carry him

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.499 
from the sky and died but we carry him
we<00:01:22.740> keep<00:01:22.920> feeding<00:01:23.130> him<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.210> beat<00:01:24.390> this

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
we keep feeding him and I just beat this

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.820 
we keep feeding him and I just beat this
so<00:01:24.659> because<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.930> does<00:01:25.080> take<00:01:25.290> quite<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.560> lot<00:01:25.799> of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
so because it does take quite a lot of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.100 
so because it does take quite a lot of
time<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.880> ogres<00:01:27.180> will<00:01:27.360> come<00:01:27.509> at<00:01:27.630> once

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
time to ogres will come at once

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.630 
time to ogres will come at once
as<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.439> see<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.650> one<00:01:28.829> ends<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:29.159> being<00:01:29.369> bugged

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
as you see that one ends up being bugged

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.850 
as you see that one ends up being bugged
but<00:01:29.970> luckily<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.780> over<00:01:31.049> okay<00:01:31.380> keep<00:01:31.560> spawning

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
but luckily the over okay keep spawning

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.890 
but luckily the over okay keep spawning
and<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.210> seems<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.479> be<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.659> very

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
and it just seems to be that very

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.450 
and it just seems to be that very
specific<00:01:34.439> spot<00:01:34.710> if<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> kill<00:01:35.100> them<00:01:35.250> there

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
specific spot if you kill them there

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.700 
specific spot if you kill them there
they<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.610> kind<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.140> stand<00:01:37.140> there<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.560> do

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
they just kind of stand there and do

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.910 
they just kind of stand there and do
nothing<00:01:37.880> but<00:01:38.880> alpha<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.720> alpha<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.530> reason

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
nothing but alpha is alpha for a reason

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.859 
nothing but alpha is alpha for a reason
I<00:01:41.070> do<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.790> concept<00:01:41.939> behind<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.689> right

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
I do like the concept behind the right

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.450 
I do like the concept behind the right
and<00:01:43.079> there's<00:01:43.380> some<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.710> fire<00:01:43.950> damage<00:01:44.280> and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
and there's some like fire damage and

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.429 
and there's some like fire damage and
stuff<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.030> need<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.479> avoid<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:46.110> if

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
stuff going on you need to avoid but if

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.260 
stuff going on you need to avoid but if
you're<00:01:47.009> quick<00:01:47.310> enough<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.759> killing<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
you're quick enough in killing the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.910 
you're quick enough in killing the
olga's<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> right-hand<00:01:49.320> side<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.740> don't

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
olga's to the right-hand side you don't

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.469 
olga's to the right-hand side you don't
wave<00:01:50.070> them<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.430> come<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> middle<00:01:51.030> you

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
wave them to come to the middle you

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.819 
wave them to come to the middle you
don't<00:01:51.509> really<00:01:51.780> need<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.110> deal<00:01:52.320> with<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.619> fire

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
don't really need to deal with the fire

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.800 
don't really need to deal with the fire
damage<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.220> be<00:01:53.490> honest<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.909> they<00:01:54.420> might<00:01:54.600> change

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
damage to be honest so they might change

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.569 
damage to be honest so they might change
that<00:01:55.020> they<00:01:55.110> might<00:01:55.259> make<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.439> bigger<00:01:55.799> radius<00:01:56.250> for

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
that they might make a bigger radius for

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.069 
that they might make a bigger radius for
the<00:01:56.640> fire<00:01:56.850> damage<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.180> avoid<00:01:57.619> but<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.680> think<00:01:58.890> the

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
the fire damage to avoid but I think the

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.270 
the fire damage to avoid but I think the
skill<00:02:01.079> behind<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.530> throw<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.890> meant<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> be

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
skill behind the throw is meant to be

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.940 
skill behind the throw is meant to be
the<00:02:02.430> feed<00:02:03.000> him<00:02:03.180> mechanic<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:04.619> keep<00:02:04.799> doing

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
the feed him mechanic and we keep doing

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.010 
the feed him mechanic and we keep doing
that<00:02:05.130> until<00:02:05.189> you've<00:02:05.579> fed<00:02:05.759> him<00:02:05.909> 10<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.630> as<00:02:06.899> I

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
that until you've fed him 10 it as I

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.809 
that until you've fed him 10 it as I
said<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.320> does<00:02:07.530> take<00:02:07.770> some<00:02:07.979> time<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.459> do<00:02:08.580> that

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
said it does take some time to do that

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.999 
said it does take some time to do that
is<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:09.629> good<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.929> yeah<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.349> long<00:02:10.590> period<00:02:10.979> of

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
is it's good to yeah a long period of

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.490 
is it's good to yeah a long period of
time<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:11.599> when<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.690> do<00:02:12.810> eventually<00:02:12.900> feed<00:02:13.379> him

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
time but when you do eventually feed him

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.910 
time but when you do eventually feed him
10

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
10

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.700 
10
he'll<00:02:14.430> spit<00:02:14.730> out<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:15.030> boulder<00:02:15.480> which<00:02:16.110> everyone

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
he'll spit out a boulder which everyone

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.560 
he'll spit out a boulder which everyone
can<00:02:16.860> loot<00:02:17.100> in<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.370> area<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:17.910> not<00:02:18.120> just<00:02:18.360> you

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
can loot in the area it's not just you

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.200 
can loot in the area it's not just you
