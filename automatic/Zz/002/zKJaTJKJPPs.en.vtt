00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 in the courtyard of the house on the street mustache 21 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.720
 stuck garbage truck about this pacific 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.639
 television told eyewitnesses 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.650
 film crew immediately 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.059
 went to the scene and here 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.059
 what picture we saw 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.790
 as it turned out the spokes car drove up to 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.310
 the store which was on the first 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.100
 floor of a residential building to pick up trash but 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.600
 while workers were loading household waste 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.940
 multi-ton car sucked in 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.100
 clay slurry do not drive out yourself 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.290
 It turned out all attempts led to 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.360
 that the garbage truck sank even more 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.090
 right side in the mud then help 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.580
 called for heavy equipment but kamaz 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.070
 pull the garbage truck out the first time 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.730
 succeeded only after a few unsuccessful 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.590
 attempts 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.480
 special car still managed 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.949
 rescue from clay captivity 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.949
 no entrance lie 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:26.490
 street well here is the time and because it will 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:28.500
 still be kicking and tired according to all 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.979
 same local people literally a month 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.200
 backwards 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.750
 workers are direct heat and power at this place 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.759
 conducted work place excavation seemingly 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.890
 leveled and then started to stack 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.670
 asphalt which has already managed twice 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.350
 fail 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.390
 as told the foreman 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.550
 organization asphalt failed due to 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.950
 the fact that it was not made a tsipko 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.200
 and the ground was not compacted due to which 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.780
 after heavy rains parking 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.119
 the playground just settled down and you already 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.030
 joking on this topic they say apparently 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.110
 whether the weather has failed the normal white 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.640
 stains. 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.290
 clay there too will be our leg up 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.650
 collapse 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.650
 to make
