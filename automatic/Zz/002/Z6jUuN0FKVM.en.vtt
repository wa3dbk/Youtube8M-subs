00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.639
 work further and calculate the following 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:14.269
 simple indefinite integral 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:14.269
 next type integral number 47 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.140
 calculate integral of fraction in numerator 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.590
 dx 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:34.640
 denominator sine squared 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:41.070
 pi to three x pi to 3x is the whole argument 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:44.700
 under the sine and so we will 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.500
 let's do for a start look at 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.590
 which one 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:53.899
 table integral is similar given to us 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.410
 integral for this need to remember 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:04.860
 table integral of the following type 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:09.240
 integral of dx divided by sine in 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.740
 squared just let's probably yes 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:18.810
 let me probably do it everywhere 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.150
 variable you probably yes yes yes let's 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.770
 probably write as x 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.290
 the variable is now clear for 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.740
 what does the integral of the form mean 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.579
 dt divided by although this is not fundamental 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.200
 it was possible to make them but it seems to me 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:40.670
 so it will be better 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.380
 dt divided by sine squared m 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.729
 by the way 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:51.509
 given that the unit parents share 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:54.600
 on sine theta is nothing but a cosecant t 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.460
 then this integral could be 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.369
 rewrite also differently that is this 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.369
 the same as the integral of 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:13.020
 integral of spit end 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.020
 spit end squared 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.900
 tdt 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.180
 so thats both integral this one 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.900
 and the same is clear so here is the integral 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.350
 turns out to be equal to 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:37.090
 he was in our table he was equal to us 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:39.340
 minus cot ton, plus the constant c Well 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.230
 yes really how to check very 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.010
 just find the derivative 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.560
 right part of the cotangent derivative 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.480
 equals unit divided minus unit 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.980
 divided by sine square t and here 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.570
 this minus minus gives minus plus and 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.480
 it turns out simply with pluses unit 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.370
 divide by sine square you are 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.150
 is everything correct or is it the same as 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.820
 cosecant in squared m so here 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.450
 this is a table integral to us now 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.090
 we need it now let's get our 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.630
 integral below this tabular 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.700
 means we fit it means we should 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:20.920
 get under the sign of the differential 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.070
 the same thing here we have 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.040
 under the sign of sine 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:30.100
 that is, we lack the coefficient at 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.519
 variable x pi sodium what we can 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.540
 to make 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:38.680
 since we lack pin 3 we 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.970
 let's multiply it into it 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.820
 first dx need to be rewritten 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.310
 so we multiply by pin 3 but we have pin 3 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.130
 there was no meaning so nothing has changed 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.360
 must be multiplied by pi 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.739
 pi split pi split and we 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.310
 divided by 3 means three necessary 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.850
 multiply 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.500
 that is, we essentially get what we do. 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.959
 3 pi 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.790
 multiplied pin 3 i.e. multiplied by pi 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.450
 divided by three multiplied divided 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:11.909
 further let's meanwhile denominator 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:15.310
 rewrite sine square pin 3x 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:17.699
 well, now only this one remains 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:23.919
 coefficient pe sodium contribute under the sign 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:24.880
 the differential we make then we have 3 to 3 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.190
 pi divided 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.630
 we can take it out as a constant 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:43.259
 integral then we will have an integral 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:51.370
 from the differential and by 3x and divided by 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:53.440
 sine squared pin 3x and see 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.070
 now we have turned out really 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.860
 integral which is here 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:03.310
 this lower tabular why because 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.400
 if you introduce a replacement that is mentally 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.710
 mark pin 3 multiply by x through t 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.539
 then we have an integral then 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.909
 this is also t then we will succeed 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.460
 integral of the form dt divided by sine 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:17.320
 square t and this is exactly this one 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.250
 our lower table integral is 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:24.130
 this integral will have the form 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:30.159
 3 divided by pi coefficient from us 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:34.690
 so only one minute remains hi 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:38.889
 I think they are all armor all right 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.270
 then 3 for beer, let's stay 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.800
 still know what we make the place 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.539
 defending a little I will explain why 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.590
 because we have before it 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:48.820
 a minus sign still appears 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.940
 why because look here here 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.710
 this integral is minus to tangent 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.199
 mean here now let's place for 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:01.030
 minus leave and so three on pi with us 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:02.770
 remains further and now this integral 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:07.690
 that is, this integral 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:10.020
 we find on the basis of our tabular that is 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.570
 we do it 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:17.340
 minus Cotangent so this one minus I 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:21.670
 I'll write down before the fraction minus further 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:26.230
 cot ton and as you have 3 pin 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:30.150
 multiply by x and by 3x this argument 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:37.560
 plus a constant c 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:37.560
 this is the final answer
