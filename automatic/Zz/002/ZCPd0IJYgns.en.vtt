the better when we're precise and folds
are<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:52.489> better<00:00:53.489> your<00:00:53.910> plane<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.390> to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
are the better your plane is going to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.549 
are the better your plane is going to
fly<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.920> try<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.160> do<00:00:56.340> as<00:00:56.520> well<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.300> i<00:00:57.449> can

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
bottom line of the tube holders that I

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.249 
bottom line of the tube holders that I
hold<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.909> down<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.450> like<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:19.939> so<00:01:20.939> now<00:01:21.259> pick

a spot about an inch or an inch and a
half<00:01:24.979> above<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.580> bottom<00:01:26.759> at<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.150> point<00:01:29.240> so

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
half above the bottom at this point so

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.960 
half above the bottom at this point so
like<00:01:30.450> about<00:01:30.780> here<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.070> crease<00:01:33.890> sorry<00:01:36.350> and

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
like about here on the crease sorry and

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.370 
like about here on the crease sorry and
folds<00:01:38.970> down<00:01:40.100> both<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.430> corners<00:01:42.229> to<00:01:43.229> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
folds down both of the corners to that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:57.930 
folds down both of the corners to that
point<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.890> like<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:48.740> then<00:01:52.520> this

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.280 

so<00:01:58.940> then<00:01:59.180> what<00:01:59.360> you're<00:01:59.480> going<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.660> do<00:01:59.780> is

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
so then what you're going to do is

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.270 
so then what you're going to do is
you're<00:02:00.380> going<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.560> take<00:02:00.770> this<00:02:00.950> little

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
you're going to take this little

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.780 
you're going to take this little
triangle<00:02:01.750> if<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:02.870> sticks<00:02:03.140> out<00:02:06.790> little

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
triangle if it sticks out little

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.180 
triangle if it sticks out little
triangle<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:08.300> sticks<00:02:08.539> up<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.800> I'm<00:02:09.920> going<00:02:10.160> to

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
triangle it sticks up and I'm going to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.680 
triangle it sticks up and I'm going to
fold<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.850> up<00:02:12.880> so<00:02:13.880> that<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.150> holds<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.480> two

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
fold that up so that it holds the two

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.400 
fold that up so that it holds the two
corners<00:02:15.530> down<00:02:15.910> so<00:02:16.910> then<00:02:17.120> you're<00:02:18.080> just<00:02:18.140> going

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
corners down so then you're just going

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:32.680 
corners down so then you're just going
to<00:02:19.060> fold<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.240> in<00:02:20.450> half<00:02:20.510> like<00:02:21.080> this<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:31.690> there

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
to fold it in half like this and there

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.060 
to fold it in half like this and there
you<00:02:32.750> go<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:33.020> is<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.230> main<00:02:33.350> value<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.739> a<00:02:33.830> plant

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
you go this is the main value of a plant

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.470 
you go this is the main value of a plant
so<00:02:34.220> now<00:02:34.340> what<00:02:34.489> we<00:02:34.550> have<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.700> do<00:02:34.880> is<00:02:35.000> fold<00:02:35.330> the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
so now what we have to do is fold the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.260 
so now what we have to do is fold the
wings<00:02:35.600> down<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:39.580> like<00:02:40.580> to<00:02:40.610> make<00:02:40.850> it<00:02:41.000> more<00:02:41.150> of

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
wings down so I like to make it more of

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.800 
wings down so I like to make it more of
a<00:02:41.330> dart<00:02:41.570> than<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.870> glider<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.120> make<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.600> wings

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
a dart than a glider so I make the wings

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.850 
a dart than a glider so I make the wings
pretty<00:02:45.260> small<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:47.690> can<00:02:47.930> experiment<00:02:48.590> around

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
pretty small you can experiment around

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:57.090 
pretty small you can experiment around
so<00:02:49.190> he<00:02:49.310> finds<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.790> best<00:02:50.050> way<00:02:51.250> for<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.780> yeah

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
so he finds the best way for you so yeah

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.240 
so he finds the best way for you so yeah
here<00:02:58.100> we<00:02:58.190> go<00:02:58.220> this<00:02:58.430> is<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.910> plane<00:02:59.830> okay<00:03:00.830> so<00:03:00.890> now

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
here we go this is the plane okay so now
