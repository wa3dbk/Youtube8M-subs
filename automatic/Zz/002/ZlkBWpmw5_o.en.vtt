from<00:00:06.839> target<00:00:07.970> about<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.330> was<00:00:09.690> like<00:00:09.809> three<00:00:09.990> weeks

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
from target about I was like three weeks

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.090 
from target about I was like three weeks
ago<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:11.010> it<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.420> bedhead<00:00:13.460> curling<00:00:14.460> lon

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
ago and it is the bedhead curling lon

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.390 
ago and it is the bedhead curling lon
and<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.609> was<00:00:17.760> only<00:00:17.910> thirteen<00:00:18.720> dollars<00:00:19.279> it<00:00:20.279> was

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
and it was only thirteen dollars it was

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.980 
and it was only thirteen dollars it was
like<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.760> last<00:00:20.910> pair<00:00:21.300> because<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.750> was<00:00:21.840> on

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
like the last pair because it was on

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.519 
like the last pair because it was on
clearance<00:00:22.340> but<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.699> usually<00:00:24.689> just<00:00:24.720> use<00:00:25.019> them

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
clearance but I usually just use them

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.050 
clearance but I usually just use them
for<00:00:26.119> ways<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.660> get<00:00:27.960> waves<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.890> today<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.760> just

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
for ways to get waves but today I just

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.840 
for ways to get waves but today I just
decided<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.929> use<00:00:31.170> them<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.859> regular<00:00:32.520> way

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
decided to use them in the regular way

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.639 
decided to use them in the regular way
that<00:00:35.030> you<00:00:36.030> should<00:00:36.300> use<00:00:36.570> my<00:00:36.809> guess<00:00:37.050> which<00:00:37.500> is

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
that you should use my guess which is

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.970 
that you should use my guess which is
just<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.040> get<00:00:38.219> normal<00:00:38.610> curls<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.469> this<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
just to get normal curls and this is the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.389 
just to get normal curls and this is the
curls<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:45.530> think<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:47.250> they

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
curls and that I have I think that they

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.170 
curls and that I have I think that they
did<00:00:47.610> pretty<00:00:48.300> well<00:00:49.219> it's<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:50.640> tight<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:51.090> I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
did pretty well it's not as tight as I

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.760 
did pretty well it's not as tight as I
would<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.480> because<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.899> know<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.410> this

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
would like because I know that this

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.880 
would like because I know that this
probably<00:00:53.670> won't<00:00:53.850> last<00:00:54.120> until<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
probably won't last until I like the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.910 
probably won't last until I like the
game<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.250> night<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.149> think<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.649> they

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
game of the night but I think that they

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.010 
game of the night but I think that they
are<00:00:59.120> gorgeous<00:01:00.120> gorgeous<00:01:00.859> curls<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:05.869> made<00:01:06.869> me

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
are gorgeous gorgeous curls I made me

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.740 
are gorgeous gorgeous curls I made me
good<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:07.740> do<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.100> side<00:01:08.430> though<00:01:11.600> be<00:01:12.600> it

overall<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.760> like<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.939> curling<00:01:15.330> wand<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:16.740> was

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
overall I like the curling wand it was

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.800 
overall I like the curling wand it was
not<00:01:17.369> expensive<00:01:17.790> because<00:01:18.090> they<00:01:18.330> had<00:01:18.509> something

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
not expensive because they had something

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.060 
not expensive because they had something
like<00:01:18.900> thirty<00:01:19.110> dollars<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.830> couldn't
