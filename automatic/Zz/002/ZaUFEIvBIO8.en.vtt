00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the top then you're going to arrange

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.610 
the top then you're going to arrange
them<00:00:35.460> all<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:36.239> your<00:00:36.780> white<00:00:37.079> piece<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.410> paper

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
them all on your white piece of paper

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.510 
them all on your white piece of paper
and<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:39.030> random<00:00:39.660> order<00:00:40.370> keeping<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
and just a random order keeping the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.520 
and just a random order keeping the
edges<00:00:41.910> lined<00:00:42.180> up<00:00:42.480> with<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.809> edges<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
edges lined up with the edges of the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.310 
edges lined up with the edges of the
paper<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.760> overlapping<00:00:45.390> them<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.989> you

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
paper and just overlapping them and you

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.660 
paper and just overlapping them and you
don't<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.770> worry<00:00:46.950> about<00:00:47.070> messing<00:00:47.340> up

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
don't have to worry about messing up

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.810 
don't have to worry about messing up
because<00:00:48.379> you<00:00:49.379> are<00:00:49.559> going<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.980> glue<00:00:50.219> after<00:00:50.730> you

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
because you are going to glue after you

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.900 
because you are going to glue after you
get<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.059> all<00:00:51.180> set<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.370> obviously<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.610> next

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
get it all set up so obviously the next

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.869 
get it all set up so obviously the next
step<00:00:54.090> will<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.539> believe<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.079> all<00:00:55.320> down<00:00:55.879> so

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
step will be to believe that all down so

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.590 
step will be to believe that all down so
now<00:00:57.300> I'm<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.079> down<00:00:58.620> all<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.100> layers

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
now I'm just going down all the layers

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.799 
now I'm just going down all the layers
then<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.109> take<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:02.070> swatch<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.059> cut<00:01:03.719> it

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
then I just take one swatch and cut it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.770 
then I just take one swatch and cut it
in<00:01:03.930> half<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.530> place<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.750> two<00:01:06.750> different

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
in half and place it in two different

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.410 
in half and place it in two different
places<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.979> piece<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.189> paper<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.240> add

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
places on the piece of paper just to add

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.310 
places on the piece of paper just to add
some<00:01:09.450> different<00:01:10.400> shapes<00:01:11.450> then<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.479> take<00:01:13.020> my

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320
