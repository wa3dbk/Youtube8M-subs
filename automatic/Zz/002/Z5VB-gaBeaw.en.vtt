00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.330 

I'm<00:01:35.660> going<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.840> do<00:01:35.960> one<00:01:36.170> at<00:01:36.290> a<00:01:36.380> time<00:01:36.650> again<00:01:37.130> in

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
I'm going to do one at a time again in

I'm going to do one at a time again in
my<00:01:37.460> double<00:01:37.790> strand<00:01:38.060> ends<00:01:38.510> just<00:01:39.290> a<00:01:39.350> little

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
my double strand ends just a little

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.820 
my double strand ends just a little
pinch<00:01:39.860> on<00:01:40.160> the<00:01:40.310> end<00:01:41.140> there's<00:01:42.140> grooves<00:01:42.560> that

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
pinch on the end there's grooves that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.320 
pinch on the end there's grooves that
are<00:01:43.070> right<00:01:43.220> on<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.370> inside<00:01:43.610> of<00:01:43.850> these<00:01:44.090> and

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
are right on the inside of these and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.140 
are right on the inside of these and
caps<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.020> there's<00:01:45.440> then<00:01:46.160> a<00:01:46.190> ball<00:01:46.550> chain<00:01:46.850> is<00:01:47.000> on

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
caps so there's then a ball chain is on

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.390 
caps so there's then a ball chain is on
inside<00:01:47.510> of<00:01:47.660> here<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.500> when<00:01:48.680> we<00:01:48.830> put<00:01:48.860> the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
inside of here so when we put the

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.910 
inside of here so when we put the
capture<00:01:49.970> on<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.360> inside<00:01:50.870> here<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:51.500> we<00:01:51.620> close

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
capture on the inside here and we close

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.250 
capture on the inside here and we close
