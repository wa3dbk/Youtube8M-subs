00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
below if I find any of them good and I

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.030 
below if I find any of them good and I
need<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:44.000> good<00:02:44.330> decent<00:02:44.720> battery<00:02:45.080> so<00:02:45.709> that's

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
need a good decent battery so that's

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.110 
need a good decent battery so that's
what<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.340> am<00:02:46.550> checking<00:02:46.760> for<00:02:51.670> so<00:02:52.670> yes<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:53.060> is

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
what I am checking for so yes this is

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.470 
what I am checking for so yes this is
the<00:02:53.330> mochi<00:02:53.900> boot<00:02:54.500> animation<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.489> is<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.239> good

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
the mochi boot animation and is a good

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.680 
the mochi boot animation and is a good
one<00:02:56.720> out<00:02:56.959> there<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:57.910> this<00:02:58.910> may<00:02:59.180> take<00:02:59.390> up<00:02:59.660> to

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
one out there and this may take up to

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.940 
one out there and this may take up to
three<00:03:00.080> minutes<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:00.769> we'll<00:03:00.950> wait<00:03:01.220> for<00:03:01.550> it

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
three minutes so we'll wait for it

three minutes so we'll wait for it
so<00:03:03.950> now<00:03:04.100> we<00:03:04.160> have<00:03:04.459> reached<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:05.090> setup<00:03:05.780> phase

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
so now we have reached the setup phase

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.470 
so now we have reached the setup phase
so<00:03:06.650> we'll<00:03:06.860> select<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.400> language<00:03:07.970> as<00:03:08.180> English

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
so we'll select the language as English

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
installed the Google G apps so I will

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.229 
installed the Google G apps so I will
reduce<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:42.920> brightness<00:03:43.130> so<00:03:43.549> you<00:03:43.609> can<00:03:43.850> see<00:03:44.120> it

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
much clearer so as always I tried doing

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.380 
much clearer so as always I tried doing
the<00:03:47.870> ot2<00:03:48.260> benchmark<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.190> which<00:03:49.760> gave<00:03:50.090> me<00:03:50.239> a

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
the ot2 benchmark and which gave me a

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.390 
the ot2 benchmark and which gave me a
pretty<00:03:50.630> good<00:03:50.780> decent<00:03:51.530> results<00:03:52.070> it<00:03:52.609> was<00:03:52.970> 22<00:03:54.400> 163

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
pretty good decent results it was 22 163

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.910 
pretty good decent results it was 22 163
which<00:03:55.850> was<00:03:56.150> a<00:03:56.390> pretty<00:03:56.750> awesome<00:03:57.109> result<00:03:57.769> it

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
which was a pretty awesome result it

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.000 
which was a pretty awesome result it
could<00:03:58.250> get<00:03:58.549> on<00:03:58.820> your<00:03:59.000> phone<00:03:59.239> and<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.890> battery

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
could get on your phone and the battery

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.490 
could get on your phone and the battery
back<00:04:01.400> up<00:04:01.430> was<00:04:01.790> also<00:04:02.239> very<00:04:02.480> good<00:04:02.780> better<00:04:03.200> than

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
back up was also very good better than

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.430 
back up was also very good better than
the<00:04:03.650> CM<00:04:03.980> 12.1<00:04:04.700> armani<00:04:05.150> version<00:04:05.600> you<00:04:06.140> can<00:04:06.230> see

the CM 12.1 armani version you can see

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.619 
the CM 12.1 armani version you can see
that<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:06.650> slope<00:04:07.070> is<00:04:07.340> very<00:04:07.400> much<00:04:07.970> high<00:04:08.180> so<00:04:08.450> miss

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
that a slope is very much high so miss

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.330 
that a slope is very much high so miss
will<00:04:08.810> give<00:04:08.989> you<00:04:09.050> pretty<00:04:09.260> decent<00:04:09.800> bristle<00:04:10.159> and

feature is that the direct call in
dialer<00:04:29.640> which<00:04:30.030> was<00:04:30.240> pretty<00:04:30.780> good<00:04:30.900> for<00:04:31.320> me<00:04:31.500> I

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
dialer which was pretty good for me I

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.570 
dialer which was pretty good for me I
had<00:04:32.340> timed<00:04:32.610> this<00:04:32.850> and<00:04:33.030> it<00:04:33.150> works<00:04:33.450> always<00:04:34.190> so<00:04:35.190> it

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
had timed this and it works always so it

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.790 
had timed this and it works always so it
would<00:04:35.880> be<00:04:36.030> like<00:04:36.270> when<00:04:36.630> you<00:04:36.840> die<00:04:37.050> someone<00:04:37.590> and

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
would be like when you die someone and

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.410 
would be like when you die someone and

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
when you keep it in your ear it will

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.260 
when you keep it in your ear it will
automatically<00:04:40.080> call<00:04:40.290> up<00:04:40.470> that<00:04:40.650> person<00:04:41.130> so<00:04:42.060> Mis
