00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.210
 I saw videos to a new video of your channel 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.830
 in hunger 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.690
 this time I'm going to share a 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.640
 excellent application that sure will 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.260
 is going to be very useful to all of you for 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.720
 start let's see what permission 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.400
 we need to see what is marked 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.169
 certain options in the menu 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.810
 phone settings so you 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.940
 you go to the settings section we go to 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.710
 the security option whether to 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.420
 verify this because we are going to make a 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.070
 installation of an external application to 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.440
 the group law following we're going to 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.810
 find the applied format compatible 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.609
 with all the android devices there are 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.170
 that in the administration section of 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.059
 devices you have to have marked 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.410
 known origins is the permission that we 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.559
 will allow to install an application 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.300
 outside the store and in the next 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.969
 option to verify applications 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.440
 we will remove the bad check not 400 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.449
 teams looking at the configuration of 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.800
 google once done this let's do 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.550
 the installation if we are going to use in the 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.000
 file manager of your 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.340
 preference 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.950
 I'm not going to rhodes flowers, I have it in my 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.870
 apk folder and here it's called the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.500
 application is called word lens translator 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.790
 3.0 we are going to install in this case I do not 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.440
 he installs it because I have it done 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.990
 because he did not show me any permission if 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.369
 let's give it to cancel but you should 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.100
 perform to and have no problem 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.200
 then we will look for it with 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.690
 qualification is called word lens we give it 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.210
 to execute immediately open the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.880
 camera in this interface actions 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.759
 presents as a first option is about 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.890
 to square or verify that the application 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.070
 is working so as an option 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.380
 will show you some letters 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.090
 in inverted order there is no need to 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.920
 remove them in the above section if you are 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.509
 in demo mode when it's going to 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.920
 run first is the application yes 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.590
 I think they have in mind it's just one of 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.180
 not be after that in the section of 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.530
 up we have the way how 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.470
 select the language and we have many 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.360
 how languages ​​of how to translate it into 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.759
 English in Spanish from Spanish in English 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.880
 of French English and many other 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.410
 options we have Portuguese English Russian 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.540
 yes and we also have the option of more 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.070
 languages ​​then as you saw here 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.450
 it opens a kind of interface or a 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.700
 kind of box where where we should 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.170
 center what we want to translate in this 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.020
 case we go to the English section 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.770
 Spanish and here I have some examples and 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.930
 let's let's try to translate as 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.760
 the option we are going to translate from English to 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.760
 Spanish and we have to with the famous phrase 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.740
 of an American jet in god we trust 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.480
 that you see in real time 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.550
 he is immediately translating it if I 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.170
 I take it off is what it says not in the 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.200
 next example we go to where it says 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:49.350
 car and obviously says here and we go to 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.350
 last example where dog says yes 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.230
 now let's try with others we would go 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.790
 in a fast way because this video 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.099
 it's really very fast because it has 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.489
 worked very well and now we're going to 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:03.160
 translate from Spanish to English ok zoom and 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.470
 house that is sun and house and I take it and 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.470
 says sun and house now let's try a 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.300
 language more than it's about French to 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.500
 English in this case we do not have the option 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.790
 to translate some other language to 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.220
 Spanish but we can translate it into 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.810
 English that is much better known to you 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.700
 under pressure the country 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.670
 and they are also looking at the section 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.170
 conscious word the word but not if 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.480
 you are in case you are in some 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.800
 movement and not because they do not want no 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.230
 They want to be moving will not be the 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.330
 that is holding there because they can give 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.760
 there and we can talk making option 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.550
 it takes away what is translating 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.459
 we continue giving him play and in this case 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.709
 still not with a translation we can 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.930
 zoom in we can remove we can turn on 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.060
 the flash we can turn it off so that we 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.220
 help with the translation if in this case 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.930
 is an application action I repeat that 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.730
