00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 from 16 to 18 june it will take place 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.730
 this year's e3 in the run-up to the trade fair 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.980
 all kinds of information were already 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.259
 some are known to play over 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.440
 official and some about unofficial 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.850
 Channels looking forward to the e3 does that 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.560
 Of course, no demolition 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.810
 but there are also those 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.240
 different category of games 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.650
 that is not yet official 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.420
 have been announced or their development 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.519
 started a long time ago and of which 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.679
 since then no one heard the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.420
 hope of one of these games in the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.219
 next week as a surprise 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.290
 look forward to the e3 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.719
 just as alive as the hunger for food 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.440
 concrete information for example 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.440
 fallout 4 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.650
 one will still be allowed to dream 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.629
 that's the motto of this video we 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.710
 want five dream announcements for the 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.720
 introduce e3 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.879
 We could do some of these games 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.199
 definitely get to see others are 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.839
 probably very unlikely 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.070
 but we do not care about that because you 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.070
 will still be allowed to dream 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.840
 let's start with one right away 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.640
 Last guest in such lists at the last 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.920
 Guardian actually already had it 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.020
 year 2011 for the playstation 3 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.240
 However, it was supposed to appear several times 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.190
 postponed and is valid for some years 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.830
 as lost in the development 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.149
 hall statements by sony usually affirm 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.700
 only that the project by no means 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:31.190
 set details are called however 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.990
 no fans are still hoping for 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.190
 a new announcement of the project for the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.229
 playstation 4 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.300
 little wonder finally comes 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.030
 the game of team ico the developers 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.500
 behind al ko and shadow of the colossus 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.330
 even if the former game director 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.399
 fumito ueda the last information 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.979
 According to only advisory function 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.690
 Hope is involved in an e3 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.940
 We were recently introduced by the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.459
 reaction of talents arising 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.740
 insider sources letter and in fact 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.660
 It would be a good year for the game more 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.369
 or revive less 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.800
 Sony and Microsoft could both 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.300
 use additional exclusive titles 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 under last guardian would be one 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.569
 potential blast in the home 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.569
 playstation we hope 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.590
 the firter fallout 4 already has before 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.750
 e3 announced as the question arises 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.000
 whether you have another in the context of the fair 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.950
 would like to introduce a new project for the first time 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.239
 not in the full shadow of the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.819
 role play should stand 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.069
 On top of that, the studio is the first time with 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.510
 a press conference on site 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.000
 you want the fans but also determined 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.590
 another surprise presented 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.590
 obvious candidate would be there the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.599
 dishonored developer of ea studios die 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.129
 have been around for several years 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.260
 next project I work that 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.129
 could be presentable accordingly 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.049
 100 followers would be absolutely conceivable 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.030
 and maybe prey is 2 years old 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.980
 not yet as written down as it is after 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.200
 The last official statements sounded 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.849
 rumors finally said that 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.440
 the team of aquin studios die 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.629
 development should have taken over 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.519
 the b then fixed one 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.889
 setting of the project confirmed 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.870
 definitely turns prey 2 into one 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.239
 abundant unlikely candidates 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.579
 for an e3 surprise we would the 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.579
 alien bounty hunting still likes to play 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.900
 My name is the Finnish developers 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.879
 from remedy entertainment are best 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.069
 known for the first two parts of the 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.590
 max payne row and are currently working on 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.450
 could break but the team around sam 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.090
 Lake also has the atmospheric 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.590
 horror play alan wake in the portfolio and 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.690
 not only does that have our opinion 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.940
 a successor deserves continuations 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.380
 were even planned that betrayed the 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.690
 ram the developers in april the 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.540
 editorial of polygon and even showed 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.310
 Scenes from a prototype one 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.810
 Continuing to alan wake one wanted 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.480
 do not exclude categorically 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.519
 However, even if you as the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.590
 possible hint to understand it 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.420
 the draw is in line with quantum 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.670
 break with a follower to alan wake 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.440
 would like to try the game for 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.880
 a big announcement not far away 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.979
 be advanced enough 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.870
 the fans, however, should also be 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.880
 already the pure confirmation and happy 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.880
 hey one will still be allowed to dream 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:41.289
 star wars fan fortin is dead long live 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:43.150
 star wars fan deserves this or something similar 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.249
 can be expected expectations 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.889
 many players describe since known 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:49.960
 became that the unannounced star was 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.699
 game of better games from the 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.349
 set lukas art project 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.930
 could have emerged 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:58.270
 officially known about the game at 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.460
 among others uncharted machin amy 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.060
 hennig is still working as well as 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.159
 Nothing 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.199
 even if the developers are striking 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.659
 gladly hints at smuggler and han 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.969
 solo releases Germany so far 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:11.770
 also little concrete that we 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.629
 the game gets to see e3 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.460
 but the more pleasing would be the 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.500
 surprise and so good battlefront 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.810
 hopefully at least one will 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.520
 another big star wars game without 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.969
 multiplayer focus would be 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.969
 desirable 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.910
 what boxster is actually doing 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.800
 next in the context of e3 an answer 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.820
 to get this question would be one 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.320
 great surprise 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.090
 and we have an exact 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.250
 Presentation of the answer we 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.010
 would like to hear so good the 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.470
 gta-row also is to gta 5 can 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.780
 first another unbearably long 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.950
 Waiting time come us with one 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.470
 successor to red dead redemption 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.690
 sweetened is a continuation to 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.240
 rockstar western in modern technology and 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.490
 with pc version already we would be ready 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.590
 this year's e3 is one of the best 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.120
 no matter what 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.590
 breakdowns and embarrassments and at the 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.590
 press conferences expected 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.910
 that was five of our wishes 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.280
 Announcements for this year's e3 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.080
 Of course there are many more 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.790
 We would all have accommodated that 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.660
 video probably down to the ground in 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.460
 to run 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.350
 that's why we fit comparatively 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.570
 but of course you want to be short 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:33.580
 know which games announcements 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.580
 you stubbornly often let us know
