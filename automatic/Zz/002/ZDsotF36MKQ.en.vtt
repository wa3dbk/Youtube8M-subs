00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:39.430
 to all and that 007 I hope you 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.260
 be well 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.400
 as for share I'm fine then 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.620
 today I am going to present you a 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.089
 glitch that will allow you to respawn 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.980
 in the vehicle and to which you are 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.150
 so that's where I'm doing them that a 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.699
 quad but it works very well that a 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.989
 helicopter in plane an end time 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.110
 all battlefield vehicles even 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.610
 even a centurion finally a bca I believe 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.589
 but here I may want to say 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.519
 nonsense so this glitch is moderately 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.470
 simple to make 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.570
 but I think it works 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.400
 when you are attacking on the street and but 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.170
 other than that frankly it would not hurt 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.280
 only niche 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.170
 so in fact good we can we can 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.720
 to commit suicide or to be killed that is not 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.630
 serious but in the menu he will see himself 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.650
 deploy so really that his attacker 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.720
 I believe on all platforms 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.340
 sama I do not know so sure on pc its margin 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.590
 could you not be able to assert 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.610
 things I do not know but I'm sure 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.500
 that on xbox it works 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.290
 So yeah actually I got there 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.690
 kill before deploying actually hard at 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.580
 still bales do it unfurled it 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.070
 will chew the round button so mashaie 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.180
 it's really strafed the the button 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.820
 to get into the vehicle so in 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.260
 the occurrence on playstation 3 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.990
 buttons to enter the vehicle 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.360
 there you will vaginas of it Metref 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.159
 you just have to deploy and 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.140
 after you press the button to 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.470
 close to having entered the 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.360
 vehicle 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.490
 not really wait for the three 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.620
 little three little sticks above 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.290
 of deployment be ok once that 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.400
 it's good you deploy yourself during 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.430
 the need is there the black truffle 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.080
 will have to be really strafed the 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.000
 button finally round the button to enter 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.349
 in the vehicle is in principle you 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.299
 will be able to take the enemies back 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.010
 if your vehicle exploded of course 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:15.299
 so I hope this video will have you 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.299
 more to the next bye
