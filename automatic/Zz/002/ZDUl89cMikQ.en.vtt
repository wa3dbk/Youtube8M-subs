00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.689

new scratches you can see the phone is
in<00:00:27.270> perfect<00:00:28.199> condition

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:40.189 

just<00:00:32.699> the<00:00:32.910> chrome<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.629> flaking<00:00:34.020> off<00:00:38.930> never<00:00:39.930> out

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
just the chrome is flaking off never out

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:50.520 
just the chrome is flaking off never out
of<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> case

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.400 

like<00:00:51.310> I<00:00:51.460> said

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.569 

now<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.769> the<00:00:55.859> case<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.070> people<00:00:56.309> are

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
now this is the case that people are

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.270 
now this is the case that people are
talking<00:00:56.730> about<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.980> damage<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.070> coming

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
talking about that the damage is coming

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:11.539 
talking about that the damage is coming
from<00:01:00.079> but<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:07.880> don't<00:01:08.880> know<00:01:10.070> it's<00:01:11.070> pretty<00:01:11.250> sad

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
from but I don't know it's pretty sad

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.139 
from but I don't know it's pretty sad
but<00:01:12.860> I<00:01:13.860> guess<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.220> t-mobile<00:01:14.640> had<00:01:14.880> replaced

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
but I guess that t-mobile had replaced

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.289 
but I guess that t-mobile had replaced
it<00:01:15.420> under<00:01:16.140> buyer's<00:01:16.860> remorse<00:01:17.070> return<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.940> this

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
it under buyer's remorse return to this

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.670
