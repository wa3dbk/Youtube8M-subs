00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.089
 hello and welcome very much 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.500
 A lot of tv people make an announcement of me 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.200
 me that was a female voice like 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.519
 that categorically starting a fun people 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.440
 Welcome as they already are 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.800
 I was asked if I was 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.449
 can make an inside and I have 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.740
 Now also as you know I am 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.930
 all coincidence when it comes to videos 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.310
 to edit and all that means this 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.250
 video I will not be cut 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.060
 but time stamp down there in the 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.340
 Descriptions do that to her exactly 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.750
 know what then how come I have mine 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.130
 Here again another assistant 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.480
 this is the sophie hello 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.629
 some probably know me 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.340
 have on your costs made the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.480
 You can also find the link in the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.219
 description she shares this one 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.170
 fanpage with another cost 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.710
 teacher in any case back to the topic 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.420
 it's all about the corner move 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.100
 What that is is almost their kick with 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.020
 So listen, you give your go a cow 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.340
 league with the afterwards sat on it 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.949
 behind them, the word jumps 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.510
 and then click into your team before 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.100
 But then we have to do that 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.290
 set some things again that 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.330
 importantly firstly we need smartcast 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.010
 weeks smartcast because everywhere we are 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.010
 let's see normal rotation 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.390
 I will have to make important this time 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.740
 that you all come pretty fast 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.020
 otherwise the opponent has enough possibility 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.290
 around you then circuit to kick off what 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.090
 I know that too, so go for yours 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.150
 Hiring brokers are now 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 so everything you do immediately 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.689
 is used without him even one 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.159
 killshot things comes at the mark and 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.960
 that shows again from the other ways 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.060
 In any case, that's how it looks 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.470
 normal I'll do that again what I do 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.860
 make it completely normal 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.330
 I was a little too far off shit like 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.130
 would you then again to go 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.320
 and I just do watch again if 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.660
 I 'm overflowing we have to go 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.590
 Here's my cooler and wait for you 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.570
 at the evil world so coo and direct 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.670
 kick and then the opponent is in five 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.640
 is opponent against turks style called 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.650
 that too and that's how it is 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.270
 So as I said first needs everything 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.350
 on markus akw on eur and ipic gb is 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.660
 or are already out of markus at lyss 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.850
 Actually, keep the items there from 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.560
 who uses the word I have it in 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.959
 the case on it in common so that the amag 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:23.020
 ubs he made swr so accurate and then I am 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.600
 I stop immediately at the opponent 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.580
 On it you had to short the beasts and 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.650
 motto as you can also like it 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.860
 short-sighted as you want so what wants 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.810
 I do not know then then I dance then 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.040
 If I have you one more here 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.870
 now go out in the bay 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.570
 you can even the meantime, some of 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.860
 the people you achieve slightly more 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.489
 know about you and I mean that 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.850
 display and how and how long do you do 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:56.890
 you there you came to it 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:59.230
 ok so yes I'll do the play 2011 with 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.820
 laila am actually there by language 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.060
 come that I just finalistenisten 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.250
 looked at and said and so on 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.190
 continue as it is and through 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.680
 internet will eventually come up 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.380
 cosplay on so funny disguised 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.660
 people who dress like games 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.660
 characters and anime characters and such 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.220
 On and I thought that was cool 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.760
 that also always happy 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.620
 made me disguised and yes I did 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.709
 I started then and how much 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.150
 There is money for each cosplay from there 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:37.780
 you again I am waiting for you I have yes 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:39.580
 I'm okay, I want the whole thing 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.620
 Here is again really nice 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.209
 slowly step by step to show her 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.260
 know perhaps a little more here 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.560
 come because that's the whole thing 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.250
 So everything is very slow team 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.990
 Make your cow jump with cake 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.670
 So set your opponents whichever 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.060
 direction he should jump to the word 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.640
 on 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.310
 and then the kick comes, that's all 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.080
 easy so it's super light off it 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.390
 maybe a lot is still some 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.340
 hard there are really moments that is 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.870
 sometimes with me so where you have one 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.670
 little bit not the topic 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.310
 to make co2 so he just like that 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.780
 looks like and not without but 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.270
 properly liquid rotation another 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.950
 there is still trick for that then i would have to 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.229
 wait again for my own politics 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.450
 water will last 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:28.210
 minute again how is now 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.710
 really fluid too, they hold a lot 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.130
 faster on her because the trick is 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.130
 just what I have achieved when sustaining 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.180
 Surgery is more or less like this 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.470
 has nowhere to worry about that 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.210
 opponent away flash and there it is 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.910
 if one flew towards you 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.520
 the opponents always surface first 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.720
 then away when the ward is set 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.450
 You can do it with the flashlight 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.460
 to interviews and you can do it first 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.039
 make the multi and you would be in the 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.690
 animation is flashing because then he will 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.919
 then click on the page 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.080
 the man behind flash is and you 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.580
 So needs a quick reaction to it 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.050
 most do not realize that 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.090
 must already be out of fear then already 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.320
 before flashing that one then almost 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.120
 finished that's the word ok my 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.169
 and i need it again for a short time 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.570
 the ten seconds 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.979
 as I said everything from the market and shows him 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:20.890
 not fast enough as a complainer creates 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:21.729
 that does not say anything here now, so to speak 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.099
 on the opponent's turn 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.840
 google still makes a cow and instead 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.950
 that right now the power you do 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.950
 yours and ii and then flash s 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.610
 hello yes you have just seen me 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.760
 I first made the multi and then 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.960
 flashed that the preacher is one 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.310
 must be able to cover it so you have to 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.960
 a can shit and flash s ground 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.510
 but the whole thing is completely gone 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.040
 impossible, and that's it but only once 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.690
 so far from this little corner 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.490
 tutorial I hope hinbekommen 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.960
 so more or less this is important 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.550
 Just practice practicing 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.610
 the edi watchers are really fluid 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.020
 can get a little note here if 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.100
 you really fly on an enemy 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.139
 the coo does not always have to 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.070
 arrive the form of the second child it 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.960
 can also be enough if you just 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.760
 just behind the opponent arrives and then 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.840
 Simply ranking in the team would have to be there 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.140
 stop but have it around the belly 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.120
 or not and as much as you can 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.550
 make a car 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.020
 you are allowed to include the people 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.020
 abo and easily when you like them 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.600
 I just hope that tutorial 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.950
 you liked it 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.240
 if you still remember crossing can one her 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.240
 abo or dismiss
