00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
understand how that would play into this

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.709 
understand how that would play into this
because<00:00:53.640> many<00:00:53.850> people<00:00:53.940> thought<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.360> Kevin

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
because many people thought that Kevin

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.540 
because many people thought that Kevin
Owens<00:00:54.780> was<00:00:55.230> going<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.680> win<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.010> match<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
Owens was going to win this match and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.250 
Owens was going to win this match and
there<00:00:57.120> wouldn't<00:00:57.270> be<00:00:57.449> room<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.899> third<00:00:57.960> match

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
there wouldn't be room for a third match

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.330 
there wouldn't be room for a third match
hell<00:00:58.410> they<00:00:58.500> probably<00:00:58.739> shouldn't<00:00:59.010> even<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.309> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
hell they probably shouldn't even be a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.130 
hell they probably shouldn't even be a
second<00:00:59.789> or<00:00:59.879> third<00:01:00.090> match<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.870> know<00:01:00.989> what

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140
