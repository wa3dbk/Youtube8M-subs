00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
solid black so that's okay the only

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.049 
solid black so that's okay the only
thing<00:00:52.680> i<00:00:52.739> don't<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.980> about<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.699> figure

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
thing i don't like about this figure

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.479 
thing i don't like about this figure
really<00:00:54.390> two<00:00:54.750> things<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.980> cape<00:00:56.190> collar

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
really two things one is the cape collar

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.939 
really two things one is the cape collar
just<00:00:56.850> looks<00:00:57.120> really<00:00:57.420> bad<00:00:57.660> i<00:00:57.930> could<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.920> wrong

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
but I don't think it's supposed to be

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.959 
but I don't think it's supposed to be
that<00:01:00.449> thick<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.930> clunky<00:01:01.739> looking<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.280> then

looks really good I can't be sure I
don't<00:02:02.250> know<00:02:02.340> if<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.610> lighting<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
don't know if it's the lighting in the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.920 
chest there came
way<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.460> kind<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.760> bummer<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.270> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
way so it's kind of a bummer and the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.200 
way so it's kind of a bummer and the
belt<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.260> really<00:02:16.650> ugly<00:02:16.800> looking<00:02:17.310> it's<00:02:17.850> just

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
belt is really ugly looking it's just

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.260

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
paintwork is sloppy and it looks a

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.560 
paintwork is sloppy and it looks a
little<00:02:23.220> bit<00:02:23.430> green<00:02:23.700> in<00:02:23.880> some<00:02:24.090> areas<00:02:24.420> just

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
little bit green in some areas just

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.050 
little bit green in some areas just
doesn't<00:02:24.900> look<00:02:25.020> good<00:02:25.490> there<00:02:26.490> is<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> little<00:02:26.850> bit

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
doesn't look good there is a little bit

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.490 
doesn't look good there is a little bit
of<00:02:27.180> paint<00:02:27.390> problem<00:02:27.720> there<00:02:27.960> on<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.290> hip

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
of paint problem there on the hip

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.220 
of paint problem there on the hip
whereas<00:02:29.070> trunks<00:02:29.460> end<00:02:29.670> but<00:02:30.480> otherwise<00:02:30.750> it's

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
whereas trunks end but otherwise it's

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.370 
whereas trunks end but otherwise it's
pretty<00:02:31.650> good<00:02:32.000> this<00:02:33.000> boot<00:02:33.300> is<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.840> little<00:02:34.260> bit

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
pretty good this boot is a little bit

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.020 
pretty good this boot is a little bit
sloppy<00:02:34.620> as<00:02:34.830> well<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.310> pain<00:02:35.490> work<00:02:35.670> could<00:02:35.880> be

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
sloppy as well so the pain work could be

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.180 
sloppy as well so the pain work could be
a<00:02:36.060> little<00:02:36.240> bit<00:02:36.420> better<00:02:36.630> but<00:02:37.260> overall<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.950> do

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
a little bit better but overall I do

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.670 
a little bit better but overall I do
like<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.550> figure<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.780> do<00:02:39.840> recommend<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.530> if

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
like the figure and I do recommend it if

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.620 
like the figure and I do recommend it if

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
with a peg and a bat symbol so I really

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.380 
with a peg and a bat symbol so I really
kind<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.250> wish<00:02:56.340> she<00:02:56.460> came<00:02:56.610> with<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.820> Batarang

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
kind of wish she came with a Batarang

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.650 
kind of wish she came with a Batarang
although<00:02:58.070> if<00:02:59.070> memory<00:02:59.490> serves<00:02:59.520> he<00:03:00.360> wasn't

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
although if memory serves he wasn't

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.660 
although if memory serves he wasn't
known<00:03:00.780> for<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.020> Batarang<00:03:01.470> at<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.770> point<00:03:02.040> he

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
known for the Batarang at this point he

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.430 
known for the Batarang at this point he
had<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.000> gun<00:03:03.330> I<00:03:03.600> think<00:03:03.930> actually<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.290> he

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
had a gun I think actually that he

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.040 
had a gun I think actually that he
carried<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.710> gun<00:03:04.920> in<00:03:05.220> this<00:03:06.000> outfit<00:03:06.420> but<00:03:06.930> I'm<00:03:07.020> not
