00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.080
ï»¿Thanks for joining us here on World
Tech Update. Iâ€™m Nick Barber.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.070
Coming up on this weekâ€™s showâ€¦North
Korea develops its own Linux OS, Intel introduces

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.210
a new Classmate PC at Germanyâ€™s Cebit
and Google tries to explain that street view

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.370
is nothing to fear. Weâ€™ll get to the
Cebit news in just a bit, but first Apple

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.000
filed a patent infringement lawsuit this Tuesday
against HTC, claiming that the Taiwanese company

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.070
is infringing on 20 Apple patents. The patents
are related to the iPhone UI and the smartphoneâ€™s

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.079
underlying architecture and hardware. In a
statement Apple CEO Steve Jobs said that quote

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.989
we can sit by and watch competitors steal
our patented inventions or we can do something

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.059
about it end quote. HTC has not commented
on the filing yet.

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:01.309
Sonyâ€™s PlayStation Network was hit
by a glitch this week that left users on all

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.210
continents unable to connect to the online
service. With 38 million users worldwide,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.010
the Playstation Network is an Internet based
service that connects PS3 consoles to online

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.649
stores, software downloads and is used as
a platform for some multiplayer online games.

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.049
Sony restored service to the PlayStation Network
by resolving a glitch in the internal clock

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.049
of some PlayStation 3 consoles that recognized
2010 as a leap year and wrongly added a Feb.

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.990
29 to the clock.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.130
Environmental group Greenpeace is criticizing
Samsung for reneging on a promise to remove

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.180
harmful substances from its products. Here
Greenpeace activists can be seen installing

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.450
signs on the Samsung building in Brussels.
In 2006 the company promised it would end

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.780
the use of brominated flame retardants or
BFRs in its products by January 1, 2010, but

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.210
that never happened. In November 2009, less
than two months before the deadline, Samsung

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.330
emailed Greenpeace to say it wouldnâ€™t
be able to keep its promise. BFRs have the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.039
potential to damage the environment and harm
human health and their elimination has been

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.710
a major goal of Greenpeace in the electronics
sector. Other companies like Dell, Lenovo

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.530
and LG Electronics delayed changes as well
but they confessed at least one year before

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.250
their deadlines. Samsung says it will now
remove BFRs from MP3 players and digital cameras

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.610
by June 1st of this year and from laptop computers
by January 1, 2011.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.900
North Korea has reportedly developed its own
version of the Linux operating system with

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.250
a graphical user interface that closely resembles
Microsoft Windows. A copy of the North Korean

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.030
Linux distribution called Red Star was purchased
for 5 US dollars by a Russian student named

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.330
Mikhail who then posted a brief review on
his blog. One of two Russian students at North

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.000
Koreaâ€™s Kim Il-Sung University, Mikhail
said it took about 15 minutes to install and

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.310
said it came with a single language option,
Korean.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.840
Now itâ€™s over to Martyn Williams whoâ€™s
covering the Cebit trade show in Germany,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.530
Martyn?

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.700
Thanks Nick and welcome to Hanover. We're
gonna kick off with news of some new products

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.470
and this week Intel announced the latest version
of its Classmate PC.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.760
The student-targeted Classmates runs on a
new Atom processor, the N450, which uses 20

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.400
percent less power than previous models so
prolongs the battery life. Intel has also

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.780
added new connectivity options including 3G
wireless and WiMax.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.460
"A lot of improvement has actually been done
since the first version. It has a rubberized

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:43.550
surface so this rubberized surface gives you
more of a feeling of ruggedness. This one

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.190
drops better, so it can withstand a drop from
the desk height of the kids. You know, it

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.960
now has a bigger screen, a 10.1 inch screen,
a bigger keyboard, it's almost a full size

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.960
keyboard now."

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.250
Intel won't make the machine - it's a reference
design offered to PC makers. The first models

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.510
should be out in April.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.150
Taiwan's Asus, the company that created the
netbook, is now trying its hand at e-book

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.010
readers. The DR900 is due out in the second
half and has a 9-inch touch-sensitive display.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.820
The battery should last about 10,000 page
turns before it needs to be recharged and

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.190
the 4 gigabytes of internal memory is enough
for hundreds of electronic books. Asus hasn't

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.190
announced a price.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:26.310
And Mio's latest navigation device, the Moov
V780, comes with a 7-inch touchscreen. Video

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.940
is a main feature and it can playback files
and tune in to digital TV. It can also be

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.540
hooked-up to a TV and playback high-def video.
There's a Web browser and music player alongside

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.840
the core navigation function. It will be available
in the second half for around 499 euros, that's

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.750
about 680 US dollars.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.970
Cebit is all about selling products but Google
is here for the first time trying to sell

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.810
an idea to a skeptical German public: that
their Street View service isn't evil.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.410
Street view has launched in several European
countries despite protests despite privacy

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.630
advocates. But in Germany the situation is
different. Here the company is building an

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.560
opt-out system to appease the privacy authority.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.520
"Right now we are working on an opt-out tool.
So for German users we give them the opportunity

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.920
that they can tell us now that they don't
want to have the house included in Street

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.920
View."

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.260
As part of its push Google's Chief Technology
Advocate spoke to local media and tried to

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.620
sell them on some of the benefits of Street
View and allay some fears.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.620
"

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.540
The pictures are still kinda blurry. It's
not some super spy-camera. It's a little camera

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.250
on top of a car and the car is shaking. It's
not super high-quality photography but it's

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.070
enough to say 'Oh, it's that building, it's
not the other building.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.820
At Cebit, attendees can get an up-close look
at three Street View cars, and the company

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.280
has let artists loose on them -- something
that ironically has visitors snapping pictures.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.700
How many will take Google up on its exclusion
program remains to be seen but company officials

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.490
say they expect it to be a small number.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.410
Sticking with the web, the German Research
Center for Artifical Intelligence and Saarland

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.680
University have developed an extension for
HTML that allows for 3D models to be included

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.260
on websites. This is the kind of thing they
can do with XML 3D.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.430
This is a 3D model of a Venetian Palace embedded
into a Wikipedia page. It can be navigated

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.490
and controlled with the mouse. It's this integration
with HTML and Web browsers that the developers

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.940
believe makes it a better alternative to competing
technologies that require developers to learn

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.900
a new programming language.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.090
The next-step will be the release of a modified
version of Firefox with support for XML3D

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.010
so that Web developers can try the technology
out for themselves. That should appear in

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.800
the next couple of weeks at XML3D.org.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.450
As the snow begins falling that's it from
Cebit for now. We've still got a couple more

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.480
days of reporting to go, so come back to next
week's World Tech Update and we'll wrap up

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.100
Cebit, but for now it's back to Nick in hopefully
a warmer Boston. Nick?

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.690
Thanks Martyn, we have some snow here too
so it's no warmer in Boston than Hanover.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.400
Well thatâ€™s our show for this week.
Coming up on next week's show weâ€™ll

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.850
take a look at body scanners being installed
right here at Boston Logan Airport and of

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.260
course all the latest tech news. Find out
whatâ€™s coming up on every weekâ€™s

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.199
show by following us on Facebook and Twitter.
As we head out this week weâ€™ll leave

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:19.400
you with some more shots of Cebit. Iâ€™m
Nick Barber and for all of us here at IDG

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.310
thanks for watching and we hope to see you
next week.
