 the threat is a technological resource that has been promoted for many 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.179
 years himself 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.749
 but they did not prosper everywhere 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:18.499
 farmers' thresholds 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:20.289
 mainly the green 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.839
 that changing the technology will generate waste ok work complications 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.160
 in response to this foundation produces sinaloa 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.630
 has scientifically confirmed that this type of waiting 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.480
 decreases production costs and makes the structure of the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.540
 ground 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.160
 the experimental field of the valley of the fort with backing of foundation 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.420
 produces sinaloa 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.190
 maintains the improvement project 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.940
 the minimum cost technology 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.610
 for the production of grains 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.690
 applied mainly to corn 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.110
 wheat the chickpea 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.950
 the results observed in the sowing of these 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.420
 repeatedly has confirmed that sow on the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.220
 unless they are stubble

 the verification of the development of the plants under the criteria of tillage 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.150
 of conservation 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.840
 has shown that similar crop yields can be obtained 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.230
 conventional standards from the first cycle and henceforth 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.320
 these terms are achieved higher yields by the general improvement and 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.610
 solve the same studies specify that the incorporation of the esquilmos 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.860
 of the previous harvest and the subsequent decomposition of this matter 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.830
 incorporated into the crop lot 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.040
 allows to improve the physical-chemical characteristics before the floors 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.630
 which guarantees greater rigor of the land if greater permanence of its

 the engineer josé luis mendoza oaks the person in charge of the program of systems 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.500
 of production in the experimental field of Valle del Fuerte require the 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.500
 results 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.450
 of the product labeling performance 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.010
 ask for your performance with the average bond professional 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.919
 said this after personal insults 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.739
 it's a huge difference difference 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.989
 if he or cds 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.739
 The cost of production 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.429
 you do not explode badly 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:19.559
 he did not walk loose 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:21.339
 10 million pesos 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:23.509
 and with the conservation cameras 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.259
 it is not my intention 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.699
 there were only robberies 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:29.649
 the costs 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.759
 we talk about movement 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:33.599
 fcc to your worrying 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.619
 to improve productivity 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:38.539
 gilles deleuze is required 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.539
 strong 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:48.609
 since then the opposition 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.059
 the two last 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:51.809

 luciano monsoon 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:03.050
 the conservation tillage production system 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.869
 with minimum tillage is being applied in crops 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.879
 Victor corn wheat and hydrotherapy 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.609
 they have all proven their functionality 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.229
 please farmers 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:16.000
 it has been verified that the Greek rolled 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.969
 the destinations of the previous harvest 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:20.659
 they are not an obstacle to let the water run 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.829
 that when it is done is an appropriate wardrobe of destinies is achieved 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.519
 incorporate the virtually to the ground by the normal effects of 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:29.669
 degradation 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.829
 with the establishment of these research works foundation produces 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.169
 sinaloa has serious data that validates the production mechanisms 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:42.019
 as an alternative to the traditional cultivation of grains in our state 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.019
 comments the engineer Juan José Cardona Andrés González the operating manager 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.019
 of foundation produces sounding ortiz 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:54.749
 the country and also percent that many of us want is that people 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.799
 learn to be more efficient 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.169
 in your applications 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.309
 of crop technology 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:05.519
 by the way this with a field check 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:10.030
 the progress you are seeing right now is what 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.859
 we can have 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.519
 same or better performance levels 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.519
 with a song of a reduced farm 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.220
 from this we have a better environment in general about organic matter 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.960
 This allows us less soil contamination and allows us one to one to one 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.689
 cost effectiveness 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:29.919
 this 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.960
 p here 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.300
 those that are exposed in this project 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.849
 what are the advantages zones 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.240
 we do not need 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.809
 higher expenses 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:43.600
 of the issues give an efficient handling 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.600
 and changing and criteria 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.629
 we 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:55.539
 the use of conventional methods of producing the 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.199
 have caused the passage of years 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.629
 a deterioration in soil quality 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:02.529
 a poor being its structure 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:06.550
 consequently making the most dependent on agrochemicals 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.740
 which makes the 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.029
 the dynamics of the crop under the criteria of minimum tillage 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:14.979
 has shown equal and better performance 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.060
 in costs 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.180
 and better soil quality 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.470
 are well-applied forms of production favor our 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.230
 farmers
