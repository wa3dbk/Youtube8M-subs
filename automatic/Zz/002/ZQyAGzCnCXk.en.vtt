okay<00:02:10.430> which<00:02:11.430> combined<00:02:12.240> accounts<00:02:12.810> for

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
the runners every year okay so there's

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.790 
the runners every year okay so there's
more<00:02:17.700> than<00:02:17.880> just<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.150> curse<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:18.810> statistical

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
more than just a curse it's statistical

look at these major preps we're talking
about<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:26.130> know<00:02:26.550> there's<00:02:26.760> ways<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.510> again<00:02:27.840> TMI

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
about I know there's ways this again TMI

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.290 
about I know there's ways this again TMI
you<00:02:28.860> can't<00:02:29.069> even<00:02:29.160> see<00:02:29.459> all<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.790> stuff<00:02:29.970> right

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
you can't even see all this stuff right

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.360 
you can't even see all this stuff right
here<00:02:30.330> that's<00:02:31.020> why<00:02:31.170> my<00:02:31.290> posters<00:02:31.709> presentation

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
here that's why my posters presentation

here that's why my posters presentation
so<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.550> can<00:02:32.670> blow<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.970> up<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.180> look<00:02:33.390> at<00:02:33.450> you

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
so you can blow it up and look at you

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.949 
so you can blow it up and look at you
know<00:02:34.290> at<00:02:34.530> your<00:02:34.739> leisure<00:02:34.890> later<00:02:35.310> but<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.810> can

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
know at your leisure later but you can

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.530 
know at your leisure later but you can
see<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.440> wood<00:02:37.709> has<00:02:38.010> really<00:02:38.580> fallen<00:02:39.120> kind

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
see that the wood has really fallen kind

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.030 
see that the wood has really fallen kind
of<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.810> little<00:02:39.959> bit<00:02:40.080> out<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.319> relevance<00:02:40.770> last

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
of a little bit out of relevance last

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.800 
of a little bit out of relevance last
ten<00:02:41.280> years<00:02:41.310> but<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.000> think<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.420> might<00:02:42.570> change

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
ten years but I think that might change

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.810 
ten years but I think that might change
this<00:02:43.019> here<00:02:43.200> since<00:02:43.470> Normandy<00:02:43.830> invasion<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.459> top

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
this here since Normandy invasion is top

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.940 
this here since Normandy invasion is top

have some relevance and I added the

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.610 
have some relevance and I added the
Louisiana<00:02:53.489> Derby<00:02:53.730> for<00:02:54.450> recent<00:02:54.780> years<00:02:54.959> because

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
Louisiana Derby for recent years because

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.290 
Louisiana Derby for recent years because
it<00:02:56.040> seems<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.459> have<00:02:56.610> more<00:02:56.819> relevant

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
it seems to have more relevant

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.210 
it seems to have more relevant
especially<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:58.290> year<00:02:58.530> as<00:02:58.769> i'm<00:02:59.010> going<00:02:59.130> to

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220
