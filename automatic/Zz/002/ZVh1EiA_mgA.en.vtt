here<00:00:02.320> at<00:00:02.469> the<00:00:02.560> great<00:00:02.740> outdoor<00:00:03.149> show<00:00:04.149> you

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:04.180 
here at the great outdoor show you

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.150 
here at the great outdoor show you
another<00:00:04.810> technique<00:00:05.290> of<00:00:05.439> fire<00:00:05.620> starting<00:00:06.069> that

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.160 
another technique of fire starting that

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.580 
another technique of fire starting that
you<00:00:06.310> should<00:00:06.490> never<00:00:06.609> rely<00:00:06.910> on<00:00:07.139> the<00:00:08.139> technique

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
you should never rely on the technique

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.289 
you should never rely on the technique
of<00:00:08.770> the<00:00:08.860> fire<00:00:09.250> pole<00:00:09.580> rubbing<00:00:10.090> two<00:00:10.270> sticks

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:10.299 
of the fire pole rubbing two sticks

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.480 
of the fire pole rubbing two sticks
together<00:00:10.750> this<00:00:11.440> technique<00:00:12.010> goes<00:00:12.190> back

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
together this technique goes back

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.009 
together this technique goes back
thousands<00:00:13.029> of<00:00:13.150> years

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
thousands of years

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.199 
thousands of years
it's<00:00:14.499> called<00:00:14.769> also<00:00:15.160> called<00:00:15.400> creating<00:00:15.910> a<00:00:15.999> fire

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
it's called also called creating a fire

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.019 
it's called also called creating a fire
by<00:00:16.449> friction<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:17.770> will<00:00:18.189> teach<00:00:18.400> you<00:00:18.430> why<00:00:18.970> you

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
by friction this will teach you why you

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.150 
by friction this will teach you why you
should<00:00:19.390> be<00:00:19.480> prepared<00:00:19.960> hearing<00:00:20.529> a<00:00:20.619> blend<00:00:20.890> stick

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
should be prepared hearing a blend stick

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.460 
should be prepared hearing a blend stick
and<00:00:21.490> waterproof<00:00:22.300> mattress<00:00:22.570> because<00:00:22.990> this<00:00:23.289> is

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
and waterproof mattress because this is

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.260 
and waterproof mattress because this is
a<00:00:23.590> last<00:00:23.829> resort<00:00:24.009> so<00:00:24.849> there's<00:00:25.060> several

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
a last resort so there's several

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.659 
a last resort so there's several
components<00:00:25.840> to<00:00:26.230> the<00:00:26.349> fire<00:00:26.560> there's<00:00:27.430> the

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
components to the fire there's the

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.240 
components to the fire there's the
baseboard<00:00:28.239> with<00:00:29.140> a<00:00:29.169> small<00:00:29.470> hole<00:00:29.739> and<00:00:30.009> notch

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
baseboard with a small hole and notch

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.270 
baseboard with a small hole and notch
there's<00:00:31.180> a<00:00:31.270> spindle<00:00:31.869> and<00:00:32.349> by<00:00:32.649> the<00:00:32.710> way<00:00:32.950> i<00:00:32.980> make

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
there's a spindle and by the way i make

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.819 
there's a spindle and by the way i make
i<00:00:33.489> use<00:00:33.790> the<00:00:34.030> woods<00:00:34.270> that<00:00:34.570> are<00:00:34.989> very<00:00:35.200> soft<00:00:35.559> like

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
i use the woods that are very soft like

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.220 
i use the woods that are very soft like
bass<00:00:36.129> wood<00:00:36.489> and<00:00:36.820> cedar<00:00:37.649> pup<00:00:38.649> and<00:00:38.950> really<00:00:39.820> drunk

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
bass wood and cedar pup and really drunk

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.360 
bass wood and cedar pup and really drunk
then<00:00:41.230> there's<00:00:41.469> the<00:00:41.649> bow<00:00:41.829> to<00:00:41.860> spin<00:00:42.340> everything

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
then there's the bow to spin everything

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.930 
then there's the bow to spin everything
at<00:00:42.850> supersonic<00:00:43.329> speed<00:00:43.780> and<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:45.280> socket<00:00:45.760> rock

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
at supersonic speed and the socket rock

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.000 
at supersonic speed and the socket rock
to<00:00:46.329> hold<00:00:46.540> everything<00:00:46.810> together<00:00:47.020> although<00:00:47.950> you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
to hold everything together although you

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.400 
to hold everything together although you
could<00:00:48.370> use<00:00:48.610> a<00:00:48.910> piece<00:00:49.239> of<00:00:49.270> wood<00:00:49.600> for<00:00:49.840> the<00:00:49.870> socket

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
could use a piece of wood for the socket

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.520 
could use a piece of wood for the socket
or<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:50.650> bowl<00:00:51.720> okay<00:00:52.720> so<00:00:52.780> I'm<00:00:52.989> going<00:00:53.170> to<00:00:53.200> curb

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
or a bowl okay so I'm going to curb

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.350 
or a bowl okay so I'm going to curb
everything<00:00:54.010> so<00:00:54.220> it's<00:00:54.370> nice<00:00:54.550> and<00:00:54.579> rough<00:00:55.030> just

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
everything so it's nice and rough just

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.020 
everything so it's nice and rough just
to<00:00:55.450> create<00:00:55.660> friction<00:00:56.050> I<00:00:56.470> need<00:00:57.399> to<00:00:57.520> curb<00:00:57.790> this

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
to create friction I need to curb this

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.680 
to create friction I need to curb this
drill<00:00:58.420> or<00:00:59.050> this<00:00:59.260> spindle

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
drill or this spindle

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.170 
drill or this spindle
it's<00:01:01.020> rough<00:01:01.260> as<00:01:01.469> possible<00:01:02.129> even<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.640> nice<00:01:02.850> rough

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
it's rough as possible even a nice rough

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.060 
it's rough as possible even a nice rough
bitch<00:01:04.159> so<00:01:05.159> that's<00:01:05.400> what<00:01:05.610> I'm<00:01:05.670> doing<00:01:05.880> right<00:01:06.000> now

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
bitch so that's what I'm doing right now

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.560 
bitch so that's what I'm doing right now
course<00:01:08.070> if<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.790> soaked<00:01:09.090> everything<00:01:09.270> in

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
course if I soaked everything in

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.570 
course if I soaked everything in
gasoline<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.259> would<00:01:10.380> work<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.619> lot<00:01:10.650> faster<00:01:10.950> but

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
gasoline it would work a lot faster but

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.620 
gasoline it would work a lot faster but
I'm<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.180> I'm<00:01:12.420> going<00:01:12.509> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
I'm not going to do that I'm going to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.710 
I'm not going to do that I'm going to
try<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:13.229> real<00:01:13.290> here<00:01:13.880> here<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.000> go<00:01:15.180> get<00:01:15.630> it

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
try this for real here here we go get it

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.460 
try this for real here here we go get it
all<00:01:15.840> nice<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.290> rough<00:01:17.600> that's<00:01:18.600> great<00:01:19.020> of

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
all nice and rough that's great of

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.109 
all nice and rough that's great of
course<00:01:19.770> thousands<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.340> years<00:01:20.580> ago<00:01:20.670> they

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
course thousands of years ago they

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.420 
course thousands of years ago they
wouldn't<00:01:21.390> start<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.690> fire<00:01:21.899> each<00:01:22.110> day<00:01:22.409> what<00:01:23.310> they

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
wouldn't start a fire each day what they

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.010 
wouldn't start a fire each day what they
would<00:01:23.610> do<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.850> start<00:01:24.060> pairing<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:24.509> fire<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
would do is start pairing one fire and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.570 
would do is start pairing one fire and
keep<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> fire<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.560> every<00:01:26.070> day<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.369> bury

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
keep the fire going every day and bury

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.270 
keep the fire going every day and bury
the<00:01:26.820> coals<00:01:27.060> transporting<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.080> holes<00:01:28.320> always

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the coals transporting the holes always

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.529 
the coals transporting the holes always
something<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.670> myself<00:01:29.850> would<00:01:30.180> be<00:01:30.330> foolish

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
something like myself would be foolish

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.090 
something like myself would be foolish
enough<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.899> be<00:01:31.080> doing<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.440> everything<00:01:31.920> for

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
enough to be doing this everything for

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.850 
enough to be doing this everything for
fun<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:33.060> here<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:33.390> now<00:01:34.080> roughing<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:34.619> that

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
fun so here we go now roughing all that

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.490 
fun so here we go now roughing all that
up<00:01:35.300> so<00:01:36.300> I<00:01:36.330> want<00:01:36.539> to<00:01:36.570> make<00:01:36.630> sure<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.289> wool

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
up so I want to make sure that the wool

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.570 
up so I want to make sure that the wool
and<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.800> baseboard<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.460> nice<00:01:39.319> and<00:01:40.319> also<00:01:41.220> that

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
and the baseboard is nice and also that

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.450 
and the baseboard is nice and also that
we<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> v-shaped<00:01:42.720> notch<00:01:42.960> will<00:01:43.860> curb<00:01:44.130> right

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
we have a v-shaped notch will curb right

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.219 
we have a v-shaped notch will curb right
to<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.759> center<00:01:44.970> cuz<00:01:45.270> what's<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.720> happen

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
to the center cuz what's going to happen

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.350 
to the center cuz what's going to happen
is<00:01:46.740> when<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> start<00:01:47.369> spinning<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.090> create

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
is when I start spinning to create

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.330 
is when I start spinning to create
friction<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.960> hot<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.920> that's

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
friction the hot just that that's

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.609 
friction the hot just that that's
created<00:01:50.940> will<00:01:51.450> fall<00:01:51.690> through<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> notch<00:01:52.319> and

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
created will fall through the notch and

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.419 
created will fall through the notch and
create<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> hot<00:01:53.420> red<00:01:54.420> ember<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.619> that's<00:01:56.220> how

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
create a hot red ember and that's how

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.870 
create a hot red ember and that's how
i'll<00:01:56.610> start<00:01:56.880> my<00:01:56.909> fire

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
i'll start my fire

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.969 
i'll start my fire
there<00:01:59.240> we<00:01:59.420> go<00:01:59.570> heard<00:02:00.079> of<00:02:00.140> that<00:02:00.290> nice<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.799> neat

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
there we go heard of that nice and neat

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.260 
there we go heard of that nice and neat
make<00:02:01.700> sure<00:02:01.729> it<00:02:01.969> goes<00:02:02.119> right<00:02:02.360> in<00:02:02.570> there

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.969 

okay<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> think<00:02:06.450> we're<00:02:06.750> ready<00:02:06.780> now<00:02:07.170> I'm<00:02:07.770> going

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
okay I think we're ready now I'm going

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.229 
okay I think we're ready now I'm going
to<00:02:08.039> cheat<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> little<00:02:08.459> bit<00:02:08.610> with<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.910> little<00:02:08.940> bit

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
to cheat a little bit with a little bit

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.999 
to cheat a little bit with a little bit
of<00:02:09.330> steel<00:02:09.539> wool<00:02:09.780> otherwise<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.770> could

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
of steel wool otherwise this could

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.520 
of steel wool otherwise this could
sometimes<00:02:11.459> take<00:02:11.670> one<00:02:12.000> two<00:02:12.270> three<00:02:12.569> days<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.470> to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
sometimes take one two three days so to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.380 
sometimes take one two three days so to
get<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.099> work<00:02:14.130> within<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.700> few<00:02:14.880> seconds

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.559 
get this to work within a few seconds
I'm<00:02:15.870> going<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.230> keep<00:02:16.590> just<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:17.040> little<00:02:17.280> bit<00:02:17.569> okay

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
I'm going to keep just a little bit okay

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.670 
I'm going to keep just a little bit okay
here<00:02:18.780> we<00:02:18.810> go<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.019> think<00:02:19.319> we're<00:02:19.410> ready<00:02:19.440> for

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
here we go I think we're ready for

here we go I think we're ready for
action<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.480> take<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.750> spindle

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
action so I take the spindle

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.220 
action so I take the spindle
I<00:02:23.569> placed<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:24.349> bindle<00:02:24.680> onto<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.700> Bozeman<00:02:26.230> it

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
I placed this bindle onto the Bozeman it

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.820 
I placed this bindle onto the Bozeman it
has<00:02:27.409> to<00:02:27.560> be<00:02:27.590> really<00:02:27.860> tight

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
has to be really tight

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.050 
has to be really tight
here<00:02:30.280> we<00:02:30.400> go<00:02:30.520> okay<00:02:31.150> i<00:02:31.390> get<00:02:32.110> rid<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.380> night

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
here we go okay i get rid of the night

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.090 
here we go okay i get rid of the night
doesn't<00:02:34.060> end<00:02:34.330> up<00:02:34.540> stabbing

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
doesn't end up stabbing

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.700 
doesn't end up stabbing
and<00:02:36.550> I<00:02:36.640> placed<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.180> spindle<00:02:37.660> into<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
and I placed the spindle into the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.250 
and I placed the spindle into the
baseboard<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.180> take<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.540> socket<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.170> I

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
baseboard and I take the socket and I

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.720 
baseboard and I take the socket and I
hold<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.620> spindle<00:02:41.830> down<00:02:42.100> but<00:02:42.340> first<00:02:42.580> I'm

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
hold the spindle down but first I'm

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.390 
hold the spindle down but first I'm
going<00:02:42.820> to<00:02:42.880> take<00:02:43.090> some<00:02:43.240> ear<00:02:43.540> wax<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.830> lubricate

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
going to take some ear wax and lubricate

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.130 
going to take some ear wax and lubricate
that<00:02:45.640> spindle<00:02:46.150> soil<00:02:46.420> because<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:46.870> don't<00:02:47.080> want

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
that spindle soil because I don't want

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.110 
that spindle soil because I don't want
friction<00:02:47.500> here<00:02:48.010> i<00:02:48.040> want<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.460> friction<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:48.970> be

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
friction here i want the friction to be

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.240 
friction here i want the friction to be
contained<00:02:49.600> down<00:02:50.050> in

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
contained down in

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.090 
contained down in
all<00:02:51.700> right<00:02:51.910> put<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.420> all<00:02:52.480> together

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
all right put it all together

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.220 
all right put it all together
sometimes<00:02:54.850> this<00:02:55.090> takes<00:02:55.150> two<00:02:55.570> or<00:02:55.600> three<00:02:55.900> tries

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
sometimes this takes two or three tries

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.280 
sometimes this takes two or three tries
just<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.340> get<00:02:57.520> everything<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.940> spin<00:02:58.240> so<00:02:59.020> I<00:02:59.080> can

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
just to get everything to spin so I can

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.190 
just to get everything to spin so I can
use<00:02:59.500> that<00:02:59.530> or<00:03:00.070> i<00:03:00.100> can<00:03:00.220> use<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.760> one<00:03:01.200> okay

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
use that or i can use this one okay

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.960 
use that or i can use this one okay
let's<00:03:02.560> try<00:03:02.710> that

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
let's try that

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.820 
let's try that
here<00:03:04.510> we<00:03:04.600> go<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:05.170> I<00:03:05.230> got<00:03:05.350> to<00:03:05.470> move<00:03:05.560> everything

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
here we go and I got to move everything

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.550 
here we go and I got to move everything
out<00:03:05.980> of<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.190> way<00:03:06.310> here

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
out of the way here

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.000 
out of the way here
nothing<00:03:08.040> gets<00:03:08.220> in<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.459> way<00:03:09.200> all<00:03:10.200> right<00:03:10.319> here

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
nothing gets in the way all right here

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.340 
nothing gets in the way all right here
we<00:03:11.040> go

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:46.790 

he's<00:03:28.860> hope

I<00:03:46.890> gotta<00:03:47.520> be<00:03:47.670> careful<00:03:47.880> that<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.360> sweat<00:03:48.630> from

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
I gotta be careful that the sweat from

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:56.970 
I gotta be careful that the sweat from
my<00:03:48.870> forehead<00:03:49.470> doesn't<00:03:49.890> fall<00:03:50.070> in

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
this you won't need a fire cuz you'll be

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.190 
this you won't need a fire cuz you'll be
warmed<00:04:03.810> up<00:04:03.930> trying<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.379> now<00:04:05.870> gonna<00:04:06.870> blow<00:04:07.049> on

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
warmed up trying it now gonna blow on

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.240 
warmed up trying it now gonna blow on
that<00:04:07.230> Oh

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.740 

I<00:04:11.310> think<00:04:11.880> we<00:04:12.000> blew<00:04:12.210> it<00:04:12.240> out<00:04:14.210> all<00:04:15.210> right<00:04:15.390> attempt

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
I think we blew it out all right attempt

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.349 
I think we blew it out all right attempt
number<00:04:15.930> two<00:04:16.079> of<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.440> fireball<00:04:19.940> now<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:21.000> got<00:04:21.239> to

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
number two of the fireball now I got to

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.580 
number two of the fireball now I got to
make<00:04:21.450> sure<00:04:21.480> this<00:04:21.780> time<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.320> sweat<00:04:22.560> from

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
make sure this time that the sweat from

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.960 
make sure this time that the sweat from
my<00:04:22.770> forehead<00:04:23.340> doesn't<00:04:23.520> fall<00:04:23.820> in

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
my forehead doesn't fall in

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.330 
my forehead doesn't fall in
I<00:04:25.060> think<00:04:25.630> that's<00:04:25.780> what<00:04:25.960> put<00:04:26.110> it<00:04:26.230> up<00:04:26.320> last<00:04:26.560> all

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
I think that's what put it up last all
