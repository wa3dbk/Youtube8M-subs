00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.300
 Hi, my name is Virginia. 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.500
 I live in Natal with my mother Vanessa. 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.800
 and my brother Vitor. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.400
 My mother is very beautiful 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.000
 She cooks very well. 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.000
 Put on some pretty clothes. 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.800
 And takes good care of us. 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.000
 We live in a very nice apartment. 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.800
 But it was not always so... 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.200
 If you knew what my mother had been through 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.000
 So we can get here. 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.700
 I always lived with my mother. 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.000
 She lived in the front 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.300
 and I lived behind. 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.500
 When I went on a contest 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.800
 I went to live inside 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.800
 a little far from here. 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.200
 And in that interior 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.900
 I had to leave my daughter with my mother. 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.700
 And there he would not pick up the phone 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.000
 I did not get the internet there 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.500
 there was nothing. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.700
 And she fell ill 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.000
 one day she got sick 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.800
 And I could not talk to my mother. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.300
 I had to sleep 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.500
 not knowing if the fever had passed. 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.800
 That's when I decided that I did not want to stay there anymore 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.800
 that's when I came away. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.100
 My mother's house is a place where the whole family gathers. 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.600
 So this weekend 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.000
 Saturday and Sunday 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.500
 It is always crowded with people. 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.760
 And you do not have quiet. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.720
 And that's when I decided to leave 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.880
 this was the beginning of the year 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.380
 I said: 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 When it's October 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.380
 I'm going to buy a bikini. 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.800
 and I'm going to sell a bikini. 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.940
 In one week I sold everything. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.040
 Then I cheered up. 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.140
 That's when I decided to buy the apartment, I said, 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.280
 I'm going to open my company's CNPJ. 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280
 So I went 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.680
 I looked for a broker 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.400
 And the broker kind of did not believe it. 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.860
 He was looking at me ... 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.120
 And he kind of did not believe that ... 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.920
 "Oh, she can not buy an apartment." 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.040
 And then I found the broker who sold me this apartment. 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.760
 Then I got it, 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.740
 in December I signed my contract. 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.040
 I have a room today 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.280
 I have a corner 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.800
 to be alone 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.940
 To play with my friends ... 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.260
 I love my house very much. 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.820
 If it were not for my mother 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.600
 we would not live in such a cool place. 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.060
 When he gave me the key, I said, 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.320
 "I'm not believing that." 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.960
 I almost went crazy 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.280
 I almost did not even go away. 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.300
 I had nothing inside 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.520
 but I almost stayed right here. 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.260
 Here is my peace of mind. 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.420
 it is my peace. 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.040
 I what peace, I run home. 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.900
 I arrive, I come whenever I want. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.840
 I lie down and watch my television. 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.140
 rest. 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.780
 "Minha, you're beautiful. 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.880
 Thanks for the room, which I love. 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.500
 I love you." 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.660
 Love you too. 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.020
 That's what I say, she has her corner, right. 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.380
 That's what I wanted, yes. 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.540
 That she had her singing. 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.520
 It was a stage of my life that I ... 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.960
 I think I conclude 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.300
 Now we're going to the others. 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.060
 The purchase of the property 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.040
 We know it's not easy. 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.640
 because it has several bureaucracies. 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.860
 It is a real estate, I think it is the dream of any human being. 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.620
 Every dream that is high 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.620
 it is difficult for you to achieve. 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.440
 That at first my concern was more this 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.580
 It was theirs to have their singing. 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.420
 Not now 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.440
 now is to fight and to create. 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.400
 Huh? 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.400
 Create for the future.
