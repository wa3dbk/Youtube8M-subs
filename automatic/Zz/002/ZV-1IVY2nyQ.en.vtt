 played 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.140
 he see with what 2010 presents their election program brand of save the 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.119
 Bonner personally all works now new food 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.349
 In the mowing they provide a whole range of products Konstantin the Coach in 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.880
 decide such a use 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.120
 in a dating and of course assured Lippert will be there on ca 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.250
 So strangle Classic does not have to say much is relatively well known 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.329
 Divers each 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.969
 It should be in Germany for two pieces of it so you can also fast 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.149
 been recorded and you should absolutely try and 4 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.370
 a yes in that respect 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.450
 Again, assuming capture more very neutral sera 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.180
 the all over microphone high resolution to the microphone then to EM is that of 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.770
 Terror that drives 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.770
 to know but gossip is a bit softer 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.770
 and percent to 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.770
 certain silky softness such new next to it 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.070
 and for that too it does not tell much much the format 1 of the 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.660
 Classic with which everything started 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.150
 but the year is like our big ears microphone from us 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.460
 Women with whom I spoke but no such really characteristics 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.210
 Lost like controlling the microphones 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.660
 Adeya of the men middle of ours 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.799
 currently the flagship was formal so this is a microphone where in principle was 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.740
 the format 1 completely preserved but as now already open possibility 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.110
 20 times way 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.750
 where you can then again for something wrong and bankrupts can achieve 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.870
 the very suspicious 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.610
 in Trier there is a lot of flexibility 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.610
 Reason for these two percent of the votes can be said Gerber 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.060
 and buy oil next to it Texas is a profound one the moment 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.290
 Hit it too 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.810
 TSO current song into the microphone of Thomas D as well as St b 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.619
 now percent right also separated so for programs voice recordings 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.440
 Benefit yourself from because the voice is very present forward you arrive 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.099
 So really place to be at the forefront of mixed and 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.949
 yes we all want to model the crown very nice high resolution elsewhere 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:25.399
 wet copywriter program Jesus becomes classic Bell 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:29.329
 that in contrast to the world hit now that is only a kidney Ursula 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.239
 Copywriters parried and the Velbert you have the possibility of sports 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.589
 US sitcom to switch between bullet and Mira and use kids tap them 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:41.289
 Heidinger so the Suhler Ventyx is so a bit more driven forward 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:42.499
 to have 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:45.839
 for Caterpillar Inc and here you can also get the microphones live in 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:48.589
 professional recording room under good conditions 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:53.779

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:57.510
 the comic-con people and there is also a special yes what so earlier 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:59.929
 then again 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:03.839
 yes now percent to every vote counts fish farm or something like that 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:06.689
 namely that fifth grade allowed to become quiet 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.689
 it builds or refines with the regulation for 7 99 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:14.559
