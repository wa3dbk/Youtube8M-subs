to open the windows which isn't really

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.920 
to open the windows which isn't really
ideal<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.490> we<00:00:24.180> just<00:00:24.359> wonder<00:00:24.510> what<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.750> could

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
ideal and we just wonder what you could

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.750 
ideal and we just wonder what you could

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
boiler is a good boiler condensing

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.860 
boiler is a good boiler condensing
boiler<00:00:41.160> should<00:00:41.610> save<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:41.969> money<00:00:42.030> however

unfortunately you haven't got a room
step<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.719> anywhere<00:00:46.200> which<00:00:47.039> means<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
step in it anywhere which means that the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.729 
step in it anywhere which means that the
border<00:00:48.149> runs<00:00:48.329> less<00:00:48.690> efficiently<00:00:49.230> than<00:00:49.620> it

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
border runs less efficiently than it

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.479 
border runs less efficiently than it
should<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.329> but<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> solution<00:00:52.489> well

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
should do but we have a solution well

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.040 
should do but we have a solution well
I've<00:00:53.550> got<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.120> today<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.690> the

I've got here for you today is the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.450 
I've got here for you today is the
Honeywell<00:00:55.530> sundial<00:00:56.190> RF<00:00:57.120> squared<00:00:57.480> back<00:00:57.989> to

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
Honeywell sundial RF squared back to

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.310 
Honeywell sundial RF squared back to
okay<00:00:59.460> what's<00:00:59.699> that<00:01:00.079> basically<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
okay what's that basically it's a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.799 
okay what's that basically it's a
wireless<00:01:01.710> enabled<00:01:01.980> programmer<00:01:02.640> which<00:01:03.480> allows

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
wireless enabled programmer which allows

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.170 
wireless enabled programmer which allows
us<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.260> put<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> room<00:01:04.680> stat<00:01:04.949> which<00:01:05.610> means<00:01:05.880> that

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
us to put a room stat which means that

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.520 
us to put a room stat which means that
we<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.420> control<00:01:06.840> your<00:01:06.990> border<00:01:07.320> more

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
we can control your border more

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.289 
we can control your border more
efficiently<00:01:07.979> okay<00:01:08.490> I'm<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.850> bit<00:01:08.970> worried

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
efficiently okay I'm just a bit worried

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.969 
efficiently okay I'm just a bit worried
because<00:01:09.479> we've<00:01:10.080> not<00:01:10.229> been<00:01:10.350> living<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:10.740> very

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
because we've not been living here very

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.250 
because we've not been living here very
long<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.330> new<00:01:12.450> carpets<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.020> down

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
long we just have new carpets but down

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.080 
long we just have new carpets but down
and<00:01:13.530> decorated<00:01:14.159> well<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.670> don't<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:14.939> to

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
and decorated well you don't have to

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.929 
and decorated well you don't have to
disrupt<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.540> walls<00:01:15.750> or<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.020> floors<00:01:16.080> all<00:01:16.939> we

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
disrupt the walls or the floors all we

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.870 
disrupt the walls or the floors all we
have<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.330> do<00:01:18.479> no<00:01:18.659> wiring<00:01:18.979> all<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.610> change

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
have to do no wiring all we do is change

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.030 
have to do no wiring all we do is change
the<00:01:21.000> program<00:01:21.390> unlike<00:01:21.689> for<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:22.740> place

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the program unlike for like and we place

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.120 
the program unlike for like and we place
the<00:01:23.189> room<00:01:23.369> stat<00:01:23.700> wherever<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.540> wish<00:01:25.130> it's

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the room stat wherever you so wish it's

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.429 
the room stat wherever you so wish it's
basically<00:01:26.460> wireless<00:01:26.970> enabled<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.290> like

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
basically wireless enabled and just like

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.109 
basically wireless enabled and just like
your<00:01:28.560> mobile<00:01:28.710> phone<00:01:29.189> where<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.640> see<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> signal

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
your mobile phone where you see a signal

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.060 
your mobile phone where you see a signal
strength<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:31.110> tells<00:01:31.380> us<00:01:31.560> where<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> best

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
strength it tells us where the best

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.010 
strength it tells us where the best
signal<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.610> which<00:01:32.909> means<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
signal is which means we can have the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.200 
signal is which means we can have the
room<00:01:34.560> start<00:01:34.890> either<00:01:35.369> sitting<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> shelf

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
room start either sitting on the shelf

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.390 
room start either sitting on the shelf
because<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.780> got<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:36.990> time<00:01:37.200> stand<00:01:37.530> or<00:01:38.100> we

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
because it's got this time stand or we

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.100 
because it's got this time stand or we
can<00:01:38.549> drill<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.970> wall<00:01:39.150> basically<00:01:39.869> you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
can drill it to the wall basically you

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.859 
can drill it to the wall basically you
could<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.350> anywhere<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:42.060> room<00:01:42.240> set<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.600> here

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
could have anywhere the room set in here

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.030 
could have anywhere the room set in here
is<00:01:43.049> more<00:01:43.409> efficient

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
is more efficient
