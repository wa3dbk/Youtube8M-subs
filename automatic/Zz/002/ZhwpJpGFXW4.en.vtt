00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
so the condition that have been a lot

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.410

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
too happy about that

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.770 
too happy about that
the<00:05:30.760> figure<00:05:31.090> versus<00:05:31.390> the<00:05:31.450> cartoon

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
the figure versus the cartoon

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.370
