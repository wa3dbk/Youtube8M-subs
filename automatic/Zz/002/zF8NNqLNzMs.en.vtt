profoundly relax that's the big the
first<00:00:07.970> upfront<00:00:08.970> kind<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.540> experience<00:00:10.019> that

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
first upfront kind of experience that

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.140 
first upfront kind of experience that
craniosacral<00:00:10.710> therapy<00:00:11.160> offers<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.700> this

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
craniosacral therapy offers is this

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.030 
craniosacral therapy offers is this
profound<00:00:12.599> deep<00:00:13.349> psychophysiological

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
profound deep psychophysiological

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.279 
profound deep psychophysiological
relaxation<00:00:14.969> which<00:00:15.089> often<00:00:15.630> times<00:00:15.660> more<00:00:16.139> often

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
relaxation which often times more often

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.890 
relaxation which often times more often
than<00:00:16.500> not<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.550> new<00:00:18.300> experience<00:00:18.449> for

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
than not is a new experience for

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.179 
than not is a new experience for
somebody<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.590> know<00:00:19.680> we<00:00:19.770> tend<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:19.980> think<00:00:20.039> of

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
somebody you know we tend to think of

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.040 
somebody you know we tend to think of
relaxation<00:00:20.939> as<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.510> know<00:00:21.600> come<00:00:21.750> home<00:00:21.930> and

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
relaxation as you know come home and

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.720 
relaxation as you know come home and
turn<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.289> TV<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.560> or<00:00:22.680> something<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.550> you

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
turn the TV on or something and that you

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.609 
turn the TV on or something and that you
know<00:00:23.820> we're<00:00:24.090> not<00:00:24.240> actually<00:00:24.420> relaxing<00:00:25.109> so

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
know we're not actually relaxing so

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.750 
know we're not actually relaxing so
there's<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.859> difference<00:00:26.250> here<00:00:26.430> between<00:00:26.460> a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
there's a difference here between a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.179 
there's a difference here between a
mental<00:00:27.420> relaxation<00:00:27.869> versus<00:00:28.830> run<00:00:28.949> all<00:00:29.160> over

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
mental relaxation versus run all over

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.700 
mental relaxation versus run all over
complete<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.359> physical<00:00:30.929> that's<00:00:31.260> right<00:00:31.500> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
complete and physical that's right you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.190 
complete and physical that's right you
can<00:00:31.859> measure<00:00:32.390> relaxation<00:00:33.390> using<00:00:33.960> EEG

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
can measure relaxation using EEG

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.830 
can measure relaxation using EEG
electroencephalography<00:00:35.160> or<00:00:35.880> measuring

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
electroencephalography or measuring

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.350 
electroencephalography or measuring
heart<00:00:37.079> rate<00:00:37.290> or<00:00:37.559> cortisol<00:00:38.040> levels<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.670> they

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
heart rate or cortisol levels and they

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.080 
heart rate or cortisol levels and they
they<00:00:39.930> go<00:00:40.110> down<00:00:40.290> significantly<00:00:41.090> with

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
they go down significantly with

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.030 
they go down significantly with
something<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:42.870> craniosacral<00:00:43.290> therapy<00:00:43.800> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
something like craniosacral therapy and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.069 
something like craniosacral therapy and
it's<00:00:44.489> often<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.090> more<00:00:45.270> often<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.899> said

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
it's often to more often as I said

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.500 
it's often to more often as I said
they're<00:00:46.230> not<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.460> unique<00:00:47.730> experience<00:00:48.149> and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
they're not it's a unique experience and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.720 
they're not it's a unique experience and
an<00:00:48.930> unprecedented<00:00:49.559> experience<00:00:50.160> because<00:00:50.370> we

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
an unprecedented experience because we

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.090 
an unprecedented experience because we
don't<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.710> opportunities<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.829> our<00:00:52.890> culture

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
don't have opportunities in our culture

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.709 
don't have opportunities in our culture
for<00:00:53.430> deep<00:00:53.760> deep<00:00:54.120> psychophysiological

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
for deep deep psychophysiological

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.720 
for deep deep psychophysiological
relaxation<00:00:55.469> because<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.039> because<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.430> on

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
relaxation because it's because it's on

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.810 
relaxation because it's because it's on
so<00:00:57.000> many<00:00:57.180> levels<00:00:57.329> right<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:59.550> such<00:00:59.699> an

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
so many levels right and it's such an

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.479 
so many levels right and it's such an
inner<00:01:00.030> experience<00:01:00.930> exactly<00:01:01.140> yeah<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:02.309> not

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
inner experience exactly yeah it's not

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.189 
inner experience exactly yeah it's not
because<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.940> substance<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.570> drug<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> sleeping

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
because of a substance a drug a sleeping

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.410 
because of a substance a drug a sleeping
pill<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.439> beer<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.339> whatever<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.090> it's

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
pill a beer or whatever is it's it's

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.859 
pill a beer or whatever is it's it's
it's<00:01:06.990> really<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.830> oneself<00:01:08.460> right<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.750> so

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
it's really in oneself right and if so

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.030 
it's really in oneself right and if so
if<00:01:10.020> somebody<00:01:10.320> has<00:01:10.530> done<00:01:10.770> yoga<00:01:11.430> or<00:01:12.000> other<00:01:13.040> very

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
if somebody has done yoga or other very

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.249 
if somebody has done yoga or other very
gentle<00:01:14.640> forms<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.180> bodywork<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.900> involve

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
gentle forms of bodywork that involve

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.570 
gentle forms of bodywork that involve
breath<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:18.750> attention<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
breath and and attention and the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.550 
breath and and attention and the
training<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.030> attention<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.259> similar

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
training of attention it's a similar

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.660 
training of attention it's a similar
kind<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.799> experience<00:01:23.159> um<00:01:23.220> buddy<00:01:23.340> once<00:01:23.490> said

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
kind of experience um buddy once said

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.429 
kind of experience um buddy once said
having<00:01:24.150> craniosacral<00:01:24.570> sessions<00:01:25.020> like<00:01:25.200> having

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
having craniosacral sessions like having

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.679 
having craniosacral sessions like having
ten<00:01:25.650> yoga<00:01:26.369> sessions<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.390> know<00:01:27.509> it's

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
ten yoga sessions in one you know it's

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.289 
ten yoga sessions in one you know it's
really<00:01:27.960> deep<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:29.220> that's<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> birth<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.119> can

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
really deep so that's the birth I can

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.760 
really deep so that's the birth I can
relate<00:01:30.390> yeah<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.530> was<00:01:31.680> your

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
relate yeah you you that was your

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.710 
relate yeah you you that was your
experience<00:01:31.950> with<00:01:32.250> me<00:01:32.729> yeah<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.689> know

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
experience with me yeah and you know

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.539 
experience with me yeah and you know
it's<00:01:33.960> amazing<00:01:34.229> because<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.710> more<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.040> give

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
it's amazing because the more we give

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.679 
it's amazing because the more we give
ourselves<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.090> opportunities<00:01:36.659> to

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
ourselves the opportunities to

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.749 
ourselves the opportunities to
experience<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.040> more<00:01:38.220> likely<00:01:38.520> we<00:01:38.549> can

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
experience that the more likely we can

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.340 
experience that the more likely we can
go<00:01:38.850> back<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.360> exactly<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.290> like

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
go back to it exactly it's like

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.429 
go back to it exactly it's like
retraining<00:01:41.009> or<00:01:41.130> exactly<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:43.049> is

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
retraining or exactly and that that is

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.319 
retraining or exactly and that that is
something<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.280> ideally<00:01:44.700> happens<00:01:45.180> in

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
something that ideally happens in

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.670 
something that ideally happens in
infancy<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.200> know<00:01:46.290> between<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
infancy you know between the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.770 
infancy you know between the
mother-child<00:01:47.549> bond<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.360> there's<00:01:48.570> this

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
mother-child bond is that there's this

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.800 
mother-child bond is that there's this
the<00:01:49.740> mother<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.100> able<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.610> convey<00:01:51.030> through<00:01:51.689> her

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
the mother is able to convey through her

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.740 
the mother is able to convey through her
own<00:01:52.729> changing<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.909> consciousness<00:01:54.390> at<00:01:54.540> will

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
own changing of a consciousness at will

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.020 
own changing of a consciousness at will
to<00:01:55.049> relax<00:01:55.740> herself<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.460> be<00:01:56.579> able<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.820> go<00:01:56.909> into

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
to relax herself to be able to go into

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.539 
to relax herself to be able to go into
that<00:01:57.180> deep<00:01:57.360> state<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.780> relaxation<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
that deep state of relaxation that the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.340 
that deep state of relaxation that the
child<00:01:59.880> kind<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.390> subconsciously<00:02:01.079> learns

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
child kind of subconsciously learns

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.770 
child kind of subconsciously learns
through<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.189> somatic<00:02:02.850> experience<00:02:03.299> that's<00:02:03.600> how

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
through a somatic experience that's how

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.990 
through a somatic experience that's how
you<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.170> yeah<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.490> nature<00:02:05.729> this

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
you do it yeah this is the nature this

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.550 
you do it yeah this is the nature this
is<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.509> what<00:02:06.630> all<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.110> theorists

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
is what this is what all the theorists

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.380 
is what this is what all the theorists
of<00:02:07.680> attachment<00:02:08.250> parenting<00:02:08.369> talk<00:02:08.849> about<00:02:09.179> is

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
of attachment parenting talk about is

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.180 
of attachment parenting talk about is
that<00:02:09.869> it's<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.289> mothers<00:02:10.590> capacity<00:02:11.400> to

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
that it's the mothers capacity to

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.800 
that it's the mothers capacity to
to<00:02:12.250> be<00:02:12.580> able<00:02:12.820> to<00:02:12.910> induce<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.240> in<00:02:13.540> herself

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
to be able to induce that in herself

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.170 
to be able to induce that in herself
that<00:02:14.080> then<00:02:14.260> induces<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:14.950> as<00:02:15.100> resonance<00:02:15.520> in<00:02:15.820> the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
that then induces it as resonance in the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.030 
that then induces it as resonance in the
baby<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:16.960> it's<00:02:17.080> more<00:02:17.260> than<00:02:17.410> role<00:02:17.620> modeling

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
baby so it's more than role modeling

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.380 
baby so it's more than role modeling
it's<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.280> felt<00:02:18.520> thing<00:02:18.790> oh<00:02:18.940> yeah<00:02:19.180> it's

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
it's a felt thing oh yeah it's

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.390 
it's a felt thing oh yeah it's
completely<00:02:20.020> somatic<00:02:20.530> it's<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:21.040> it's<00:02:21.340> a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
completely somatic it's a it's a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.890 
completely somatic it's a it's a
completely<00:02:21.670> cement<00:02:22.030> it's<00:02:22.330> an<00:02:22.420> experiential

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
completely cement it's an experiential

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.140 
completely cement it's an experiential
thing<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.290> can't<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.920> can't<00:02:24.160> just<00:02:24.430> pretend

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
thing you can't you can't just pretend

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.440 
thing you can't you can't just pretend
to<00:02:25.630> do<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:27.310> as<00:02:27.490> a<00:02:27.520> mother<00:02:27.700> also<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.210> know<00:02:28.390> you

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
to do you as a mother also you know you

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.780 
to do you as a mother also you know you
can't<00:02:28.780> do<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.200> can't<00:02:29.230> fake<00:02:29.640> no<00:02:30.640> you

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
can't do that you can't fake no you

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.840 
can't do that you can't fake no you
can't<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.300> cannot<00:02:31.830> help<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:33.010> child<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.490> relax

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
can't you cannot help a child to relax

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.610 
can't you cannot help a child to relax
if<00:02:34.210> you're<00:02:34.570> not<00:02:34.690> doing<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.080> yourself<00:02:35.170> which<00:02:35.590> is

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
if you're not doing it yourself which is

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.450 
if you're not doing it yourself which is
why<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:37.000> I<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:38.020> know<00:02:38.050> maybe<00:02:38.320> now<00:02:38.500> I<00:02:38.530> can<00:02:38.650> just

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
why and I you know maybe now I can just

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:46.920 
why and I you know maybe now I can just
talk<00:02:39.640> about<00:02:39.880> yeah<00:02:40.270> sure<00:02:40.540> that<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:43.440> baby<00:02:45.930> coming

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
talk about yeah sure that a baby coming

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.320

about<00:02:54.420> two<00:02:55.420> years<00:02:55.630> old<00:02:55.990> I<00:02:56.280> routinely<00:02:57.280> will<00:02:57.610> ask

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
about two years old I routinely will ask

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.970 
about two years old I routinely will ask
that<00:02:58.150> it's<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:58.810> work<00:02:59.080> with<00:02:59.170> mother<00:02:59.440> first<00:02:59.740> and

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
that it's I work with mother first and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.860 
that it's I work with mother first and
for<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.010> whole<00:03:03.220> variety<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.610> reasons<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.180> the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
for a whole variety of reasons and the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.260 
for a whole variety of reasons and the
most<00:03:05.020> important<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.500> which<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:06.270> it

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
most important of which is that it

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.640 
most important of which is that it
really<00:03:07.690> is<00:03:07.960> the<00:03:08.350> mothers<00:03:09.660> experience<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.930> her

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
really is the mothers experience and her

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.440 
really is the mothers experience and her
capacity<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.670> go<00:03:12.790> into<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.060> deep<00:03:13.210> state<00:03:13.330> of

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
capacity to go into a deep state of

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.940 
capacity to go into a deep state of
relaxation<00:03:13.600> that<00:03:14.170> will<00:03:14.320> induce<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.860> the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
relaxation that will induce that in the

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.740 
relaxation that will induce that in the
child<00:03:15.190> all<00:03:15.970> right<00:03:16.120> so<00:03:16.270> there's<00:03:16.390> no<00:03:16.510> sense

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
child all right so there's no sense

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.270 
child all right so there's no sense
getting<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.050> child<00:03:17.320> there<00:03:17.590> only<00:03:17.800> to<00:03:18.010> give<00:03:18.160> the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
getting the child there only to give the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.770 
getting the child there only to give the
child<00:03:18.430> back<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.940> baby<00:03:19.060> back<00:03:19.330> to<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.570> mother

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
child back the baby back to the mother

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.840 
child back the baby back to the mother
who's<00:03:20.110> all<00:03:20.230> well<00:03:20.380> that<00:03:20.770> stays<00:03:21.070> because<00:03:21.640> it

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
who's all well that stays because it

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.130 
who's all well that stays because it
will<00:03:21.970> throw<00:03:22.180> them<00:03:22.330> right<00:03:22.360> out<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.660> exact

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
will throw them right out of exact

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.880 
will throw them right out of exact
pounds<00:03:23.530> okay<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:24.520> yeah<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:26.020> and<00:03:26.290> routinely

pounds okay so yeah and so and routinely

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.220 
pounds okay so yeah and so and routinely
when<00:03:27.130> I<00:03:27.160> work<00:03:27.370> with<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.790> baby<00:03:28.480> who's<00:03:28.750> colicky

find<00:05:23.260> myself<00:05:23.380> in<00:05:23.680> this<00:05:23.800> role<00:05:24.040> of<00:05:24.280> kind<00:05:24.460> of

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
find myself in this role of kind of

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.510 
find myself in this role of kind of
mediating<00:05:25.120> between<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.290> infant<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:26.980> the

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
mediating between the the infant and the

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.170 
mediating between the the infant and the
mother<00:05:27.780> because<00:05:28.780> a<00:05:29.110> mother<00:05:29.650> typically<00:05:30.400> has<00:05:30.760> a

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
mother because a mother typically has a

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.390 
mother because a mother typically has a
birth<00:05:31.540> plan<00:05:31.570> and<00:05:32.290> intention<00:05:32.860> around<00:05:33.070> birth

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
and idealizing it saying it's going to

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.050 
and idealizing it saying it's going to
look<00:05:36.100> like<00:05:36.130> this<00:05:36.430> is<00:05:36.610> going<00:05:36.700> to<00:05:36.790> feel<00:05:36.940> like
