stuff<00:01:00.450> I<00:01:00.630> mean<00:01:00.980> that's<00:01:01.980> how<00:01:02.100> my<00:01:02.250> uses<00:01:02.580> for<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:02.970> I

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
stuff I mean that's how my uses for so I

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.950 
stuff I mean that's how my uses for so I
get<00:01:03.180> another<00:01:03.210> motor<00:01:05.300> after<00:01:06.300> repairing<00:01:06.690> this

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
get another motor after repairing this

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.300 
get another motor after repairing this
one<00:01:07.940> still<00:01:08.940> raining<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:10.100> but<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.220> get

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
one still raining on that but you get

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.490 
one still raining on that but you get
the<00:01:11.490> idea

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.120 

think<00:01:16.500> about<00:01:16.680> plastic<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.580> meth<00:01:17.940> but

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
think about plastic you have meth but

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.860 
think about plastic you have meth but
you<00:01:20.130> don't<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.400> oil<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.820> everything<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.810> I

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
you don't have oil and everything so I

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.050 
you don't have oil and everything so I
could<00:01:22.110> angle<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.040> date<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.550> want<00:01:23.760> to<00:01:23.850> take

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
could angle that date if I want to take

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.170 
could angle that date if I want to take
a<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.420> wider<00:01:24.600> cut<00:01:25.760> so<00:01:26.760> I<00:01:27.060> may<00:01:27.510> angle<00:01:28.110> it

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
a little wider cut so I may angle it

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.330 
a little wider cut so I may angle it
what<00:01:30.180> y'all<00:01:30.390> do<00:01:30.600> I'll<00:01:30.900> put<00:01:31.770> more<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.979> an<00:01:32.100> angle

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
what y'all do I'll put more of an angle

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.960 
what y'all do I'll put more of an angle
so<00:01:32.580> it<00:01:32.820> take<00:01:33.000> through<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> wider<00:01:33.540> cut<00:01:34.970> then

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
so it take through a wider cut then

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.150 
so it take through a wider cut then
we'll<00:01:36.150> be<00:01:36.270> back<00:01:37.610> okay<00:01:39.590> hard<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.740> get<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.010> here

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
we'll be back okay hard to get in here

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.060 
we'll be back okay hard to get in here
close<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.760> up<00:01:42.290> because<00:01:43.290> I'm<00:01:43.560> hitting<00:01:43.770> my

close this up because I'm hitting my

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.340 
close this up because I'm hitting my

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.280 
desk with the tripod i flick something
special<00:01:46.800> I<00:01:47.000> did<00:01:48.000> angular<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.840> gets<00:01:49.050> more

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
special I did angular so it gets more

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.830 
special I did angular so it gets more
the<00:01:49.500> flat<00:01:49.800> not<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.250> point<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> bed<00:01:50.940> you

still<00:02:12.520> tired<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:13.030> motor<00:02:13.240> going<00:02:13.600> up<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:13.900> down

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
still tired the motor going up and down

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.490 
still tired the motor going up and down
saying<00:02:14.470> this<00:02:15.190> is<00:02:15.430> cheap<00:02:15.700> motor

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.290 

you<00:02:19.980> know<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.130> know<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.340> could<00:02:20.610> slow<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.880> down<00:02:20.940> the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
you know I know I could slow it down the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.510 
you know I know I could slow it down the
plastic<00:02:21.570> I'm<00:02:21.990> not<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.410> do<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.560> direct<00:02:22.980> I

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
plastic I'm not going to do it direct I

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.110 
plastic I'm not going to do it direct I
already<00:02:23.850> done<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.330> trapeze

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.210 

don't<00:02:29.630> ask<00:02:29.810> how<00:02:30.170> many<00:02:30.230> thousands<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.130> is<00:02:33.220> but

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
don't ask how many thousands that is but

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:55.500 
don't ask how many thousands that is but
we<00:02:34.700> will<00:02:34.910> go<00:02:35.120> back<00:02:35.360> across<00:02:35.569> and<00:02:36.140> move<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.410> in

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.390 

I<00:02:55.599> really<00:02:56.230> don't<00:02:56.409> like<00:02:56.560> cutting<00:02:57.099> out<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.310> the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
I really don't like cutting out of the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.130 
I really don't like cutting out of the
way<00:02:57.519> because<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:58.150> dead<00:02:58.360> tangle<00:02:58.870> man<00:02:59.080> I<00:03:01.140> know

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
way because the dead tangle man I know

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.770 
way because the dead tangle man I know
it's<00:03:02.439> plastic<00:03:03.069> but

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.980 

I<00:03:06.680> really<00:03:07.130> hate<00:03:07.250> coming<00:03:07.640> back<00:03:07.820> across<00:03:08.270> with<00:03:08.870> an

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
I really hate coming back across with an

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.390 
I really hate coming back across with an
angle<00:03:09.380> then<00:03:09.530> like<00:03:09.710> that<00:03:10.240> stop<00:03:11.240> that<00:03:11.570> way<00:03:12.400> they

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
angle then like that stop that way they

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.730 
angle then like that stop that way they
can't<00:03:14.240> see<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.600> but<00:03:14.750> it's<00:03:14.900> really<00:03:15.110> gouging

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
can't see it but it's really gouging

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.330 
can't see it but it's really gouging
into<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.160> it's<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.880> bit<00:03:17.090> going<00:03:17.420> in<00:03:17.800> too<00:03:18.800> pointed

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
into it it's a bit going in too pointed

okay<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:43.870> thought<00:05:44.200> so<00:05:44.530> what<00:05:44.680> this<00:05:44.830> is<00:05:45.160> just<00:05:45.610> a

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
okay I thought so what this is just a

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.300 
okay I thought so what this is just a
bit<00:05:45.940> holder<00:05:46.380> but<00:05:47.380> it's<00:05:47.530> stuck<00:05:47.710> in<00:05:47.860> a<00:05:47.950> piece<00:05:48.130> of

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
bit holder but it's stuck in a piece of

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.879 
bit holder but it's stuck in a piece of
screwdriver<00:05:48.730> handle<00:05:49.180> I<00:05:49.620> did<00:05:50.620> take<00:05:50.889> a<00:05:51.600> wider

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
screwdriver handle I did take a wider

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.430 
screwdriver handle I did take a wider
fit<00:05:53.889> but<00:05:54.880> that<00:05:54.910> dulled<00:05:55.419> the<00:05:55.720> plastic<00:05:56.200> even

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
fit but that dulled the plastic even

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.159 
fit but that dulled the plastic even
though<00:05:56.560> it<00:05:56.650> takes<00:05:57.070> a<00:05:57.190> lot<00:05:57.400> off<00:05:57.600> this<00:05:58.600> one<00:05:58.840> is<00:05:58.990> so
