time and I don't even need any reagents
for<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.270> was<00:02:39.360> my<00:02:39.510> special<00:02:39.900> clip<00:02:40.230> that's<00:02:41.190> not

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
for it was my special clip that's not

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.490 
for it was my special clip that's not
the<00:02:41.520> best<00:02:41.820> part<00:02:41.970> though<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.900> fact<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.230> i<00:02:43.350> can

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
the best part though the fact that i can

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.470 
the best part though the fact that i can
even<00:02:43.680> hear<00:02:44.010> myself<00:02:44.280> after<00:02:45.000> falling<00:02:45.239> and

even hear myself after falling and
taking<00:02:45.780> damage<00:02:45.989> means<00:02:46.709> i<00:02:46.890> don't<00:02:46.920> have<00:02:47.040> to

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
taking damage means i don't have to

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.670 
taking damage means i don't have to
spend<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:47.730> much<00:02:47.880> time<00:02:47.940> stuffing<00:02:48.810> my<00:02:48.989> face<00:02:49.260> and
