00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.570 
of here also you have your mind
dispenser<00:05:35.120> which<00:05:35.479> you<00:05:35.599> just<00:05:35.810> pull<00:05:36.050> out<00:05:36.580> you

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
dispenser which you just pull out you

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.719 
dispenser which you just pull out you
can<00:05:37.669> see<00:05:37.789> the<00:05:37.909> mines<00:05:38.180> drop<00:05:38.539> out<00:05:39.520> back<00:05:40.520> again

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
can see the mines drop out back again

each one in its slot it's a simple

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:55.600 
each one in its slot it's a simple
design<00:05:50.030> but<00:05:50.060> it<00:05:50.300> works<00:05:54.370> over<00:05:55.370> here<00:05:55.520> you

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610

of the detail I put in there I've never

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.520 
of the detail I put in there I've never
understood<00:06:08.210> they<00:06:08.720> always<00:06:09.020> put<00:06:09.199> so<00:06:09.409> much

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
understood they always put so much

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.310 
understood they always put so much
detail<00:06:09.590> into<00:06:10.039> the<00:06:10.449> engine<00:06:11.449> panels<00:06:11.840> inside<00:06:12.139> of

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
detail into the engine panels inside of

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.450 
detail into the engine panels inside of
them<00:06:12.409> but<00:06:12.500> they<00:06:12.620> never<00:06:12.740> take<00:06:12.949> the<00:06:13.099> time<00:06:13.310> to

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
them but they never take the time to

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.460 
them but they never take the time to
paint<00:06:13.639> it<00:06:13.789> which<00:06:14.050> really<00:06:15.050> makes<00:06:15.229> just

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
paint it which really makes just

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.140 
paint it which really makes just
displaying<00:06:15.860> it<00:06:16.010> without<00:06:16.130> the<00:06:16.310> panel<00:06:16.610> on<00:06:16.760> a

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
displaying it without the panel on a

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.930 
displaying it without the panel on a
waste<00:06:17.720> of<00:06:17.810> time<00:06:17.870> in<00:06:18.110> my<00:06:18.229> book<00:06:18.729> you<00:06:19.729> have<00:06:19.849> to

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
waste of time in my book you have to

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.430 
waste of time in my book you have to
actually<00:06:20.060> took<00:06:20.300> the<00:06:20.419> time<00:06:20.449> to<00:06:20.720> put<00:06:20.750> some<00:06:21.080> paint

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
actually took the time to put some paint

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.839 
actually took the time to put some paint
in<00:06:21.590> there<00:06:21.710> it<00:06:21.860> would<00:06:21.949> really<00:06:22.220> be<00:06:22.370> a<00:06:22.490> lot<00:06:22.699> better

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
in there it would really be a lot better

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:28.300 
in there it would really be a lot better
in<00:06:23.060> my<00:06:23.180> personal<00:06:23.419> opinion<00:06:26.380> so

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
in my personal opinion so

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.900 
in my personal opinion so
oh<00:06:28.400> and<00:06:29.180> of<00:06:29.330> course<00:06:30.280> it<00:06:31.280> rolls<00:06:31.610> really

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
oh and of course it rolls really

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.320 
oh and of course it rolls really
smoothly<00:06:33.040> so<00:06:34.040> over<00:06:34.220> all<00:06:34.250> of<00:06:34.520> them<00:06:34.640> this<00:06:35.180> is

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
smoothly so over all of them this is

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.690 
smoothly so over all of them this is
from<00:06:35.480> wave<00:06:35.810> two<00:06:36.140> of<00:06:36.560> the<00:06:36.710> new<00:06:36.800> Daleks<00:06:37.250> vehicles
