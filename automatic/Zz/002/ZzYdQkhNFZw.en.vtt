00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
thinking he might predict the switch but

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.120 
thinking he might predict the switch but
he<00:02:25.550> thinks<00:02:26.000> he's<00:02:26.510> not<00:02:26.780> very<00:02:26.989> walls<00:02:27.319> my<00:02:27.650> star<00:02:27.950> me

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
he thinks he's not very walls my star me

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.559 
he thinks he's not very walls my star me
but<00:02:28.430> no<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:29.030> have<00:02:29.420> HP<00:02:29.930> fire<00:02:30.170> on<00:02:30.530> my<00:02:30.739> star<00:02:31.010> me<00:02:31.190> and

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
but no I have HP fire on my star me and

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.570 
but no I have HP fire on my star me and
yeah<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:32.750> bad<00:02:33.200> thing<00:02:33.530> about<00:02:33.560> HP<00:02:34.100> fire<00:02:34.340> is

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
yeah the bad thing about HP fire is

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.930 
yeah the bad thing about HP fire is
though<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:34.850> have<00:02:35.120> only<00:02:35.330> 30<00:02:35.800> speed<00:02:36.800> IVs<00:02:37.280> so

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
though you have only 30 speed IVs so

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.870 
though you have only 30 speed IVs so
that's<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:38.840> why<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.170> have<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:40.220> little<00:02:40.730> bit

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
that's that is why I have a little bit

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.259 
that's that is why I have a little bit
of<00:02:40.910> HP<00:02:41.660> investment<00:02:42.170> since<00:02:42.470> with<00:02:43.030> 360<00:02:44.030> speed

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
of HP investment since with 360 speed

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.940 
of HP investment since with 360 speed
you<00:02:44.420> don't<00:02:44.600> really<00:02:44.810> out<00:02:45.019> speed<00:02:45.350> anything<00:02:45.680> in

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
you don't really out speed anything in

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.350 
you don't really out speed anything in
particular<00:02:46.070> so<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:46.670> just<00:02:46.880> gave<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.209> little

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
particular so I just gave it a little

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.199 
particular so I just gave it a little
less<00:02:47.600> in<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:47.870> little<00:02:48.110> bit<00:02:48.200> more<00:02:48.380> HP<00:02:48.620> um<00:02:49.519> he

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
less in a little bit more HP um he

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.460 
less in a little bit more HP um he
brings<00:02:50.450> him<00:02:50.569> road<00:02:50.780> I'm<00:02:50.959> thinking<00:02:51.260> he<00:02:51.350> could

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
brings him road I'm thinking he could

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.800 
brings him road I'm thinking he could
scare<00:02:51.739> me<00:02:51.890> out<00:02:52.040> but<00:02:52.280> no<00:02:52.489> I<00:02:52.700> stay<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.330> go<00:02:53.569> for

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810

psychic as he goes for willow he misses

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.880 
psychic as he goes for willow he misses
but<00:02:56.150> then<00:02:56.480> again<00:02:56.600> wasn't<00:02:57.110> really<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.650> big<00:02:57.860> deal

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
but then again wasn't really a big deal

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.370

named wild chase of course and finishes
me<00:03:41.209> off<00:03:41.239> then<00:03:41.989> I<00:03:42.019> bring<00:03:42.470> in<00:03:42.590> my<00:03:42.709> Garchomp<00:03:42.950> which

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
me off then I bring in my Garchomp which

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.120 
me off then I bring in my Garchomp which
is<00:03:43.549> actually<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.940> wall<00:03:44.390> jump<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:44.989> I<00:03:45.859> was

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
is actually a wall jump and I was

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.020 
is actually a wall jump and I was
thinking<00:03:46.910> he<00:03:47.090> might<00:03:47.390> want<00:03:47.720> to<00:03:47.840> switch<00:03:47.989> his

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
thinking he might want to switch his

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.699 
thinking he might want to switch his
gengar<00:03:50.030> in<00:03:50.209> so<00:03:50.420> i<00:03:50.450> go<00:03:50.690> for<00:03:50.840> dragon<00:03:51.260> tail<00:03:51.440> but<00:03:51.650> he

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
gengar in so i go for dragon tail but he

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.560 
gengar in so i go for dragon tail but he
brings<00:03:51.950> in<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.670> car<00:03:52.880> too<00:03:53.030> but<00:03:53.180> i<00:03:53.209> miss

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
brings in the car too but i miss

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.560 
brings in the car too but i miss
Garchomp<00:03:54.440> i<00:03:54.890> miss<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.579> dragonite<00:03:56.030> i<00:03:56.090> mean<00:03:56.420> i

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
Garchomp i miss the dragonite i mean i

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.599 
Garchomp i miss the dragonite i mean i
could<00:03:56.900> have<00:03:57.260> used<00:03:57.410> stealth<00:03:57.859> rocks<00:03:58.130> but<00:03:58.340> i<00:03:58.370> was

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
could have used stealth rocks but i was

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.310 
could have used stealth rocks but i was
thinking<00:03:58.640> he<00:03:59.120> might<00:03:59.329> switch<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.780> gengar<00:04:00.140> in

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
thinking he might switch the gengar in

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.500 
thinking he might switch the gengar in
so<00:04:00.620> that's<00:04:01.310> why<00:04:01.489> I<00:04:01.519> went<00:04:01.880> for<00:04:03.730> a<00:04:04.730> dragon<00:04:05.239> till

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
so that's why I went for a dragon till

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.479 
so that's why I went for a dragon till
now<00:04:06.019> I<00:04:06.049> set<00:04:06.440> up<00:04:06.560> stealth<00:04:06.829> rocks<00:04:07.100> in<00:04:07.250> some<00:04:07.400> a

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
now I set up stealth rocks in some a

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.160 
now I set up stealth rocks in some a
wall<00:04:07.670> jump<00:04:07.970> I'm<00:04:08.120> not<00:04:08.329> really<00:04:08.480> fearing<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.019> and

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
wall jump I'm not really fearing it and

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.610 
wall jump I'm not really fearing it and
I<00:04:09.260> had<00:04:09.440> this<00:04:09.620> I<00:04:09.859> suspect<00:04:10.519> it<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:11.060> being<00:04:11.269> a

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
I had this I suspect it and being a

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
I had this I suspect it and being a
bulky<00:04:12.620> dragonite<00:04:13.099> so<00:04:13.340> I

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
bulky dragonite so I

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.060 
bulky dragonite so I
stay<00:04:14.300> and<00:04:14.510> take<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:14.900> Dragon<00:04:15.230> Claw<00:04:15.410> and<00:04:15.620> here<00:04:15.860> i

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
stay and take the Dragon Claw and here i

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.949 
stay and take the Dragon Claw and here i
go<00:04:16.340> for<00:04:16.519> drag<00:04:16.790> until<00:04:16.940> I<00:04:17.180> could<00:04:17.390> have<00:04:17.480> used<00:04:17.630> fire

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
go for drag until I could have used fire

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.750 
go for drag until I could have used fire
blast<00:04:18.230> but<00:04:18.500> then<00:04:18.650> again<00:04:18.769> I'm<00:04:19.070> thinking<00:04:19.579> he's

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
blast but then again I'm thinking he's

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.720 
blast but then again I'm thinking he's
bulky<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:20.480> if<00:04:21.079> I<00:04:21.200> use<00:04:21.380> Fire<00:04:21.620> Blast<00:04:21.650> he<00:04:22.250> gets<00:04:22.520> up

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
bulky and if I use Fire Blast he gets up

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.730 
bulky and if I use Fire Blast he gets up
the<00:04:22.880> leftovers<00:04:23.450> and<00:04:23.600> Whitney<00:04:23.930> multi-scale<00:04:24.590> I

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
the leftovers and Whitney multi-scale I

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.590 
the leftovers and Whitney multi-scale I
don't<00:04:24.980> think<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.340> would<00:04:25.550> have<00:04:25.610> done<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:26.060> single

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
don't think I would have done a single

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.760 
don't think I would have done a single
HP<00:04:27.170> of<00:04:27.200> damage<00:04:27.550> so<00:04:28.550> now<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:28.850> bring<00:04:29.210> in<00:04:29.470> my<00:04:30.470> render

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
until I die so let's see how that goes I

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.260 
until I die so let's see how that goes I
go<00:04:42.410> for<00:04:42.560> stone<00:04:42.740> edge<00:04:42.950> hit<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:43.760> he<00:04:44.090> goes

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
go for stone edge hit and he goes

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.659 
go for stone edge hit and he goes
jhankla<00:04:44.840> i<00:04:45.020> miss<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.650> stone<00:04:45.890> and<00:04:45.919> he<00:04:46.310> gets<00:04:46.520> up

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
jhankla i miss the stone and he gets up

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.050 
jhankla i miss the stone and he gets up
a<00:04:46.790> roost<00:04:47.060> now<00:04:47.570> i<00:04:47.930> don't<00:04:48.740> think<00:04:49.130> he<00:04:49.460> has<00:04:49.580> extreme

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
a roost now i don't think he has extreme

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.310 
a roost now i don't think he has extreme
speed<00:04:50.360> because<00:04:50.660> otherwise<00:04:50.900> he<00:04:51.020> would<00:04:51.290> have

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
speed because otherwise he would have

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.510 
speed because otherwise he would have
used<00:04:51.590> it<00:04:51.800> before<00:04:51.919> i<00:04:53.110> think<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.380> yeah<00:04:55.310> he<00:04:55.490> does

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
used it before i think and yeah he does

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.490 
used it before i think and yeah he does
not<00:04:55.910> have<00:04:56.120> extreme<00:04:56.540> speed<00:04:56.870> i<00:04:56.960> go<00:04:57.140> for<00:04:57.380> another

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
not have extreme speed i go for another

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.800 
not have extreme speed i go for another
stone<00:04:58.010> edge<00:04:58.160> and<00:04:58.400> miss<00:04:58.610> again<00:04:59.210> so<00:04:59.480> I<00:04:59.510> just

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
stone edge and miss again so I just

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.409 
stone edge and miss again so I just
pretty<00:05:00.050> much<00:05:00.140> wasted<00:05:00.590> my<00:05:01.190> render<00:05:01.910> Rosa<00:05:02.120> which

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
pretty much wasted my render Rosa which

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.350 
pretty much wasted my render Rosa which
is<00:05:02.570> very<00:05:02.960> bad<00:05:03.260> for<00:05:03.290> me<00:05:03.650> but<00:05:04.550> I<00:05:04.730> do<00:05:04.790> have<00:05:05.120> my

toxic stalling jirachi which is a very
good<00:05:07.580> set<00:05:07.910> I<00:05:08.120> used<00:05:08.780> it<00:05:08.930> in<00:05:09.050> my<00:05:09.140> last<00:05:09.410> dog

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
moshpit video as well and it really

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.980 
moshpit video as well and it really
worked<00:05:13.100> there<00:05:13.310> so<00:05:13.520> i<00:05:13.550> go<00:05:13.850> for<00:05:14.030> toxic<00:05:14.510> on<00:05:14.690> the

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
worked there so i go for toxic on the

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.390 
worked there so i go for toxic on the
dragonite<00:05:15.410> and<00:05:15.620> a<00:05:15.680> good<00:05:15.890> thing<00:05:16.160> about

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
dragonite and a good thing about

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.030 
dragonite and a good thing about
dragonite<00:05:17.270> and<00:05:17.570> having<00:05:17.900> multi<00:05:18.290> skill<00:05:18.590> is<00:05:18.770> that

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
dragonite and having multi skill is that

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.640 
dragonite and having multi skill is that
it<00:05:19.160> does<00:05:19.310> not<00:05:19.370> have<00:05:19.850> inner<00:05:20.090> focus<00:05:20.570> anymore<00:05:20.840> so

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
it does not have inner focus anymore so

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.740 
it does not have inner focus anymore so
i<00:05:21.680> can<00:05:21.890> just<00:05:22.040> go<00:05:22.310> for<00:05:22.520> iron<00:05:22.880> heads<00:05:23.240> and<00:05:23.510> try<00:05:23.690> to

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
i can just go for iron heads and try to

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.850 
i can just go for iron heads and try to
flinch<00:05:24.110> it<00:05:24.350> now<00:05:25.070> I<00:05:25.250> just<00:05:25.460> go<00:05:25.669> for<00:05:25.840> I've<00:05:26.840> wait<00:05:27.560> no

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
flinch it now I just go for I've wait no

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.920 
flinch it now I just go for I've wait no
I'm<00:05:28.070> thinking<00:05:28.910> he<00:05:29.090> wants<00:05:29.240> to<00:05:29.510> predict<00:05:29.870> the

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
I'm thinking he wants to predict the

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.900 
I'm thinking he wants to predict the
iron<00:05:30.169> head<00:05:30.440> and<00:05:30.590> switch<00:05:30.770> ways<00:05:31.040> infernape<00:05:31.669> and

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
iron head and switch ways infernape and

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.540 
iron head and switch ways infernape and
I<00:05:32.419> see<00:05:32.780> that<00:05:32.960> coming<00:05:33.380> and<00:05:33.560> go<00:05:33.800> for<00:05:34.010> you<00:05:34.160> turn<00:05:34.370> so

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
I see that coming and go for you turn so

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.159 
I see that coming and go for you turn so
that's<00:05:34.700> a<00:05:34.760> good<00:05:34.910> prediction<00:05:35.390> on<00:05:35.479> my<00:05:35.660> part<00:05:35.960> I

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
that's a good prediction on my part I

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.140 
that's a good prediction on my part I
predicted<00:05:36.919> your<00:05:37.040> furnace<00:05:37.430> switch<00:05:37.700> and<00:05:37.940> switch
