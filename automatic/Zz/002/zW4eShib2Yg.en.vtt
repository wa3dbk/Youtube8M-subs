my first etching which I can turn out
really<00:00:36.460> nice<00:00:38.160> there<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:40.360> here's<00:00:40.690> another

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
really nice there and here's another

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:48.420

longer<00:00:48.699> than<00:00:49.090> my<00:00:49.210> nail<00:00:49.420> polish<00:00:49.660> remover<00:00:49.840> idea

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350

that I showed you guys but I think the
results<00:00:52.720> are<00:00:52.780> much<00:00:52.989> more<00:00:54.930> much<00:00:55.930> nicer<00:00:57.120> okay

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
results are much more much nicer okay

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.509 
results are much more much nicer okay

using a real action items you want to do
this<00:02:10.100> they're<00:02:10.880> not<00:02:11.030> expensive<00:02:11.300> he'd<00:02:11.630> get<00:02:11.780> up

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
this they're not expensive he'd get up

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.259

like<00:02:12.019> a<00:02:12.050> hardware<00:02:12.470> store<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:13.010> just<00:02:13.820> found<00:02:14.120> this

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
like a hardware store I just found this

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.560 
like a hardware store I just found this
on<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.510> house<00:02:14.720> actually<00:02:14.989> it's<00:02:15.260> my<00:02:15.350> dad<00:02:16.570> this

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
on the house actually it's my dad this

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.229 
on the house actually it's my dad this
is<00:02:17.780> not<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.959> real<00:02:18.260> hard<00:02:18.560> process<00:02:18.880> etching<00:02:19.880> your

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
is not a real hard process etching your

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.160 
is not a real hard process etching your
Breyer<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.160> makes<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:22.430> look<00:02:22.610> really<00:02:22.820> nice

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
Breyer and it makes it look really nice

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.590 
Breyer and it makes it look really nice
and<00:02:24.170> obviously<00:02:24.440> this<00:02:24.650> doesn't<00:02:24.709> look<00:02:25.100> very

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
and obviously this doesn't look very

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.430 
and obviously this doesn't look very
amazing<00:02:26.600> new<00:02:26.690> hood<00:02:26.810> I'm<00:02:26.900> doing<00:02:27.110> this<00:02:27.200> very

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
amazing new hood I'm doing this very

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.729 
amazing new hood I'm doing this very
fast<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:28.040> show<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:28.250> guys<00:02:28.690> but<00:02:29.690> overall<00:02:30.350> I

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
fast to show you guys but overall I

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.740 
fast to show you guys but overall I
think<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.280> results<00:02:31.790> are<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:32.030> lot<00:02:32.239> better<00:02:32.420> than

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
think the results are a lot better than

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.050 
think the results are a lot better than
the<00:02:32.840> nail<00:02:33.019> polish<00:02:33.380> for<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.620> results<00:02:34.040> but<00:02:34.910> if

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
the nail polish for the results but if

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.300 
the nail polish for the results but if
you<00:02:35.120> have<00:02:35.209> but<00:02:35.930> if<00:02:36.019> you<00:02:36.140> have<00:02:36.319> like<00:02:36.709> you<00:02:36.860> want<00:02:37.069> a

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
you have but if you have like you want a

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.670 
you have but if you have like you want a
little<00:02:37.580> faster<00:02:38.180> thing<00:02:38.900> i'd<00:02:39.050> recommend<00:02:39.650> the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
little faster thing i'd recommend the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.370 
little faster thing i'd recommend the
nail<00:02:39.860> posh<00:02:40.810> because<00:02:41.810> this<00:02:42.230> takes<00:02:42.440> more<00:02:42.739> time

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.640
