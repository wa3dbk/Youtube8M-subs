00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.400
 always high premium here 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.109
 mercedes-benz e-class estate and there we 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.090
 but in bremen are the whole thing 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.090
 Of course also in German world premiere 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.090
 in mercedes-benz c-class t-model 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.090
 you are welcome 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.050
 My colleague Robin Hornig and I had 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.670
 this morning already the opportunity and 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.670
 to take a closer look at the car 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.519
 what is special about this car 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.690
 So Mercedes has looked closely 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.370
 above all, this is precisely the competition 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.799
 looked a bit more on it 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.629
 put a bit bigger ten liters 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:07.119
 more load volume and then they have too 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.070
 many interesting gimmicks will be easy 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.570
 here at the touch of a button the backrests 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.520
 have to see everything have ever seen 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.399
 but that is relieved too 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.929
 So good as standard and I could 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.580
 now synonymous first find anything what 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:20.560
 would order me now so the 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.240
 Practicability is also given though 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.909
 The vehicle is very dynamic 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.039
 is now drawn to ruins behind it 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.750
 and counts this rollo with it has it all 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.450
 special on how does that work 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.009
 So what's that rollo is now 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.539
 no longer in a strong china 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.030
 attached that would be now normally 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.959
 up here and that would be just then 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.450
 also prevent that if I am now 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:42.100
 Luggage must have been higher 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.600
 that of the polo is no longer about it 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.819
 can pull that into this now 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.240
 Luggage china can drop the rollo 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:50.590
 then about the luggage would also 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.530
 a very practical matter 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.840
 ok also similar to the v class 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.729
 There are such additional features here 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.039
 I also think there's place 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:05.729
 Here again we have the purchase costs 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:08.410
 so that you can then go to the supermarket 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.060
 a bit like the euro 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.910
 load but it works wonderfully 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.030
 okay and normal a little word right away 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.440
 if we handle this 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.140
 what can one say creatively 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.670
 what do you have in total so the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.170
 harmonious impression we already at 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.480
 the limousine had the pulls 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.980
 now here at the t-model and continue 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.890
 it will be that she is really too 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.230
 athletic out without mind you then here 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.000
 also to restrict the space and 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.470
 I like that very much 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.599
 still like a little shooting 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.940
 Almost you can already break something 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.140
 to say the prices 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.989
 Price mercedes still not known 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.720
 Given we go from 36,000 euros 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.040
 Exactly the predecessor was 35,000 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.299
 a bit of heat on it 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.489
 but there is also a bit more 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.950
 equipment so a total of a lot 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.810
 successful and consistent car on everyone 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.090
 case more we like it through the 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.860
 two-part heek lay rather wide 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.950
 We got into the vehicle purely 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.590
 through the different lions in the 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.290
 much in the bumper design too 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.070
 more variability than before and it 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.070
 just sexy 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.670
 Of course, everything is great here 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.530
 now you might think because of the 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.510
 form that maybe not the overview 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.610
 quite as good would be if I were here 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.430
 turn around then it's amazing 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.870
 the rear window is relatively large 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.220
 small slices left and right so 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.200
 I'm curious how this is in the 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.790
 But traffic is so static 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.400
 At first impression one can open 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.500
 See where you are in any case 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.210
 space here in the fund is for mine 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.080
 Size absolutely sufficient, I have just 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.910
 sat in front 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.710
 So the seat was set now 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.870
 I'm sitting here behind my knee on 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.500
 place my head is bursting now we have 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.360
 of course that too 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.850
 panoramic sunroof but absolutely 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.890
 enough feel-good factor I would 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.830
 Absolutely fulfilled just say natural 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.900
 here too with the leather and the fine 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.420
 smell it is still nice here 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.640
 end of june is orderable that means then 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.050
 So there are also all prices and middle 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.570
 september is then the launch 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.570
 for this theme of the c class
