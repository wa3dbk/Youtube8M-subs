Jack as we head on down towards let's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.040 
Jack as we head on down towards let's
cook<00:00:40.790> what's<00:00:41.030> known<00:00:41.240> as<00:00:41.390> pyro<00:00:41.690> gorge

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.950 

and<00:00:46.950> here<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.489> canyon<00:00:48.149> walls<00:00:48.360> begin<00:00:48.780> to

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and here the canyon walls begin to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.110 
and here the canyon walls begin to
narrow<00:00:49.469> down<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:50.010> us<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.250> little<00:00:50.399> bit

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.630 

and<00:00:54.289> then<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.440> also<00:00:55.590> find<00:00:56.010> ourselves<00:00:56.250> getting

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
and then we also find ourselves getting

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.170 
and then we also find ourselves getting
down<00:00:57.059> towards<00:00:57.539> piru<00:00:57.989> Creek<00:00:58.940> luckily<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.120> us

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
down towards piru Creek luckily for us

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.270 
down towards piru Creek luckily for us
this<00:01:00.510> time<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.899> year<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.379> an<00:01:01.710> awful<00:01:02.129> lot<00:01:02.219> of

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
this time of year is not an awful lot of

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.180 
this time of year is not an awful lot of
water

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.470 

and<00:01:07.340> then<00:01:07.460> looking<00:01:07.790> up<00:01:07.910> with<00:01:08.060> some<00:01:08.240> of<00:01:08.360> the

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
and then looking up with some of the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.810 
and then looking up with some of the
rock<00:01:08.810> formations<00:01:09.440> along<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:09.890> way<00:01:10.070> gives<00:01:10.610> us<00:01:10.790> a

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
rock formations along the way gives us a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.660 
rock formations along the way gives us a
good<00:01:11.270> idea<00:01:11.300> of<00:01:11.840> how<00:01:12.050> twisted<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.010> tortured

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
good idea of how twisted and tortured

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.060 
good idea of how twisted and tortured
this<00:01:13.910> these<00:01:14.720> rock<00:01:14.960> strategies<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:15.620> this<00:01:15.740> area

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
this these rock strategies in this area

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.460 
this these rock strategies in this area
are

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.770 

and<00:01:20.890> then<00:01:21.100> things<00:01:21.310> really<00:01:21.640> start<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.600> narrow

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
and then things really start to narrow

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.220 
and then things really start to narrow
down<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.850> in<00:01:24.970> places<00:01:25.210> there's<00:01:25.690> just<00:01:26.080> no

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
down and in places there's just no

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.410 
down and in places there's just no
choice<00:01:26.560> but<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:27.010> try<00:01:27.430> and<00:01:27.460> find<00:01:27.790> a<00:01:28.000> way<00:01:28.150> to<00:01:28.210> get

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
choice but to try and find a way to get

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.760 
choice but to try and find a way to get
across<00:01:28.660> the<00:01:28.900> creek

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.639 

includes<00:01:34.219> getting<00:01:34.549> around<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.689> over<00:01:36.049> lots

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
includes getting around and over lots

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.890 
includes getting around and over lots
and<00:01:36.859> lots<00:01:37.070> of<00:01:37.310> boulders

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.920 

in<00:01:42.900> places<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.439> water<00:01:44.369> ponds<00:01:45.030> up<00:01:45.210> create

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
in places the water ponds up create

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.590 
in places the water ponds up create
pretty<00:01:46.259> good<00:01:46.470> cool<00:01:47.210> although<00:01:48.210> there's<00:01:48.420> not

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
pretty good cool although there's not

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.719 
pretty good cool although there's not
too<00:01:48.810> much<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.200> wave<00:01:49.380> elevation<00:01:49.710> gain<00:01:50.369> at<00:01:50.549> us

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
too much in wave elevation gain at us

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.749 
too much in wave elevation gain at us
and<00:01:51.479> was<00:01:51.810> hiked<00:01:52.049> through<00:01:52.350> lots<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.430> lots<00:01:53.580> of

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
and was hiked through lots and lots of

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.389 
and was hiked through lots and lots of
exercise<00:01:56.960> in<00:01:57.960> places<00:01:58.409> it's<00:01:58.619> really<00:01:58.890> no<00:01:59.070> trail

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
exercise in places it's really no trail

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.520 
exercise in places it's really no trail
to<00:01:59.640> follow<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.659> have<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.049> do<00:02:01.500> your

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
to follow so you just have to do your

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.169 
to follow so you just have to do your
best<00:02:01.920> job<00:02:02.310> finding<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.210> way<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.360> go

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.099 

including<00:02:08.780> numerous<00:02:09.439> stream<00:02:10.099> crossings<00:02:11.109> some

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:12.109 
including numerous stream crossings some

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.420 
including numerous stream crossings some
of<00:02:12.290> which<00:02:12.439> were<00:02:12.739> somewhat<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:13.939> challenge

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
of which were somewhat of a challenge

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.339 
of which were somewhat of a challenge
one<00:02:16.430> of<00:02:16.579> which<00:02:16.760> ended<00:02:17.420> up<00:02:17.540> with<00:02:17.780> me<00:02:17.959> picking

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
one of which ended up with me picking

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.759 
one of which ended up with me picking
myself<00:02:18.650> up<00:02:19.069> out<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.519> water<00:02:20.530> but<00:02:21.530> here

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
myself up out of the water but here

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.530 
myself up out of the water but here
Dale's<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.459> little<00:02:22.760> better<00:02:22.939> than<00:02:23.269> getting

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
Dale's a little better than getting

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.569 
Dale's a little better than getting
across<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.959> then<00:02:27.290> some<00:02:27.590> more<00:02:27.769> dodging

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
across and then some more dodging

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.330 
across and then some more dodging
boulders<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.659> the<00:02:30.200> springtime<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.889> a<00:02:31.159> wet

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
boulders in the springtime of a wet

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.370 
boulders in the springtime of a wet
season<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:31.790> could<00:02:32.329> be<00:02:32.480> quite<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.810> challenge

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.880 

and<00:02:37.520> then<00:02:38.520> on<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:39.150> trudged<00:02:39.560> hoping<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.650> find

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
and then on we trudged hoping to find

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.220 
and then on we trudged hoping to find
the<00:02:41.070> easier<00:02:41.670> way<00:02:41.880> not<00:02:42.570> having<00:02:42.780> too<00:02:43.020> much<00:02:43.170> luck

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
the easier way not having too much luck

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.620 
the easier way not having too much luck
at<00:02:43.620> it

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.690 

and<00:02:48.630> occasionally<00:02:48.930> we<00:02:49.410> did<00:02:49.620> actually<00:02:49.980> find<00:02:50.580> a

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
and occasionally we did actually find a

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.440 
and occasionally we did actually find a
trail

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.839 

this<00:02:55.810> narrow<00:02:56.200> Gorge<00:02:56.590> with<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.069> pyro<00:02:57.459> creek

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
this narrow Gorge with the pyro creek

this narrow Gorge with the pyro creek
running<00:02:58.120> through<00:02:58.239> it<00:02:58.510> has<00:02:59.020> some<00:02:59.290> quite

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
running through it has some quite

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.420 
running through it has some quite
interesting<00:02:59.709> topography

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.630 

and<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.569> occasionally<00:03:06.049> lets<00:03:06.379> us<00:03:06.530> know<00:03:06.560> that<00:03:07.010> we

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
and it occasionally lets us know that we

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.050 
and it occasionally lets us know that we
are<00:03:07.819> in<00:03:08.060> arid<00:03:08.810> country<00:03:09.019> with<00:03:09.819> cactus<00:03:10.819> like

are in arid country with cactus like

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.330 
are in arid country with cactus like
this

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.420 

but<00:03:15.340> then<00:03:15.490> it's<00:03:15.670> back<00:03:16.030> along<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.390> creek

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.800 

and<00:03:21.170> crossing<00:03:22.170> back<00:03:22.349> over<00:03:22.409> it<00:03:22.799> again<00:03:23.810> it's

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
and crossing back over it again it's

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.649 
and crossing back over it again it's
possible<00:03:25.349> to<00:03:25.560> follow<00:03:26.129> this<00:03:26.400> route<00:03:26.670> all<00:03:27.209> the

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
possible to follow this route all the

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.860 
possible to follow this route all the
way<00:03:27.780> down<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.290> Lake<00:03:28.650> Piru<00:03:29.000> about<00:03:30.000> 14<00:03:30.599> miles

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
way down to Lake Piru about 14 miles

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.990 
way down to Lake Piru about 14 miles
from<00:03:31.230> where<00:03:31.439> we<00:03:32.040> started<00:03:32.250> Frenchman's<00:03:32.969> flat

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.930 

for<00:03:38.150> us<00:03:38.330> after<00:03:38.630> about<00:03:39.050> two<00:03:39.560> miles<00:03:39.830> of<00:03:40.130> hacking

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
for us after about two miles of hacking

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.270 
for us after about two miles of hacking
our<00:03:41.030> way<00:03:41.210> downstream<00:03:41.840> we<00:03:42.650> decided<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.190> was

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
our way downstream we decided it was

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.020 
our way downstream we decided it was
time<00:03:43.460> to<00:03:43.520> call<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:44.690> day<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.170> start<00:03:45.530> back<00:03:46.030> I'm

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
time to call it a day and start back I'm

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.180 
time to call it a day and start back I'm
not<00:03:47.240> quite<00:03:47.510> sure<00:03:47.540> with<00:03:48.050> this<00:03:48.200> slow<00:03:48.620> going<00:03:49.040> how

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
not quite sure with this slow going how

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.880 
not quite sure with this slow going how
many<00:03:49.400> miles<00:03:49.670> we<00:03:49.940> wanted<00:03:50.240> but<00:03:50.690> I<00:03:50.750> knew<00:03:51.020> it<00:03:51.200> dunno

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
many miles we wanted but I knew it dunno

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.130 
many miles we wanted but I knew it dunno
we<00:03:52.070> ended<00:03:52.310> up<00:03:52.400> with<00:03:52.580> almost<00:03:53.270> a<00:03:53.450> four-hour<00:03:53.900> hike

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
we ended up with almost a four-hour hike

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.670 
we ended up with almost a four-hour hike
enough<00:03:55.100> for<00:03:55.310> one<00:03:55.459> day
