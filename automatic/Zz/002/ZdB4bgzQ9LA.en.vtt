00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:04.180
 more to see if the rural 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.350
 the production 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.990
 of seeds 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.159
 this is the mediator 

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:12.029
 they do not allow work 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.029
 cortez and science in tomato production 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.089
 the researchers 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:19.070
 They have done a very good job 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.250
 in the operation 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.250
 of new varieties for a better production of taking 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.539
 the technician alberto huarte 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:27.949
 we are not going to stop 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.949
 of a variety that has developed 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.250
 what is the ink variety porra 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.550
 of how the product once you have 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.170
 they were at home 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.170
 can reproduce it through seeds 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.410
 for the lieutenant to continue to get good seeds for reproduction 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.650
 from the small producer 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.150
 good day to look rural we are in the laboratory of 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.390
 seed extraction 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.390
 the decision because culture of the national agronomic institute 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.870
 to show the extraction of seeds of the ink variety 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.820
 then it is worth mentioning that the dgt the farmer selects the best 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.940
 plants for harvested tomato fruit the cost of the product lébed 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.390
 expect that the fruit is well ripe and tomato crops once harvested 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.560
 fruits are selected with the characteristics of the variety for their 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.700
 subsequent seed extraction 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.290
 once the fruits have been selected and in mature they proceed for the expression of 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.000
 the seed is cut in the middle of the fruit 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.790
 these tomatoes how are we going the tomato fruit 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.710
 who some what where are deposited in it with the juice for the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.630
 station 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.380
 it is taken out 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.850
 the juice with the seed is deposited a container 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.130
 with the juice of tomatoes and navigable water or nothing only with jude himself 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.880
 of the seed 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.880
 they are dedicated to the container for three days 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.200
 after three days, think about fermenting this seed 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.160
 I will proceed to wash the seed we should not be 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.060
 spend more than three days in the tomato game because you can 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.929
 let our seed germinate 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:16.099
 the minister 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.769
 interested way does not do well or as 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.039
 seed for 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:26.139
 to cause bahamón the seed of the seed extracted from the sea at least three 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:27.229
 rockrose 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:28.769
 the kilo of tomato 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.070
 in this container is left 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.580
 they rested or in a cool place 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.780
 for three days 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.930
 these tomatoes start to ferment 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.510
 this amount of tomato juice can of this we can get up to five thousand 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.360
 seeds that are for 5000 seedlings and at the same time can produce up to 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.330
 the growth to 4 thousand kilograms of fruit in the field it is worth mentioning that 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:57.609
 having coal I want to be worth whatever variety of tomato already pointed 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.509
 supposed premium the producer previous selection in the field can make his 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:07.009
 own seed every time a variety was pointed out in which the same form 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.449
 that we are applying is proceeding to the extraction of seed and that the 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:14.579
 producer can have his own seed is made after three days of 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.039
 seasons the seed is added to his girls a certain amount disappointed 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:22.839
 the container where the seed is 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.010
 and proceed 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.159
 to see mana in the colander by suffocating sara the low 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.739
 cg wash well so that the full force of 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:34.369
 sixth masters 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:37.209
 so that none is left 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.059
 red guilt to these phases remain only the most elitist phases the 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:52.549
 tomatoes of ceases away once finished the washing takes the seed to 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.089
 deposit on top of him 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:57.319
 ap the diary is deposited in china in the newspaper 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.340
 the little seed 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.290
 if you start distributing in such a way that the seeds are not coming for what the 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.500
 drying is more faster and better and as we said that this stay in a 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.069
 place 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.260
 I have half shade a cool place during this month to four days and 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.630
 after doing you can save the seeds 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.659
 or that you can already 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:23.279
 re-sowing finally when seed is camouflaged this seed is wanted 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:25.400
 find out everything together 11 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.360
 the process that must be done 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.789
 when the 3 4 days of drying the seed is to undo highlight the 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.759
 1 to 1 seed well with your hand 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.479
 for later police officers on where they will be saved 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.520
 that because of the humidity a fool sticks I know he will come back 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.509
 remove lizarte priest a few months ago 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.870
 villa can be 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.409
 will plant again 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.430
 after 50 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.900
 two months left 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.020
 in a motion billions 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.759
 we can already have 200 150 tomato template with diamonds would suffice for a 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.200
 2000 template crop
