00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.520
 if you comment today, there is at least one of my food 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.130
 sometimes very much in their coverage in his collection one maybe 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.029
 on the right wing of the course Martin Demichelis the concept 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.849
 Not to be confused with Basic Opera, the logo is similar 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.720
 He is co-founder of the world market 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.260
 and best concept »you get to run at Volvo that is now too 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.350
 Yield is therefore achieved 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.730
 a little longer agree the favorites if Robbies misses or not 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.940
 decide for yourself 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.850
 he is a very cheap market so i would be extremely cheap for a long time 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.460
 say 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.680
 so the diesel Quattro 1 99 is so if initiated and on 43 1 99 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.820
 In addition to the products, there were also colorful products in the collection 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.330
 Iran has a vice 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.860
 However, these have been out so long 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.990
 In any case, this palette is the same in other color versions 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.209
 once Laura nights in different colors gradation and Greens believes 

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:06.509
 I do not know if there is a fourth one I'm sorry there were not 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.400
 Adults still earlier than I was there 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.070
 and that's if I need more then 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.400
 two by chance from photo again sponsorship that already noticed 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.970
 but you should see 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.490
 worldwide 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.730
 the quotes one can say is right 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.430
 I was totally surprised 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.700
 But he does not have to be a long time does not mean that he will not be so far 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.250
 see and even have actually applied quite well 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.950
 totally surprised me 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.450
 It was a bit pale for the first time which airlines so above all 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.790
 a little bit of land 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.110
 despite the 2 1 99 I found it very very successful 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.580
 but as I am quite a big shortcoming 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.340
 it sounds like the songs so that's just this 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.730
 Aldi has the people you meet elsewhere at mac computers that yes 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.700
 for example also a refined one 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.520
 To turn the animal on then that is not looks is safe among other things 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.010
 that Sebastian embody the brand so seen responsibility warns so seen 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.040
 the customer also a responsibility 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.970
 maybe he also explains so the seller I know it finds thanks 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.309
 for the hint 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:09.799
 percent 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.120
 So it is we may have except maybe accept so if he is ready for it 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.390
 that he can not afford to start back or traded in case 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.160
 probably also Starbucks blue that I have not experienced that traffic 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.559
 but it is precisely because greens you can probably assume that 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:28.650
 Anyway, whoever left in Bern on the third day for that is the way 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.649
 not Becker that's pretty cool and maybe that's saying 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:35.889
 So here made and owns the split it is not a nice thing 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.879
 help Dr 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.959
 Lünen Trara I must honestly say the finest 90 knows the surprised by 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.790
 what you could do with it on the eye and if you could do it completely 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.959
 other quality most profound higher quality products used and only 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.799
 a color of it as a small splash of paint on it 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.079
 then that's not bad at all 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.909
 It is a very difficult promise for me from Sennfeld's worth or not 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.139
 Minden 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.059
 and for each other, this can not even be so bad 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:07.279
 So it's all the more blue color on Sunday in the 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:08.889
 drive completely funny 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.559
 So for us quality is not rather average it is not 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:16.509
 comes now that is, but maybe she is actually quite okay 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:19.929
 I did take it though, for example on the 11 5 to 4 in addition 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:23.889
 from the b2 you have but I want you to like it just me from 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.299
 The fans of the brand will be deposits has Kolbe 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.519
 but better a few better because of surfaces on the market 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.529
 let the whole dry and then again contest second layer above 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.319
 and then it's like that percent 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.539
 So individual light particles are in many neighborhoods the spokeswoman 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:45.099
 other market participants perhaps also from the collection of reported times wants 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.779
 I am very happy that I really have everything at Stosur 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:50.489
 you do not realize this channel 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.120
 clearly the next time growth was able to comment on the case again 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.310
 Take an eye I have a few other products from the fixed range 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.329
 hit on you also in the report 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.619
 and doing something like that
