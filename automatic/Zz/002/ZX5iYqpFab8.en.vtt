00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.859
 when you enter at times by the beginning of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.859
 Guadalajara, you have to deny everything 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.700
 here in Polynesian dances of Guadalajara 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.100
 that focus a lot not only to teach you 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.620
 the dance technique but part of the 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.200
 culture plus you exercise and 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.910
 releases the toxins is really dance 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.150
 with a feeling because you're 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.420
 transmitting a culture because very very 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.519
 old the apprenticeships go 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.890
 at many levels is not what you're going 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.359
 knowing of the amount of teachers and 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.359
 people with experience that happens because 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.550
 the functions are of very high quality 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.210
 the costumes the presentations 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.440
 choreography the technique that you start to 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.089
 demand yourself and you like those 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.299
 results that you had in yourself 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.640
 it shows that we really want to 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.399
 you know maybe people say there is not 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.080
 that is too much what is fault but already 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.229
 you see it in the analysis is good with 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.310
 reason the time the hours of dedication 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.500
 the fellowship we are are enough 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.929
 so the truth is I feel very very 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.200
 I'm all going to polish the 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.450
 steps to learn the choreographies you take 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.709
 very good relationship with teachers 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.959
 You can count on them to 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:35.299
 tell them if you have any questions or something 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.700
 so they always help you get to make a 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.340
 relationship as more 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.899
 friendship that a simple companion of 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.469
 dance and then the whole atmosphere is very 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.270
 healthy of a lot of support a lot of help and 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.219
 anything that to another partner 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.679
 companions of the tower then if you think 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:54.170
 that you can count on that with that 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.740
 person really helps you all 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.299
 discipline exercise to me being here in 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.869
 so many polinices de guadalajara has 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.670
 helped me feel more happy and 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.590
 when he arrived here I relax from my 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.019
 school activities and I feel 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.000
 as more confident in myself because here 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.580
 I learned teamwork because with 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.380
 teamwork if we all help 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.630
 Well, the dance will be excellent 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.700
 is what I have learned from here that 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.650
 you have to be very disciplined and that is 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.640
 is very dedicated and has its rewards 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.650
 and it is definitely I recommend 100% 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.200
 Polynesian dances of Guadalajara for its 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.720
 professionalism with the teachers for the 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.610
 technique when you want to do something or 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.310
