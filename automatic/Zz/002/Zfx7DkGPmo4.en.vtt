00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.540
 hello friends with you raki in the hangar and 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.590
 Today we have a new developer response 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.779
 the developers were asked how often 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.210
 information is updated on 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.920
 to the marks on the server on what they 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.120
 answered going daily 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.190
 update around midnight singing yew over 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.200
 which tanks are the second dash of the fifth levels 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.690
 there will be a mouse branch to that 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.309
 developers responded pc 35t 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.110
 and further, that is, in this thread will be 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.850
 attend tanks absolutely 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.920
 similar to those that have branches 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.030
 development in the computer version of the game 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.580
 world of tanks 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.500
 what actions are planned to take in 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.690
 respect to premium shells and in what 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.309
 versions of the game with distant yet 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.140
 decided most likely it will be 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.600
 reduced efficiency and cost 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.879
 Reception of shells according to the version apparently not 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.740
 before 14 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.890
 why didn't they get into the release version of the game? 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.250
 tank pz 3/4 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.440
 ipv4 t-34 tank paper and therefore not 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.460
 added by over 4 did not hit just because 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.610
 that they decided to make a branch congress about will be in 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.770
 1.4 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.810
 there is such an interesting moment we are for 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.229
 four goes to the maus development thread and and 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.270
 100 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.880
 but since e100 is already in the game, it is quite 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.149
 it is possible that the mouse will be exactly the same 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.009
 update 1.4 further developers 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.109
 asked to tell about the new graphics on 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.359
 learning card and how it will affect 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.979
 device performance on that 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:40.810
 developers answered key 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.929
 graphic on the introduction of the nearest 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.630
 update 1.2 is a new realistic 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:49.600
 grass in 1.2 is planted with grass only 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.850
 learning mission a in 1.3 is all appropriate 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.149
 cards to enjoy 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.560
 beauty on iyos need ipad air 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.200
 ipad mini retina 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.659
 or iphone 5s grass actually 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.969
 quite a serious animating chip 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.850
 the landscape is potentially more ambitious 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:09.479
 things can give a meter anyway such 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.310
 innovations pull only top device 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.080
