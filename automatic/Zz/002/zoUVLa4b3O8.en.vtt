00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.620
 you for I myself aziz and 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.629
 Numerous take make videos like 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.360
 make an outline drawing or how 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.349
 I will show photoshoot example 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.980
 Here's a photo from the face of Daniel that the shaft 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:19.740
 myself and here I am immediately doing noob 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.439
 comparing such a photo and this one 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.410
 which i drew so for this 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.810
 we go photoshop itself 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.359
 here he is now going to draw 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.540
 Catsville 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:36.440
 ok click kontrol shift in it means 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.020
 create new layer open layers 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.050
 so here here if you have this background 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.879
 there will be such a lock we click twice 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.190
 okay he is all without a lock 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.969
 so here it is and regulate but it is me 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.920
 I'll tell you why it is a little later 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.920
 arrive at the first layer of the shooting range we need 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.910
 set up the brush itself go into the brush and 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.570
 press f5 further intervals 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.600
 we can put a daw and do one percent 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.960
 further size according to your desire 2-3 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.210
 pixel most normal stable 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:18.869
 then we go to the feast itself in general and 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.940
 we start to trace the photo itself 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.660
 so now if you donâ€™t if such here 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.950
 but then we make the openings here 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.190
 here's another . 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.160
 press control and so bend 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.160
 also in bass all claws 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.620
 so after we first killed here 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.710
 right click to execute this 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.700
 the contour work further here we select if 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.060
 you have a jackdaw 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.480
 select the checkbox here choose the brush and ok 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:59.340
 and press enter further we can look 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:02.460
 that the workpiece is ready here if we choose 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.320
 Here we see that even though I already have those 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:11.010
 let's also take a beer and pick out 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.520
 eyes and nose with your feet 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.520
 body parts 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.290
 and immediately outline 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:44.459
 so here even though the workpiece is still 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:55.560
 everything is left here a little bit so themselves him 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:58.379
 a bunch of stickies and so here I am done 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.049
 billet well I did not become such all 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:04.769
 do so in detail so what are you 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.140
 understood the very essence and already there they can 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.140
 I just draw everything in detail 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.750
 takes a lot of time so on 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.930
 create a new control shift layer so 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.780
 same layer 2 so now let this layer 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.480
 below our cat this is the basis 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.489
 new layer so go over layer 2 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:29.010
 those here and change to white marshmallows and 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:32.340
 girls tool fill and fill 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.620
 now as we see here on a white background 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.959
 our drawing 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.069
 so now we have left so I do not have eyes 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:44.150
 I can draw it like this 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.150
 so cool first layer 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:56.430
 so let's normal eyes now to us 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.070
 need to do all this bones again we go 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.860
 fed shift in new layer now here 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:05.310
 This here we get down here here now 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.880
 Any color can be chosen by the way here 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:12.420
 This here to bloom so here we set 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:15.050
 Click here and now we select the light 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.820
 choose those as you can see we can 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.780
 thereby not to touch these 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:26.060
 here are the blacks that we drew very much ourselves 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:29.060
 the stroke itself so now the tree 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.060
 decorate 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.040
 so if you have come out like this 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.770
 go beyond the passing of his me 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.980
 plastic do hard one hundred percent and 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:54.250
 as well, so we remove all that we do not 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:57.340
 it is necessary if something went wrong with you 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.250
 much you accidentally here for example when 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.410
 stroke here and there circled around like this 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.860
 remove this one click control z 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.640
 control z and see back or go to 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.080
 stories 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.720
 here and delete this that's what we did 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.240
 remove all tactics let's move on 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.370
 back step from strength so now here's my 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.820
 once to celtic and we need to do here 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.000
 such here 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.910
 from him so here you see here 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.240
 it is a little darker cascade atu its lighter 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:32.700
 to do this we go back the same way 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:39.669
 could we choose it so we go we go 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:42.220
 from here from there we go sponge and cube dome 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.169
 button stiffness zero percent do 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.300
 this is someone size and and and and 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.850
 several dates we enter several 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.760
 offend and color changes and so here 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:56.650
 somewhat simple 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:59.620
 at your request, you can also 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.780
 lighten up some from the place like this 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.660
 like me 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.530
 so here now here if you originally 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:11.110
 holy ie then or 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:14.169
 now you can also darken it 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:23.290
 dimmer see and everything as you see 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:26.710
 drawing is ready here as you see yes after 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:30.310
 so if you want to make a background 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:36.520
 the drawing of the saint itself is not smeared on the form 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:42.220
 currently up 2 Here's the file but 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:44.560
 this one here and here okay so we go 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:48.760
 quick selection of the select 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.130
 Catsville and here so here antennae not 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.950
 it turns out that it is very small so 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:58.290
 kontrol ti come to this control 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:07:01.120
 web further we put like this in size and ok 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:07.260
 If you wish, you can round off the ends here. 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:07.260
 so that they do not interfere with this video 

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:18.569
 and all where you can further sign on 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:18.569
