00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 use two chords here in the first idea 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:11.849
 there minor with seventh and the seventh fact 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.610
 A major minor seventh from fifth to 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.250
 The fact that the fact is greater here gives even 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.609
 imagine a levada that is very 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.830
 used in an mpb style in several 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.710
 I'll even mention one as 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.630
 taken this example it consists of 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.720
 and work with low 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.949
 accord in which case the home is the fifth 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.570
 placed here 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.340
 then in the case the junction of the three 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.420
 index finger and income there 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.800
 doing this simultaneously pulled 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.670
 a few times and can pick the most part 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.610
 sharp 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.030
 the chord and sometimes the most serious part 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.879
 You're tempering the sound of it. 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.550
 will have a cell two cells equal 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.789
 only the second one is a little bit more 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.210
 slow 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.210
 like this 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:09.080
 then you would here a pull one 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:11.690
 down and placed in three low UOL 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.550
 then it will pull only a bit and 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.910
 then you will do that effect 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:21.620
 percussive that is the bath then she goes 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.330
 stay that way and then pull yourself 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:30.670
 again the rope only now a little 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:30.670
 slower and again in love with you 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:40.730
 together placed on the very placed map and 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.670
 muffles okay you can do it here and 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:52.700
 changing chords from the smaller 7 in fact 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:58.490
 say a measure for each 1 342 3 4 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:02.000
 I did not tell you about a song that would be 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.920
 example the song tears and rain already 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.800
 uses these two chords in the introduction 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.070
 in the first part of the song more or 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.070
 Less so, it's just two bars 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:23.220
 begins the first stanza this way 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:30.400
 tears and rain now the window glass 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:32.890
 but no one sees me right to get a 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.660
 little of the traditional one was playing the 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.629
 left a little more 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.730
 organized 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.690
 It's okay, I hope you enjoy it. 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.690
 until the next edition
