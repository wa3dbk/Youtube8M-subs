00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
my bookshelf also I've been thinking of

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.330

rereading<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.649> since<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.890> only<00:02:05.009> takes

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
rereading this and since it only takes

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.609 
rereading this and since it only takes
about<00:02:05.490> an<00:02:05.759> hour<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.180> read<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.990> might<00:02:07.409> do<00:02:07.590> that

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
about an hour to read it I might do that

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.650 
about an hour to read it I might do that
today<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.399> next<00:02:08.610> ones<00:02:08.789> were<00:02:08.910> also<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.509> a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
today the next ones were also in a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.380 
today the next ones were also in a
recent<00:02:10.140> book<00:02:10.379> haul<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
recent book haul and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.860 
recent book haul and
is<00:02:11.560> 1q84<00:02:12.560> I<00:02:13.490> really<00:02:13.730> like<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.150> blueness<00:02:14.569> and

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
is 1q84 I really like the blueness and

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.840

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
the moon pattern on this vine but what

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.460 
the moon pattern on this vine but what
makes<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.090> even<00:02:17.209> better<00:02:17.330> is<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:17.900> if<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.230> put

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
makes it even better is that if you put

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.440 
makes it even better is that if you put
these<00:02:18.800> together<00:02:19.069> in<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.580> right<00:02:19.700> order<00:02:19.910> they
