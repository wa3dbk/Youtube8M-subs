twelve<00:00:25.939> by<00:00:26.929> resolution<00:00:27.349> of<00:00:27.679> 300<00:00:28.279> that<00:00:28.759> allows

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
twelve by resolution of 300 that allows

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.980 
twelve by resolution of 300 that allows
for<00:00:29.269> great<00:00:31.750> size<00:00:32.750> two<00:00:34.420> eights<00:00:35.420> fives

for great size two eights fives
whichever<00:00:36.710> easy<00:00:37.700> to<00:00:37.790> go<00:00:37.880> down<00:00:38.090> it's<00:00:38.390> much

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
whichever easy to go down it's much

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.110 
whichever easy to go down it's much
harder<00:00:38.750> to<00:00:38.870> go<00:00:39.050> up<00:00:42.640> okay<00:00:43.640> there<00:00:43.820> we<00:00:43.910> go

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
harder to go up okay there we go

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.750 
harder to go up okay there we go
open<00:00:44.630> that<00:00:44.840> now<00:00:45.680> for<00:00:46.100> when<00:00:46.370> I<00:00:46.400> do<00:00:46.490> these<00:00:46.700> things

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
open that now for when I do these things

I<00:00:47.240> usually<00:00:47.540> like<00:00:47.990> to<00:00:48.020> have<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:49.130> grid<00:00:49.400> system

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
I usually like to have the grid system

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.270 
I usually like to have the grid system
it<00:00:50.150> just<00:00:50.180> makes<00:00:50.540> it<00:00:50.630> easier<00:00:50.930> for<00:00:50.960> me<00:00:51.350> anyway<00:00:51.710> to

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
it just makes it easier for me anyway to

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.570 
it just makes it easier for me anyway to
see<00:00:52.580> even<00:00:53.480> placements<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:54.800> I<00:00:54.890> do<00:00:54.950> that<00:00:55.370> by

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
see even placements and I do that by

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.020 
see even placements and I do that by
pressing<00:00:55.880> ctrl<00:00:56.750> +<00:00:57.050> H<00:01:00.070> I<00:01:01.070> leave<00:01:01.520> it<00:01:01.610> on<00:01:01.700> until<00:01:01.970> I

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
pressing ctrl + H I leave it on until I

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.049 
pressing ctrl + H I leave it on until I
get<00:01:02.150> the<00:01:02.270> framework<00:01:02.750> up<00:01:02.960> usually<00:01:04.059> alright

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
get the framework up usually alright

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.149

of 75 pixels you can play with that to

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.730 
of 75 pixels you can play with that to
see<00:01:32.030> what<00:01:32.539> works<00:01:32.719> better<00:01:33.020> for<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:33.350> how<00:01:33.530> much

is and then from there I'm actually
going<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.970> one<00:02:37.970> more<00:02:38.000> time<00:02:39.610> make<00:02:40.610> another

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
going to one more time make another

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.630 
going to one more time make another
layer<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.450> start<00:02:42.440> from<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.709> bottom<00:02:42.920> corner

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
layer and start from the bottom corner

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:56.350 
layer and start from the bottom corner
and<00:02:44.650> work<00:02:45.650> my<00:02:45.980> way<00:02:54.190> there<00:02:55.190> makes<00:02:55.610> it<00:02:55.820> about<00:02:56.180> the

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
and work my way there makes it about the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.300 
and work my way there makes it about the
same<00:02:56.570> size<00:02:56.810> is<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.290> one<00:02:57.470> up<00:02:57.620> there

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.949 

one<00:03:01.880> two<00:03:02.209> three<00:03:02.930> don't<00:03:03.800> write<00:03:04.010> over<00:03:04.220> there

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
one two three don't write over there

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.590 
one two three don't write over there
actually<00:03:05.959> there<00:03:06.709> we<00:03:06.830> go<00:03:07.010> that's<00:03:07.940> about<00:03:08.270> even

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
actually there we go that's about even

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.760 
actually there we go that's about even
all<00:03:09.350> right<00:03:10.780> all<00:03:11.780> right<00:03:12.020> now<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:12.319> I<00:03:12.380> got<00:03:12.530> the

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
all right all right now that I got the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.120 
all right all right now that I got the
frame<00:03:13.250> in<00:03:13.520> what<00:03:14.300> I'm<00:03:14.390> gonna<00:03:14.510> do<00:03:14.780> is<00:03:15.200> get<00:03:15.830> rid<00:03:16.069> of

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
frame in what I'm gonna do is get rid of

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.580 
frame in what I'm gonna do is get rid of
that<00:03:16.730> grid<00:03:17.569> system<00:03:18.020> because<00:03:18.200> now<00:03:18.350> it's<00:03:18.530> just

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
that grid system because now it's just

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.030 
that grid system because now it's just
distracting<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:19.819> ctrl<00:03:20.330> H<00:03:20.630> makes<00:03:21.319> it<00:03:21.500> disappear

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
distracting so ctrl H makes it disappear

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.440 
distracting so ctrl H makes it disappear
look<00:03:22.430> at<00:03:22.550> that<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.170> then<00:03:24.170> now<00:03:25.100> I<00:03:25.670> can<00:03:26.239> add
