hi<00:00:02.159> everyone<00:00:02.730> Cody<00:00:03.000> here<00:00:03.240> I<00:00:03.419> know<00:00:04.049> I'm<00:00:04.170> going

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
hi everyone Cody here I know I'm going

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.710 
hi everyone Cody here I know I'm going
to<00:00:04.350> be<00:00:04.440> suit<00:00:04.680> I<00:00:04.859> just<00:00:05.100> got<00:00:05.220> back<00:00:05.339> my<00:00:05.580> B's<00:00:05.759> but<00:00:06.690> I

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
to be suit I just got back my B's but I

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.059 
to be suit I just got back my B's but I
thought<00:00:06.930> I'd<00:00:07.109> make<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.410> stop<00:00:07.740> by<00:00:08.010> the

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
thought I'd make a stop by the

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.700 
thought I'd make a stop by the
greenhouse<00:00:08.960> see<00:00:09.960> how<00:00:10.050> everything<00:00:10.349> was<00:00:10.440> going

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
greenhouse see how everything was going

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.900 
greenhouse see how everything was going
down<00:00:10.860> here<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:13.130> switch<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.340> other<00:00:14.400> pump

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
down here I switch to the other pump

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.630 
down here I switch to the other pump
because<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:16.350> one<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:16.800> seemed<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.100> warp<00:00:17.340> of

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
because that one just seemed to warp of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.230 
because that one just seemed to warp of
worn<00:00:18.090> out<00:00:18.830> all<00:00:19.830> carrot<00:00:20.580> apart<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.060> put<00:00:21.210> it

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
worn out all carrot apart and put it

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.490 
worn out all carrot apart and put it
back<00:00:21.300> together<00:00:21.539> see<00:00:21.900> if<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.140> fix<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.439> later

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
back together see if I can fix it later

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.609 
back together see if I can fix it later
but<00:00:22.980> basically<00:00:23.760> I've<00:00:24.269> reached<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.869> nominal

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
but basically I've reached the nominal

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.019 
but basically I've reached the nominal
end<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.609> experiment<00:00:28.609> it's<00:00:29.609> coming<00:00:29.849> up<00:00:29.910> on

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
end of this experiment it's coming up on

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.999 
end of this experiment it's coming up on
the<00:00:30.119> end<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.390> season<00:00:30.750> now<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.679> starting

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
the end of the season now it's starting

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.470 
the end of the season now it's starting
to<00:00:32.070> frost<00:00:32.340> outside<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.910> know<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.420> a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
to frost outside I know it's in a

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.380 
to frost outside I know it's in a
greenhouse<00:00:33.870> but<00:00:37.250> yeah<00:00:38.250> really<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:39.000> don't<00:00:39.120> have

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
greenhouse but yeah really we don't have

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.940 
greenhouse but yeah really we don't have
the<00:00:39.510> screen<00:00:39.750> house<00:00:39.930> heated<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.590> does<00:00:40.800> get

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the screen house heated so it does get

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.440 
the screen house heated so it does get
cold<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.370> here<00:00:41.520> at<00:00:41.640> night<00:00:42.350> so<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:44.239> might<00:00:45.239> be

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
cold in here at night so we might be

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.420 
cold in here at night so we might be
tearing<00:00:46.050> some<00:00:46.230> stuff<00:00:46.500> out<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.890> planting<00:00:47.340> our

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
tearing some stuff out and planting our

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.930 
tearing some stuff out and planting our
way<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.610> winter<00:00:47.820> crops<00:00:48.180> soon<00:00:49.100> so<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.579> may<00:00:50.910> be

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
way to winter crops soon so this may be

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.010 
way to winter crops soon so this may be
the<00:00:51.120> last<00:00:51.920> last<00:00:52.920> update<00:00:53.250> a--make<00:00:54.020> there's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the last last update a--make there's

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.350

I<00:01:33.659> mean<00:01:34.650> Thievery<00:01:35.130> Tomatoes<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.420> about

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.770 
I mean Thievery Tomatoes have just about
reached<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.020> top<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.470> greenhouse<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.780> may

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
reached the top of the greenhouse I may

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.200 
reached the top of the greenhouse I may
go<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.409> cut<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.979> tops<00:01:41.189> off<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.460> them<00:01:41.729> let

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
go in and cut the tops off of them let

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.859 
go in and cut the tops off of them let
all<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.420> fruit<00:01:42.630> ripen<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.850> then<00:01:45.270> once<00:01:45.810> that

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
all the fruit ripen and then once that

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.719 
all the fruit ripen and then once that
happens<00:01:45.990> I'll<00:01:46.439> go<00:01:46.560> ahead<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.979> rip<00:01:47.460> everything

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
happens I'll go ahead and rip everything

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.260 
happens I'll go ahead and rip everything
out<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:49.340> may<00:01:50.340> make<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> video<00:01:50.880> then<00:01:51.090> I'm<00:01:51.360> not<00:01:51.570> sure

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
out I may make a video then I'm not sure

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.510 
out I may make a video then I'm not sure
but<00:01:54.270> yeah<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.780> think<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.770> experiment<00:01:56.070> was<00:01:56.399> all

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
but yeah I think this experiment was all

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.510 
but yeah I think this experiment was all
like<00:01:56.640> success<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.390> mean<00:01:58.320> all<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.280> was

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
like success I mean all of this was

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.600 
like success I mean all of this was
grown<00:01:59.700> without<00:01:59.850> dirt<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:01.280> it<00:02:02.280> was<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.460> great

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
grown without dirt and it was a great

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.840 
grown without dirt and it was a great
way<00:02:02.850> for<00:02:02.880> me<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.210> see<00:02:03.479> what<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.840> would<00:02:03.960> take<00:02:04.259> and

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
way for me to see what it would take and

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.479 
way for me to see what it would take and
perhaps<00:02:05.850> next<00:02:06.180> year<00:02:06.329> I'll<00:02:07.009> go<00:02:08.009> bigger<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
perhaps next year I'll go bigger and

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.979 
perhaps next year I'll go bigger and
I'll<00:02:09.179> definitely<00:02:09.479> not<00:02:09.599> do<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:09.929> here

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
I'll definitely not do it in here

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.390 
I'll definitely not do it in here
I<00:02:11.019> was<00:02:11.349> planning<00:02:11.530> on<00:02:11.739> doing<00:02:11.769> it<00:02:12.010> down<00:02:12.159> there

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
I was planning on doing it down there

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.890 
I was planning on doing it down there
something<00:02:13.560> maybe<00:02:14.560> on<00:02:14.799> this<00:02:14.920> side<00:02:15.129> Hill<00:02:15.400> here

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
something maybe on this side Hill here

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.770 
something maybe on this side Hill here
just<00:02:16.900> putting<00:02:17.200> rows<00:02:17.409> and<00:02:17.709> rows<00:02:17.739> of<00:02:17.890> buckets

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
just putting rows and rows of buckets
