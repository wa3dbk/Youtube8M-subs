articulation but they kind of have this
nice<00:00:23.150> accommodating<00:00:24.150> gooey<00:00:24.779> mid-range<00:00:25.380> as

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
nice accommodating gooey mid-range as

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.380 
nice accommodating gooey mid-range as
well<00:00:25.800> now<00:00:26.490> from<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> quilter<00:00:27.029> I'll<00:00:27.119> walk<00:00:27.269> you

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
well now from the quilter I'll walk you

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.179 
well now from the quilter I'll walk you
through<00:00:27.449> how<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.810> would<00:00:27.990> get<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
through how you would get to that the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.160 
through how you would get to that the
first<00:00:29.400> thing<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.670> would<00:00:29.849> do<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.300> would<00:00:30.480> add<00:00:30.840> a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
first thing I would do is I would add a

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.380 
first thing I would do is I would add a
little<00:00:31.590> bit<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.740> treble<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.759> would<00:00:32.910> add<00:00:33.120> a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
little bit of treble and I would add a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.330 
little bit of treble and I would add a
little<00:00:33.630> bit<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.840> bass<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.770> reason<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.190> do

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
little bit of bass and the reason we do

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.700 
little bit of bass and the reason we do
there<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> treble<00:00:36.390> gives<00:00:36.630> us<00:00:36.809> it

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
there is because the treble gives us it

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.010 
there is because the treble gives us it
gives<00:00:37.950> us<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.219> sparkly<00:00:38.760> articulate<00:00:39.510> top<00:00:39.719> end

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
gives us a sparkly articulate top end

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.619 
gives us a sparkly articulate top end
and<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:41.010> bass<00:00:41.250> gives<00:00:42.000> us<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.210> little<00:00:42.329> bit<00:00:42.420> more

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
and the bass gives us a little bit more

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.869 
and the bass gives us a little bit more
body<00:00:42.840> right<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> little<00:00:43.800> bit<00:00:43.920> more<00:00:44.010> low-end

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
body right a little bit more low-end

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.400 
body right a little bit more low-end
punch<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.690> some<00:00:45.840> warmth

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
punch and some warmth

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.680 
punch and some warmth
what<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.100> also<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:50.690> roll

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
what I also like to do is I like to roll

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.330 
what I also like to do is I like to roll
up<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.020> limiter<00:00:52.469> table<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> limiter

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
up that limiter table and the limiter

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.979 
up that limiter table and the limiter
knob<00:00:53.489> kind<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.879> acts<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.329> compressor

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
knob kind of acts as a compressor

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.319 
knob kind of acts as a compressor
limiter<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:56.070> makes<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.430> squish<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> little

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
limiter and it makes a squish a little

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.790 
limiter and it makes a squish a little
bit<00:00:57.510> now<00:00:58.109> something<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.559> characterizes

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
bit now something that characterizes

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.099 
bit now something that characterizes
these<00:00:59.340> old<00:00:59.579> tweet<00:00:59.969> amps<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:00.809> they

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
these old tweet amps is that they they

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.319 
these old tweet amps is that they they
naturally<00:01:01.710> compressed<00:01:02.309> whenever<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.120> dig

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
naturally compressed whenever you dig

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.820 
naturally compressed whenever you dig
into<00:01:03.570> them<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.320> little<00:01:04.439> bit<00:01:04.650> more

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
into them it's a little bit more

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.380 
into them it's a little bit more
forgiving<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> amp<00:01:05.700> sounds<00:01:06.060> kind<00:01:06.299> of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
forgiving and the amp sounds kind of

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.630 
forgiving and the amp sounds kind of
squishy<00:01:07.140> right<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> warm<00:01:08.430> blanket

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
squishy right it's like a warm blanket

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.800 
squishy right it's like a warm blanket
but<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.420> good<00:01:09.570> way

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
but in a good way

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.570 
but in a good way
I<00:01:09.990> know<00:01:10.320> normally<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.860> wouldn't<00:01:11.010> say<00:01:11.220> blanket

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
I know normally we wouldn't say blanket

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.859 
I know normally we wouldn't say blanket
with<00:01:11.670> an<00:01:11.760> amplifier<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.689> particular

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
with an amplifier but in this particular

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.440 
with an amplifier but in this particular
case<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.799> good<00:01:13.979> thing<00:01:14.189> also<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.270> mode

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
case it's a good thing also for the mode

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.810 
case it's a good thing also for the mode
setting<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.020> want<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.409> go<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> tweed<00:01:17.100> all<00:01:17.640> right

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
setting I want to go to tweed all right

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.350 
setting I want to go to tweed all right
now<00:01:18.770> based<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:20.009> how<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.250> have<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> limiter<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
now based on how we have the limiter the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.289 
now based on how we have the limiter the
treble<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.990> bass<00:01:22.439> set<00:01:22.860> up<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.310> also<00:01:23.970> want<00:01:24.270> to

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
treble the bass set up I also want to

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.620 
treble the bass set up I also want to
add<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.810> little<00:01:25.140> bit<00:01:25.320> more<00:01:25.350> reverb<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
add a little bit more reverb and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.630 
add a little bit more reverb and
increase<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.869> dwell<00:01:28.140> knob<00:01:28.409> all<00:01:29.159> right<00:01:29.369> so

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
increase the dwell knob all right so

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.640 
increase the dwell knob all right so
that's<00:01:29.790> how<00:01:30.509> much<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.869> reverb<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.290> mixed

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
that's how much of the reverb is mixed

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.100 
that's how much of the reverb is mixed
in<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.040> how<00:01:32.220> long<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.729> lasts<00:01:33.090> now<00:01:33.509> sound<00:01:33.900> like

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
in and how long it lasts now sound like

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.010 
in and how long it lasts now sound like
this<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.650> really<00:01:35.100> great<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.570> neck<00:01:36.810> pickup

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
this is really great on the neck pickup

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.960 
this is really great on the neck pickup
with<00:01:37.799> something<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> little<00:01:38.700> bit<00:01:38.820> more

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
with something that is a little bit more

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.080 
with something that is a little bit more
of<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.180> fingerstyle<00:01:39.630> kind<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.290> thing<00:01:40.500> right

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
of a fingerstyle kind of thing right

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.940 
of a fingerstyle kind of thing right
just<00:01:42.090> because<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.509> has<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.869> old<00:01:43.170> warmth<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
just because it has that old warmth and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.130 
just because it has that old warmth and
with<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> limiter<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.060> compressor<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.990> can

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
with a limiter and compressor you can

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.870 
with a limiter and compressor you can
play<00:01:46.350> with<00:01:46.500> your<00:01:46.590> fingers<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.340> everything
