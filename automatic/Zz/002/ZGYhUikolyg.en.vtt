00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.100
 Symbolically, we now have our car 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.590
 built that has a passenger seat 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.939
 driver's seat or david on it sits here 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.810
 Can you get the shift stick 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.420
 imagine 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.820
 so this is not a seat so too 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.160
 no seat exactly in the middle of 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.790
 our two front speakers that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.170
 means you have one now 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.309
 front speaker right below 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.960
 front left speaker and that is why 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.210
 also david on the left side and 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.390
 not in the middle of this happen in the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.010
 Erzhaher the theresa that turns 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.640
 times directly to this loudspeaker the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.789
 Sabi is just the same and when I tell her 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.469
 going then you walk on the David to with 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.879
 the same step as you have practiced 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.410
 so that really the sound in 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.320
 theoretically to luck with the same 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.809
 speed on david and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.869
 the one of the first practical david 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.330
 reaches his ear in the moment remains 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.470
 the other just stand on the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.470
 get ready 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.820
 Aha 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.009
 the driver side has a shorter one 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.750
 off to the side as the passenger side 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.960
 because of course it is further away 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.740
 that is what happens the sound of the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.890
 driver's side 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.100
 yes, it's first on David's ear and first 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.860
 after another milliseconds is the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.250
 sound from the passenger side on at davids 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.229
 ear that means that's now 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.610
 we have exactly the point what I 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.869
 I do not really like it 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.670
 actually would like between the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.290
 Speakers sit and feel 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.659
 have my right and my left are 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.970
 just far away what we have to do it 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.880
 just gives the theme runtime correction 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.740
 We will correct the term both 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.969
 give people here and now 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.969
 back to the starting point 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.570
 and off 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.930
 we have we have the theresa shortly 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.000
 held back so she did not 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.920
 can start but and then only 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.670
 so we can continue to walk 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.590
 then the driver the driver side shortly 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.910
 we have corrected from the term 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.710
 they just started running later 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.910
 let and let that sound 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.840
 Processors when going from runtime 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.090
 to talk about correction 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.520
 per speaker just the delay 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.260
 Enter and then they both come too 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.270
 at the same time on the ear 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.670
 and then that sounds to me like 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.470
 if I am here on the stick 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.870
 sits and exactly in the middle of the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.640
 speakers seats and the music 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.560
 can enjoy a stage directly 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.260
 Right and left right away from me 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.260
 That was the theme of the runtime correction
