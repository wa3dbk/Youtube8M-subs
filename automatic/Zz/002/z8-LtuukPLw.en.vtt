00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.333
- YESTERDAY I SHOWED YOU
A VIDEO OF A GUY

00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.966
WHO RECORDS CONVERSATIONS
BETWEEN HIS MOM AND HIS AUNT,

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.766
AND THEN HE ACTS THEM OUT
WITH HIS FRIEND,

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.466
USING THEIR ORIGINAL AUDIO.

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.733
TAKE A LOOK.

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.633
- THIS IS REALLY PRETTY.
WHAT IN THE HECK IS THIS?

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:14.400
- THIS IS PROBABLY ONE
THAT YOU GAVE ME.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.300
- OH, MARG,
I NEVER HAD THIS ONE.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.700
- I DON'T KNOW.
TAKE SOME.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.866
- I LOVE HOW TIGHT THEY ARE.
DID YOU--DID YOU PRUNE THEM?

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.066
- I PRUNE EVERYTHING.

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.033
- AND I WOULD SING
IN GYM CLASS,

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:29.633
AND MY--I HAD A FRIEND
WHO COULD PLAY BY EAR.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:31.866
SHE GOES,
"HARVA, YOU JUST CHANGED KEYS."

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.266
- [laughs]

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.200
- THEN I--AND THEN I'D SING,
LIKE, TEN MORE NOTES,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.000
AND SHE'D SAY,
"YOU JUST CHANGED KEYS AGAIN."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.200
- OH, WOW.
- AND THEN--

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.933
I MEAN, THIS WHOLE SONG
I'M SINGING,

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:43.166
SHE'S SAYING HOW MANY TIMES
I CHANGED KEYS.

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.766
BUT MY VOICE
HAD A NICE SOUND TO IT.

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.100
- I COULD GUESS--
- AFFAIRS AND--

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.266
- I CAN GUESS
WHO'S GONNA GET FIRST PLACE.

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.500
- OH, YEAH?
WHAT--WHO?

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.133
- "TRUE DETECTIVES."
- OH, YEAH, I DON'T WATCH THAT.

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.566
WE DON'T GET GOOD TV.
- HBO.

00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:58.566
- WE DON'T GET HBO.

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:01.100
- [gasps]

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.500
- PLEASE WELCOME
MITCH AND NIK

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.700
AND NICK'S AUNT HARVA
AND HIS MOM MARGO.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.000
DID YOU REALIZE
HOW FUNNY YOU WERE

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
BEFORE THIS HAPPENED?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.766
- CAN I THANK YOU?
- YES.

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.566
- BECAUSE THIS IS
CRAZY TIMING.

00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.666
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO,
I WAS REWATCHING YOUR DVD

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.766
"HERE AND NOW,"
CRYING LAUGHING,

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:18.300
AND, LIKE, WHEN WE STARTED THIS
FOUR YEARS AGO,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.066
I SENT MESSAGES TO ALL
OF OUR FRIENDS SAYING,

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.000
LIKE, "MAYBE IF YOU GUYS
SHARE OUR VIDEOS ENOUGH,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.100
"ELLEN WILL SEE THEM,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.333
AND WE'LL GET TO BE
ON HER SHOW."

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:25.933
AND THIS WAS, LIKE,
WHEN WE WERE NOTHING.

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.733
AND SO THE FACT
THAT YOU CHASED US DOWN

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.700
IS, LIKE, JUST CRAZY.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.700
SO THANK YOU.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.600
- THANK YOU.
- YES, THANK YOU.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.400
- THANKS--I'M HONORED
THAT YOU LIKE MY COMEDY.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.533
- LOVE IT.

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.166
- THAT MY OLD STAND-UP
IS STILL RELEVANT.

00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:39.566
- [chuckles]

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:42.333
- OKAY, SO IT'S ONE THING
TO HEAR THE CONVERSATION,

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.933
BUT THEN TO CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND IMAGINE IT

00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:45.800
IN ANOTHER CONTEXT
WITH YOU DOING IT

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.866
IS PRETTY GREAT.

00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:47.866
AND YOU DIDN'T REALIZE

00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:49.733
ANYTHING YOU WERE SAYING
WAS FUNNY.

00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:50.966
- NO.
- EXACTLY.

00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:53.500
- YEAH, WE THINK
WE'RE REAL NORMAL.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.933
both: AND WE STILL
DON'T GET IT.

00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:57.066
- RIGHT.

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.733
YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S FUNNY
WHEN THEY DO IT, RIGHT?

00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:01.400
- OH, ABSOLUTELY.
- YEAH.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.833
THEY'RE--IT'S NOTHING REALLY
FUNNY ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS.

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:05.633
THEY'RE JUST KIND
OF REGULAR CONVERSATIONS.

00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:07.200
[laughter]

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.466
- NO, I APPRECIATE THAT.

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:10.433
- YEAH, THEY'RE NOT WEIRD
OR ANYTHING.

00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:11.733
- THANK YOU.

00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:13.566
- YEAH, THEY'RE PRETTY
NORMAL CONVERSATIONS.

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.366
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT YOU REALLY ESPECIALLY

00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:16.766
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE MOST?

00:02:16.766 --> 00:02:20.800
- MARGO AND I LOVE TO TALK
ABOUT TV SHOWS AND MOVIES,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.466
BUT WE LOVE USA PROGRAMS
AND ALL THE RERUNS OF "NCIS,"

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:29.100
BECAUSE WE LOVE MARK HARMON.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.733
- UH-HUH.
EVERYONE DOES.

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.300
- ESPECIALLY BECAUSE
HE'S BEEN MARRIED

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.333
TO THE SAME PERSON
FOR 25 YEARS,

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:35.833
WHICH IS A RARITY.

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:37.266
- IT IS.
IT IS.

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:38.266
- YES.

00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:39.833
[applause]

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:41.033
- THAT'S A BIG DEAL.

00:02:41.033 --> 00:02:42.766
- AND I HAVE EVEN PAINTED
A PORTRAIT OF HIM

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:43.933
IN MY ART CLASS.

00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:46.166
- HAVE YOU?
- YES.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.733
- DOES HE KNOW THAT?
- NO.

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.000
- HE DOES NOW.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.166
[laughter]

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:51.400
- MAYBE WE TRY TO GET IT
TO HIM.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.933
MAYBE--
- WELL, THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:54.133
- WE CAN PRESENT IT
TO HIM.

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:55.866
- HALF OF HIM
WAS WHEN HE WAS REAL YOUNG,

00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:59.200
AND THEN HALF OF HIM
IS HOW HE IS IN "NCIS."

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.266
[laughter]

00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:05.333
- THAT SOUNDS
REAL FLATTERING.

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:06.500
- YEAH, IT WAS.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.133
- IT'S GREAT TO SHOW PEOPLE--

00:03:09.133 --> 00:03:11.200
NOT THE TRANSITION,
BUT HOW AGE--

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.633
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:15.466
OH, WONDERFUL.

00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:18.066
AND HOW DO YOU RECORD THEM?
HOW IS THAT--

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:20.400
- SO, YEAH, IT ALL STARTED
WITH US KIND OF--

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.700
MY COUSIN AND I WERE HANGING OUT
AT SOME FAMILY GATHERINGS,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.900
AND WE JUST STARTED KIND
OF EAVESDROPPING

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.000
ON THEIR CONVERSATIONS,
AND I DON'T KNOW.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.200
WE JUST STARTED DYING IN
THE CORNER LAUGHING EVERY TIME.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.600
THIS HAPPENED
TIME AND TIME AGAIN,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.933
AND FINALLY, I JUST ASKED THEM,
"CAN I RECORD YOU GUYS, PLEASE?"

00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:36.533
SO I JUST STRAPPED A COUPLE
SMART PHONES AROUND THEIR NECKS,

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:38.966
HIT RECORD, AND SAID,
"GO FOR IT."

00:03:38.966 --> 00:03:40.400
AFTER A MINUTE,
THEY TOTALLY FORGOT

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.733
WE WERE EVEN RECORDING,

00:03:41.733 --> 00:03:43.866
AND THEY TALKED ABOUT
JUST EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN:

00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:46.366
MOVIES, GARDENING,
YOU KNOW, TV SHOWS.

00:03:46.366 --> 00:03:48.700
AND SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY,

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.666
THEY JUST WERE ABLE
TO STAY THEMSELVES.

00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:53.166
- IT'S GREAT.

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:56.133
AND WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT IT IS
THE PLACES YOU PUT YOURSELF,

00:03:56.133 --> 00:03:59.300
LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE CAMERA
THAT WAS INSIDE THE DRYER,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.900
THE WASHER, OR WHATEVER,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.533
AND TYING YOUR SHOES,
TALKING ABOUT IT.

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:04.933
IT REALLY ADDS TO IT,
BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO SUBTLE.

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:06.366
IT'S REALLY,
REALLY GREAT.

00:04:06.366 --> 00:04:08.300
WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU GIFTS

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.333
SO THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE
TO DO THIS.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.900
FIRST OF ALL,
WE'RE GIVING YOU NEW IPHONES,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.900
AND YOU CAN HANG--

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.000
- [laughs]

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.933
[cheers and applause]

00:04:18.933 --> 00:04:21.833
- I LOVE IT!
THANK YOU.

00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:23.733
MARGO.

00:04:23.733 --> 00:04:25.366
- BUT WE--
REALLY, I MEAN IT.

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:27.800
I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO BE
A PART OF THE SHOW IN SOME WAY

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.100
AND DO THINGS WITH YOU.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.266
I THINK YOU'RE BOTH SO TALENTED
AND SO FUNNY.

00:04:31.266 --> 00:04:32.933
SO LET'S TALK
ABOUT THIS.

00:04:32.933 --> 00:04:35.266
AND THEN THE TWO OF YOU--
I KNOW RETIRED NURSE,

00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:36.433
RETIRED TEACHER.

00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:38.100
YOU DON'T GET A LOT
OF VACATION TIME.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.866
YOU DON'T GET TO GO--
MAKE SURE YOU WEAR THESE

00:04:39.866 --> 00:04:41.133
WHEN YOU'RE GOING HERE.

00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:42.800
WE'RE GONNA SEND YOU
ON A SEVEN-NIGHT TRIP

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.800
TO MODERN HONOLULU.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.866
YOU'RE GONNA GO
TO HAWAII.

00:04:45.866 --> 00:04:48.600
- OH, MY GOD.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.866
- HAVE AMAZING MEALS,
RELAX AT THE SPA.
