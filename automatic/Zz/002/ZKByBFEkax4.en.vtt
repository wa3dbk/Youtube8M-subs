00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
do have black widely available with no

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.910 
do have black widely available with no
one<00:01:48.700> sells<00:01:49.000> blue<00:01:49.240> since<00:01:50.200> I've<00:01:50.350> got<00:01:50.679> to<00:01:50.770> buy<00:01:50.860> the

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
one sells blue since I've got to buy the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.350 
one sells blue since I've got to buy the
blue<00:01:51.159> like<00:01:51.369> this<00:01:51.520> then<00:01:51.850> I'm<00:01:51.970> going<00:01:52.119> to<00:01:52.179> get<00:01:52.270> the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
blue like this then I'm going to get the

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.180 
blue like this then I'm going to get the
grab<00:01:52.539> it<00:01:52.689> matches<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.350> exact<00:01:53.799> same<00:01:54.009> shape

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.499 

another<00:02:00.190> rockford<00:02:00.549> fosgate<00:02:00.670> power<00:02:01.149> series

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
another rockford fosgate power series

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.109 
another rockford fosgate power series
amplifier<00:02:01.929> now<00:02:02.560> currently<00:02:03.009> I've<00:02:03.190> got<00:02:03.399> a<00:02:03.429> t800

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
amplifier now currently I've got a t800

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.980 
amplifier now currently I've got a t800
point<00:02:04.840> for<00:02:05.020> so<00:02:05.770> that's<00:02:06.149> 800<00:02:07.149> rms<00:02:07.450> for<00:02:07.659> channel

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
point for so that's 800 rms for channel

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.940 
point for so that's 800 rms for channel
so<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.739> puts<00:02:08.950> out<00:02:09.239> 200<00:02:10.239> watts<00:02:10.450> I<00:02:10.750> think<00:02:11.200> at<00:02:11.380> 20

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
so it puts out 200 watts I think at 20

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.000 
so it puts out 200 watts I think at 20
and<00:02:12.430> 1<00:02:12.640> ohm<00:02:12.790> per<00:02:13.150> channel<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.630> 150<00:02:14.590> or<00:02:14.680> 4<00:02:14.860> ohm

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
and 1 ohm per channel and 150 or 4 ohm

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.039 
and 1 ohm per channel and 150 or 4 ohm
per<00:02:15.190> channel<00:02:15.430> now<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.420> guy<00:02:16.569> I've<00:02:16.720> just<00:02:16.870> got

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
per channel now this guy I've just got

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.180 
per channel now this guy I've just got
here<00:02:17.290> is<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.799> t600<00:02:18.489> point2<00:02:19.799> alright<00:02:20.799> so<00:02:20.980> what

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
here is a t600 point2 alright so what

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.860 
here is a t600 point2 alright so what
the<00:02:21.310> t600<00:02:22.000> point<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.269> is<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:22.540> think<00:02:22.690> this<00:02:22.750> is

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
the t600 point to is I think this is

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.870 
the t600 point to is I think this is
also<00:02:23.019> as<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.200> black<00:02:23.380> box<00:02:23.410> addition<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.760> other

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
also as a black box addition the other

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.370 
also as a black box addition the other
ones<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.150> red<00:02:25.330> box<00:02:25.510> but<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.870> don't<00:02:26.140> think<00:02:26.230> that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
ones a red box but I don't think that

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.930 
ones a red box but I don't think that
makes<00:02:26.560> any<00:02:26.799> difference<00:02:27.510> ok<00:02:28.510> so<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.140> t600<00:02:30.090> is

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
makes any difference ok so the t600 is

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.069 
makes any difference ok so the t600 is
300<00:02:33.940> rms<00:02:34.299> x<00:02:35.019> 2<00:02:35.290> at<00:02:35.640> at<00:02:36.640> 21<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.780> think<00:02:37.959> it's

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
300 rms x 2 at at 21 and I think it's

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.789 
300 rms x 2 at at 21 and I think it's
200<00:02:38.680> x<00:02:39.370> 2<00:02:39.609> at<00:02:39.850> forum<00:02:40.630> actually<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.560> think<00:02:41.590> it

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
200 x 2 at forum actually I think it

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.080 
200 x 2 at forum actually I think it
says<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.070> on<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.190> box<00:02:42.630> there<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:43.720> go<00:02:43.810> yet<00:02:44.049> 200

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
says it on the box there you go yet 200

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.699 
says it on the box there you go yet 200
times<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.299> a<00:02:46.329> forum<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:46.989> is<00:02:47.109> also<00:02:47.290> 1<00:02:47.590> ohm

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
times to a forum and it is also 1 ohm

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.340

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
planning on doing is this will run some

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.590 
planning on doing is this will run some
bigger<00:02:58.299> meds<00:02:59.430> to<00:03:00.430> probably<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:01.030> bigger<00:03:01.329> meds

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
bigger meds to probably to bigger meds

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.059 
bigger meds to probably to bigger meds
maybe<00:03:01.840> eight<00:03:02.079> to<00:03:02.109> 10<00:03:02.470> s<00:03:02.620> or<00:03:02.709> something<00:03:02.980> like

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
maybe eight to 10 s or something like

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.580 
maybe eight to 10 s or something like
that<00:03:03.130> /<00:03:03.459> door<00:03:03.700> in<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.269> front<00:03:04.420> doors<00:03:04.660> so<00:03:05.440> this

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
that / door in the front doors so this

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.460 
that / door in the front doors so this
will<00:03:05.739> run<00:03:05.829> four<00:03:06.160> mins<00:03:06.430> at<00:03:06.640> 20<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:08.230> they'll<00:03:08.380> have

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
will run four mins at 20 so they'll have

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.949 
will run four mins at 20 so they'll have
150<00:03:09.040> hours<00:03:09.310> each<00:03:09.459> then<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.299> one<00:03:10.450> I've<00:03:10.569> got<00:03:10.720> now

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
150 hours each then the one I've got now

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.470 
150 hours each then the one I've got now
will<00:03:11.319> run<00:03:11.590> two<00:03:12.010> smaller<00:03:12.400> meds<00:03:12.670> on<00:03:12.880> two<00:03:13.329> of<00:03:13.359> the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
will run two smaller meds on two of the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.680 
will run two smaller meds on two of the
channels<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.230> for<00:03:14.530> mids<00:03:14.799> total<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:16.510> they'll

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
channels so for mids total so they'll

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.420 
channels so for mids total so they'll
have<00:03:16.810> about<00:03:17.130> 75<00:03:18.660> oh<00:03:19.660> add<00:03:20.440> 2<00:03:20.620> i'm<00:03:20.769> sorry<00:03:21.040> so<00:03:21.280> that

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
have about 75 oh add 2 i'm sorry so that

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.860 
have about 75 oh add 2 i'm sorry so that
would<00:03:21.549> be<00:03:21.579> a<00:03:21.700> hundred<00:03:21.970> watts<00:03:22.209> rms<00:03:22.540> each<00:03:22.690> and

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
would be a hundred watts rms each and

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.479 
would be a hundred watts rms each and
then<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.530> other<00:03:23.650> two<00:03:23.739> channels<00:03:24.190> on<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.340> four

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
then the other two channels on the four

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:25.800 
then the other two channels on the four
channel<00:03:24.760> that<00:03:24.850> I've<00:03:24.940> got<00:03:25.120> will<00:03:25.269> run<00:03:25.389> tweeters

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
channel that I've got will run tweeters

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.270 
channel that I've got will run tweeters
some<00:03:26.200> super<00:03:26.470> tweeters<00:03:26.769> or<00:03:26.920> something<00:03:27.190> like

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
some super tweeters or something like

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.470 
some super tweeters or something like
that<00:03:27.370> so<00:03:28.530> now<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.650> reason<00:03:29.799> I<00:03:29.920> bought<00:03:30.040> this<00:03:30.100> now

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
that so now the reason I bought this now

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.400 
that so now the reason I bought this now
even<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:31.540> won't<00:03:31.720> need<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:31.900> for<00:03:32.079> maybe<00:03:32.200> another

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
even I won't need it for maybe another

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.620 
even I won't need it for maybe another
45<00:03:32.949> months<00:03:33.100> is<00:03:33.579> because<00:03:33.970> if<00:03:34.120> you<00:03:34.209> notice<00:03:34.510> the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
45 months is because if you notice the

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.140 
45 months is because if you notice the
rockford<00:03:34.900> fosgate<00:03:35.019> upgraded<00:03:35.949> the<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.790> models

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
rockford fosgate upgraded the the models

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.820 
rockford fosgate upgraded the the models
of<00:03:37.479> the

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
of the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.890

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
prime and punt series amps but they

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.020 
prime and punt series amps but they
didn't<00:03:40.260> upgrade<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.710> power<00:03:40.890> this<00:03:41.160> year<00:03:41.400> so

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
didn't upgrade the power this year so

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.370 
didn't upgrade the power this year so
I'm<00:03:42.090> kind<00:03:42.330> of<00:03:42.420> expecting<00:03:42.840> him<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:42.960> do<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.260> next

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
I'm kind of expecting him to do it next

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.960 
I'm kind of expecting him to do it next
year<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:44.100> I'd<00:03:44.250> like<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.430> have<00:03:44.610> my<00:03:44.730> amps

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
year and I'd like to have my amps

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.910 
year and I'd like to have my amps
matching<00:03:45.390> so<00:03:45.690> I<00:03:45.720> wouldn't<00:03:46.050> want<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.230> wait<00:03:46.440> miss

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
matching so I wouldn't want to wait miss

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.680 
matching so I wouldn't want to wait miss
out<00:03:47.070> and<00:03:47.280> not<00:03:47.370> be<00:03:47.460> able<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:47.730> buy<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:47.940> the

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
out and not be able to buy the the

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.390 
out and not be able to buy the the
current<00:03:49.110> look<00:03:49.290> because<00:03:49.890> if<00:03:50.040> they<00:03:50.130> bring<00:03:50.310> out

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
current look because if they bring out

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.560 
current look because if they bring out
the<00:03:50.490> new<00:03:50.610> one<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.820> looks<00:03:50.940> different<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.360> want

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
the new one it looks different I want

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.680 
the new one it looks different I want
matching<00:03:51.870> m's<00:03:53.810> cool<00:03:56.030> so<00:03:57.030> let's<00:03:57.330> see<00:03:57.510> how<00:03:57.540> much

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
matching m's cool so let's see how much

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.770 
matching m's cool so let's see how much
power<00:03:57.900> she<00:03:58.140> actually<00:03:58.290> puts<00:03:58.650> out<00:03:58.800> damn<00:03:59.780> alright

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
power she actually puts out damn alright

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.640 
power she actually puts out damn alright
so<00:04:01.080> 223<00:04:01.830> at<00:04:01.890> 4<00:04:02.130> ohms<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.600> 350<00:04:03.600> x<00:04:03.840> 2<00:04:04.110> or<00:04:04.260> 2<00:04:04.410> ohms

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
so 223 at 4 ohms and 350 x 2 or 2 ohms

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.090 
so 223 at 4 ohms and 350 x 2 or 2 ohms
so<00:04:04.920> it's<00:04:05.820> doing<00:04:06.180> another<00:04:06.660> almost<00:04:07.620> twenty

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
so it's doing another almost twenty

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.210 
so it's doing another almost twenty
percent<00:04:08.420> 2<00:04:09.420> ohms<00:04:09.630> of<00:04:09.930> what<00:04:10.110> it's<00:04:10.230> rated<00:04:10.530> at<00:04:10.680> so

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
percent 2 ohms of what it's rated at so

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.400 
percent 2 ohms of what it's rated at so
that's<00:04:11.400> really<00:04:11.700> good<00:04:12.000> actually<00:04:12.180> I<00:04:12.630> had<00:04:13.140> sent<00:04:13.380> a

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
that's really good actually I had sent a

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.440 
that's really good actually I had sent a
few<00:04:13.530> other<00:04:13.680> birthdays<00:04:13.890> are<00:04:14.250> under<00:04:14.610> just<00:04:15.240> under

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
few other birthdays are under just under

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.690 
few other birthdays are under just under
700<00:04:15.959> so<00:04:16.080> that's<00:04:16.230> not<00:04:16.440> bad<00:04:16.650> Rockford<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.549> get

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
700 so that's not bad Rockford you get

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.570 
700 so that's not bad Rockford you get
the<00:04:17.820> nice<00:04:17.940> foam<00:04:18.630> packaging<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:20.250> then<00:04:20.370> we<00:04:20.430> have

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
the nice foam packaging and then we have

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.090 
the nice foam packaging and then we have
a<00:04:20.609> hand<00:04:20.910> with<00:04:21.269> just<00:04:21.510> kind<00:04:21.720> of<00:04:21.750> plastic<00:04:22.710> seal

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
a hand with just kind of plastic seal

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.900 
a hand with just kind of plastic seal
keeps<00:04:23.970> all<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.270> dust<00:04:24.450> out<00:04:24.630> of<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.980> nice<00:04:25.980> so

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
keeps all the dust out of it nice so

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.700 
keeps all the dust out of it nice so
another<00:04:27.120> power<00:04:27.360> series<00:04:27.780> I<00:04:27.960> like<00:04:28.230> the<00:04:28.380> look<00:04:28.590> of

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
another power series I like the look of

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.040 
another power series I like the look of
these<00:04:28.860> ones<00:04:29.330> not<00:04:30.330> saying<00:04:30.570> that<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.780> new<00:04:30.930> one

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
these ones not saying that the new one

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.270 
these ones not saying that the new one
might<00:04:31.290> be<00:04:31.320> I<00:04:31.500> haven't<00:04:31.830> seen<00:04:31.950> the<00:04:32.040> new<00:04:32.160> one

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
might be I haven't seen the new one

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.280 
might be I haven't seen the new one
because<00:04:32.400> it<00:04:32.580> doesn't<00:04:32.820> exist<00:04:32.880> yet<00:04:33.180> you<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.020> might

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
because it doesn't exist yet you I might

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.050 
because it doesn't exist yet you I might
look<00:04:34.410> better<00:04:34.560> but<00:04:35.280> I'd<00:04:35.490> rather<00:04:35.610> have<00:04:35.880> two

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
look better but I'd rather have two

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.910 
look better but I'd rather have two
matching<00:04:36.390> apps<00:04:36.510> than<00:04:36.900> have<00:04:37.080> odd<00:04:37.260> ones<00:04:37.500> so

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
matching apps than have odd ones so

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.830 
matching apps than have odd ones so
that's<00:04:38.100> why<00:04:38.220> I<00:04:38.250> bought<00:04:38.460> this<00:04:38.610> one<00:04:38.850> so<00:04:39.030> that's

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
that's why I bought this one so that's

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:47.630 
that's why I bought this one so that's
the<00:04:40.370> tee<00:04:41.370> 600<00:04:41.880> point2<00:04:43.580> yep<00:04:45.770> cool<00:04:46.770> for<00:04:47.460> gage

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
the tee 600 point2 yep cool for gage

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.740 
the tee 600 point2 yep cool for gage
inputs<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:49.520> yeah<00:04:50.520> so<00:04:51.150> that's<00:04:51.620> that's<00:04:52.620> that

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
inputs and yeah so that's that's that

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.090 
inputs and yeah so that's that's that
instruction<00:04:54.750> manual<00:04:55.080> is<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.530> tear<00:04:55.740> hundred

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
instruction manual is the tear hundred

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.030 
instruction manual is the tear hundred
the<00:04:56.190> t600<00:04:56.760> boxes<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.450> exact<00:04:58.440> same<00:04:58.680> box

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
the t600 boxes and the exact same box

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.670 
the t600 boxes and the exact same box
and<00:04:59.340> i'm<00:05:00.030> pretty<00:05:00.300> sure<00:05:00.540> they're<00:05:01.140> the<00:05:01.350> exact

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
and i'm pretty sure they're the exact

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.830 
and i'm pretty sure they're the exact
same<00:05:01.710> axial<00:05:02.280> skeleton<00:05:02.580> for<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.240> amp<00:05:03.390> it's<00:05:03.660> the

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
same axial skeleton for the amp it's the

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.990 
same axial skeleton for the amp it's the
same<00:05:04.020> frame<00:05:04.440> same<00:05:04.950> everything<00:05:05.280> she's<00:05:05.850> just

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
same frame same everything she's just

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.580 
same frame same everything she's just
different<00:05:06.120> internal<00:05:06.570> so<00:05:06.840> that's<00:05:07.020> they<00:05:07.410> get<00:05:07.560> a

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
different internal so that's they get a

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.570 
different internal so that's they get a
look<00:05:07.710> really<00:05:07.980> good<00:05:08.070> next<00:05:08.310> to<00:05:08.370> each<00:05:08.490> other

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
look really good next to each other

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.750 
look really good next to each other
that's<00:05:08.970> mostly<00:05:09.390> why<00:05:09.600> I<00:05:09.630> wore<00:05:09.840> them<00:05:10.580> there's<00:05:11.580> no

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
that's mostly why I wore them there's no

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.909 
that's mostly why I wore them there's no
app<00:05:11.910> on<00:05:12.600> the<00:05:12.720> labor<00:05:12.900> wrapped<00:05:13.140> up<00:05:13.320> just<00:05:13.710> put

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
app on the labor wrapped up just put

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.290 
app on the labor wrapped up just put
some<00:05:14.040> ice<00:05:14.160> in<00:05:14.400> around<00:05:14.580> 40<00:05:14.850> months<00:05:15.060> so<00:05:15.120> I<00:05:15.180> want

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
some ice in around 40 months so I want

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.920 
some ice in around 40 months so I want
to<00:05:15.360> get<00:05:15.419> dust<00:05:15.660> in<00:05:15.810> it<00:05:16.490> so<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:17.760> new<00:05:17.910> build<00:05:18.120> we'll

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
to get dust in it so the new build we'll

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.090 
to get dust in it so the new build we'll
just<00:05:19.020> flick<00:05:19.260> away<00:05:19.380> here<00:05:19.680> it's<00:05:19.800> gonna<00:05:19.890> show

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
just flick away here it's gonna show

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.469 
just flick away here it's gonna show
same<00:05:20.310> thing<00:05:20.729> as<00:05:20.850> they<00:05:20.940> got<00:05:21.090> a<00:05:21.120> new<00:05:21.300> little

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
same thing as they got a new little

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.659 
same thing as they got a new little
headliner<00:05:21.900> thing<00:05:22.140> up<00:05:22.229> top<00:05:22.440> here<00:05:22.520> this<00:05:23.520> was

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
headliner thing up top here this was

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.490 
headliner thing up top here this was
made<00:05:23.850> by<00:05:23.880> one<00:05:24.120> of<00:05:24.150> my<00:05:24.240> subscribers<00:05:24.479> like<00:05:25.290> he

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
made by one of my subscribers like he

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.990 
made by one of my subscribers like he
