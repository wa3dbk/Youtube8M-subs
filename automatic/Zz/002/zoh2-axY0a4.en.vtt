00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 hello everyone tested another 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.790
 battery 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:12.500
 215 milliamps capacity and that's what's wrong with it 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:24.570
 as we see the inscription erased as their 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.869
 there was a couple like the same one 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.869
 emulator 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:38.120
 Yes, and the same shoals 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.980
 Builds here and I do not know why but on one 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.079
 battery 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:47.089
 just the inscription got down although they are in 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:54.800
 packaged in one were both on both here 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:01:00.040
 there is a little font you can see 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.040
 even reputation 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.710
 I ask that and here 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.280
 only here 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:25.600
 for him the letters are the same for Christ 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.970
 consider the same battery with why 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.450
 here here here got us all don't know but 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.460
 low battery 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.500
 very small capacity 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.470
 200 milliamps for them about anything 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.820
 here is the word battery plan ie 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.010
 I do not recommend to buy 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:59.710
 I think on this battery too I will get off 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:02:03.460
 No, it does not drive here from there 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:07.900
 overheating one tear is usually of high quality 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.920
 about to be erased quality made 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:17.400
 polygraphy 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:22.180
 she said to the thermal influence should not in any way 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.290
 respond to the campaign here it is printed 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.290
 on the printer 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.730
 either infusion to anyone even 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:38.430
 either on the laser but the fact that printing 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:41.820
 it is a fact or I shoot a movie 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:50.230
 the batteries were in hours 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:52.750
 tested to give a mountain a mask to whom 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:03:02.770
 interesting you 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:02.770
 7 grams 7 grams 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.950
 next you will have 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:12.670
 battery from the same series here we are 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.880
 who made this fake 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.570
 here we have a font smaller than those 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.570
 batteries 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:33.810
 but the weight is already 9 grams as if I did not 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.120
 like there are centers this is crooked with 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.370
 the reverse side is smoother much that is 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.530
 correct length 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:47.010
 we went it sat very well 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:54.620
 There is a meeting to estimate only two 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:04:00.150
 battery even on camera noticed 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:02.190
 spread well let's get down to test 2 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.880
 battery on it all thank you all for 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.430
 Attention 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.430
 The battery will be all deducted for now.
