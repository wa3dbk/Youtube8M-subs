00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.610 
again if you don't have the impact gun
you<00:02:35.670> can<00:02:35.849> use<00:02:36.150> one<00:02:36.629> of<00:02:36.659> these<00:02:36.870> breaker<00:02:37.260> bars

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
you can use one of these breaker bars

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.309 
you can use one of these breaker bars
these<00:02:38.040> are<00:02:38.189> also<00:02:38.519> called<00:02:38.879> cheater<00:02:39.269> bars<00:02:39.569> in

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
these are also called cheater bars in

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.229 
these are also called cheater bars in
this<00:02:40.500> case<00:02:40.739> you<00:02:40.890> can<00:02:41.040> use<00:02:41.189> either<00:02:41.489> an<00:02:41.819> 18

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
this case you can use either an 18

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.280 
this case you can use either an 18
millimeter<00:02:42.720> or<00:02:43.109> a<00:02:43.310> 3/4<00:02:44.310> inch<00:02:44.700> socket<00:02:45.049> so<00:02:46.049> just

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
millimeter or a 3/4 inch socket so just

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.339 
millimeter or a 3/4 inch socket so just
place<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:47.340> socket<00:02:47.790> over<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.209> end<00:02:48.359> there<00:02:48.599> I'll

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
place the socket over the end there I'll

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.589 
place the socket over the end there I'll
use<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.620> breaker<00:02:49.980> bar<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.909> happens<00:02:51.299> to<00:02:51.420> be<00:02:51.450> a

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
use a breaker bar this happens to be a

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.710 
use a breaker bar this happens to be a
half<00:02:51.959> inch<00:02:52.260> breaker<00:02:52.620> bar<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:54.090> then<00:02:54.299> for<00:02:54.689> good

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
half inch breaker bar and then for good

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.050 
half inch breaker bar and then for good
measure<00:02:54.900> also<00:02:55.680> get<00:02:55.859> yourself<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.519> wrench

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
measure also get yourself a wrench

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.809 
measure also get yourself a wrench

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
to check is sometimes you have brake

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.940 
to check is sometimes you have brake
lines<00:04:13.670> ABS<00:04:14.329> sensors<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:14.959> so<00:04:15.079> forth<00:04:15.410> attached

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
lines ABS sensors and so forth attached

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.039 
lines ABS sensors and so forth attached
to<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.280> strut<00:04:16.609> so<00:04:17.180> this<00:04:17.359> happens<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.780> be<00:04:17.900> a

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
to the strut so this happens to be a

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.990 
to the strut so this happens to be a
twelve<00:04:18.530> millimeter<00:04:21.100> just<00:04:22.100> remove<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.550> bolts

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
twelve millimeter just remove the bolts

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:35.260 
twelve millimeter just remove the bolts
like<00:04:23.510> so<00:04:30.699> okay<00:04:32.770> then<00:04:33.770> also<00:04:34.039> we<00:04:34.370> have<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.970> brake

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
like so okay then also we have the brake

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.270 
like so okay then also we have the brake
line<00:04:35.600> right<00:04:35.900> here<00:04:36.139> now<00:04:36.320> this<00:04:36.500> is<00:04:36.560> held<00:04:36.889> on<00:04:37.039> by<00:04:37.250> a

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
line right here now this is held on by a

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.110 
line right here now this is held on by a
clip<00:04:37.760> and<00:04:38.060> as<00:04:38.750> you<00:04:38.930> can<00:04:39.050> see<00:04:39.110> it<00:04:40.070> grabs<00:04:40.550> around

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
clip and as you can see it grabs around

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.360 
clip and as you can see it grabs around
this<00:04:41.930> fitting<00:04:42.410> so<00:04:42.710> what<00:04:42.830> you<00:04:42.919> want<00:04:43.070> to<00:04:43.130> do<00:04:43.250> is

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
get yourself a flat head and just pry it

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.339 
get yourself a flat head and just pry it
up<00:04:46.070> like<00:04:46.280> so<00:04:46.580> and<00:04:47.000> with<00:04:47.240> my<00:04:47.419> thumb<00:04:47.780> my<00:04:48.139> left

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
up like so and with my thumb my left

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:52.409 
up like so and with my thumb my left
thumb<00:04:48.590> here<00:04:48.889> I'll<00:04:49.820> press<00:04:50.210> down<00:04:50.510> and<00:04:50.750> out<00:04:51.169> and

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
thumb here I'll press down and out and

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.830 
thumb here I'll press down and out and
to<00:04:53.419> be<00:04:53.539> a<00:04:53.570> little<00:04:53.750> difficult<00:04:53.900> but<00:04:55.389> just<00:04:56.389> wiggle

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
to be a little difficult but just wiggle

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.560 
to be a little difficult but just wiggle
it<00:04:56.960> and<00:04:57.110> there<00:04:57.500> you<00:04:57.590> go<00:04:57.740> so<00:04:57.979> now<00:04:58.940> everything<00:04:59.479> is

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
it and there you go so now everything is

it and there you go so now everything is
free<00:04:59.870> and<00:05:00.050> clear<00:05:00.380> so<00:05:00.889> now<00:05:01.010> we<00:05:01.070> can<00:05:01.310> remove<00:05:01.430> the

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
free and clear so now we can remove the

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.120 
free and clear so now we can remove the
strut<00:05:01.970> but<00:05:02.630> before<00:05:03.050> we<00:05:03.169> do<00:05:03.320> that<00:05:03.349> we<00:05:03.979> have<00:05:04.070> a

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
strut but before we do that we have a

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.089 
strut but before we do that we have a
couple<00:05:04.370> of<00:05:04.550> bolts<00:05:04.789> on<00:05:05.000> top<00:05:05.650> all<00:05:06.650> right<00:05:06.770> so<00:05:06.950> what

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
couple of bolts on top all right so what

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.279 
couple of bolts on top all right so what
we<00:05:07.250> need<00:05:07.460> to<00:05:07.580> do<00:05:07.700> up<00:05:07.849> here<00:05:08.120> is<00:05:08.270> we<00:05:08.750> have<00:05:08.840> three

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.640 
we need to do up here is we have three
top<00:05:09.830> mounts<00:05:10.570> now<00:05:11.570> this<00:05:11.810> can<00:05:11.990> be<00:05:12.020> rather<00:05:12.320> tight

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
top mounts now this can be rather tight

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.620 
top mounts now this can be rather tight
sometimes<00:05:12.919> especially<00:05:13.820> if<00:05:14.300> they've<00:05:14.479> been

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
sometimes especially if they've been

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.870 
sometimes especially if they've been
sitting<00:05:14.870> here<00:05:14.990> for<00:05:15.229> ten<00:05:15.440> plus<00:05:15.650> years<00:05:15.820> so<00:05:16.820> what

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
sitting here for ten plus years so what

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.689 
sitting here for ten plus years so what
you<00:05:16.970> can<00:05:17.120> do<00:05:17.240> is<00:05:17.419> yourself<00:05:18.229> the<00:05:18.470> socket<00:05:18.949> get

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
you can do is yourself the socket get

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.580 
you can do is yourself the socket get
yourself<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.120> ratchet<00:05:20.570> and<00:05:20.720> then<00:05:21.020> I'm<00:05:21.289> using

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
yourself the ratchet and then I'm using

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.159 
yourself the ratchet and then I'm using
an<00:05:22.010> extension<00:05:22.490> just<00:05:22.910> place<00:05:23.240> this<00:05:23.720> happens<00:05:24.050> to

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
an extension just place this happens to

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.500 
an extension just place this happens to
be<00:05:24.229> a<00:05:24.320> 17<00:05:24.860> millimeter<00:05:25.039> socket<00:05:25.760> on<00:05:25.910> placing<00:05:26.389> the

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
be a 17 millimeter socket on placing the

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.740 
be a 17 millimeter socket on placing the
end<00:05:26.740> over<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:27.830> ratchet<00:05:28.280> that<00:05:29.030> I'm<00:05:29.150> using<00:05:29.360> an

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
end over the ratchet that I'm using an

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.320 
end over the ratchet that I'm using an
extension<00:05:30.729> this<00:05:31.729> gives<00:05:31.970> you<00:05:32.060> a<00:05:32.090> lot<00:05:32.270> more

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330
