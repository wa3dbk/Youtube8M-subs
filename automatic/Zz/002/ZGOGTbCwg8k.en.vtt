 hello good night we are here in the 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.900
 kitchen of my house to prepare a 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:12.110
 new stage tonight we are going to make a 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.340
 tapa that is called potato cake with 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:19.300
 filling to taste 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:22.500
 for this I cooked some potatoes 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.930

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.930
 manipulate the filling I'm going to do it 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:33.110

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.450
 I'm crushing the mash that I'm going to 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.450
 add a little bit of 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.570
 you will see that it is a very fresh tapa 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.020

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.650

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.850
 pepper sorry 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.850
 and a little salt 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.339

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.740
 end the potato already we know that it accompanies 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.450
 very well 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.790
 to any last 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.470
 it's very easy it 's a cold lid 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.470

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.950
 and the pepper 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.520

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.659

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.259
 of meat in use of a fish 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.020
 I do not know what is inoculated many things that 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.969
 I could put the stuffing but here in 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.729
 my house in the kitchen of my house we 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:12.930
 like a lot 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.110
 the onion and the lettuce because it gives 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.680
 a lot of freshness when I'm on the cake I'm going to mix 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.680

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.980
 everything I have very minced that is like 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.630

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.260

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.250
 of other meat of life 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.870
 you'll see it's a cover 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.700
 a food that is very well preserved 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.700
 Well, do it 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.960
 and eating it are very cool when it does 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.780
 Much hot 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.150
 Holds the fridge very well 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.900
 and especially since it is very easy 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.910
 to prepare what these balls are for and 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.480
 the pretty peas and the 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.990
 peas are to decorate at the end the 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.990
 cake 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.030
 this time I searched and sandro 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.380
 caught month before and you the balls are 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.380
 from a mixture of 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:59.170
 barbecue sauce with grated bread does not have 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.670
 more history the little ball now we are going to 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.460
 pass a little bit through the pan that 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.000
 will be more 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.000
 delicious 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.239
 we crush well and we have a mold in 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.239
 house like a mold 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.260
 or without mold in a font itself I 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.580
 why I'm going to make tapas but 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.580
 this will be very good too 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.290
 it looks great too in a fountain and 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.110
 I'm telling you, I tell you, it's preserved 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.720
 phenomenal and above all that is very very 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.300
 very nice to take it in summer 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.260
 the writings that is let's throw a 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.260
 little bit of stuffing 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:48.629
 and now we cover with another layer of 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.629
 of potato 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.960
 we crush well and unmold 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.120
 you see that we do not complicate our lives 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.600
 especially now for warmth not 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.330
 Feel or rarely want to be at 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.990

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.990

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.560
 Mastro protect cold in summer and 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.100

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.100
 more than cover 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.940
 you will see what 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.270
 I feel like I'm going to laugh 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.890
 really 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:04.350
 with any mold it is also very apart 

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:08.720

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.720
