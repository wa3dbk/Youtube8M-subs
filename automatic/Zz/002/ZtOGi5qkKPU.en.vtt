now<00:01:18.060> let's<00:01:18.240> switch<00:01:18.360> over<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.570> someone<00:01:18.840> who<00:01:18.900> is

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
now let's switch over to someone who is

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.140 
now let's switch over to someone who is
prestige<00:01:19.320> master<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.430> his<00:01:20.549> stats<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
prestige master you see his stats and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.640 
prestige master you see his stats and
the<00:01:21.210> prestige<00:01:21.360> master<00:01:21.689> emblem<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.560> we

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the prestige master emblem but if we

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.230 
the prestige master emblem but if we
zoom<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.189> see<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> same<00:01:23.700> emblem<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.180> I

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
zoom in we see the same emblem that I

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.270 
zoom in we see the same emblem that I
circle<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.869> second<00:01:25.229> ago<00:01:25.259> from<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.009> alone

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
circle just a second ago from this alone

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.620 
circle just a second ago from this alone
i<00:01:26.400> think<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.670> safe<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.820> say<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.090> there<00:01:27.420> will

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
i think it's safe to say that there will

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.210 
i think it's safe to say that there will
be<00:01:27.810> more<00:01:27.990> prestigious<00:01:28.409> after<00:01:28.920> prestige

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
be more prestigious after prestige

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.800 
be more prestigious after prestige
