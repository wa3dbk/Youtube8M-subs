00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.980
 a great desire for all the boys and I am 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.970
 mixed and and we're going to do lambo xing 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.230
 of having media comes capture hd2 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.810
 probably one of the possible 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.869
 answers to those like us the other is 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.610
 is asking how the hell log on 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.230
 xbox but is ps4 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.879
 this is a new device then 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.040
 made available not to me from that 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:43.140
 allows us to record is compatible 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:47.399
 with xbox one xbox 360 wii and ps3 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.960
 PS 41 records in full HD 1080p and there 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.270
 allows recording even without the PC 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.730
 we're going to see why and what 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.739
 interesting from the icon we see that it is 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.600
 You can also control it remotely 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.510
 with an application compatible with 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.730
 android and ios 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.850
 let's see what's more than the box 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.560
 here we are including the device a 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.830
 manual use a guide 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.470
 an introductory remote control then a 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.619
 remote controller the HDMI cable e 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.250
 power will proceed we proceed 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.250
 with unboxing 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.829
 then there was a box here 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.009
 let's see what we have inside 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.829
 of the box clearly having media 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.009
 in plain sight and the user manual 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.959
 quick that we can come back 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.909
 let's take our jail ass game 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:52.060
 when those run over almost 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.640
 leaning on we see it and show the 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.299
 let's say our graphics device 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.170
 pretty cute design not bad 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.539
 especially much nicer than the 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.739
 predecessor not portable but it is 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.450
 the previous one 

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:05.979
 this we say that this is also one 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.200
 middle ground is not just door fault 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.970
 that still needs power 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.910
 then power supply lan cable a 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:18.239
 basin hdm account keane and the socket 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:22.780
 component in front we have the usb output 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:26.980
 for the external hard disk the entrance 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:31.329
 headphone microphone and two lights 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.700
 let's say two LEDs that show us if we are 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.130
 in hdmi rather than in components 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.230
 button to register to start the 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.810
 registration and the power button 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.790
 here I imagine it is the infrared for the 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.060
 remote control monster a little more closely 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.829
 and now I would say that we can support 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.150
 we are going to remove the upper part 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.700
 of the box we see what is there 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.090
 inside the box 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.000
 power supply then in power supplies 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.620
 from what we can see 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.739
 clearly you can put the various 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.590
 adapters depending on the situation 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:12.780
 one click there is our here 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:16.919
 we can shoot immediately and 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.919
 we connect the bipolar adapter 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.329
 here we are then we have the remote control 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.690
 would probably allow us to 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.930
 change the sky recording 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.489
 or the classic remote features 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.669
 then we also endorse the batteries 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.289
 the remote control but not to use 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:43.000
 that now we are not to browse and the 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:47.850
 hdmi cable 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.609
 then such hot considerations 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.470
 thanks to the academy in and out the 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.660
 so let's say the operation 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.699
 connection the installation is identical 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.830
 those we say to new devices 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:03.380
 generation then we will connect from 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.250
 the playstation rather than xbox 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:10.190
 the hdmi cable while we start from 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.580
 our device the HDMI out to the 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.580
 television 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.750
 I suppose that since there is this 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.290
 outlet we could ask to connect one 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.850
 simple usb stick to store i 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.530
 our videos and we can start 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.070
 quietly our registration 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.140
 from here I would now like to register you then 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.390
 to follow in this video a use 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.100
 via let's say software so let's try it one 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.100
 according to I also tell you the considerations 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.860
 a moment the right time to assemble it 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.830
 here we are back to what you are 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.930
 seeing is a player registered with the 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.120
 our device therefore in the quality is 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.250
 excellent worthy of a product 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.110
 gravier media then definitely a 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.040
 product that compared to ours 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.290
 expectations 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.450
 and one thing I forgot to 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.940
 tell you is that in the back of the device 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.590
 in the back of the possible vermilion 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.620
 apply directly to a hard disk 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.080
 classic hard disk to apply behind 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.970
 otherwise you go to us usb stick 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.800
 I have personally tried one 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.440
 USB stick can be formatted 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.360
 directly inside the device 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.580
 then insert the key and you are 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.919
 formed the key must be 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.650
 formatted ntfs but precisely by applying 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.540
 directly the key and formatting 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.760
 from the device you don't make me problems 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.930
 also those who love and maybe I should 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.910
 use an external application 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.860
 we said to format in this type 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.810
 file system there are no problems that 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.790
 take the key from the cleaned up 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.919
 your files and shape directly 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.840
 within the device 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.790
 the use is very simple through 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.680
 the remote control starts 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.960
 registration e 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.280
 and then it always stops with i 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.250
 remote control rather than with the 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.919
 Click on directly on the aver 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:55.460
 media and comes from the video comes 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:57.710
 recorded in mp4 in the stick 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.610
 so goi the connected computers and 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.229
 do whatever you want 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.400
 there is the possibility of making a minimum of 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.400
 editing on 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.570
 directly from the vermilion from the menu 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.730
 some remote controls do at least 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.860
 if you want you can add a watermark 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.510
 that is what you now find above 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.460
 on the left which shows precisely that 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.020
 we have recorded with the media but 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.940
 this can be clearly removed 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.670
 so you can make recordings 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.400
 very normal without any type of icon 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.720
 it is certain I will not say more maybe 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.570
 I leave you with the last seconds of 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.460
 personally imagine I have this 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.490
 product I recommend hello to everyone 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.490
 boys 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.440
 it does 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.450
 no 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.450
 no
