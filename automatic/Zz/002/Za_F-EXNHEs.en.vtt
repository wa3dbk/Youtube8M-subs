California today's video is about water
and<00:00:14.340> many<00:00:14.820> people<00:00:15.120> ask<00:00:15.299> me<00:00:15.450> about<00:00:15.570> water

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
and many people ask me about water

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.990 
and many people ask me about water
water's<00:00:16.710> super<00:00:17.310> important<00:00:17.820> it's<00:00:17.940> a

water's super important it's a
foundation<00:00:18.570> principle<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:20.160> just<00:00:20.730> some

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
foundation principle and so just some

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.060 
foundation principle and so just some
quick<00:00:21.390> elements<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.470> water<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:24.920> think<00:00:25.920> it's

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
quick elements on on water I think it's

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.830 
quick elements on on water I think it's
very<00:00:26.220> important<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.910> drink<00:00:27.210> half<00:00:27.390> your<00:00:27.630> body

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the solution to pollution is dilution so

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.680 
the solution to pollution is dilution so
we<00:00:42.840> have<00:00:43.640> toxic<00:00:44.640> elements<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.180> build<00:00:45.329> up<00:00:45.570> in

body this creates metabolic wastes and a

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.850 
body this creates metabolic wastes and a
good<00:01:04.979> way<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:06.240> know<00:01:06.360> continuously<00:01:07.290> rinse

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
good way to you know continuously rinse

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.039 
good way to you know continuously rinse
the<00:01:08.100> body<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.520> rinse<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.880> tissues<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.479> to

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the body and rinse the tissues is to

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.130 
the body and rinse the tissues is to
drink<00:01:10.320> fresh<00:01:10.770> pure<00:01:11.159> water<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.600> my

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
drink fresh pure water and so my

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.810 
drink fresh pure water and so my
philosophy<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:14.280> water<00:01:15.470> quality<00:01:16.820> because

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
philosophy on water quality because

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.749 
philosophy on water quality because
water<00:01:18.180> quality<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.140> also<00:01:19.770> very<00:01:20.040> important<00:01:20.610> I

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
water quality is also very important I

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.020 
water quality is also very important I
personally<00:01:21.689> liked<00:01:21.990> drinking<00:01:22.350> glass<00:01:26.030> plastics

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
personally liked drinking glass plastics

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.319 
personally liked drinking glass plastics
also<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.570> many<00:01:27.780> toxic<00:01:28.350> elements<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.329> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
also have many toxic elements and the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.130 
also have many toxic elements and the
water<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.220> top<00:01:33.180> solvents<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
water is one of the top solvents on the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.700 
water is one of the top solvents on the
planet<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.520> if<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.090> sitting<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.710> plastic

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
planet and so if it's sitting in plastic

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.260 
planet and so if it's sitting in plastic
for<00:01:37.890> long<00:01:38.280> periods<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.670> time<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.060> has<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
for long periods of time it has the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.969 
for long periods of time it has the
ability<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.630> break<00:01:40.020> down<00:01:40.259> plastic<00:01:40.590> and

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
ability to break down plastic and

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.120 
ability to break down plastic and
plastic<00:01:41.490> has<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.540> xenoestrogens<00:01:43.380> or<00:01:43.680> things

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
plastic has the xenoestrogens or things

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.219 
plastic has the xenoestrogens or things
that<00:01:44.220> plug<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.850> receptor<00:01:45.299> sites<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.780> your

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
that plug the receptor sites in your

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.149 
that plug the receptor sites in your
cells<00:01:47.960> xenoestrogens<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:50.070> know

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
cells xenoestrogens it's like you know

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.749 
cells xenoestrogens it's like you know
being<00:01:50.970> all<00:01:51.119> doped<00:01:51.420> up<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.689> estrogen<00:01:52.759> becoming

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
being all doped up on estrogen becoming

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.030 
being all doped up on estrogen becoming
a<00:01:53.909> woman<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:57.240> personally<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.590> drink<00:01:58.860> in

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
a woman so personally I like to drink in

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.929 
a woman so personally I like to drink in
glass

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
glass

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.899 
glass
there's<00:02:00.360> Eno<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.719> phytoestrogens<00:02:01.909> all

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
there's Eno and phytoestrogens all

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.380 
there's Eno and phytoestrogens all
throughout<00:02:03.270> our<00:02:03.329> society<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.649> can't

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
throughout our society and you can't

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.690 
throughout our society and you can't
miss<00:02:06.390> them<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:06.960> easy<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:08.459> me<00:02:08.520> to

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
miss them so it's easy for me to

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.680 
miss them so it's easy for me to
sidestep<00:02:09.420> as<00:02:09.780> many<00:02:10.050> as<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.379> possibly<00:02:11.099> can<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.270> a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
sidestep as many as I possibly can so a

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.830 
sidestep as many as I possibly can so a
little<00:02:13.050> bit<00:02:13.170> more<00:02:13.230> on

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
little bit more on

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.339 
little bit more on
quality<00:02:14.140> I've<00:02:14.319> recently<00:02:14.920> upgraded<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:16.349> spring

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
quality I've recently upgraded to spring

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.000 
quality I've recently upgraded to spring
in<00:02:17.680> glass<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:20.379> a<00:02:20.500> little<00:02:20.650> bit<00:02:20.830> more

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
in glass and so it's a little bit more

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.540 
in glass and so it's a little bit more
expensive<00:02:21.599> however<00:02:22.599> I'm<00:02:23.019> worth<00:02:23.379> it<00:02:23.680> it's<00:02:23.890> just

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
expensive however I'm worth it it's just

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.869 
expensive however I'm worth it it's just
spring<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.330> glass<00:02:25.510> from<00:02:26.080> artesian<00:02:26.650> wells

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
spring and glass from artesian wells

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.180 
spring and glass from artesian wells
artesian<00:02:27.879> Springs<00:02:28.300> is<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.260> highest<00:02:29.800> quality

to this quadruple filtration system down

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.670 
to this quadruple filtration system down
here<00:03:48.389> it's<00:03:49.389> from<00:03:49.599> culligan<00:03:50.139> I<00:03:50.319> think<00:03:50.500> it's<00:03:50.620> a

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
here it's from culligan I think it's a

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.009 
here it's from culligan I think it's a
national<00:03:50.889> brand<00:03:51.340> they'll<00:03:51.970> come<00:03:52.180> in<00:03:52.359> and<00:03:52.569> put

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
national brand they'll come in and put

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.259 
national brand they'll come in and put
this<00:03:53.200> in<00:03:53.440> your<00:03:53.620> house<00:03:53.829> I<00:03:54.220> think<00:03:54.370> for<00:03:54.700> free<00:03:55.030> and

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
this in your house I think for free and

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.500 
this in your house I think for free and
then<00:03:55.810> charge<00:03:56.169> a<00:03:56.290> $30<00:03:56.889> a<00:03:56.919> month<00:03:57.220> it<00:03:58.030> comes<00:03:58.269> out

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
then charge a $30 a month it comes out

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.440 
then charge a $30 a month it comes out
here<00:03:58.810> this<00:03:59.019> is<00:03:59.169> basically<00:04:00.060> basically<00:04:01.060> an<00:04:01.180> RO

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
here this is basically basically an RO

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.120 
here this is basically basically an RO
system<00:04:02.410> which<00:04:02.950> stands<00:04:03.340> for<00:04:03.730> reverse<00:04:04.180> osmosis

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130

which is basically zeroing all the
particles<00:04:09.220> in<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:09.549> water

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000

out<00:04:10.239> to<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.720> certain<00:04:10.930> extent<00:04:11.349> you're<00:04:11.470> still

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
out to a certain extent you're still

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.699 
out to a certain extent you're still
getting<00:04:11.829> homeopathic<00:04:12.760> doses<00:04:13.090> of

elements that's in a municipal water
supply<00:04:22.750> so<00:04:23.110> water<00:04:23.520> super-important

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
supply so water super-important

it's<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:25.240> number<00:04:25.510> one<00:04:25.690> element

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
it's the number one element

you need to survive on the planet next

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.910 
you need to survive on the planet next
to<00:04:28.440> oxygen<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:29.710> so<00:04:30.460> this<00:04:31.420> is<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.600> major<00:04:31.920> reason

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
to oxygen and so this is a major reason

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.430 
to oxygen and so this is a major reason
why<00:04:33.310> I<00:04:33.340> am<00:04:33.910> such<00:04:34.150> a<00:04:34.180> strong<00:04:34.600> proponent<00:04:35.080> about

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
why I am such a strong proponent about

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.980 
why I am such a strong proponent about
health<00:04:35.770> and<00:04:36.120> planetary<00:04:37.120> health<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.690> taking

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
health and planetary health and taking

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.050 
health and planetary health and taking
responsibility<00:04:38.800> for<00:04:38.830> your<00:04:39.160> health<00:04:39.400> and<00:04:39.610> how

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
responsibility for your health and how

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.600 
responsibility for your health and how
your<00:04:40.390> health<00:04:40.630> is<00:04:40.900> in<00:04:41.170> symbiotic<00:04:41.980> relationship

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
your health is in symbiotic relationship

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.660 
your health is in symbiotic relationship
with<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.120> health<00:04:43.480> of<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.960> earth<00:04:44.260> and<00:04:44.650> so<00:04:45.340> it

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
with the health of the earth and so it

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.850 
with the health of the earth and so it
can't<00:04:45.940> be<00:04:46.090> separated<00:04:46.300> at<00:04:46.840> all<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:47.320> so<00:04:47.710> when

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
can't be separated at all and so when

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.680 
can't be separated at all and so when
you<00:04:47.980> take<00:04:48.220> precautions<00:04:48.580> when<00:04:49.240> you<00:04:49.420> take

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
you take precautions when you take

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.930 
you take precautions when you take
responsibility<00:04:50.400> for<00:04:51.400> your<00:04:51.490> own<00:04:51.550> health

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
responsibility for your own health

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.060 
responsibility for your own health
you're<00:04:52.210> also<00:04:52.390> taking<00:04:52.920> responsibility<00:04:53.920> for

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
you're also taking responsibility for

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.740 
you're also taking responsibility for
the<00:04:54.250> health<00:04:54.430> of<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.700> earth<00:04:54.850> air<00:04:55.300> water<00:04:55.330> and

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
the health of the earth air water and

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.590 
the health of the earth air water and
soil<00:04:56.110> is<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.440> common<00:04:56.830> heritage<00:04:57.040> for<00:04:57.940> humanity

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
soil is the common heritage for humanity

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.470 
soil is the common heritage for humanity
and<00:04:58.840> so<00:04:59.170> when<00:05:00.130> you<00:05:00.400> become<00:05:00.700> healthy<00:05:01.090> healthy

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
and so when you become healthy healthy

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.570 
and so when you become healthy healthy
minded<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.140> teach<00:05:02.380> health<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.860> others<00:05:03.160> you

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
minded you teach health to others you

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.970 
minded you teach health to others you
become<00:05:03.700> health<00:05:04.240> you<00:05:04.840> exude<00:05:05.320> health<00:05:05.680> you

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
become health you exude health you

vibrate<00:05:06.550> at<00:05:06.700> a<00:05:06.820> higher<00:05:06.850> level<00:05:07.060> people<00:05:07.660> want<00:05:07.960> to

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
vibrate at a higher level people want to

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.860 
vibrate at a higher level people want to
know<00:05:08.170> what<00:05:08.350> you're<00:05:08.530> on<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:08.950> this<00:05:09.460> is

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
know what you're on and this is

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.960 
know what you're on and this is
basically<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:11.200> evolution<00:05:11.980> of<00:05:12.070> mankind<00:05:12.310> when

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
basically the evolution of mankind when

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.240 
basically the evolution of mankind when
we<00:05:13.180> all<00:05:13.420> raised<00:05:13.720> up<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.170> this<00:05:14.290> full<00:05:14.860> level<00:05:15.160> of

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
we all raised up to this full level of

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.640 
we all raised up to this full level of
responsibility<00:05:15.820> instead<00:05:16.240> of<00:05:16.660> leaving<00:05:17.440> it<00:05:17.500> to

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
responsibility instead of leaving it to

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.440 
responsibility instead of leaving it to
the<00:05:17.740> government<00:05:18.070> or<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.430> healthcare<00:05:19.030> or<00:05:19.270> this

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
the government or the healthcare or this

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.620 
the government or the healthcare or this
that<00:05:19.660> or<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:19.840> other<00:05:19.960> thing<00:05:20.140> so<00:05:20.920> after<00:05:21.760> I<00:05:21.790> did

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
that or the other thing so after I did

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.420 
that or the other thing so after I did
the<00:05:22.750> RO<00:05:23.080> I've<00:05:23.440> done<00:05:23.650> this<00:05:23.770> for<00:05:24.010> a<00:05:24.040> couple<00:05:24.190> of

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
the RO I've done this for a couple of

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.060 
the RO I've done this for a couple of
years<00:05:24.760> I<00:05:24.970> just<00:05:25.150> upgraded<00:05:25.330> to<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:26.200> spring<00:05:27.040> and

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
years I just upgraded to the spring and

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.570 
years I just upgraded to the spring and
glass<00:05:27.430> recently<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:28.800> before<00:05:29.800> that<00:05:29.830> I<00:05:30.340> was

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
glass recently and before that I was

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.350 
glass recently and before that I was
doing<00:05:30.820> the<00:05:30.910> RO

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
doing the RO

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.720 
doing the RO
and<00:05:31.660> then<00:05:32.650> I<00:05:32.890> would<00:05:33.070> put<00:05:33.310> it<00:05:33.400> in<00:05:33.550> this

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
and then I would put it in this

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:34.650 
and then I would put it in this
vitalizer

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
vitalizer

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.490 
vitalizer
this<00:05:35.170> is<00:05:35.380> like<00:05:35.590> a<00:05:35.620> $500<00:05:36.580> blender<00:05:36.960> you<00:05:37.960> spin<00:05:38.350> it

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
this is like a $500 blender you spin it

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.140 
this is like a $500 blender you spin it
here<00:05:38.770> it's<00:05:39.100> actually<00:05:39.400> kind<00:05:39.610> of<00:05:39.640> cool<00:05:39.850> I'll

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
here it's actually kind of cool I'll

00:05:40.150 --> 00:06:07.530 
here it's actually kind of cool I'll
show<00:05:40.600> you<00:05:40.660> how<00:05:40.750> it<00:05:40.810> works

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.160 

it's<00:06:08.540> kind<00:06:08.720> of<00:06:08.750> cool<00:06:08.930> huh<00:06:09.230> so<00:06:10.690> it<00:06:11.690> spins<00:06:11.960> it

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
it's kind of cool huh so it spins it

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.550 
it's kind of cool huh so it spins it
into<00:06:12.410> a<00:06:12.440> vortex<00:06:13.010> this<00:06:13.820> is<00:06:14.000> kind<00:06:14.240> of<00:06:14.270> the<00:06:14.360> way

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
into a vortex this is kind of the way

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.250 
into a vortex this is kind of the way
water<00:06:15.560> goes<00:06:15.890> through<00:06:15.920> nature<00:06:16.490> underground

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260 
water goes through nature underground

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.040 
water goes through nature underground
and<00:06:18.260> over<00:06:18.650> rocks<00:06:18.920> it's<00:06:19.550> in<00:06:19.880> a<00:06:20.000> coral<00:06:20.510> calcium

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
and over rocks it's in a coral calcium

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.180 
and over rocks it's in a coral calcium
charge

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
charge

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.180 
charge
so<00:06:22.640> there's<00:06:22.850> coral<00:06:23.420> calcium<00:06:23.720> rocks<00:06:24.350> that<00:06:25.040> are

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
so there's coral calcium rocks that are

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.460 
so there's coral calcium rocks that are
in<00:06:25.370> there<00:06:25.610> and<00:06:25.790> the<00:06:25.880> water<00:06:26.120> spins<00:06:26.690> over<00:06:27.260> that

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
in there and the water spins over that

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.790 
in there and the water spins over that
and<00:06:27.800> it<00:06:28.400> gives<00:06:28.610> it<00:06:28.760> a<00:06:28.820> little<00:06:29.000> bit<00:06:29.120> of<00:06:29.360> a

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
and it gives it a little bit of a

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.200 
and it gives it a little bit of a
remineralisation<00:06:30.800> as<00:06:30.980> well<00:06:31.490> as<00:06:31.700> it<00:06:31.820> puts<00:06:32.060> it

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
remineralisation as well as it puts it

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.870 
remineralisation as well as it puts it
into<00:06:32.420> a<00:06:32.570> hexagonal<00:06:33.500> structure<00:06:34.100> and<00:06:34.580> after

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
into a hexagonal structure and after

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.060 
into a hexagonal structure and after
traveling<00:06:35.150> in<00:06:35.540> trucks<00:06:35.900> it's<00:06:36.470> probably<00:06:36.890> not<00:06:37.010> a

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
traveling in trucks it's probably not a

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.980 
traveling in trucks it's probably not a
bad<00:06:37.310> idea<00:06:37.520> to<00:06:38.270> put<00:06:38.300> this<00:06:38.660> through<00:06:38.960> the

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
bad idea to put this through the

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.350 
bad idea to put this through the
vitalizer<00:06:39.590> I've<00:06:39.980> been<00:06:40.310> using<00:06:40.460> the<00:06:40.670> vitalizer

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
vitalizer I've been using the vitalizer

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.170 
vitalizer I've been using the vitalizer
for<00:06:41.570> five<00:06:41.900> years<00:06:42.470> and<00:06:42.710> I<00:06:43.280> like<00:06:43.550> it<00:06:43.790> and<00:06:43.970> it's

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
for five years and I like it and it's

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.630 
for five years and I like it and it's
definitely<00:06:44.450> kept<00:06:44.810> me<00:06:44.900> hydrated<00:06:45.650> so<00:06:45.950> I<00:06:46.250> will

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640 
definitely kept me hydrated so I will

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.030 
definitely kept me hydrated so I will
continue<00:06:46.940> to<00:06:47.090> use<00:06:47.240> it<00:06:47.630> water<00:06:48.050> super-important

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.040 
continue to use it water super-important

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.610 
continue to use it water super-important
if<00:06:49.190> you<00:06:49.550> get<00:06:49.700> a<00:06:49.730> headache<00:06:49.970> drink<00:06:50.750> water<00:06:51.260> and

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
if you get a headache drink water and

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.130 
if you get a headache drink water and
wait<00:06:51.890> about<00:06:52.100> 15<00:06:52.910> minutes<00:06:53.360> and<00:06:53.570> see<00:06:53.720> if<00:06:53.840> it<00:06:53.960> goes

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.140 
wait about 15 minutes and see if it goes
