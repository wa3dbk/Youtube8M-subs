what<00:00:00.450> are<00:00:00.510> you<00:00:00.570> working<00:00:00.810> on<00:00:00.870> right<00:00:01.020> now<00:00:01.050> I'm

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
what are you working on right now I'm

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.530 
what are you working on right now I'm
working<00:00:02.159> on<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.460> pulsating<00:00:02.820> wait<00:00:03.030> door<00:00:03.210> start

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
working on a pulsating wait door start

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.420 
working on a pulsating wait door start
that<00:00:03.840> you<00:00:04.470> potentially<00:00:04.740> have<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.069> planet

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
that you potentially have a planet

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.480 
that you potentially have a planet
around<00:00:05.520> it<00:00:06.200> we<00:00:07.200> have<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.379> bunch<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.980> data<00:00:08.220> that

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
around it we have a bunch the data that

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.310 
around it we have a bunch the data that
I<00:00:08.580> get<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:09.000> basically<00:00:09.630> just<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.960> bunch<00:00:10.110> of

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
I get is basically just a bunch of

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.410 
I get is basically just a bunch of
numbers<00:00:10.590> just<00:00:11.070> how<00:00:11.190> bright<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.639> star<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.059> yeah

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
numbers just how bright the star is yeah

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.810 
numbers just how bright the star is yeah
and<00:00:12.570> so<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:12.960> plot<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:13.920> we<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.309> them<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:14.790> I

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
and so I plot that so we like them so I

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.430 
and so I plot that so we like them so I
can<00:00:15.000> actually<00:00:15.120> see<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.719> pulsation<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.379> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
can actually see the pulsation in the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.900 
can actually see the pulsation in the
star<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.130> then<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.400> use<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.670> mathematical

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
star and then I use a mathematical

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.060 
star and then I use a mathematical
equation<00:00:18.480> called<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.960> Fourier<00:00:19.199> transform<00:00:19.740> to

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
equation called a Fourier transform to

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.010 
equation called a Fourier transform to
pull<00:00:20.580> out<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.910> periods<00:00:21.270> at<00:00:21.390> frequencies<00:00:21.840> from

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
pull out the periods at frequencies from

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.460 
pull out the periods at frequencies from
that<00:00:23.449> the<00:00:24.449> white<00:00:24.660> dwarfs<00:00:24.930> stars<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.289> pulls

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
that the white dwarfs stars that pulls

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.670 
that the white dwarfs stars that pulls
it<00:00:25.650> are<00:00:25.830> very<00:00:26.070> very<00:00:26.310> accurate<00:00:26.519> time<00:00:27.000> clocks<00:00:27.680> so

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
it are very very accurate time clocks so

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.189 
it are very very accurate time clocks so
we<00:00:29.369> can<00:00:29.550> track<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.029> pulsations<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.929> we<00:00:31.050> know

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
we can track the pulsations and we know

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.010 
we can track the pulsations and we know
when<00:00:31.560> exactly<00:00:32.189> like<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.239> microsecond<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
when exactly like to the microsecond a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.160 
when exactly like to the microsecond a
pulse<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.070> supposed<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.370> arrive<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.390> we<00:00:36.930> can

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
pulse is supposed to arrive so we can

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.139 
pulse is supposed to arrive so we can
monitor<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:38.399> can<00:00:38.550> tell<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.030> a

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
monitor it and we can tell if it's a

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.660 
monitor it and we can tell if it's a
little<00:00:39.329> bit<00:00:39.510> off<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.430> when<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.640> put

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
little bit off and so when you put

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.970 
little bit off and so when you put
together<00:00:41.940> runs<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.320> years<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.710> years<00:00:43.920> of

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
together runs and years and years of

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.520 
together runs and years and years of
data<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.640> can<00:00:44.879> see<00:00:45.149> you'll<00:00:45.960> normally<00:00:46.140> see<00:00:46.500> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
data you can see you'll normally see a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.930 
data you can see you'll normally see a
flatline<00:00:46.980> because<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.640> shouldn't<00:00:47.879> be

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
flatline because it shouldn't be

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.040 
flatline because it shouldn't be
changing<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.390> should<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.570> arriving<00:00:48.870> at<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
changing it should be arriving at the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.069 
changing it should be arriving at the
exact<00:00:49.230> same<00:00:49.410> time<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:50.809> hopefully<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:51.989> we

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
exact same time but hopefully what we

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.830 
exact same time but hopefully what we
want<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.440> see<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.399> nice<00:00:53.670> sinusoidal<00:00:54.629> shape

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
want to see is a nice sinusoidal shape

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.660 
want to see is a nice sinusoidal shape
because<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.860> would<00:00:56.039> indicate<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.399> there's

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
because that would indicate that there's

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.510 
because that would indicate that there's
a<00:00:56.730> planet<00:00:57.120> around<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.539> has<00:00:57.719> as<00:00:58.190> they're<00:00:59.190> going

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
a planet around it has as they're going

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.060 
a planet around it has as they're going
about<00:00:59.730> their<00:00:59.879> orbits<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.930> star<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.920> actually

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
about their orbits the star is actually

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.250 
about their orbits the star is actually
getting<00:01:02.520> farther<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.850> closer<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.140> farther

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
getting farther and closer and farther

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.219 
getting farther and closer and farther
away<00:01:04.530> from<00:01:04.830> us<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:06.420> pulses<00:01:06.810> will<00:01:06.960> arrive

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
away from us so the pulses will arrive

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.030 
away from us so the pulses will arrive
far<00:01:08.100> closer<00:01:08.490> sooner<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.420> later<00:01:09.890> because<00:01:10.890> of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
far closer sooner and later because of

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.109 
far closer sooner and later because of
light<00:01:11.189> travel<00:01:11.520> time<00:01:11.549> I've<00:01:12.540> been<00:01:12.689> working<00:01:13.020> on

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.929 

it<00:01:18.119> was<00:01:18.320> interesting<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.939> frequencies

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
it was interesting that the frequencies

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.469 
it was interesting that the frequencies
we<00:01:21.119> took<00:01:21.479> one<00:01:21.750> month<00:01:22.369> shifted<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:24.150> few

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
we took one month shifted just a few

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.690 
we took one month shifted just a few
weeks<00:01:24.659> later<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.890> I've<00:01:26.220> been<00:01:26.310> trying<00:01:26.640> to

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
weeks later so I've been trying to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.420 
weeks later so I've been trying to
figure<00:01:26.850> out<00:01:26.970> why<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.799> why<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.860> happened

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
figure out why the why this happened

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.340 
figure out why the why this happened
there's<00:01:29.670> some<00:01:29.790> theories<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.329> might<00:01:30.630> be

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
there's some theories that it might be

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.330 
there's some theories that it might be
eating<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
eating and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.840 
eating and
and<00:01:32.700> maybe<00:01:33.030> oblique<00:01:33.540> pulsator<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:37.850> we

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
and maybe oblique pulsator so we

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.690 
and maybe oblique pulsator so we
pulsator<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.960> stars<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.439> sum<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
pulsator it's the stars to sum the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.999 
pulsator it's the stars to sum the
access<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.210> pulsations<00:01:42.869> off<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.409> axis<00:01:43.799> of

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
access of pulsations off the axis of

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:53.139 
access of pulsations off the axis of
rotation<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:50.330> as<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.570> Earth<00:01:51.869> orbits<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.500> Sun

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
rotation so as the Earth orbits the Sun

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.819 
rotation so as the Earth orbits the Sun
the<00:01:54.149> orientation<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.140> stars<00:01:55.350> changes

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the orientation of the stars changes

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.219 
the orientation of the stars changes
from<00:01:55.950> night<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.310> night<00:01:56.340> also<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.780> precession

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
from night to night also the precession

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.499 
from night to night also the precession
of<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.350> earth<00:01:58.619> as<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.250> long-term<00:01:59.820> changes<00:02:00.299> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
of the earth as a long-term changes the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.050 
of the earth as a long-term changes the
apparent<00:02:01.110> position<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.679> stars<00:02:02.030> what<00:02:03.030> I

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
apparent position of the stars what I

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.029 
apparent position of the stars what I
did<00:02:03.329> was<00:02:03.509> wrote<00:02:03.720> script<00:02:04.079> which<00:02:04.229> takes<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.770> in

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
did was wrote script which takes the in

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
position of a star yes this way we can

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.900 
position of a star yes this way we can
see<00:02:13.230> if<00:02:13.650> there<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> better<00:02:14.430> way<00:02:14.640> for

see if there is a better way for

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.309 
see if there is a better way for

calculating the movement of the star
throughout<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.769> night<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.849> we're<00:02:17.970> trying<00:02:18.150> to

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
throughout the night so we're trying to

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.089 
throughout the night so we're trying to
use<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.959> software<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.620> we<00:02:19.739> borrowed<00:02:19.950> from

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
use the software that we borrowed from

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.170 
use the software that we borrowed from
someone<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.209> Vienna<00:02:21.569> who<00:02:22.380> has<00:02:22.640> his<00:02:23.640> model<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
someone in Vienna who has his model the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.180 
someone in Vienna who has his model the
convection<00:02:24.450> cells<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:24.989> Sun<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.470> he<00:02:25.530> has

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
convection cells in the Sun and he has

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.559 
convection cells in the Sun and he has
programmed<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.730> do<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.360> he's<00:02:27.450> been

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
programmed to do that that he's been

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.780 
programmed to do that that he's been
working<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:27.840> for<00:02:28.049> like<00:02:28.080> 17<00:02:28.590> years<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.580> instead

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
working on for like 17 years so instead

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.550 
working on for like 17 years so instead
of<00:02:29.849> doing<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.150> ourselves<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:30.810> asked<00:02:31.290> him<00:02:31.410> to

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
of doing that ourselves we asked him to

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.140 
of doing that ourselves we asked him to
borrow<00:02:31.709> his<00:02:32.220> program<00:02:32.580> see<00:02:32.819> if<00:02:32.880> we<00:02:32.970> could<00:02:33.120> use

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
borrow his program see if we could use

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.270 
borrow his program see if we could use
it<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.510> find<00:02:33.660> model<00:02:33.989> connections<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.220> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
it to find model connections in the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.330 
it to find model connections in the
white<00:02:35.430> dwarfs<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.799> we've<00:02:37.799> just<00:02:38.100> been<00:02:38.220> trying

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
white dwarfs and we've just been trying

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.599 
white dwarfs and we've just been trying
to<00:02:38.549> get<00:02:38.670> up<00:02:38.820> working<00:02:39.150> model<00:02:39.570> on<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.900> recently

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
to get up working model on that recently

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.729 
to get up working model on that recently
my<00:02:41.609> project<00:02:42.090> tackle<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.840> an<00:02:42.930> observational

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
my project tackle is an observational

my project tackle is an observational
problem<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.280> we've<00:02:44.400> been<00:02:44.549> having

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
problem that we've been having

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.330 
problem that we've been having
I<00:02:45.629> guess<00:02:46.170> all<00:02:46.319> the<00:02:46.439> years<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.980> been<00:02:47.219> doing

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
I guess all the years of it been doing

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.490 
I guess all the years of it been doing
this<00:02:47.579> sort<00:02:47.819> of<00:02:47.909> research<00:02:48.079> it<00:02:49.079> deals<00:02:49.260> with<00:02:49.379> the

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
this sort of research it deals with the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.630 
this sort of research it deals with the
fact<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:49.829> when<00:02:50.010> you're<00:02:50.129> looking<00:02:50.400> through<00:02:50.459> a

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
fact that when you're looking through a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.300 
fact that when you're looking through a
telescope<00:02:51.079> island<00:02:52.079> during<00:02:52.349> a<00:02:52.709> whole<00:02:53.069> night

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
telescope island during a whole night

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.280 
telescope island during a whole night
like<00:02:53.579> say<00:02:53.849> five<00:02:54.180> hours<00:02:54.510> at<00:02:54.719> a<00:02:54.780> time<00:02:54.989> which<00:02:55.260> is

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
like say five hours at a time which is

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.569 
like say five hours at a time which is
the<00:02:55.950> length<00:02:56.189> of<00:02:56.459> some<00:02:56.969> of<00:02:57.060> our<00:02:57.180> best<00:02:57.359> friends

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
the length of some of our best friends

the length of some of our best friends
the<00:02:59.579> atmosphere<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.269> then<00:03:00.780> right<00:03:01.049> above<00:03:01.319> you

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
the atmosphere is then right above you

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.130 
the atmosphere is then right above you
then<00:03:01.859> it<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.220> off<00:03:02.609> to<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:02.879> side<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.569> so<00:03:03.870> like

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
then it is off to the side and so like

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.330 
then it is off to the side and so like
throughout<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.470> night<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.769> looks<00:03:04.980> like<00:03:05.159> it's

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
throughout the night it looks like it's

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.220 
throughout the night it looks like it's
dim<00:03:05.579> getting<00:03:05.939> brighter<00:03:06.239> right<00:03:06.689> when<00:03:07.079> it's

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
dim getting brighter right when it's

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.649 
dim getting brighter right when it's
overhead<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.799> then<00:03:07.920> dinner<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:09.299> its<00:03:09.450> side

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
overhead and then dinner to its side

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.319 
overhead and then dinner to its side
again<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.200> since<00:03:11.010> we're<00:03:11.489> trying<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.849> look<00:03:12.060> for

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
again and since we're trying to look for

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.420 
again and since we're trying to look for
changes<00:03:12.629> in<00:03:13.139> brightness<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:14.099> generally

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
changes in brightness and generally

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.309 
changes in brightness and generally
what's<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.670> start<00:03:14.969> that<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.209> star<00:03:15.480> makes<00:03:15.780> we

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
what's the start that the star makes we

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.020 
what's the start that the star makes we
have<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.650> take<00:03:16.859> out<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.189> effects<00:03:17.639> that<00:03:17.670> that

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
have to take out the effects that that

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.229 
have to take out the effects that that
mascara<00:03:18.420> makes<00:03:18.659> and<00:03:19.220> we<00:03:20.220> have<00:03:20.430> sort<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.790> crude

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
mascara makes and we have sort of crude

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.030 
mascara makes and we have sort of crude
ways<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.750> doing<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.379> I'm<00:03:22.500> trying<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.889> come

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
ways of doing it and I'm trying to come

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.699 
ways of doing it and I'm trying to come
up<00:03:23.069> with<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.370> better<00:03:24.150> model<00:03:24.450> for<00:03:24.629> it<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.109> so<00:03:25.530> we

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
up with a better model for it and so we

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.399 
up with a better model for it and so we
can<00:03:25.889> find<00:03:26.159> an<00:03:26.370> actual<00:03:26.700> real<00:03:27.030> fit<00:03:27.419> and<00:03:27.750> take

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
can find an actual real fit and take

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.429 
can find an actual real fit and take
that<00:03:28.560> out<00:03:29.569> going<00:03:30.569> to<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.780> observatory<00:03:31.349> is

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
that out going to the observatory is

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.619 
that out going to the observatory is
probably<00:03:32.310> one<00:03:32.549> of<00:03:32.579> my<00:03:32.879> favorite<00:03:33.299> UT

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
probably one of my favorite UT

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.020 
probably one of my favorite UT
experiences<00:03:34.260> it's<00:03:35.069> a<00:03:35.430> great<00:03:35.760> learning

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
experiences it's a great learning

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.449 
experiences it's a great learning
experience<00:03:36.629> and<00:03:36.930> just<00:03:37.379> a<00:03:37.620> lot<00:03:37.889> of<00:03:37.950> fun<00:03:38.280> in
