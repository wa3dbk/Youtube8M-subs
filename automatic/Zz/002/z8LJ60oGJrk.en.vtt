00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.050
 yes 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.560
 Hi, guys and girls, I hope so 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.330
 see 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.700
 and well we're still here with the second 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.920
 chapter of the series 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.760
 to see that I have already here I can already create 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.530
 aleluya classes 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.920
 remember that I aim 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.970
 reach rank 55 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.560
 with a proportion greater than 5 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.450
 for now, 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.970
 I'm already doing my job because the 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.700
 only game that is or that from 25 to 25 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.620
 to 6 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.950
 so I'm not in proportion to so 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.320
 let's see if we get those casualties 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.360
 to enter into proportion 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.400
 when I'm not, I'm not playing, 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.680
 I'm recording I think of many things 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.780
 to tell you in the videos and the eyes 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.970
 they forget me all things like for example 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.050
 I have twitter follow me on twitter 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.040
 and they all really forget me why 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.040
 I start to play 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.230
 if it does not stop working the brain 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.150
 in the part that stores information is 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.650
 you must block me or something 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.480
 and is that I still cost a little 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.220
 the topic of commenting 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.310
 what cloth did not give him a bullet 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.610
 and in mode mode we're not going to throw the 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.610
 aerial 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.000
 suicide specialist by the way 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.000
 we go 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:45.170
 and that is scary and everything 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:49.400
 the direct telephone is ringing 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.060
 but in helicopter 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.060
 go dead 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.840
 or after the caller who remembers 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.560
 Now I call you I pledge I do not know who 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.560
 you are now I call you 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.990
 these games are pretty short and 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.420
 the truth is that I'm liking 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.709
 quite do this series that is me 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.700
 really liking the idea of ​​having a 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.160
 short series 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.160
 and brief more than short the series itself 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.150
 but short chapters quick chapters 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:25.500
 and fun fuck I do not give one and this 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:29.130
 on fire, come on, we are afraid of uncle 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.110
 to see this voice to the limit 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.830
 let's see I do not have bullets come to the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.520
 adventure with the gun 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.650
 one of the things he has noticed the most 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.480
 I have lost practice of having played 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.790
 both at bat the Finnish is the subject of the 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.370
 pistol in modern warfare costs me 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.320
 very much kill with a gun now but 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.550
 good and this of the recharges also 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.080
 annoying because instead of this you can 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.370
 recharge running and here you can 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.330
 let's go a young aunt 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.460
 this situation is usually given quite 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.780
 everything against everything is the fact that two 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:05.970
 guys are hitting and a third come 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.970
 and fuck fuck let's see if this one is 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.830
 outside 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.069
 look what you were waiting for 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.959
 get off during these here 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.010
 and I tell you , it bothers me a lot that two 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.109
 feet are sticking and a 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.109
 third to burst it 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.100
 fuck last battle the martyrdom uncle what 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.190
 mine with the martyrdoms we go to traction 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.190
 total 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.790
 the title test another martyrdom 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.520
 good to see if we find the peaks 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.270
 missing for 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.270
 to win the game 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.620
 doing the triple 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.129
 that goes for you your cousin man 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.310
 I think it's not bad, I think nothing is going 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.040
 wrong 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.080
 the game is 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.580
 but what can I put on 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.410
 in the proportion that I have proposed 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.170
 trunk does not give an endorsement to the guy 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.380
 now you throw 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.690
 fuck something else too that I think is 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.450
 important is that game without helmets 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.829
 I have some transports listen to 24 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.419
 km 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.289
 but good if I have to fix by 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.060
 everything then franz kafka good guys then 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.740

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.909
 that you have liked as always and until 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.909
