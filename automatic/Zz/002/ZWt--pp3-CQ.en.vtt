00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.700
 Let the family see where we are here. 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.309
 in a hair salon with a rose 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.650
 marrey and besides being an excellent 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.839
 she is over 13 years old. 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.449
 experience in hairdressing salons and 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.359
 we thought it would be ideal for 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.310
 to test the thermal alignment to the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.830
 give your own testimony 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.570
 It's okay, Roseli, well before long. 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.519
 Nothing, thank you very much for accepting our 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.109
 invitation and I will thank you for 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.070
 very happy to receive the invitation 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.469
 because I'm crazy to try 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.230
 the public as I know the products 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.770
 amb and I'm sure it's a good thing 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.100
 out there but I'm super curious to 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.739
 know the differential of this product 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.899
 You already worked in halls and speeches today. 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.020
 what is your opinion on the various 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.949
 options on the market today is only 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.350
 a lot of right 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.289
 but the big problem is that the methods 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.059
 that I have already used is that most of them 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.090
 are impractical 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.820
 besides this comes several cups of it 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.330
 complicates when applying the hair 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.760
 besides the dirt that all this does and 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.860
 some of them may even damage the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.080
 hair is true 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.509
 so here you are being so careful 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.009
 to offer a quality product and 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.130
 high performance 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.200
 You'll like it, I'm sure of it. 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.240
 besides the rose we are here with the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.030
 barge and with the tate 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.159
 the two are ANP officials and we 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.170
 we rely so much on this product that everything 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.509
 world wanted to participate 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.210
 the two made a point of experimenting 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.700
 treatment and now you will see a 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.950
 transformation and there is no longer any 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.329
 prepared so eager to see 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.020
 soon the result I think will stay 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.850
 very good 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.369
 it will be long there, because the process 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.680
 It's super fast. I think it'll look great. 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.259
 you which is expected accounts am 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.240
 very anxious to change for the better is always 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.950
 Good how you can see they have 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.510
 completely different hair 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.640
 different textures 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.650
 different characteristics and what 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.600
 will act perfectly on each of them 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.979
 because it can be used by any 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.620
 hair type 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.450
 now we are here with the fabola 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.630
 product product technique 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.390
 outsourcing to us with 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.910
 which is the use of the product the super product 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.220
 simple to use and a thermal alignment 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.900
 a single step is not necessary 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.300
 to clean before and after the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.340
 our client may be up to 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.040
 three days without washing the hair is 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.930
 important to use and not necessary 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.610
 apply an excessive amount of 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.560
 product is not what gives the result 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.110
 desired in the hair 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.820
 wick test is required 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.620
 so it is necessary to open and we already 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.420
 We perform the strand test in both 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.310
 models and hair 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.950
 they correspond to what we need 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.680
 to perform the procedure is 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.660
 important to stress that the professional 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.670
 you must do the wick test o 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.340
 capillary diagnosis identifying 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.140
 quality of hair texture structure 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.240
 good wire 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.090
 we have already performed the wick test reminding 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.070
 the pause of 20 minutes after this 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.530
 hair test in four 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.140
 parents to follow in the application 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.640
 Also note that the upgrade is 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.890
 indicated for use only . 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.420
 professionals and that they should follow the 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.750
 application protocol 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.080
 it is important to stress our client can 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.000
 being up to three days without washing your hair 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.040
 after this missile test in the hair 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.880
 four parts to give sequence in the 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:40.410
 application now let's spray what 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.690
 them remembering that there is no 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.950
 need to be a quantity 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.340
 excessive 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.680
 the product is already of the 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.150
 combability to the end 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:59.130
 Comb then we will renew 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:02.580
 a small amount already obeyed 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.480
 the wire and we can move on to next 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.480
 Mexico 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.019
 We've already done the first 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:14.019
 now just wait 20 minutes from paulo 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.669

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:30.039
