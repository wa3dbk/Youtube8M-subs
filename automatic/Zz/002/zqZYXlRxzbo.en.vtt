00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.289
 hi welcome to the fourth video of 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.800
 tutorial today we will discuss how to make videos 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:25.430
 for youtube putting pictures and 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.800
 adding us the sound above equal 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.640
 procedures you will see it done too 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.199
 for videos already of course 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.199
 previously saved or registered 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.660
 today, by the way, I also hope 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.309
 the purchase of my new video camera 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.640
 with whom I hope to do next 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:50.120
 months or enough fun 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.980
 here we begin by doing a little 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:58.489
 I review a little note what we do 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.350
 need to make a video for youtube in 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.460
 this kind 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.649
 first of all all we need is a 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.240
 computer that already has the function 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:13.390
 Microphone them to him if there was it 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.280
 will mark a system that all computers 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.580
 they own that is the function record 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.500
 external sounds 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.360
 the only thing we will go to is what is 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.209
 saying where to see if ours 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.780
 computer the microphone function that is 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:32.360
 it already has a stereo system that we can 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:38.709
 record already directly from the PC without 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:43.360
 the use of no object or 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:46.640
 external application or accessory or 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.380
 obviously this doesn't even serve a 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.050
 say if you have a video camera 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.229
 obviously there is already the microphone function 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.050
 so you can make gardens directly 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.429
 with a video camera 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.349
 but I don't do this anymore for 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.830
 those who like me most of all 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.480
 to make videos or did 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.870
 with this that since now I will have the 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:12.940
 stain the camera with the machine 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:17.430
 photographic and therefore the microphone does not 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.800
 there is usually to do it if we don't have 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.850
 already a video camera or a computer that has 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.740
 this function 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.110
 we will have to have a microphone since i 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.230
 Microphones on the market really cost 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.440
 so much of achieved something 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.350
 this kind of in the headphones they already have 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.230
 a microphone some of you will tell me 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.190
 that maybe it costs the same is not 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.110
 absolutely this is new 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.250
 the apparatus neither more nor less than three 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.350
 francs and 94 jockey inaugurates an average 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.950
 of 5 euros therefore a price enough 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.590
 accessible for anyone to find 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.660
 even on the internet a meat cap a 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.860
 microphone those used up for 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.950
 than a usual videogame or chifari 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.590
 Skype conversations are also found 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.180
 for very little money this tip like 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.850
 I had shown it took it for 4 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.920
 frankie more than useful for that 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.120
 what we need 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:22.840
 well we don't tear too much we see the 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.170
 system here we are to the boys first 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:31.540
 we have to go to our computer on 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.330
 start and click to start there 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.959
 will appear on this page 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.300
 we go and write on the computer 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.800
 sound recorder and let's try this 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.800
 application on the computer 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.290
 as mentioned before all the computers ce 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.080
 they have it and this is the function that 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.519
 must be done is if you will use the dop headphones 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.769
 or if you will be directly at the computer 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:00.489
 this will appear once crushed 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:03.310
 small program for registration 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:07.900
 sounds and start recording we will have i 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.440
 minutes and the green bar that practically 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.580
 it is a basis for the sound we will make of it 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.209
 will record crush start 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.980
 registration 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.519
 and as you see here will start the 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.519
 registration 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.530
 we obviously make the video that 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.730
 we intend to comment once that 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.780
 we finished 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:36.350
 let's stop recording and there 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:40.600
 the page will appear where we will have to 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:45.320
 save the audio file we just have 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.210
 created as you usually saw vi 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.560
 appears in the one where it is more recent than 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.710
 you make the saves and now I'll file 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.340
 save with name 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:07.430
 no sound test is better I will try 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:10.880
 sound save now entered on documents and 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.510
 I will look for the file as you can see it is 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:18.340
 here above sound test here is this 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:22.669
 the procedure to save an audio file 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.520
 through the computer as I read 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:29.030
 works with both of you existing 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.450
 try this first without attacking the 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:35.510
 headphones or microphone and then you see the 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:38.810
 sound or proof that you of the audio file 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.940
 that you've tried if the sound isn't there 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.240
 like because he looks like I do n't have not 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:48.229
 there is even then you will have to use 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.120
 headphones however at 90 percent the 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.610
 your computer should already be on 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:58.090
 able to do so without the use of 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.090
 good headphones is everything
