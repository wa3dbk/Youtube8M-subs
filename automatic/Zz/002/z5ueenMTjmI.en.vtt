00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:11.320
 so the disco guys are improved and 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.320
 bald in miguel will change it 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:20.970
 the workshop is tired is already screwed up well 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:25.199
 could that the truth was too bad 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.669
 then I went to buy the album I did not have 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.910
 to change because I had sold a 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.400
 disco with 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.740
 of screws this we no longer go to a rotor 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.560
 not legal 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.200
 then more yards etc. as the 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.140
 video 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.590
 see the strength in chinga I change it and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.350
 It was that simple what advantages it has 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.270
 this record 'of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.310
 to the sizes very 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:56.160
 it is a most current system 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:59.450
 but in braking 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.450
 the same 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.840
 these should be screw five or 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.040
 six screws 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.110
 like now and then the ballads that 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.190
 you are going to change the cuencia boys 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.690
 you have to be aware of being 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.090
 changing these because if you are not going to 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.090
 take out the record like me as I did 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.880
 then the workshop is in what street 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.880
 Miguel 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.759
 david or leave between revolution 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.990
 / revolution before reaching the market is 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.390
 as when before reaching the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.490
 market one block after the 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.640
 whereabouts of my four 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.689
 a good mechanic net very chinky 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.500
 do your services 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.830
 you change valero also rims you 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.229
 get bikes gun parts you can 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.439
 trust any bike from bikes 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.689
 iron up high-end bikes like the 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.060
 truth that you see there or mine 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.690
 naught high- end aircraft that night in 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.820
 would win for himself 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.740
 and there is my guel here you can 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.730
 find it you can see the business that is 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.420
 well, a 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.060
 parking and from there you see the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.780
 Escaleritas and you're here with me 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.700
 ya look and got the balatas these are 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.440
 the news 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.440
 let's see the old relationships 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.819
 see how the misshapen metal looks 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.020
 because he's already slowing down with the cigar 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:47.840
 metal checks from the others and they are already 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.560
 arming they still have their pasta and it's 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.780
 they no longer have pasta 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.030
 then this is what I was 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.100
 braking nothing else will be with a small 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.530
 part of him 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.610
 of the disk and no longer braking correctly 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.500
 where he made the record and it was worth then 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.980
 Each flight must check the balatas 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.980
 millions 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.090
 depending on the use for example and although 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.819
 the daily use Monday through Friday until 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.670
 Saturdays and Sundays 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:20.459
 how can one check it without having 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.560
 to have it to the mechanic you know someone 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.959
 that knows like you then if you do not want 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.959
 disassemble nothing more with a bulb 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:36.989
 you see guys then lumin I walk without 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.790
 disassemble the rim with a lamp 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:43.400
 you can see how much dough is how 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.400
 life time then you have to open it 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.360
 As they are new it brings a wire and it is 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:55.510
 on average to separate then here 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.510
 put the screwdriver to open them a little 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.680
 and that without making it strong for crosses of 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.430
 forms the casualties there is already seen 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.430
 we have to sell insurance 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.710
 like what 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.680
 if they notice me there I can illuminate with the 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.870
 cell light 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.889
 and looks looks 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:31.770
 and there is already put him in secure Miguel 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.770
 and it's that simple now with the rim 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.120
 the mount with a new disc is the 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.120
 my shimano truth of mine 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.120
 well this is how it is a change of 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.699
 balatas and discs 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.699
 forward guys the next video
