Welcome to "Is it a Good Idea to 
 Microwave This?" I'm your host, Jory Caron.

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:21.244
Here, I've got the cutest, cutest litte piece of fake! It's a kitty-cat, and I've 
 nurtured it and loved it, and I named it "Fluffy Periwinkles, the Mischievous Cat"!

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:32.389
What's cuter than a little mischievous cat, you ask? Maybe a cute cat playing 
 with yarn? Or a cute cat that's on fire in my microwave!

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:37.935
Oh! There it goes! (laughs)

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.242
Jory: Is it a good idea to microwave this?

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:55.779
Let's find out! Here at the Jory Caron Laboratory, safety is our number-one concern. And that's why we 
 hide behind this giant tin foil shield. It's to protect our nuts, because nobody likes roasted...

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:58.188
Riley: Tama-goochie! "Tama-goochie" is the name of him!

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.660
Oh, It's not just "Pink Kitty-Cat Thing"?

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:03.862
Nope! Tama-goochie!

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:07.565
Jon: I think you're wrong. I think you're an idiot!

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.068
Jory: Whatever!

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.770
None of you have one!

00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:12.821
*electronic beeping*

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:22.539
We also have these fans, to circulate the air, and our new Panasonic microwave. Her 
 name is Whoopi, and incidentally, we also shoot on a Panasonic camera. Sponsorship?

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:24.683
Jon: No!

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:34.850
I'm just throwin' it out there! Maybe it could... We'll do lunch or something! Okay, let's open this 
 bad girl up! Put this thing in there, right in the middle there, and close this girl!

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:40.095
Jory: I wonder how long I should put it 
 in there for? Well, let's think... Tamagotchi, Tama...

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.450
Jon: It's not actually a Tama-goochie!

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:43.870
Whatever!

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:45.700
Jon: So, put it in for four minutes.

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.870
Jory: Four minutes? Okay, let's go!

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.840
Jon: Do it!

00:01:52.152 --> 00:01:54.150
Jory: Oh! Brilliant colors!

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:57.510
Jon and Riley: (meowing like cat)

00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:00.000
Jon: (in cat voice) Meow! I'm dying! Meow!

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:05.420
Jory: Just picture what it sounds like when you 
accidentally kick your cat into the garbage disposal...

00:02:06.502 --> 00:02:08.500
Jon: (meowing and making blender sounds)

00:02:08.546 --> 00:02:10.550
Riley: (singing) Smoke!

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:12.590
Jon and Riley: OH!

00:02:11.704 --> 00:02:13.700
Jory: That was awesome, that was awesome!

00:02:13.793 --> 00:02:15.790
Jon: Nice!

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.700
Riley: Wow!

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:17.840
Jory: Okay, let's turn this bitch off!

00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:20.950
Jon: Alright, let's turn that off. Alright, go in there, Jory. 
 Put it out before it burns our microwave away!

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:22.710
Riley: Go, go, go!

00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:30.020
Riley: Smells kinda...

00:02:30.217 --> 00:02:32.220
Jory: Death-like?

00:02:31.785 --> 00:02:33.780
Riley: Like garbage-disposal cat?

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:37.190
Jon: [Beep] me! That's still on fire!

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:40.490
Jory: Let's see if I can pull this out 
in one piece... Luckily for me, I can!

00:02:41.595 --> 00:02:43.600
Riley: That smells great! Look at all the spiderwebs!

00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:45.750
Jory: You might wanna get back, 'cause I feel like...

00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:47.230
Jon: Whoa, Jory!

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:47.970
Riley: It's still on fire!

00:02:50.713 --> 00:02:52.710
Jon: (laughs) Jesus Christ!

00:02:53.273 --> 00:03:00.270
Riley: (laughs) That thing went back on fire in his hand! He's, like, "What's 
wrong with THIS picture?! Why are you guys yelling away? I don't understand!"

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:05.320
Jory: You guys just scared the [beep] outta me!

00:03:04.877 --> 00:03:06.880
Jon: Your whole arm was gonna catch on fire, dude!

00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:09.290
Riley: It lit BACK on fire, like outta nothing!

00:03:17.788 --> 00:03:20.790
Jory: Damn! Don't ever underestimate the, uh...

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.030
Jon: Tama-goochie?

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.170
Jory: The sly cat! Now, it's inside the blender!

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.870
Jon: You trapped away all the oxygen. That was ridiculous, dude!

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:30.280
Riley: That was awesome! That's why HE'S the host!

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:38.540
So, you may be wondering, is it a good idea to 
microwave a kitty-cat? Oh, Jesus Christ... No, it's not!

00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:42.960
Jon: It almost took your [beep]in' hand off, dude!

00:03:43.283 --> 00:03:45.280
Riley: It was so funny, 'cause he's just, like...

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:47.820
Jon: (imitating Jory) "What's the problem? Oh, God, I'm on fire!"

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:52.560
Riley: Oh, God! He's, like, "What's wrong, what's wrong? I don't see anything! Why's 
it getting hot in here? I thought it was 30 degrees outside!"

00:03:53.467 --> 00:04:00.470
Well, that's about it for "Is it a Good Idea to Microwave This?" I'm your 
host, Jory Caron. Stay tuned! We'll have another episode eventually. Go for it!

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.140
Fire safety is our next topic!

00:04:02.788 --> 00:04:09.790
*end credits play*

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:14.220
Jory: (imitating Tom Dickson) Blender smoke! Don't breathe this!

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.490
Jory: I think Fluffy Periwinkles is enjoying it, don't you?
