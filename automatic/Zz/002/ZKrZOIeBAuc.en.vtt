00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
that are released since um states that

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.009 
that are released since um states that
it's<00:04:18.010> illegal<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.549> turn<00:04:18.729> that<00:04:18.880> off<00:04:19.120> but<00:04:19.450> at<00:04:19.780> any

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
it's illegal to turn that off but at any

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.950 
it's illegal to turn that off but at any
point<00:04:20.109> during<00:04:20.530> an<00:04:20.799> arrest<00:04:21.100> so<00:04:21.850> I<00:04:21.880> guess<00:04:22.600> it

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
point during an arrest so I guess it

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.280 
point during an arrest so I guess it
does<00:04:23.200> depend<00:04:23.560> state<00:04:23.890> to<00:04:24.040> state
