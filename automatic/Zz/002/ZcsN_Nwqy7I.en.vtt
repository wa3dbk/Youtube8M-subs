alright hey guys today I'll be showing
you<00:00:03.030> my<00:00:03.149> new<00:00:03.360> csgo<00:00:03.990> key<00:00:04.410> generator<00:00:04.859> or<00:00:05.279> Keith's

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
you my new csgo key generator or Keith's

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.970 
you my new csgo key generator or Keith's
life<00:00:05.910> case<00:00:06.180> generator<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:06.779> guess<00:00:07.049> because<00:00:07.859> it

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
life case generator I guess because it

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.509 
life case generator I guess because it
does<00:00:08.099> both<00:00:08.690> its<00:00:09.690> downloaded<00:00:10.380> link<00:00:11.280> will<00:00:11.400> be<00:00:11.490> in

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
does both its downloaded link will be in

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.539 
does both its downloaded link will be in
the<00:00:11.610> description<00:00:13.130> that's<00:00:14.130> gonna<00:00:14.309> download

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
the description that's gonna download

it's pretty quick download I don't know

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.400 
it's pretty quick download I don't know
why<00:00:17.340> I'll<00:00:17.609> probably<00:00:17.910> actually<00:00:18.240> compress<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.990> I

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
why I'll probably actually compress it I

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.170

good<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.700> know<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.120> coding<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:34.430> redid<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
good you know the coding I I redid the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.549 
good you know the coding I I redid the
whole<00:00:35.760> coding<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.450> software<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.290> time

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
whole coding on the software this time

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.069 
whole coding on the software this time
and<00:00:38.430> then<00:00:38.610> I'm<00:00:38.730> gonna<00:00:38.820> crypt<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.239> file<00:00:39.450> when

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
and then I'm gonna crypt the file when

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.660 
and then I'm gonna crypt the file when
I'm<00:00:40.170> done<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.469> make<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.739> smaller<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.399> guys

I'm done and make it smaller so you guys
won't<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.210> download<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.660> much<00:00:42.840> code<00:00:43.379> this

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
won't have to download so much code this

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.560 
won't have to download so much code this
is<00:00:44.370> what<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> program<00:00:44.730> looks<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.090> after

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
is what the program looks like after

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.880 
is what the program looks like after
you've<00:00:45.660> done<00:00:45.750> down<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.379> open<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.770> up
