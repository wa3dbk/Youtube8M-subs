00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.170 
brought to you by the physics department
at<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.350> Colorado<00:00:04.740> School<00:00:04.859> of<00:00:05.009> Mines<00:00:05.100> my<00:00:06.000> name

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
at the Colorado School of Mines my name

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.639 
at the Colorado School of Mines my name
is<00:00:06.270> Eric<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.720> I'm<00:00:07.080> Nicole

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
is Eric and I'm Nicole

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.709 
is Eric and I'm Nicole
okay<00:00:08.490> we've<00:00:08.880> been<00:00:08.970> talking<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.269> lot<00:00:09.420> about<00:00:09.450> the

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
okay we've been talking a lot about the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.390 
okay we've been talking a lot about the
dispersion<00:00:10.019> we<00:00:10.620> know<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.830> dispersion<00:00:11.190> is

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
dispersion we know the dispersion is

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.009 
dispersion we know the dispersion is
just<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.700> bucket<00:00:12.090> we<00:00:12.269> pour<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.660> electrons

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
just the bucket we pour the electrons

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.350 
just the bucket we pour the electrons
into<00:00:13.290> yeah<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.730> we<00:00:14.849> really<00:00:15.059> need<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.330> think

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
into yeah so we really need to think

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.510 
into yeah so we really need to think
about<00:00:15.660> which<00:00:16.080> states<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> dispersion<00:00:17.400> are

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
about which states in the dispersion are

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.519 
about which states in the dispersion are
actually<00:00:17.970> occupied<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.289> end<00:00:19.439> we're

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
actually occupied to that end we're

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.689 
actually occupied to that end we're
gonna<00:00:19.590> do<00:00:19.770> some<00:00:19.920> rather<00:00:20.039> important<00:00:20.490> beam

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
gonna do some rather important beam

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.700 
gonna do some rather important beam
counting<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.359> episode<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:22.260> addresses

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
counting in this episode that addresses

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.029 
counting in this episode that addresses
how<00:00:22.920> our<00:00:23.130> electrons<00:00:23.550> fill<00:00:24.180> our<00:00:24.359> bands<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:25.039> know

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
how our electrons fill our bands I know

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.250 
how our electrons fill our bands I know
that<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.460> plot<00:00:26.699> band<00:00:27.000> structures<00:00:27.539> from<00:00:27.990> k

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
that we plot band structures from k

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.859 
that we plot band structures from k
equals<00:00:28.710> minus<00:00:29.099> PI<00:00:29.310> over<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> 2<00:00:29.970> PI<00:00:30.210> over<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
equals minus PI over a 2 PI over a and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.280 
equals minus PI over a 2 PI over a and
the<00:00:31.439> line<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.830> really<00:00:32.009> only<00:00:32.340> semi<00:00:32.610> continuous

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
the line is really only semi continuous

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.080 
the line is really only semi continuous
and<00:00:34.290> by<00:00:34.469> semi<00:00:34.739> continuous<00:00:35.040> you're<00:00:35.850> saying

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
and by semi continuous you're saying

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.030 
and by semi continuous you're saying
that<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> line<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.660> actually<00:00:36.870> composed<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.950> a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
that the line is actually composed of a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.160 
that the line is actually composed of a
series<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.430> discrete<00:00:38.969> K<00:00:39.210> points<00:00:39.600> each

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
series of discrete K points each

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.700 
series of discrete K points each
separated<00:00:40.829> by<00:00:40.950> 2<00:00:41.010> PI<00:00:41.340> over<00:00:41.640> L<00:00:41.760> yeah<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.260> 1d

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
separated by 2 PI over L yeah so in 1d

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.940 
separated by 2 PI over L yeah so in 1d
each<00:00:44.309> band<00:00:44.730> spans<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.629> reciprocal<00:00:46.260> distance<00:00:46.680> of

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
each band spans a reciprocal distance of

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.060 
each band spans a reciprocal distance of
2<00:00:47.430> pi<00:00:47.640> over<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.090> then<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.200> number<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.620> discrete

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
2 pi over a then the number of discrete

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.490 
2 pi over a then the number of discrete
K<00:00:50.280> points<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.879> band<00:00:51.180> must<00:00:51.690> be<00:00:51.840> equal<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
K points in band must be equal to the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.700 
K points in band must be equal to the
number<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.860> unit<00:00:53.160> cells<00:00:53.370> n<00:00:54.059> yep<00:00:54.899> how<00:00:55.530> many

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
number of unit cells n yep how many

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.670 
number of unit cells n yep how many
electrons<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> band<00:00:56.640> hold<00:00:56.940> them<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:58.410> n

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
electrons can the band hold them to n

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.220 
electrons can the band hold them to n
since<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.820> put<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> spin<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> spin

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
since we can put a spin up and a spin

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.770 
since we can put a spin up and a spin
down<00:01:01.440> electron<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.190> each<00:01:02.309> mode<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.300> depending

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
down electron in each mode and depending

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.990 
down electron in each mode and depending
on<00:01:03.870> how<00:01:04.019> filled<00:01:04.379> these<00:01:04.589> bands<00:01:04.830> are<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.430> how

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
on how filled these bands are and how

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.760 
on how filled these bands are and how
they're<00:01:06.210> arranged<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:07.290> can<00:01:07.409> get<00:01:07.530> four

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
they're arranged we can get four

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.429 
they're arranged we can get four
different<00:01:07.979> types<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.490> materials

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.160 

on<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:12.340> two<00:01:12.490> extremes<00:01:12.969> we<00:01:13.329> have<00:01:13.450> metals<00:01:13.840> and

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
on the two extremes we have metals and

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.380 
on the two extremes we have metals and
insulators<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:15.549> between<00:01:15.850> we<00:01:16.030> have<00:01:16.060> semi

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
insulators in between we have semi

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.870 
insulators in between we have semi
metals<00:01:16.689> and<00:01:16.990> semiconductors<00:01:17.259> and<00:01:18.069> their

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
metals and semiconductors and their

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.910 
metals and semiconductors and their
shading<00:01:19.270> along<00:01:19.359> the<00:01:19.630> bands<00:01:20.049> indicates<00:01:20.619> the

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
shading along the bands indicates the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:31.140 
shading along the bands indicates the
occupied<00:01:21.280> states<00:01:21.549> you<00:01:22.329> got<00:01:22.539> it

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.610 

we<00:01:32.150> can<00:01:32.300> also<00:01:32.450> show<00:01:32.720> this<00:01:32.900> in<00:01:33.200> terms<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.560> the

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
we can also show this in terms of the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.140 
we can also show this in terms of the
density<00:01:34.070> of<00:01:34.100> states

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.960 

all<00:01:40.020> right<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.410> let's<00:01:41.040> test<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.550> with<00:01:41.820> some

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
all right so let's test this with some

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.300 
all right so let's test this with some
real-world<00:01:42.150> examples

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
real-world examples

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.500 
real-world examples
okay<00:01:44.310> how<00:01:44.520> about<00:01:44.550> carbon<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.120> the<00:01:45.210> diamond

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
okay how about carbon in the diamond

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.710 
okay how about carbon in the diamond
structure<00:01:46.280> well<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.520> carbon<00:01:48.300> has<00:01:48.450> four

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
structure well I know carbon has four

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.110 
structure well I know carbon has four
electrons<00:01:49.010> so<00:01:50.010> we're<00:01:50.160> going<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.610> an<00:01:50.760> even

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
electrons so we're going to have an even

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.970 
electrons so we're going to have an even
number<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.450> electrons<00:01:51.990> regardless<00:01:52.830> of

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
number of electrons regardless of

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.010 
number of electrons regardless of
whether<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.340> consider<00:01:53.730> the<00:01:54.000> primitive<00:01:54.450> or<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
whether we consider the primitive or the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.800 
whether we consider the primitive or the
conventional<00:01:55.530> cell<00:01:56.090> since<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.210> know<00:01:57.270> diamond

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
conventional cell since I know diamond

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.630 
conventional cell since I know diamond
is<00:01:57.930> transparent<00:01:58.620> I'm<00:01:58.860> going<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.130> guess<00:01:59.340> that

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
is transparent I'm going to guess that

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.760 
is transparent I'm going to guess that
there's<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.910> big<00:02:00.180> gap<00:02:00.450> between<00:02:00.480> a<00:02:01.080> filled<00:02:01.470> band

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
there's a big gap between a filled band

how<00:02:07.170> about<00:02:07.290> if<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.410> looked<00:02:07.650> at<00:02:07.770> gallium

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
how about if we looked at gallium

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.480 
how about if we looked at gallium
arsenide<00:02:08.369> well<00:02:09.350> together<00:02:10.350> gallium<00:02:11.280> and

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
arsenide well together gallium and

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.610 
arsenide well together gallium and
arsenic<00:02:11.880> bring<00:02:12.240> eight<00:02:12.540> valence<00:02:12.870> electrons<00:02:13.500> to

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
arsenic bring eight valence electrons to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.680 
arsenic bring eight valence electrons to
the<00:02:13.770> table<00:02:14.130> so<00:02:14.670> again<00:02:14.970> we<00:02:15.150> have<00:02:15.330> an<00:02:15.420> even

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
the table so again we have an even

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.600 
the table so again we have an even
number<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.320> I'm<00:02:17.010> gonna<00:02:17.190> go<00:02:17.340> with<00:02:17.490> an

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
number and I'm gonna go with an

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.430 
number and I'm gonna go with an
insulator<00:02:18.030> or<00:02:18.300> maybe<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.750> semiconductor

that's<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.250> reasonable<00:02:20.640> guess<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.240> turns

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
that's a reasonable guess and it turns

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.060 
that's a reasonable guess and it turns
out<00:02:21.600> gallium<00:02:21.930> arsenide<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.350> a<00:02:22.410> semi<00:02:22.650> conductor

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
out gallium arsenide is a semi conductor

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.310 
out gallium arsenide is a semi conductor
with<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.670> gap<00:02:23.940> between<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.450> filled<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.020> empty

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
for gallium arsenide isn't so terrible

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.240 
for gallium arsenide isn't so terrible
since<00:02:31.170> who<00:02:31.260> think<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.709> as<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.830> diamond-like

move on to lithium
okay<00:02:38.220> well<00:02:38.820> that's<00:02:38.940> easy<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.510> know<00:02:39.840> lithium<00:02:40.410> is

okay well that's easy I know lithium is

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.180 
CoreStates the valence band is half
filled<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.060> guess<00:02:48.330> in<00:02:48.510> metal

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.400 

sure<00:02:55.190> but<00:02:55.730> then<00:02:55.850> let's<00:02:56.000> add<00:02:56.150> an<00:02:56.270> electron<00:02:56.900> why

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
sure but then let's add an electron why

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.000 
sure but then let's add an electron why
is<00:02:57.470> beryllium<00:02:57.770> a<00:02:58.040> medal<00:02:58.750> hmm<00:02:59.750> that's<00:03:00.170> weird<00:03:00.680> so

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
is beryllium a medal hmm that's weird so

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.940 
is beryllium a medal hmm that's weird so
we've<00:03:01.580> got<00:03:01.760> two<00:03:01.970> electrons<00:03:02.480> per<00:03:02.720> atom<00:03:02.950> so

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
we've got two electrons per atom so

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.440 
we've got two electrons per atom so
regardless<00:03:04.370> of<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.670> crystal<00:03:05.150> structure

regardless of the crystal structure
we're<00:03:05.870> going<00:03:06.110> to<00:03:06.230> have<00:03:06.350> an<00:03:06.500> even<00:03:06.740> number<00:03:06.890> of

we're going to have an even number of

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
electrons I want to say that the band's

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.650 
electrons I want to say that the band's
will<00:03:10.070> be<00:03:10.190> fully<00:03:10.430> filled<00:03:10.760> but<00:03:11.270> that<00:03:11.390> doesn't

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
will be fully filled but that doesn't

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.690 
will be fully filled but that doesn't
agree<00:03:11.810> with<00:03:11.870> beryllium<00:03:12.200> being<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.770> metal<00:03:13.040> I'm

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
agree with beryllium being a metal I'm

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.450 
agree with beryllium being a metal I'm
just<00:03:13.910> gonna<00:03:14.060> let<00:03:14.180> you<00:03:14.210> drift<00:03:14.540> in<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.780> breeze

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
just gonna let you drift in the breeze

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.040 
just gonna let you drift in the breeze
fine<00:03:16.460> I<00:03:16.610> don't<00:03:16.760> need<00:03:16.940> your<00:03:17.150> help<00:03:17.390> anyway

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
fine I don't need your help anyway

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.700 
fine I don't need your help anyway
so<00:03:19.010> beryllium<00:03:19.670> z--<00:03:19.790> 2p<00:03:20.660> orbitals<00:03:21.170> must<00:03:21.560> have

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
so beryllium z-- 2p orbitals must have

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.770 
so beryllium z-- 2p orbitals must have
dropped<00:03:21.980> down<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:22.580> mixed<00:03:23.120> with<00:03:23.240> the<00:03:23.420> 2's

orbital leading to multiple bands at the
Fermi<00:03:26.360> level<00:03:26.660> there<00:03:27.110> you<00:03:27.200> go

Fermi level there you go

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.780 
Fermi level there you go
we<00:03:27.830> can<00:03:28.010> actually<00:03:28.160> see<00:03:28.430> this<00:03:28.580> in<00:03:28.730> the

we can actually see this in the

we can actually see this in the

calculated dispersion actually seeing

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.550 
calculated dispersion actually seeing
this<00:03:31.490> dispersion<00:03:31.940> I<00:03:32.360> think<00:03:32.930> I<00:03:33.020> can<00:03:33.200> take<00:03:33.350> this

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
this dispersion I think I can take this

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.590 
this dispersion I think I can take this
a<00:03:33.620> step<00:03:33.740> further

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
a step further

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.430 
a step further
what's<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:35.750> crystal<00:03:36.050> structure<00:03:36.410> of

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
what's the crystal structure of

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.420 
what's the crystal structure of
beryllium<00:03:37.030> exactly<00:03:38.030> close-packed<00:03:38.530> okay<00:03:39.560> that

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
beryllium exactly close-packed okay that

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.010 
beryllium exactly close-packed okay that
means<00:03:40.640> it's<00:03:40.820> got<00:03:40.940> two<00:03:41.270> atoms<00:03:41.720> in<00:03:41.870> its

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
means it's got two atoms in its

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.410 
means it's got two atoms in its
primitive<00:03:42.260> cell<00:03:42.710> and<00:03:43.100> thus<00:03:43.940> we're<00:03:44.120> going<00:03:44.150> to

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
primitive cell and thus we're going to

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
primitive cell and thus we're going to
dump<00:03:44.570> four<00:03:44.990> electrons<00:03:45.560> into<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:45.980> bands<00:03:47.440> you

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
dump four electrons into the bands you

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.900 
dump four electrons into the bands you
might<00:03:48.620> think<00:03:48.920> this<00:03:49.070> should<00:03:49.280> fill<00:03:49.520> the<00:03:49.670> first

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
might think this should fill the first

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.580 
might think this should fill the first
two<00:03:50.090> bands<00:03:50.330> and<00:03:50.630> give<00:03:50.750> us<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.990> highest<00:03:51.410> energy

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
two bands and give us the highest energy

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.490 
two bands and give us the highest energy
electron<00:03:52.220> back<00:03:52.580> at<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.850> gamma<00:03:53.090> point

sounding<00:03:54.500> good<00:03:54.590> so<00:03:54.770> far<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.220> in<00:03:56.150> that<00:03:56.330> case

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
sounding good so far and in that case

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.080 
sounding good so far and in that case
the<00:03:57.020> next<00:03:57.320> lowest<00:03:57.710> energy<00:03:58.130> state<00:03:58.400> would<00:03:58.820> also

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
the next lowest energy state would also

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.510 
the next lowest energy state would also
be<00:03:59.510> at<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.720> gamma<00:03:59.930> point<00:04:00.280> so<00:04:01.280> when<00:04:01.430> the

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
be at the gamma point so when the

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.699 
be at the gamma point so when the
unoccupied<00:04:01.910> band<00:04:02.540> drops<00:04:02.959> down<00:04:03.290> into<00:04:03.620> the

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
unoccupied band drops down into the

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.280 
unoccupied band drops down into the
occupied<00:04:04.040> band<00:04:04.550> the<00:04:05.120> overlap<00:04:05.630> starts<00:04:06.140> at

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
occupied band the overlap starts at

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.680 
occupied band the overlap starts at
gamma<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:06.890> you<00:04:07.640> can<00:04:07.850> see<00:04:08.060> this<00:04:08.240> in<00:04:08.510> the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
gamma and you can see this in the

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.090 
gamma and you can see this in the
calculated<00:04:09.260> dispersion

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
calculated dispersion

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.490 
calculated dispersion
is<00:04:11.180> this<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.390> same<00:04:12.600> sort<00:04:12.840> of<00:04:12.900> behavior<00:04:12.990> we'd

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
is this the same sort of behavior we'd

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.530 
is this the same sort of behavior we'd
see<00:04:13.710> in<00:04:13.860> other<00:04:14.100> models<00:04:14.310> I'd<00:04:15.120> say<00:04:15.300> this<00:04:15.390> is<00:04:15.480> a

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
see in other models I'd say this is a

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.840 
see in other models I'd say this is a
really<00:04:16.110> clean<00:04:16.410> example<00:04:16.950> actually<00:04:17.370> since

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
really clean example actually since

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.670 
really clean example actually since
you're<00:04:18.000> only<00:04:18.120> dealing<00:04:18.390> with<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.720> 2's<00:04:19.110> the<00:04:19.350> 2p

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
you're only dealing with the 2's the 2p

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.010 
you're only dealing with the 2's the 2p
orbitals<00:04:20.220> let's<00:04:20.940> take<00:04:21.120> zinc<00:04:21.360> as<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:21.570> second

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
orbitals let's take zinc as a second

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.220 
orbitals let's take zinc as a second
metal<00:04:22.290> example<00:04:23.000> okay<00:04:24.000> so<00:04:24.240> we're<00:04:24.630> looking<00:04:25.020> at

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
metal example okay so we're looking at

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.290 
metal example okay so we're looking at
the<00:04:25.770> far<00:04:26.010> right<00:04:26.040> side<00:04:26.490> of<00:04:26.670> the<00:04:26.760> transition

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
the far right side of the transition

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.680 
the far right side of the transition
metals<00:04:27.600> ah<00:04:28.820> again<00:04:29.820> we<00:04:30.000> see<00:04:30.210> that<00:04:30.420> there's<00:04:30.600> an

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
metals ah again we see that there's an

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.050 
metals ah again we see that there's an
even<00:04:30.990> number<00:04:31.230> of<00:04:31.290> electrons<00:04:31.770> and<00:04:32.610> we<00:04:32.760> look<00:04:32.940> to

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
even number of electrons and we look to

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.490 
even number of electrons and we look to
the<00:04:33.150> calculated<00:04:33.540> dispersion<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.350> whole

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
the calculated dispersion the whole

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.350 
the calculated dispersion the whole
thing's<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:34.860> mess<00:04:35.010> with<00:04:35.580> many<00:04:35.820> bands<00:04:36.120> at<00:04:36.270> the

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
thing's a mess with many bands at the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.490 
thing's a mess with many bands at the
Fermi<00:04:36.570> energy

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.680 

so<00:04:42.310> now<00:04:42.400> we<00:04:42.460> can<00:04:42.670> see<00:04:42.790> that<00:04:42.910> in<00:04:43.030> real<00:04:43.240> systems

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
so now we can see that in real systems

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.390 
so now we can see that in real systems
we<00:04:44.080> need<00:04:44.230> to<00:04:44.290> be<00:04:44.380> careful<00:04:44.800> about<00:04:44.890> predicting

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
we need to be careful about predicting

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.350 
we need to be careful about predicting
how<00:04:45.550> we<00:04:45.610> fill<00:04:45.910> our<00:04:46.060> vans<00:04:47.730> okay<00:04:48.760> so<00:04:49.120> what<00:04:49.270> would

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
how we fill our vans okay so what would

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.660 
how we fill our vans okay so what would
a<00:04:49.420> semi<00:04:49.660> metal<00:04:49.990> look<00:04:50.170> like<00:04:50.350> well<00:04:51.220> cadmium

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
a semi metal look like well cadmium

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.400 
a semi metal look like well cadmium
oxide<00:04:51.790> is<00:04:52.090> a<00:04:52.150> nice<00:04:52.300> example<00:04:52.480> of<00:04:52.780> a<00:04:52.870> semi<00:04:53.140> metal

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
oxide is a nice example of a semi metal

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.110 
oxide is a nice example of a semi metal
here<00:04:54.010> we<00:04:54.100> can<00:04:54.220> see<00:04:54.370> how<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:54.520> Fermi<00:04:54.850> level

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
here we can see how the Fermi level

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.510 
here we can see how the Fermi level
splits<00:04:55.360> between<00:04:55.870> two<00:04:56.050> bands<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:57.370> we're

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
splits between two bands and we're

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.040 
splits between two bands and we're
calling<00:04:57.850> it<00:04:57.940> a<00:04:58.000> semi<00:04:58.210> metal<00:04:58.540> because<00:04:58.870> there's

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
calling it a semi metal because there's

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.840 
calling it a semi metal because there's
no<00:04:59.230> crossing<00:04:59.590> of<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.130> two<00:05:00.310> bands<00:05:00.580> at<00:05:00.790> the

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
no crossing of the two bands at the

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.150 
no crossing of the two bands at the
Fermi<00:05:01.180> level<00:05:01.450> exactly<00:05:02.050> you<00:05:02.650> can<00:05:02.800> see<00:05:02.980> this

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
Fermi level exactly you can see this

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.040 
Fermi level exactly you can see this
further<00:05:03.430> by<00:05:03.970> looking<00:05:04.300> at<00:05:04.420> outline<00:05:04.810> with

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
further by looking at outline with

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.350 
further by looking at outline with
calcium<00:05:05.440> oxide<00:05:05.890> as<00:05:06.520> we<00:05:06.700> all<00:05:06.820> know<00:05:06.940> Academy

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
calcium oxide as we all know Academy

amaq<00:05:07.570> side<00:05:07.810> with<00:05:08.290> calcium<00:05:08.650> oxide<00:05:09.070> we<00:05:09.580> can<00:05:09.730> pull

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
amaq side with calcium oxide we can pull

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.580 
amaq side with calcium oxide we can pull
these<00:05:10.090> bands<00:05:10.300> apart<00:05:10.660> and<00:05:10.900> end<00:05:11.260> up<00:05:11.380> with<00:05:11.500> an

these bands apart and end up with an

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.830 
these bands apart and end up with an
insulator<00:05:13.530> okay<00:05:14.530> so<00:05:15.070> let's<00:05:15.220> do<00:05:15.400> a<00:05:15.430> recap<00:05:15.910> today

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
insulator okay so let's do a recap today

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.440 
insulator okay so let's do a recap today
we<00:05:17.050> introduced<00:05:17.500> metals<00:05:18.030> semi<00:05:19.030> metals

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
we introduced metals semi metals

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.070 
we introduced metals semi metals
semiconductors<00:05:20.290> and<00:05:21.190> insulators<00:05:21.600> in<00:05:22.600> general

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
semiconductors and insulators in general

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.320 
semiconductors and insulators in general
I'd<00:05:23.560> say<00:05:23.860> that<00:05:24.040> classifying<00:05:24.640> materials<00:05:25.150> is

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
I'd say that classifying materials is

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.760 
I'd say that classifying materials is
pretty<00:05:25.540> easy<00:05:25.780> if<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:26.110> know<00:05:26.200> the<00:05:26.380> dispersion

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
pretty easy if you know the dispersion

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.980 
pretty easy if you know the dispersion
but<00:05:27.700> that<00:05:27.880> it's<00:05:28.000> pretty<00:05:28.180> tricky<00:05:28.450> to<00:05:28.600> predict

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
but that it's pretty tricky to predict

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.580 
but that it's pretty tricky to predict
