00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
make them and I'm truly trying to come

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.400 
make them and I'm truly trying to come
back<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:42.000> decided<00:03:42.300> just<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.600> get<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.959> purple

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
back so I decided just to get the purple

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.800 
back so I decided just to get the purple
and<00:03:43.500> I<00:03:43.709> thought<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.430> came<00:03:44.640> out<00:03:44.850> with<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.090> thicker

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
and I thought it came out with a thicker

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.590 
and I thought it came out with a thicker
black<00:03:46.260> pencil<00:03:46.709> but<00:03:47.160> it's<00:03:47.310> actually<00:03:47.580> one<00:03:48.570> of

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
black pencil but it's actually one of

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.120 
black pencil but it's actually one of
those<00:03:48.810> um<00:03:50.420> smudges<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.530> and<00:03:52.530> I'm<00:03:52.680> not<00:03:53.010> really

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
those um smudges and and I'm not really

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.370 
those um smudges and and I'm not really
crazy<00:03:53.340> about<00:03:53.610> that<00:03:54.030> but<00:03:54.750> it<00:03:54.959> also<00:03:55.110> has<00:03:55.320> a

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
crazy about that but it also has a

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.570 
crazy about that but it also has a
sharpener<00:03:56.070> inside<00:03:56.750> so<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:58.440> thought<00:03:59.160> that<00:03:59.220> was

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
sharpener inside so I thought that was

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.479 
sharpener inside so I thought that was
cool<00:03:59.820> but<00:04:00.570> however<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.110> really<00:04:01.980> really<00:04:02.250> didn't

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
cool but however I really really didn't

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.479 
cool but however I really really didn't
like<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:04.080> caller<00:04:04.380> was<00:04:04.590> too<00:04:04.890> light<00:04:05.190> it

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
like the the caller was too light it

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.300 
like the the caller was too light it
doesn't<00:04:05.550> really<00:04:05.970> work<00:04:06.090> as<00:04:06.600> it<00:04:07.560> won't<00:04:07.920> define

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
doesn't really work as it won't define

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.120 
doesn't really work as it won't define
your<00:04:08.459> eye<00:04:08.670> as<00:04:08.970> an<00:04:09.120> eyeliner<00:04:09.510> unless<00:04:09.989> you<00:04:10.200> doing

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
your eye as an eyeliner unless you doing

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.250 
your eye as an eyeliner unless you doing
monkey<00:04:11.430> look<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:12.030> want<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.780> put<00:04:12.960> a<00:04:12.990> light

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
monkey look and want to put a light

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.830 
monkey look and want to put a light
eyeliner<00:04:13.800> probably<00:04:14.730> would<00:04:14.910> go<00:04:15.030> better<00:04:15.270> under

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
eyeliner probably would go better under

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.650 
eyeliner probably would go better under
the<00:04:16.290> eye<00:04:16.320> as<00:04:16.800> opposed<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.370> that<00:04:17.550> so<00:04:17.910> wasn't

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
the eye as opposed to that so wasn't

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.810 
the eye as opposed to that so wasn't
really<00:04:18.840> crazy<00:04:19.230> about<00:04:19.380> how<00:04:19.920> like<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.220> purple

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
really crazy about how like that purple

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.650 
really crazy about how like that purple
was<00:04:21.560> so<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:22.860> took<00:04:23.070> on<00:04:23.670> pictures<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.450> swatches

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
was so I took on pictures and swatches

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:33.140
