00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.407
So, this is my dad's workshop.

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:10.810
It's an all wooden
building on wooden posts.

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:13.246
And it's heated
by a wood stove.

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:16.048
Which is also very useful
for scrap disposal.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.285
And to get the heat around the
building a little bit more,

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:21.287
my dad always used a
little fan that just

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:23.356
circulated air
around that stove.

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.892
So, back here, my dad's also
got his old drill press

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:29.328
and one of the metal
tools and the router.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.631
And then, moving
over here.

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:35.568
A small bandsaw and the
main tool of the shop

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:37.470
a Felder tablesaw.

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.006
I think I'm gonna make a
separate video about this saw

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.341
so I won't talk too
much about that.

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:46.946
Now back here we've got the main
working area, assembly area.

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:50.082
So this is the workbench where
most of the assembly took place.

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:52.102
It's apparently low
workbench because

00:00:52.161 --> 00:00:54.187
my dad was a fairly
short guy so

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:56.923
he liked to have the
work a little bit lower.

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:59.859
And back here, a drill press.
That was a recent addition.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.527
I actually bought
that at a yard sale

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:04.230
and my dad
confiscated it.

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:07.600
Strip sander, grinder,
router stuff.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:09.669
All the screwdrivers,
a miter trimmer

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.238
that's a rare tool, you don't
see that too many these days

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:15.107
because with miter saws, you
don't really need them anymore.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:18.110
But my dad never
believed in miter saws.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.280
Here we've got a lathe. My dad
actually used that quite a lot

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.312
because any sort
of spindles or

00:01:23.324 --> 00:01:25.952
knobs for drawers
for little doors

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.487
he'd always turn those
on here himself.

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.423
And he got quite fast at it.
He never believed in

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.124
copy lathes, or
anything like that

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.926
because he could work
much faster himself.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.362
And you still have to stand
there with a copy lathe.

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:38.998
And here we've got an
incremental bandsaw.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.667
This isn't a very
good bandsaw.

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:45.471
I tried tweaking it but I could
build a better one myself.

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:47.707
My dad always called
this bandsaw his tractor

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:51.978
because it could cut big things
but never very accurately.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.680
So, back here,
we've got

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:56.073
a machine that you
don't see that

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:58.285
many of these days, this
is a stroke sander.

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:01.000
Basically he used
it where people

00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:02.989
nowadays use
thickness sanders.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.626
And with this long belt
running, just with a pad

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:09.262
push it out here and
rolling this in and out

00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:11.964
to finish polish and
stuff like that.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.300
The problem with a
sander like this is

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:17.670
there's really not a very
good way to catch the dust.

00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:19.172
Although that wasn't
a problem for my dad

00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:21.174
because he didn't believe
in dust collection.

00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:24.677
and there was a huge amount
of dust all over the shop

00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:26.846
and especially here because
this was the biggest source

00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:29.182
of fine dust in
the whole shop.

00:02:29.183 --> 00:02:32.485
Back here we have another
sander. This is an edge sander.

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:34.987
And actually I always enjoyed
using that sander the most

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.123
just for rounding edges
ans stuff like that.

00:02:37.124 --> 00:02:39.825
Very easy to see what you're
doing while it's running.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.494
And, as far as
I'm concerned,

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:43.729
sanders are always pretty safe.
The worst you can always get

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.566
is scuffed
up knuckles.

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:49.769
And over here we have
the jointer. A 12 inch

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.839
contrast jointer.
This jointer is

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.878
quite the heavy beast.
It's got a

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:57.210
really big 5 inch
cutter head,

00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:01.214
12 inch wide cut, but the tables
are actually a bit wider.

00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:05.358
All cast iron, even the base
is made out of cast iron.

00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:09.422
And a big hawking motor inside
so quite the heavy beast.

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:11.991
Good for cutting big
stuff, although

00:03:11.992 --> 00:03:13.993
since I've got my own
shop with a jointer

00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:15.995
with a much smaller cutter
head, this jointer is

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:17.997
not very good at
cutting small stuff.

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:22.068
Not safe at that. So a big
tool isn't always better.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.803
If this was my shop,
I would add a

00:03:23.824 --> 00:03:25.438
6 inch jointer
right next to it.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.875
just for small stuff. Now here
is that thickness planer.

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:31.878
This is a 20 inch
thickness planer.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.315
It's a Taiwanese planer, clone
of some American machine

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:39.151
that I've seen. I've
seen American machines

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:41.787
that look just
like that machine.

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:44.056
Very handy to have one
that's 20 inches wide.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.560
But, just like the jointer, for
small stuff it's not ideal.

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.829
Especially because
it's got bed rollers.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.964
There's quite a lot of
snake on this machine.

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:56.402
I might make another video
on that machine as well.

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:59.539
Now back here, we've
got a radial armsaw.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.340
Sears Craftsman
saw.

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:03.643
This one has actually
got an induction motor

00:04:03.644 --> 00:04:06.412
which is nice in that
it runs quieter.

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:09.148
But it's liable to overheat
if you cut a lot with it.

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:12.151
People don't use radial
armsaws very much anymore.

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:15.154
My dad mostly just used
it for sizing up lumbar.

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:17.790
Not really protect
enough for final cuts.

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:21.427
When my dad
built this shop

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.930
this saw was actually
mounted at a slight angle.

00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:26.499
And I found that the saw
would have a tendency

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.785
to wander forward
on it's own,

00:04:27.806 --> 00:04:29.235
especially as the
bearings on it

00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:31.270
were still new. And I
thought that that was

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.272
maybe an accident
waiting to happen.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:37.714
So I jury-rigged this up,
where I put a string on here

00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:40.146
and that goes down to
a weight down here

00:04:40.147 --> 00:04:42.281
so as you pull
the saw out

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:43.658
the weight goes
up so that it

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:45.218
doesn't come forward
on it's own.

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.622
And that seems to have
lasted all these 26 years.

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.090
And, hasn't been any
accidents with this saw

00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:53.359
so maybe it
did the job.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.595
Back here we've got a
lot of scrap wood.

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:57.663
My dad was always
saving scrap wood

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.799
and then trying to use
the piece of wood

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.801
that was just
the right size.

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:04.370
So there's lot's of off-cuts
left over that are still good

00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:06.506
for smaller
projects.

00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:10.676
In later years he got a little
bit more of a cleaning process.

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:14.747
So every small flattened
plywood, he would save.

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:19.118
Just recently this whole
shelf was full of off-cuts

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:21.053
that were too small
to make anything.

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:23.389
But just recently, turned
all of them into firewood

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.258
and these are the off-cuts
that are left over

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.594
that are large enough to
still make stuff with them.

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:31.664
Here we've got my dad's
homemade table saw.

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:34.000
This one's more of an experiment
using parts that were

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:36.636
left over from when the
Felder got repaired.

00:05:36.637 --> 00:05:39.739
Because it was a new
design when they came out

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.042
and both the saw Armour and the
sliding table had to be replaced

00:05:43.043 --> 00:05:45.378
so these are actually
made of the old parts.

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:48.514
And he's got a 3
horsepower motor on here.

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:51.651
The catch with the saw is you
can't adjust the depth of cut.

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:54.921
He didn't really use it very
much after he built it.

00:05:54.922 --> 00:05:56.756
If you want to know
more about this saw

00:05:56.757 --> 00:05:59.542
I actually made a video
about that one 2 years ago.

00:06:07.301 --> 00:06:10.036
So that kind of takes us full
circle so here we're back at

00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:13.339
the wood stove again.
And here is the door to

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.341
what used to be the
finishing room.

00:06:15.342 --> 00:06:17.844
Because my dad, of course,
always made a lot of dust.

00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:19.712
Especially with no dust
collecting system.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:21.225
My mom would do all
the varnishing

00:06:21.246 --> 00:06:22.348
and that
happened in here

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:24.223
where there was
electric heat because

00:06:24.244 --> 00:06:25.751
it's away from
the wood stove.

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:29.388
And it's away from the dust.
Right now it's just

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.624
a junk storage room. In fact,
I moved a lot of the junk

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:35.294
that accumulated here into
there just to make this video.

00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:37.048
Getting the workshop
really warm has

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:38.564
always been a bit
of a problem.

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:40.500
But when you're working, you
don't need it that warm.

00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:43.569
But it turns out the glue
needed temperature quite warm

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.506
so my dad actually made
this bench, which has

00:06:46.507 --> 00:06:50.576
unequal length legs because it
sits half on the concrete pad.

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.712
And the purpose
of this bench is

00:06:52.713 --> 00:06:54.747
to put the wood that
he's about to glue

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:56.682
and that he has glued
up near the wood stove

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:59.385
to keep it warm. So having
a bench near the wood stove

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:01.058
kind of solved that problem.
