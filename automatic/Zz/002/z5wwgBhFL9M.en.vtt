00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
comes back to taking a lot of damage

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.550 
comes back to taking a lot of damage
that<00:01:46.830> first<00:01:47.100> round<00:01:47.570> well<00:01:48.570> no<00:01:48.720> yeah<00:01:49.110> yeah<00:01:49.290> just

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560

that first round well no yeah yeah just
a<00:01:49.650> very<00:01:49.830> quickly<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:53.570> think<00:01:54.570> he<00:01:54.630> recognizes

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
a very quickly I think he recognizes

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.950 
a very quickly I think he recognizes
that<00:01:55.260> there's<00:01:55.620> a<00:01:55.850> blind<00:01:56.850> spot<00:01:56.970> when<00:01:57.479> gokhan<00:01:57.840> in

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
that there's a blind spot when gokhan in

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.180 
that there's a blind spot when gokhan in
so<00:01:58.250> doing<00:01:59.250> fireball<00:01:59.900> pressure<00:02:00.900> is<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.350> his<00:02:01.950> toe

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
so doing fireball pressure is is his toe

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.340 
so doing fireball pressure is is his toe

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
this is definitely a very different

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.890

whether i was like he pitches for the

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.750 
whether i was like he pitches for the
sweep<00:04:07.900> he<00:04:08.470> said<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:08.769> were<00:04:08.859> asleep<00:04:09.040> and<00:04:09.430> when

think he's more prone to just like

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.870 
think he's more prone to just like
abusing<00:04:18.609> teleports<00:04:20.340> but<00:04:21.340> I'm<00:04:21.579> not<00:04:21.729> sure<00:04:21.760> that

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
abusing teleports but I'm not sure that

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.520 
abusing teleports but I'm not sure that
that<00:04:22.060> that<00:04:22.630> tendency<00:04:23.080> might<00:04:23.199> have<00:04:23.320> changed

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
that that tendency might have changed

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.900 
that that tendency might have changed
home<00:04:24.039> and<00:04:24.460> ok<00:04:25.229> down<00:04:26.229> though<00:04:26.530> oh<00:04:26.760> that<00:04:27.760> was<00:04:27.880> a

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
home and ok down though oh that was a

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.550 
home and ok down though oh that was a
crucial<00:04:28.240> throw<00:04:28.600> you<00:04:29.020> think<00:04:29.199> this<00:04:29.350> could

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
crucial throw you think this could

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.650 
crucial throw you think this could
change<00:04:29.590> everything<00:04:30.010> he's<00:04:30.669> I<00:04:31.060> think<00:04:31.389> it's<00:04:31.510> like

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
change everything he's I think it's like

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.600 
change everything he's I think it's like
here<00:04:31.900> in<00:04:31.990> here<00:04:32.729> one<00:04:33.729> more<00:04:33.940> oh<00:04:35.280> what<00:04:36.280> did<00:04:36.340> he<00:04:36.460> go

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
here in here one more oh what did he go

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.089 
here in here one more oh what did he go
for<00:04:37.110> uppercut<00:04:38.110> again<00:04:38.349> I<00:04:38.380> don't<00:04:38.650> know<00:04:38.740> he<00:04:38.919> did

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
for uppercut again I don't know he did

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.150 
for uppercut again I don't know he did
something<00:04:39.490> I<00:04:39.990> I<00:04:40.990> think<00:04:41.500> he<00:04:41.590> tried<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:41.889> delay

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
something I I think he tried to delay

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.060 
something I I think he tried to delay
the<00:04:42.490> uppercut<00:04:43.349> so<00:04:44.349> much<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:44.710> he<00:04:44.770> got<00:04:44.889> hit<00:04:44.979> by

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
the uppercut so much that he got hit by

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.820 
the uppercut so much that he got hit by
the<00:04:45.099> end<00:04:45.310> but

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.660 

interesting<00:04:48.830> choice<00:04:48.890> of<00:04:49.160> ulcers<00:04:49.490> here

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
interesting choice of ulcers here

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.010 
interesting choice of ulcers here
because<00:04:49.910> every<00:04:50.120> time<00:04:50.150> I<00:04:50.300> seen<00:04:50.570> you<00:04:50.900> know

but the filtration you know opting with

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.130 
but the filtration you know opting with
ultra<00:05:00.320> one<00:05:00.500> will<00:05:00.860> see<00:05:01.010> what<00:05:01.130> they<00:05:01.190> can<00:05:01.250> do<00:05:01.370> oh
