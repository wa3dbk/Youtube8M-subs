00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.900
 behind us I had 1 or 2 starts to 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.420
 remove two houses that we had the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.920
 allowed and all that and then by the end of 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.660
 day I realized by his 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.390
 boss I had calves the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.580
 bad faith that's it now that ben 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.810
 here is the latest news 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.150
 apparently without his brother with the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.240
 owner boss and all that 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.820
 I hope it will work out 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:36.510
 now me good i took a shot 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.700
 did not go from assuming this to 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:45.660
 what's the point if not to pursue it in fact 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.239
 departure indications was not accurate 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.120
 was conducted by phone but I got 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.660
 I said good here we go ahead we advance 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.070
 we have to work we are apparently 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.780
 well here is chadrac the bad it's true 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.570
 that there is a little white house and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.520
 the other one is a little so there was 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.900
 misunderstanding is so how is it 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.890
 was passing very quickly home molins 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.600
 so we do not have time to 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.170
 give an account we talk about it time of 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.250
 realize 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.229
 it took me about twenty minutes 20 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.390
 minutes half an hour and the building 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.220
 broke out what's more after he 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.310
 have to sort all that's what takes a 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.990
 little more time demolish it takes in 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.560
 more than they were holding so much 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:38.310
 was pretty good again the proof does 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:40.650
 to drink rot but how do you 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.689
 you realized that this element has 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.399
 dropped in five days but when my 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.810
 boss phoned me he asked me if he 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.060
 there were not too many bricks in lyon 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.130
 on the road and I have him noodles 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.530
 the road is far enough what is 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.470
 pebble price and more 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.590
 it's costing them dearly realized that we 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.930
 had made a wrong maneuver of the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:07.049
 angry boss boss 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:10.560
 yes, even if it is necessary is not very 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.569
 happy with the work we did 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.920
 still, what does he commit to 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.400
 now have you given him any 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.920
 details 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.030
 obama said that here he took 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.750
 contact with the owner is 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.550
 now if he will arrange with 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.110
 I hope that all will be well 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:31.760
 Here well it's here that the house 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.760
