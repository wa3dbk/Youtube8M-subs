00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:16.270
 marco sormani website and red mark yours 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:19.820
 overall impressions on the vis between one thousand 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.760
 certainly very positive impressions 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.039
 stupid mainly the front end is 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.539
 because I found it very stable in the 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.810
 strict 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.660
 fast and at the same time very stable 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.030
 but also very easy to hold the 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.350
 trajectory with this bike and not tired 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:43.399
 minimally even at a fast pace not 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.879
 never tiring round a good engine 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:50.089
 perfect extension at mid-range 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.579
 perhaps it lacks in a bit of inspiration to 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:56.019
 low speeds but it is not a 1200 so it is 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.509
 natural that this is so 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.939
 lapo which of the website motoblog 

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:05.089
 lapo tell me your first impression 

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:07.159
 on the new visa at one thousand per hour moved 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.430
 very funny especially in the 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.979
 tight turns that the couple there 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.770
 always allows you to start from low 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.100
 speed to succeed well from 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.670
 the curves also first the engine a 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.899
 this abundant pair below and 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.869
 so let's say the mix between one boast 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.149
 precise and sincere and a couple since 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.860
 low precisely allows you to also in 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.039
 situations where heavier bikes more 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.229
 adults are generally penalized 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.000
 without expecting training 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:45.250
 sport or motorbike displacement 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.890
 upper claudio falanga moto on the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.329
 road punto it is a bike that keeps 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.670
 what promises a bike made for 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:57.409
 travel then 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.280
 a nice engine, excellent fuel economy 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.610
 very reduced 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.979
 a good distance more than 20 km with 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.780
 a liter then autonomy search 400 km 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.070
 it's a pretty interesting thing to 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.459
 who travels 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.870
 the saddle very comfortable the engine is 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.810
 absolutely blameless with that 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.020
 couple at 4,000 rpm that really a lot 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.190
 enjoyable because it allows you to 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.040
 traits guided by the mixed traits the 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.780
 mixed fast to get out of the corners 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.670
 but also in the traits let's say it in 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.860
 mountain to use not very much the 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.450
 so I change my bike absolutely 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.280
 I would say that this is a great alternative 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.380
 a great alternative to much more bikes 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.370
 expensive in the fall in the category 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.120
 however of the road enduro and therefore 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.120
 my opinion very positive 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.880
 paolo sardi motorbox dot com ma 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.000
 definitely a bike very much 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.430
 nice very balanced suzuki wants 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.410
 place halfway between say le 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.600
 small displacement crossover and le 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.070
 maxi that are instead around 1200 with 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.690
 I think this bike succeeds 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.250
 sure to reach his 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.700
 goal that was to propose a 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.160
 easy balanced medium well balanced 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.720
 and able to immediately give confidence to 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.269
 all of them and that's what you have 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.880
 verified but absolutely yes I have 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.519
 found the bike very very fluid in the 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.100
 very gradual change of direction one 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.140
 downhill however always great 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.090
 sense of confidence and the idea of a 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.100
 responds to commands without a 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.290
 important psychological and physical commitment on the part 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.000
 of those who drive on the roads we have 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.160
 done today is important 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.230
 well surely even when the bottom 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.790
 beaten road had a bike that that 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.049
 from this confidence it is 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.049
 it's really something important 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.460
 andrea farina omnimoto.it then said 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.800
 very my simple balanced opinion 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.840
 one hundred cocks that can suffice in 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.090
 tourist use that must not not 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.300
 he wants to go to annoy us, we say ai 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.820
 1200 cash plus horses and what we say 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.420
 for a very comfortable road use and 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.970
 easy 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.570
 what did you like most is the engine in 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.480
 low that where for tourism 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:12.440
 serves is ready very fluid vibrations 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.150
 almost non-existent and let's say here I would 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.100
 the protection was improved a little 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.560
 of the standard fairing but and option a 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.230
 the touring one then expanded 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.210
 let's say solvable for the rest 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.590
 bikes that I still have to drive in a manner 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.960
 thorough but I'm curious about 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:33.350
 try boni galleries historic colleague 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.730
 panoramauto you have a memory a little far 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.140
 of the previous one 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.630
 it seemed to me much more fluid as 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:42.160
 engine more 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:44.040
 more enjoyable and even more drivable 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.320
 that the fund was not at its peak 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:51.550
 but my agility seems to have improved 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:56.000
 it seems much more neutral to me more 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.790
 and very valid as suspensions from 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.870
 consider the saddle which is a bit maybe 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.540
 too high 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.270
 definitely raised in the summer and maybe 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:09.010
 it could be saved or needed 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.010
 choose those with the lowered saddle 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:17.930
 average grade from 1 to 10 8 and a half 99 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.790
 we absolutely say that an 8 if it 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.040
 deserves everything 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:27.860
 let's say eight and a half a good 8 but the king 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:31.400
 by a bell 8:30 but also 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.440
 moto.it and I say my way this way 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.360
 really like it for its neutrality 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.550
 general is very different from the 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.710
 old from much more feeling in driving 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.190
 I really like the thrust of the bass 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.710
 regimes 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.870
 I don't find any defect from it 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.600
 consider yourself as such we will soon put you in 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.740
 in comparison with other competitors 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.740
 we'll see what comes out
