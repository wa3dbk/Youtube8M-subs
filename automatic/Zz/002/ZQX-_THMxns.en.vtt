00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
there's like a big gap and then it

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.540 
there's like a big gap and then it
instantly<00:01:00.930> falls<00:01:01.140> over<00:01:01.440> even<00:01:01.739> if<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.949> spray<00:01:02.340> it

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550

there so you kind of want this to lay as

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.649 
there so you kind of want this to lay as
flat<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:10.890> possible<00:01:11.150> so<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.270> doesn't<00:01:12.540> matter

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
flat as possible so it doesn't matter

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.280 
flat as possible so it doesn't matter
which<00:01:12.840> way<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.110> lame<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.740> do<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:15.049> you<00:01:16.049> could

tight<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> rest<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.750> go<00:01:39.900> in

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
tight to the rest and then I just go in

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.899 
tight to the rest and then I just go in
with<00:01:40.140> my<00:01:40.290> iron<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.759> its

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
with my iron and I have it on its

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.120 
with my iron and I have it on its
highest<00:01:42.060> setting<00:01:42.270> with<00:01:42.780> steam<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.470> I

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
highest setting with steam and I

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.380 
highest setting with steam and I
actually<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.670> hold<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.119> right<00:01:45.299> above<00:01:45.930> that

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
actually just hold it right above that

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.160 
actually just hold it right above that
part<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.490> way<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.939> steam<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.630> going<00:01:52.020> to

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
part so that way the steam is going to

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.580 
part so that way the steam is going to
set<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.530> hair<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.950> place<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:54.409> then<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.560> can

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
set the hair in place and then you can

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.580

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
I use my clothes iron only because I

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.029 
I use my clothes iron only because I
don't<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:09.479> steamer<00:02:10.319> like<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> clothing

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
don't have a steamer like a clothing

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.979 
don't have a steamer like a clothing
steamer<00:02:11.489> if<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.150> have<00:02:12.360> one<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.629> those<00:02:12.750> those

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
steamer if you have one of those those

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.309 
steamer if you have one of those those

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
are

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.330 
are
but<00:02:13.409> better<00:02:13.590> because<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.859> actually<00:02:13.920> shoots

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
but better because it actually shoots

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.890 
but better because it actually shoots
the<00:02:14.519> steam<00:02:14.760> out<00:02:14.939> you<00:02:15.269> don't<00:02:15.359> have<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.599> tilt

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
the steam out you don't have to tilt

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.479 
the steam out you don't have to tilt
like<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.349> you<00:02:16.859> don't<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.129> to<00:02:17.219> tilt<00:02:17.370> it

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
like that I you don't have to tilt it

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.679 
like that I you don't have to tilt it
down<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:17.819> order<00:02:17.909> to<00:02:18.030> get<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.269> steam<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.569> come

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
down in order to get the steam to come

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.619 
down in order to get the steam to come
out<00:02:18.889> but<00:02:19.889> pretty<00:02:20.340> much<00:02:20.489> everyone<00:02:20.939> has<00:02:21.090> an<00:02:21.269> iron

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
out but pretty much everyone has an iron

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.449 
out but pretty much everyone has an iron
so<00:02:22.079> it's<00:02:22.709> gonna<00:02:22.799> be<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.010> little<00:02:23.219> bit<00:02:23.340> more

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
this way you don't want to get too close

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.539 
this way you don't want to get too close
to<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.900> hair<00:02:58.049> with<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.349> actual<00:02:58.829> like<00:02:59.159> metal

to the hair with the actual like metal

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.309 
to the hair with the actual like metal
part<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.909> the<00:03:00.000> iron<00:03:00.209> because<00:03:00.810> if<00:03:01.049> it<00:03:01.169> touches

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
part of the iron because if it touches

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.170 
part of the iron because if it touches
the<00:03:01.590> hair<00:03:01.769> it<00:03:01.980> might<00:03:02.129> melt<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.549> unless<00:03:02.939> it's

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
the hair it might melt it unless it's

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.899 
the hair it might melt it unless it's
like<00:03:03.389> high<00:03:03.719> heat<00:03:03.989> resistant<00:03:04.340> fiber<00:03:05.340> hope<00:03:05.760> this

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
like high heat resistant fiber hope this

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.819 
like high heat resistant fiber hope this
