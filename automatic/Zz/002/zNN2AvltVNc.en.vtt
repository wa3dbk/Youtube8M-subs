titan got 67 this may be a md optimized

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.500 
titan got 67 this may be a md optimized
and<00:02:12.030> but

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
and but

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.309 
and but
still<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.959> great<00:02:14.260> game<00:02:15.510> perfectly<00:02:16.510> good<00:02:17.080> game

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319
