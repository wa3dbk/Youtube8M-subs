is my hand hold on my hand and

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.229 
is my hand hold on my hand and
comparison<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.850> him<00:00:40.129> so<00:00:41.129> yep<00:00:41.610> that's<00:00:41.910> how<00:00:42.059> big

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
comparison to him so yep that's how big

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.030 
comparison to him so yep that's how big
they<00:00:42.420> are<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.809> I'll<00:00:43.379> take<00:00:43.559> one<00:00:43.710> out<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.950> show

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
they are and I'll take one out and show

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.770 
they are and I'll take one out and show
you<00:00:46.700> so<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.760> comes<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.270> little<00:00:48.329> light

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
you so it comes in this little light

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.979 
you so it comes in this little light
right<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.770> little<00:00:50.010> packet<00:00:50.489> thing<00:00:52.280> and<00:00:53.280> this

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
right a little packet thing and this

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.920 
right a little packet thing and this
okay<00:00:54.989> number<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.949> area<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.809> only

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
okay number in the area and it only

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.590 
okay number in the area and it only
comes<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.590> here<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.129> it's<00:00:59.280> full<00:01:00.000> down<00:01:00.270> here

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
comes up to here but it's full down here

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.810 
comes up to here but it's full down here
so<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> think<00:01:00.960> yeah<00:01:01.379> three<00:01:01.890> bit<00:01:02.039> about<00:01:02.219> four<00:01:02.520> I

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
so I think yeah three bit about four I

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.119 
so I think yeah three bit about four I
think<00:01:03.660> they're<00:01:04.049> kind<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.379> expensive<00:01:04.619> though

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
think they're kind of expensive though

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.230 
think they're kind of expensive though
for<00:01:05.489> how<00:01:05.640> tiny<00:01:05.970> they<00:01:06.240> are<00:01:06.270> but<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:08.060> guess<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
for how tiny they are but I guess the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.870 
for how tiny they are but I guess the
snails<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:10.020> won't<00:01:10.470> eat<00:01:10.740> big<00:01:11.010> ones<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.610> you

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
snails like won't eat big ones like you

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.490 
snails like won't eat big ones like you
had<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.090> break<00:01:12.210> them<00:01:12.390> up<00:01:12.510> into<00:01:12.600> force<00:01:13.049> anyway

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
had to break them up into force anyway

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.270 
had to break them up into force anyway
so<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.369> guy<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.760> store<00:01:16.159> recommended<00:01:17.159> these

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
so the guy the store recommended these

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.190 
so the guy the store recommended these
ones<00:01:17.580> because<00:01:17.759> they're<00:01:18.060> already<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.570> tiny

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
ones because they're already like tiny

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.690 
ones because they're already like tiny
enough<00:01:19.409> he<00:01:19.560> said<00:01:19.710> even<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.040> break<00:01:20.220> these<00:01:20.400> in

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
enough he said even to break these in

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.830 
enough he said even to break these in
half<00:01:21.689> even<00:01:22.320> still<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.240> have<00:01:24.240> two<00:01:24.509> snails

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
half even still but I have two snails

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.890 
half even still but I have two snails
and<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.259> thought<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:26.360> one<00:01:27.360> would<00:01:27.540> be<00:01:27.600> good

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and so I thought that one would be good

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.590 
and so I thought that one would be good
but<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.890> actually<00:01:29.579> they<00:01:29.909> haven't<00:01:30.180> touched

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
but they actually they haven't touched

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.530 
but they actually they haven't touched
this<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.759> at<00:01:32.759> all<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.420> just

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
this they at all like it's just

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.960 
this they at all like it's just
dissolving<00:01:34.079> at<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> bottom<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> tank<00:01:34.970> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
dissolving at the bottom of the tank and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.300 
dissolving at the bottom of the tank and
since<00:01:36.750> they're<00:01:36.960> sinking<00:01:37.500> well<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.860> takes<00:01:38.040> them

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
since they're sinking well it takes them

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.179 
since they're sinking well it takes them
like<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> minute<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.939> sink<00:01:39.770> it's<00:01:40.770> weirdest

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
like a minute to sink it's weirdest

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.160 
like a minute to sink it's weirdest
things<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.579> want<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.970> say<00:01:42.210> downs<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.810> things<00:01:43.020> I
