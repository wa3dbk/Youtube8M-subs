00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
back surface as we can see has is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.899 
back surface as we can see has is
listening<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.229> pattern<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.579> not<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
listening to pattern and it's not like a

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.630 
listening to pattern and it's not like a
soft<00:01:30.299> coded<00:01:30.890> rubbish<00:01:31.890> filling<00:01:32.340> or<00:01:32.430> anything

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
soft coded rubbish filling or anything

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.850 
soft coded rubbish filling or anything
it's<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:32.880> short<00:01:33.270> plastic<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.259> pattern

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
it's just short plastic with the pattern

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.330 
it's just short plastic with the pattern
and<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.549> actually<00:01:35.909> pretty<00:01:36.299> good<00:01:37.340> first

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and this is actually pretty good first

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.780 
and this is actually pretty good first
office<00:01:38.810> no<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.020> makes<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.619> gives<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.130> some<00:01:41.610> kind

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
office no it makes it gives it some kind

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.090 
office no it makes it gives it some kind
of<00:01:41.909> pattern<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.659> makes<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.259> not<00:01:43.409> boring<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
of pattern so it makes it not boring and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.130 
of pattern so it makes it not boring and
a<00:01:44.130> second<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.149> gives<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.450> quite<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.810> good<00:01:46.110> grip

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
a second it gives a quite a good grip

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.100 
a second it gives a quite a good grip
and<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:47.070> prevents<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.759> from<00:01:47.939> slipping<00:01:48.240> off

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
and it prevents it from slipping off

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.639 
and it prevents it from slipping off
your<00:01:49.140> hand

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
your hand

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.590

but seeing it with the eyes there's a

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.660 
but seeing it with the eyes there's a
weird<00:03:08.310> rigid<00:03:08.880> lines<00:03:09.239> on<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:10.670> horizontally

will be useful to some of the folks who

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.559 
will be useful to some of the folks who
really<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.560> in<00:04:05.130> need<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.639> the<00:04:05.970> microwaves<00:04:06.420> B

really is in need and the microwaves B

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.720 
really is in need and the microwaves B
port<00:04:06.780> right<00:04:06.989> there<00:04:07.019> gives<00:04:07.560> more<00:04:07.859> power<00:04:08.130> if<00:04:08.639> you

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
port right there gives more power if you

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.400 
port right there gives more power if you
want<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.060> connect<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.389> external<00:04:10.079> hard<00:04:10.230> drive

they will be useful if you want to
connect<00:04:16.169> more<00:04:16.440> than<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.979> just<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.459> USB<00:04:17.789> flash

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
connect more than the just the USB flash

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.219 
connect more than the just the USB flash
memories<00:04:19.400> and<00:04:20.400> home<00:04:21.269> key<00:04:21.479> right<00:04:21.660> there<00:04:21.690> is

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
memories and home key right there is

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.460 
memories and home key right there is
another<00:04:22.680> problem<00:04:23.039> so<00:04:23.610> tapping<00:04:24.000> on<00:04:24.300> that

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
another problem so tapping on that

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.410 
another problem so tapping on that
doesn't<00:04:25.470> really<00:04:25.830> react<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:27.120> the

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
doesn't really react to the

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.700 
doesn't really react to the
way<00:04:27.720> that<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:27.990> want<00:04:28.320> so<00:04:28.590> I<00:04:28.620> usually<00:04:29.070> end<00:04:29.580> up<00:04:30.120> just

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
way that I want so I usually end up just

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.200 
way that I want so I usually end up just
finding<00:04:31.710> myself<00:04:32.130> more<00:04:32.310> useful<00:04:32.730> to<00:04:32.880> fight<00:04:33.090> it

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
finding myself more useful to fight it

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.480 
finding myself more useful to fight it
off<00:04:33.270> from<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.720> right<00:04:34.020> side<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:34.530> tap<00:04:35.070> in<00:04:35.250> on<00:04:35.340> it

about<00:04:36.150> ten<00:04:36.600> times<00:04:36.750> of<00:04:36.960> trial<00:04:37.200> like<00:04:37.440> two<00:04:37.590> or

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
about ten times of trial like two or

about ten times of trial like two or
three<00:04:37.950> times<00:04:38.130> don't<00:04:38.400> work<00:04:38.610> maybe<00:04:39.510> I<00:04:39.690> was

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
three times don't work maybe I was

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.160 
three times don't work maybe I was
maybe<00:04:40.680> it's<00:04:40.890> my<00:04:40.980> finger<00:04:41.430> I<00:04:41.580> don't<00:04:41.790> know<00:04:41.910> but<00:04:42.690> at

maybe it's my finger I don't know but at

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.920 
maybe it's my finger I don't know but at
least<00:04:43.350> my<00:04:43.740> on<00:04:44.130> cord<00:04:44.670> doesn't<00:04:45.210> really<00:04:45.420> respond

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
least my on cord doesn't really respond

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.200 
least my on cord doesn't really respond
well<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.170> the<00:04:46.560> Windows<00:04:47.400> key<00:04:47.580> right<00:04:47.760> here<00:04:48.060> and

well to the Windows key right here and

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.210 
well to the Windows key right here and
that's<00:04:48.420> a<00:04:48.510> bummer

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
that's a bummer

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.980

Venue 8 Pro this guy has been suffering
from<00:05:15.450> that<00:05:15.720> problem<00:05:15.930> a<00:05:16.200> lot<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:16.830> it<00:05:16.980> it<00:05:17.760> still

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
from that problem a lot and it it still

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.560 
from that problem a lot and it it still
does<00:05:18.390> a<00:05:18.660> mix<00:05:19.230> to<00:05:19.530> eight<00:05:19.770> not<00:05:20.430> so<00:05:20.730> much<00:05:21.000> but<00:05:21.390> the

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
does a mix to eight not so much but the

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.780 
does a mix to eight not so much but the
bad<00:05:21.750> battery<00:05:22.410> on<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.710> encore<00:05:23.130> lasts<00:05:23.550> a<00:05:23.610> whole

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790

bad battery on the encore lasts a whole
lot<00:05:23.970> better<00:05:24.240> than<00:05:24.630> the<00:05:24.900> mix<00:05:25.170> to<00:05:25.380> eight<00:05:25.620> so

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
lot better than the mix to eight so

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.380 
lot better than the mix to eight so
that's<00:05:26.250> a<00:05:26.460> good<00:05:26.670> thing<00:05:26.910> so<00:05:27.120> I've<00:05:27.240> been

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
that's a good thing so I've been

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
maybe as since this got a Haitian way

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.930 
maybe as since this got a Haitian way
port<00:05:33.420> and<00:05:33.570> the<00:05:34.200> and<00:05:34.530> the<00:05:35.250> long<00:05:35.670> last

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
not pretty in the first place so it's

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.850 
not pretty in the first place so it's
not<00:06:15.540> for<00:06:15.750> the<00:06:15.840> personal<00:06:16.230> users<00:06:16.590> for<00:06:16.770> the

not for the personal users for the

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.130 
not for the personal users for the
multimedia<00:06:17.490> so<00:06:17.940> who<00:06:18.060> is<00:06:18.210> this<00:06:18.390> really<00:06:18.690> for<00:06:18.930> and

multimedia so who is this really for and

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.500 
multimedia so who is this really for and
I've<00:06:20.100> been<00:06:20.280> thinking<00:06:20.580> really<00:06:20.790> hard<00:06:21.000> and<00:06:21.180> I

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
I've been thinking really hard and I

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.270 
I've been thinking really hard and I
couldn't<00:06:22.020> seem<00:06:22.290> to<00:06:22.320> get<00:06:22.650> an<00:06:22.800> answer<00:06:22.950> for<00:06:23.220> that

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
couldn't seem to get an answer for that

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.500 
couldn't seem to get an answer for that
so<00:06:24.090> without<00:06:24.660> that<00:06:25.080> I<00:06:25.530> I<00:06:26.070> really<00:06:26.670> am<00:06:27.000> not<00:06:27.210> sure

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
so without that I I really am not sure

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.200 
so without that I I really am not sure
if<00:06:27.720> I<00:06:27.840> can<00:06:28.020> recommend<00:06:28.320> this<00:06:28.560> to<00:06:28.770> anyone<00:06:29.210> who's

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
if I can recommend this to anyone who's

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.290

got<00:06:30.840> a<00:06:30.870> clear<00:06:31.410> vision<00:06:31.620> for<00:06:31.980> the<00:06:32.430> micro<00:06:32.880> HDMI

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
got a clear vision for the micro HDMI

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.080 
got a clear vision for the micro HDMI
port<00:06:33.630> that<00:06:34.050> it's<00:06:34.230> got<00:06:34.410> right<00:06:34.560> there<00:06:35.090> unless

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
port that it's got right there unless

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.730
