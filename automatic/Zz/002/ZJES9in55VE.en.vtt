waist<00:02:10.390> joint<00:02:11.280> he<00:02:12.280> could<00:02:12.460> go<00:02:12.580> back<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:13.060> much

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
waist joint he could go back this much

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.000 
waist joint he could go back this much
with<00:02:13.510> his<00:02:13.630> torso<00:02:13.840> joint<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.470> his<00:02:14.560> waist<00:02:14.740> joint

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
with his torso joint and his waist joint

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.220 
with his torso joint and his waist joint
working<00:02:15.310> together

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.840 

he<00:02:20.230> has<00:02:20.350> hip<00:02:20.530> joints<00:02:20.920> just<00:02:21.190> like<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.520> Joker

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
he has hip joints just like the Joker

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.090 
he has hip joints just like the Joker
figure<00:02:22.150> where<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.630> leg<00:02:23.319> kind<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.680> comes<00:02:23.890> out

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
figure where the leg kind of comes out

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.800 
figure where the leg kind of comes out
and<00:02:24.310> allows<00:02:24.580> for<00:02:24.819> his<00:02:24.910> leg<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.450> go<00:02:25.840> forward<00:02:26.260> I

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
and allows for his leg to go forward I

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.090 
and allows for his leg to go forward I
think<00:02:28.810> that's<00:02:28.960> a<00:02:29.050> really<00:02:29.319> cool<00:02:29.470> joint<00:02:29.770> he<00:02:29.920> has

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
think that's a really cool joint he has

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.440 
think that's a really cool joint he has
a<00:02:30.130> double<00:02:31.030> jointed<00:02:31.270> knees<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:33.000> his<00:02:34.000> ankle

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
a double jointed knees and his ankle

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.180 
a double jointed knees and his ankle
seems<00:02:34.930> like<00:02:35.080> it's<00:02:35.260> supposed<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.620> rock<00:02:35.830> but<00:02:36.069> it

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
seems like it's supposed to rock but it

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.280 
seems like it's supposed to rock but it
really<00:02:36.310> doesn't<00:02:36.640> at<00:02:36.880> all<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:37.330> swivels<00:02:38.080> and

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
really doesn't at all it swivels and

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.460 
really doesn't at all it swivels and
goes<00:02:38.950> up<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.310> down<00:02:39.370> just<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.760> little<00:02:39.790> bit<00:02:40.470> goes

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
goes up and down just a little bit goes

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.990 
goes up and down just a little bit goes
up<00:02:41.680> kind<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:41.980> good<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.459> has<00:02:42.610> toe

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
up kind of good and it has toe

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.390 
up kind of good and it has toe
articulation<00:02:45.720> he's<00:02:46.720> not<00:02:46.930> able<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.260> stand<00:02:48.010> flat

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
articulation he's not able to stand flat

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.010 
articulation he's not able to stand flat
on<00:02:48.580> his<00:02:48.700> feet<00:02:48.940> for<00:02:48.970> some<00:02:49.330> reason<00:02:49.630> his<00:02:49.750> toes<00:02:49.990> are

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
on his feet for some reason his toes are

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.880 
on his feet for some reason his toes are
always<00:02:50.410> sticking<00:02:50.770> up<00:02:51.690> his<00:02:52.690> cape<00:02:53.020> has<00:02:53.230> wire<00:02:53.590> in

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
always sticking up his cape has wire in

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.130 
always sticking up his cape has wire in
it<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.280> allows<00:02:54.490> you<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.790> bend<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.209> I<00:02:55.390> think

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
it and it allows you to bend it I think

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.449 
it and it allows you to bend it I think
that's<00:02:56.290> pretty<00:02:56.410> cool<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.860> only<00:02:57.010> thing<00:02:57.190> is<00:02:57.310> the

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
that's pretty cool the only thing is the

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.100 
that's pretty cool the only thing is the
Cape<00:02:57.640> right<00:02:58.060> out<00:02:58.240> of<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.360> package<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.870> kind<00:02:59.050> of

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
Cape right out of the package it kind of

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.850 
Cape right out of the package it kind of
looked<00:02:59.650> a<00:03:00.090> crumpled<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.330> I<00:03:02.170> didn't<00:03:02.560> like<00:03:02.650> that

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
looked a crumpled and I didn't like that

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.199 
looked a crumpled and I didn't like that
I<00:03:02.890> think<00:03:03.099> if<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.280> take<00:03:03.430> an<00:03:03.550> iron<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.910> it<00:03:03.940> or<00:03:04.120> to

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
I think if I take an iron to it or to

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.360 
I think if I take an iron to it or to
look<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.450> lot<00:03:04.599> nicer<00:03:04.780> but<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.830> wires<00:03:06.040> work

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
look a lot nicer but the wires work

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.339 
look a lot nicer but the wires work
pretty<00:03:06.670> good<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.599> wish<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.900> Cape<00:03:08.080> was<00:03:08.260> a

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
pretty good and I wish the Cape was a

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.100 
pretty good and I wish the Cape was a
little<00:03:08.590> bit<00:03:08.709> bigger<00:03:09.270> but<00:03:10.270> for<00:03:10.599> the<00:03:10.690> most<00:03:10.870> part

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
little bit bigger but for the most part

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.920 
little bit bigger but for the most part
it's<00:03:11.230> okay

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.440 

the<00:03:14.920> wires<00:03:15.159> hold<00:03:15.489> pretty<00:03:15.730> well<00:03:15.970> in<00:03:16.180> any

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
the wires hold pretty well in any

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.110 
the wires hold pretty well in any
position<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:16.989> you<00:03:17.170> put<00:03:17.379> them<00:03:17.530> in<00:03:20.879> you<00:03:21.879> know

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
position that you put them in you know

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.460 
position that you put them in you know
as<00:03:22.299> for<00:03:22.750> some<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.019> quality<00:03:23.440> control

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
as for some of the quality control

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.830 
as for some of the quality control
issues<00:03:24.190> on<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.700> first<00:03:24.940> release<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.269> shoulder

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
issues on the first release the shoulder

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.390 
issues on the first release the shoulder
would<00:03:25.959> just<00:03:26.200> fall<00:03:26.379> out<00:03:26.409> in<00:03:26.709> this<00:03:26.860> case<00:03:27.099> it

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
would just fall out in this case it

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.479 
would just fall out in this case it
comes<00:03:27.819> out<00:03:28.090> but<00:03:28.299> it<00:03:28.780> holds<00:03:29.409> pretty<00:03:29.560> well<00:03:29.830> you

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
comes out but it holds pretty well you

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.030 
comes out but it holds pretty well you
got<00:03:30.610> to<00:03:30.700> kind<00:03:30.819> of<00:03:30.940> pull<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.510> out<00:03:31.750> of<00:03:31.870> there<00:03:32.040> but

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
got to kind of pull it out of there but

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.970 
got to kind of pull it out of there but
uh<00:03:33.540> it<00:03:34.540> seems<00:03:35.170> like<00:03:35.319> on<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.500> first<00:03:35.709> one<00:03:35.950> it

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
uh it seems like on the first one it

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.490 
uh it seems like on the first one it
would<00:03:36.190> just<00:03:36.400> fall<00:03:36.579> out<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.930> with<00:03:38.110> this<00:03:38.260> one<00:03:38.440> I

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
would just fall out but with this one I

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.199 
would just fall out but with this one I
really<00:03:38.769> don't<00:03:38.950> like<00:03:39.069> how<00:03:39.280> far<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:39.879> shoulder

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
really don't like how far the shoulder

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.360 
really don't like how far the shoulder
sits<00:03:40.480> from<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:41.260> torso<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.709> wish<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.129> it<00:03:42.250> was

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
sits from the torso I wish that it was

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.900 
sits from the torso I wish that it was
sunken<00:03:42.730> in<00:03:42.879> just<00:03:43.090> a<00:03:43.180> little<00:03:43.209> bit<00:03:43.510> more<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:44.910> on

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
sunken in just a little bit more and on

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.660 
sunken in just a little bit more and on
this<00:03:46.060> guy<00:03:46.299> on<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.599> high<00:03:46.750> bicep<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:48.099> kind<00:03:48.609> of

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
this guy on the high bicep it kind of

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.339 
this guy on the high bicep it kind of
comes<00:03:48.910> out<00:03:49.060> really<00:03:49.269> easy<00:03:49.540> after<00:03:49.870> just<00:03:50.079> turning

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
comes out really easy after just turning

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.960 
comes out really easy after just turning
it<00:03:50.470> a<00:03:50.560> few<00:03:50.739> times<00:03:50.890> it'll<00:03:51.250> just<00:03:51.430> pop<00:03:51.579> out<00:03:52.530> so

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
it a few times it'll just pop out so

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.520 
it a few times it'll just pop out so
that<00:03:54.970> kind<00:03:55.180> of<00:03:55.239> sucks<00:03:55.540> but<00:03:55.810> I<00:03:55.989> mean<00:03:56.290> if<00:03:56.379> you're

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
that kind of sucks but I mean if you're

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.349 
that kind of sucks but I mean if you're
careful<00:03:56.739> with<00:03:57.010> it<00:03:57.190> it's<00:03:57.400> not<00:03:57.489> going<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:57.819> be<00:03:57.970> too

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
careful with it it's not going to be too

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.420 
careful with it it's not going to be too
big<00:03:58.540> of<00:03:58.659> an<00:03:58.780> issue<00:03:58.900> it<00:03:59.230> just<00:03:59.440> doesn't<00:04:00.069> make<00:04:00.190> for

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
big of an issue it just doesn't make for

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.050 
big of an issue it just doesn't make for
fluid<00:04:00.909> posing<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:02.519> could<00:04:03.519> see<00:04:03.670> how<00:04:03.819> it<00:04:03.849> could

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
fluid posing I could see how it could

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.190 
quality issue mine has is right here
when<00:04:09.519> you<00:04:09.640> try<00:04:09.879> to<00:04:09.940> pull<00:04:10.180> off<00:04:10.329> the<00:04:10.540> hand<00:04:10.750> it's

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
when you try to pull off the hand it's

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.170 
when you try to pull off the hand it's
stuck<00:04:11.620> onto<00:04:11.829> the<00:04:12.010> peg<00:04:12.220> pretty<00:04:12.519> good<00:04:12.760> but<00:04:13.000> when

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
stuck onto the peg pretty good but when

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.259 
stuck onto the peg pretty good but when
it<00:04:13.299> comes<00:04:13.540> off<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:15.519> ball<00:04:15.760> joint<00:04:16.060> and

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
it comes off the the ball joint and

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.449 
it comes off the the ball joint and
they're<00:04:16.419> kind<00:04:16.660> of<00:04:16.750> just<00:04:16.959> breaks<00:04:17.199> in<00:04:17.410> half<00:04:17.650> it

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
they're kind of just breaks in half it

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.449 
they're kind of just breaks in half it
just<00:04:18.579> seems<00:04:19.000> like<00:04:19.239> it's<00:04:19.479> not<00:04:20.250> connected<00:04:21.250> well

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
just seems like it's not connected well

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.740 
just seems like it's not connected well
I<00:04:22.110> don't<00:04:23.110> know<00:04:23.200> if<00:04:23.289> you<00:04:23.380> could<00:04:23.530> see<00:04:23.740> that<00:04:23.950> but

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
I don't know if you could see that but

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.279 
I don't know if you could see that but
see<00:04:25.750> that<00:04:25.780> it<00:04:26.020> just<00:04:26.169> popped<00:04:26.410> right<00:04:26.560> out<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:29.050> I

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
see that it just popped right out and I

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.080 
see that it just popped right out and I
don't<00:04:29.440> know<00:04:29.530> if<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:29.710> could<00:04:29.830> see<00:04:30.039> that<00:04:30.250> but

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
don't know if you could see that but

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.710 
don't know if you could see that but
there<00:04:31.330> it<00:04:31.419> is<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:32.910> once<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:34.030> put<00:04:34.270> it<00:04:34.360> back<00:04:34.479> in

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
there it is and once you put it back in

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.070 
there it is and once you put it back in
there<00:04:34.900> it'll<00:04:35.349> stay<00:04:35.740> okay<00:04:36.570> especially<00:04:37.570> when

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
there it'll stay okay especially when

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.140 
there it'll stay okay especially when
when<00:04:38.349> you<00:04:38.440> put<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.650> hand<00:04:38.919> on<00:04:39.070> there<00:04:39.280> but<00:04:39.490> it's

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
when you put a hand on there but it's

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.460 
when you put a hand on there but it's
just<00:04:40.330> kind<00:04:40.510> of<00:04:40.570> annoying<00:04:40.810> every<00:04:41.139> time<00:04:41.320> you

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
just kind of annoying every time you

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.180 
just kind of annoying every time you
switch<00:04:41.710> out<00:04:41.860> one<00:04:42.070> of<00:04:42.099> the<00:04:42.220> hands<00:04:42.520> it<00:04:42.639> does<00:04:42.820> this

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
switch out one of the hands it does this

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.379 
switch out one of the hands it does this
it<00:04:45.190> kind<00:04:45.430> of<00:04:45.490> makes<00:04:45.639> it<00:04:45.760> difficult<00:04:45.940> for<00:04:46.240> the

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
it kind of makes it difficult for the

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.000 
it kind of makes it difficult for the
hands<00:04:46.539> pop<00:04:46.810> on<00:04:46.990> there<00:04:47.199> but<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.560> straps<00:04:47.860> from

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
hands pop on there but the straps from

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.680 
hands pop on there but the straps from
the<00:04:48.190> globe<00:04:48.430> kind<00:04:48.669> of<00:04:48.760> hold<00:04:48.970> it<00:04:49.090> back<00:04:49.210> together

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
the globe kind of hold it back together

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.969 
the globe kind of hold it back together
and<00:04:51.330> yeah<00:04:52.330> that's<00:04:52.570> kind<00:04:52.780> of<00:04:52.870> weak<00:04:53.050> but<00:04:53.349> it

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
and yeah that's kind of weak but it

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.260 
and yeah that's kind of weak but it
doesn't<00:04:54.310> make<00:04:54.370> me<00:04:54.430> hate<00:04:54.699> the<00:04:54.820> figure<00:04:55.150> or

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
Hansel that he could hold his weapons he

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.420 
Hansel that he could hold his weapons he
comes<00:05:09.490> with<00:05:09.699> one<00:05:09.880> big<00:05:10.120> gun<00:05:10.389> and<00:05:10.949> his<00:05:11.949> grappling

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.499 

he<00:05:16.099> also<00:05:16.249> comes<00:05:16.550> with<00:05:16.729> three<00:05:17.029> different<00:05:17.179> heads

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:17.509 
he also comes with three different heads

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:19.329 
he also comes with three different heads
and<00:05:17.809> I<00:05:18.169> don't<00:05:18.229> think<00:05:18.589> the<00:05:18.739> original<00:05:18.889> release

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:19.339 
and I don't think the original release

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:20.979 
and I don't think the original release
came<00:05:19.580> with<00:05:19.759> any<00:05:19.939> alternate<00:05:20.419> heads<00:05:20.599> so<00:05:20.809> that's

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:20.989 
came with any alternate heads so that's

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:22.350 
came with any alternate heads so that's
cool<00:05:21.139> that<00:05:21.319> they<00:05:21.409> included<00:05:21.769> that<00:05:21.889> this<00:05:22.099> time

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
cool that they included that this time

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.799 
cool that they included that this time
and<00:05:23.360> this<00:05:23.959> is<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:24.199> first<00:05:24.409> of<00:05:24.589> the<00:05:24.679> three<00:05:24.919> I

00:05:25.799 --> 00:05:25.809 
and this is the first of the three I

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:29.309 
and this is the first of the three I
think<00:05:26.809> this<00:05:26.929> one<00:05:27.080> is<00:05:27.110> sculpted<00:05:27.589> really<00:05:27.769> well

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
think this one is sculpted really well

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.079 
think this one is sculpted really well
this<00:05:30.319> is<00:05:30.469> the<00:05:30.559> second<00:05:31.039> I'm<00:05:31.189> not<00:05:31.429> too<00:05:31.669> into<00:05:31.969> this

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:32.089 
this is the second I'm not too into this

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:34.359 
this is the second I'm not too into this
one<00:05:32.360> I<00:05:32.449> don't<00:05:32.509> think<00:05:32.779> they<00:05:33.529> executed<00:05:34.099> this<00:05:34.219> one

00:05:34.359 --> 00:05:34.369 
one I don't think they executed this one

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:39.159 
one I don't think they executed this one
very<00:05:34.580> well<00:05:36.159> and<00:05:37.419> this<00:05:38.419> is<00:05:38.539> the<00:05:38.689> third<00:05:38.899> which<00:05:39.139> is

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
very well and this is the third which is

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.229 
very well and this is the third which is
an<00:05:39.409> unmasked<00:05:40.009> head<00:05:40.159> and<00:05:40.369> I<00:05:40.729> think<00:05:40.999> that<00:05:41.119> it

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:41.239 
an unmasked head and I think that it

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:42.369 
an unmasked head and I think that it
really<00:05:41.419> looks<00:05:41.599> a<00:05:41.749> lot<00:05:41.869> like<00:05:41.989> Christian<00:05:42.349> Bale

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:42.379 
really looks a lot like Christian Bale

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:45.159 
really looks a lot like Christian Bale
they<00:05:42.800> did<00:05:42.949> a<00:05:42.979> good<00:05:43.129> job<00:05:43.689> you<00:05:44.689> can't<00:05:44.899> see<00:05:45.080> it

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
they did a good job you can't see it

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.659 
they did a good job you can't see it
here<00:05:45.199> but<00:05:45.349> mine<00:05:45.619> has<00:05:45.800> some<00:05:45.979> weird<00:05:46.189> paint<00:05:46.489> on

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
here but mine has some weird paint on

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.100 
here but mine has some weird paint on
his<00:05:46.819> nose<00:05:47.089> I'm<00:05:47.330> not<00:05:47.449> sure<00:05:47.629> what's<00:05:47.839> up<00:05:47.929> with

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
his nose I'm not sure what's up with

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.169 
his nose I'm not sure what's up with
that<00:05:48.139> oh<00:05:48.499> and<00:05:49.249> this<00:05:49.369> one<00:05:49.610> fits<00:05:49.849> really<00:05:50.059> tight

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:50.179 
that oh and this one fits really tight

00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:51.969 
that oh and this one fits really tight
onto<00:05:50.629> his<00:05:50.749> neck<00:05:50.989> so<00:05:51.259> you<00:05:51.289> can't<00:05:51.589> move<00:05:51.709> it<00:05:51.889> at

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
onto his neck so you can't move it at

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.290 
onto his neck so you can't move it at
all<00:05:52.069> except<00:05:52.489> for<00:05:52.519> the<00:05:54.189> the<00:05:55.189> joint<00:05:55.489> at<00:05:55.639> the<00:05:55.669> neck

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
all except for the the joint at the neck

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.959 
all except for the the joint at the neck
and<00:05:56.509> the<00:05:56.569> torso<00:05:56.839> which<00:05:57.800> allows<00:05:58.099> very<00:05:58.669> little

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969 
and the torso which allows very little

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:00.609 
and the torso which allows very little
range<00:05:59.269> of<00:05:59.419> motion<00:05:59.719> when<00:05:59.839> you<00:05:59.929> use<00:06:00.050> it<00:06:00.199> by<00:06:00.319> it<00:06:00.379> so

00:06:00.609 --> 00:06:00.619 
range of motion when you use it by it so

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:03.100 
range of motion when you use it by it so
you<00:06:01.369> can't<00:06:01.610> turn<00:06:01.849> this<00:06:02.089> part<00:06:02.659> of<00:06:02.749> the<00:06:02.809> head<00:06:02.959> at

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
you can't turn this part of the head at

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.239 
you can't turn this part of the head at
all<00:06:03.229> only<00:06:03.469> right<00:06:03.739> here<00:06:05.679> and<00:06:06.679> he<00:06:06.769> also<00:06:06.949> comes

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:07.249 
all only right here and he also comes

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:08.709 
all only right here and he also comes
with<00:06:07.369> the<00:06:07.550> stand<00:06:07.819> they<00:06:07.999> could<00:06:08.179> plug<00:06:08.360> into<00:06:08.539> his

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:08.719 
with the stand they could plug into his

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:11.709 
with the stand they could plug into his
back<00:06:08.959> and<00:06:09.289> I<00:06:10.279> think<00:06:10.339> we'd<00:06:10.639> use<00:06:11.300> it<00:06:11.569> like<00:06:11.689> this

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719 
back and I think we'd use it like this

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:14.979 
back and I think we'd use it like this
it<00:06:12.259> works<00:06:12.469> very<00:06:12.769> well<00:06:13.329> but<00:06:14.329> it<00:06:14.479> also<00:06:14.629> comes

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:14.989 
it works very well but it also comes

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:17.290 
it works very well but it also comes
with<00:06:15.110> this<00:06:15.319> clamp<00:06:15.860> that<00:06:16.159> doesn't<00:06:17.059> seem<00:06:17.209> to

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
with this clamp that doesn't seem to

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.269 
with this clamp that doesn't seem to
work<00:06:17.419> well<00:06:17.659> at<00:06:17.839> all<00:06:17.989> it<00:06:18.499> doesn't<00:06:18.860> really<00:06:18.979> grip

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:19.279 
work well at all it doesn't really grip

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:21.669 
work well at all it doesn't really grip
him<00:06:19.459> I<00:06:19.779> mean<00:06:20.779> you<00:06:20.869> could<00:06:21.019> put<00:06:21.110> it<00:06:21.229> on<00:06:21.349> there<00:06:21.589> and

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:21.679 
him I mean you could put it on there and

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:24.879 
him I mean you could put it on there and
it'll<00:06:21.860> kind<00:06:22.129> of<00:06:22.219> hold<00:06:22.459> but<00:06:23.259> it<00:06:24.259> doesn't<00:06:24.679> it

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889 
it'll kind of hold but it doesn't it

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:26.350 
it'll kind of hold but it doesn't it
doesn't<00:06:25.219> work<00:06:25.309> so<00:06:25.519> well<00:06:25.699> and<00:06:25.879> it<00:06:25.999> can't<00:06:26.209> fit

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
doesn't work so well and it can't fit

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.389 
doesn't work so well and it can't fit
around<00:06:26.659> the<00:06:26.749> Cape<00:06:26.929> at<00:06:27.139> all<00:06:27.289> but<00:06:28.099> even<00:06:28.129> when

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:28.399 
around the Cape at all but even when

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:31.179 
around the Cape at all but even when
it's<00:06:28.519> right<00:06:28.669> there<00:06:28.939> it<00:06:29.659> falls<00:06:29.929> right<00:06:30.050> off<00:06:30.229> so

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:31.189 
it's right there it falls right off so

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:33.790 
it's right there it falls right off so
it's<00:06:31.699> not<00:06:31.879> very<00:06:32.149> sturdy<00:06:32.419> I<00:06:32.569> prefer<00:06:33.409> just<00:06:33.679> the

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
it's not very sturdy I prefer just the

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.949 
it's not very sturdy I prefer just the
piece<00:06:34.699> that<00:06:34.879> plugs<00:06:35.149> right<00:06:35.360> into<00:06:35.539> his<00:06:35.749> back

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:35.959 
piece that plugs right into his back

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:40.449 
piece that plugs right into his back
that<00:06:36.199> one<00:06:36.319> works<00:06:36.499> out<00:06:36.679> pretty<00:06:36.800> good<00:06:36.949> and<00:06:39.459> here

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:40.459 
that one works out pretty good and here

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:43.509 
that one works out pretty good and here
he<00:06:40.579> is<00:06:40.610> along<00:06:41.059> with<00:06:41.269> mapex<00:06:41.749> joker<00:06:42.110> and<00:06:42.409> i<00:06:42.519> think

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:43.519 
he is along with mapex joker and i think

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:46.839 
he is along with mapex joker and i think
they're<00:06:43.669> scaled<00:06:43.999> together<00:06:44.389> pretty<00:06:44.629> well<00:06:45.849> and

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:46.849 
they're scaled together pretty well and

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:49.869 
they're scaled together pretty well and
there<00:06:47.089> are<00:06:47.179> face-to-face<00:06:47.419> and<00:06:48.139> i<00:06:48.789> think<00:06:49.789> this

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:49.879 
there are face-to-face and i think this

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:53.319 
there are face-to-face and i think this
is<00:06:50.029> a<00:06:50.059> good<00:06:50.239> figure<00:06:50.659> and<00:06:51.699> it's<00:06:52.699> unfortunate

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:53.329 
is a good figure and it's unfortunate

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:55.059 
is a good figure and it's unfortunate
that<00:06:53.360> it<00:06:53.479> has<00:06:53.689> those<00:06:53.929> quality<00:06:54.469> control<00:06:54.800> issues

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:55.069 
that it has those quality control issues

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:56.199 
that it has those quality control issues
cuz<00:06:55.279> it<00:06:55.399> could<00:06:55.489> have<00:06:55.610> been<00:06:55.729> a<00:06:55.759> great<00:06:55.939> figure

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:56.209 
cuz it could have been a great figure

00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:57.790 
cuz it could have been a great figure
like<00:06:56.509> it<00:06:56.629> has<00:06:56.749> a<00:06:56.779> really<00:06:57.079> nice<00:06:57.259> detailed
