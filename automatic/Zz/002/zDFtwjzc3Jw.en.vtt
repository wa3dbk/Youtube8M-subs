00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.100
 [Music] 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.990
 good friends 13 sports as you can 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.870
 observe study the technical area with a 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.370
 really demonized heat we are 33 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.650
 degrees I did several tests this is the 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.110
 banking where will be josé manuel de la 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.790
 tower at about the same time 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.009
 party that you from here good then 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.590
 here is not so dramatic in the matter 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.989
 climatological by the chito response that 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.750
 has the famous bank now this is the 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.759
 radio or space let's say better said 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.739
 that will have mobility of josé manuel 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.620
 of the tower is impossible and believe me I left 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.110
 my dark glasses there stay more than 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.690
 twenty thirty seconds dark silent 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.200
 And what today makes it a cloudy day 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.000
 here in san pedro sula the grass is a 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.700
 little grown not as expected 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.940
 was much more so this will be the 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.710
 where joseba will be the tower between 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.360
 done the physical test 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.180
 of going around the Olympic stadium to 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.370
 the 400 meters practically in a 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.739
 minute and a half or so I ran over 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.570
 all that is the field the sweat itch 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.190
 the eyes create dams a situations 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.540
 that they are going to live here with the 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.880
 footballers and we are seeing the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.149
 tribas more or less to day meters where 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.750
 it will obviously stop for what is the 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.610
 banking a little more 15-16 meters at 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.860
 which is row 1 of the stadium of san 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.700
 pedro sula is Olympic stadium 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.770
 Well, it is in very little condition 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.409
 maintenance when we can observe in 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.109
 several of his 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.539
 of its grandstands and also orients 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.520
 boxes the stalls and so on this is the 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.799
 tunnel where the Mexican team will leave 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.049
 We'll see Luis Castillo with a piece 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.299
 from inside this classroom these 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.709
 locker rooms that do not have the 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.149
 great amenities as they are 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.200
 used something most of 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.250
 footballers both tourists and 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.099
 Mexicans 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.709
 the Mexicans who also owner who lives 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:57.049
 and that plays for teams from england and 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.060
 there in the 'old continent' the channel 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.679
 it's unbearable 33 degrees is doing 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.680
 this moment is expected for the 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.480
 party is hottest day 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.800
 see, let's do a test with the 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:13.680
 with the glasses forgive me why to say 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.680
 my eyes are choked with sweat I slip 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.959
 and we are doing it in a way 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.380
 let's say act totally I'm 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.410
 totally with sweat on the shirt 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.270
 it is unbearable and that we do not choose 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.730
 400 meters imagine a futurist that 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.620
 runs average between 6 and 7 kilometers 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.820
 by party towards death 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.940
 is going to be death at this stage 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:40.040
 ours is sounding and we 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.040
 let's go let's see more things about samper 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:03:06.809
 [Music] 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.940
 and after having seen what is the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.910
 hell outside already in the technical area 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.790
 this is the dressing room that will occupy mexico 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.840
 Next Friday the football field 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.970
 where josé manuel de la torre 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.470
 will surely make the last notes 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.690
 where will the tactical talk where 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.150
 will be talking to each of the 23 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.310
 players called on this occasion 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.530
 to face the catracho team as 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.050
 you can see then you have the amenities 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.720
 enough the dressing room actually made it 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.550
 we are going to leave little cards and with messages 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.860
 to each one is the one of giovanni there 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.170
 launch on behalf of gilberto alcalá here 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.020
 we are going to leave you to zavala on behalf of 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.390
 rafael ocampo and here here not from me 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.680
 because they turned things over there in 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.270
 valencia then how can it be 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.459
 seeing has got good pause to 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.980
 wait for him to be here is where he will come 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.750
 at the last moment to put the 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.550
 stopped the team surely with four 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.530
 defenses with twice containment with 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.230
 here one another by a peak here by 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.720
 here and another one that is ahead extra 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.739
 javier hernández on this screen see 13 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.360
 national selected sports 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.280
 will be seeing the criticisms of all 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.690
 us and here good because we are 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.480
 finishing to see the dressing room where 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.260
 Well, they obviously bathed here 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.240
 there are the common sprinklers 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.350
 I do not think they need hot water 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.350
 with the heat that makes 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:36.030
 and this is where the footballers and here 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.780
 is where good, if they have another type 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.110
 of needs 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.360
 this is the dressing room that will occupy mexico 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.980
 next Friday he will occupy it from the 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.380
 Thursday because they will come to do the 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.930
 recognition of the field and here they will be 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.360
 surely then each and every one of 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.820
 them in the massage rooms where there 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.400
 two massage rooms a first tub of 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.560
 hydromassage and the refrigerator for 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.360
 chelas late after the game then 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.020
 obviously throw them some chéveres with 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.990

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.540

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.090
 until we reached the field we already saw the 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.510
 technical zone where will be josé manuel de 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.390

 this tour here there are some announcements 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.410
 of motivation for Hondurans we go

 Honduran team this is a stadium 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.190
 opened in 1997 for games 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.840
 Central Americans here in san pedro sula 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.170
 this is the route that the 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.660
 players heading to the playing field there are 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.700
 several changing rooms that you could have us 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.070

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.430
 level here is another the dressing room as you 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:11.200
 they call in Central America that a little 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.020
 neglected and so here we see the 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:17.140
 final part this is the back of 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.080
 the grandstands of this Olympic stadium of 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.270
 san pedro sula and it 's a long journey 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.680

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.280
 decision a few years ago after the 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.820
 Exit of Sven Goran Eriksson Pass 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.980

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:16.350
 game here is where they will meet 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:19.139

 travel that we do in this stadium 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:29.880
 Olympic a strong temperature the one 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:32.130
 you feel right now and that's a 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.560
 long journey then the one that will do the 

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:37.020
 Mexican national soccer 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.690

 long travel for many long to 

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.440
 rethink the ideas to calibrate well 

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:57.360
 well the thought of what this will be 

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:01.250
