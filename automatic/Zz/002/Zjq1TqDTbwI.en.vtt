00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.879
 all welcome to a new video 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.009
 stoke this crazy robot game for 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.050
 android a very good game that has come out 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.720
 a few days ago and well here are the 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.269
 I bring as always nothing written will be 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.830
 one download of this game as as 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.689
 we have the game with an incognito of a 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.279
 chicken if all square we are going to enter 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.190
 the game so we can see it quite 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.830
 simple is pretty good and fun 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.810
 much whatever it is in a game the the 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.640
 game is pretty good let's wait 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.309
 to enter 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.160
 besides that the game is a game that 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.870
 you do not need so many graphics 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.100
 here we have to change character 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.320
 in this case we can go unlocking 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.750
 different characters as there are I have 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.100
 this way 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.770
 to see what I have this let's see what it is 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.030
 Well, I got it then 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.450
 how do you play then we simply have 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.450
 to go squeezing 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.140
 well we have to make us 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.450
 shock because we will not ask that we not 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.450
 run over and not that we crash but that 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.620
 do not run over us or anything like in ay uy 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:21.520
 uy uy no good the most I've spent are 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.320
 61 obstacles in this case every time 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.960
 We jump, we are told as a point 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.180
 as you see up there on the left goes 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.740
 counting the points that we are jumping 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.940
 well all the obstacles that we're going 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.890
 going to see let's see let's go 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.409
 very good 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.380
 do not 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.759
 well there it is and as if we do to 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.499
 right left of the good almost yes but 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.789
 we have to go fast because as in the 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:49.810
 camera like that is coming 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:52.359
 we have to go fast the truth I do not 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.429
 ran over good can play again what 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.259
 more that I have reached that 61 and the truth is not 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.590
 I know how team we are fast fast 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.420
 fast bounce here and I ran over 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.119
 good is quite simple to play 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.549
 we have here to play with what would be 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.530
 google + and compete with one of our 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.530
 friends and then here as to change the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.980
 character buy other characters in 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.959
 Here I only have 236 coins that is 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:23.340
 we are for her company well and now to 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.340
 see 321 runs run run 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.230
 The idea was to turn around not to 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.150
 jump but well let's go back to the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.830
 last time in the description as 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.810
 always in this line download the game 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.730
 the truth is that it is quite good and not 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.550
 you need as many graphs as others 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.290
 games I run over, shit we're going 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:46.560
 again the last to see if it is the last 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:51.360
 to see the train goes well already happened uy uy 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.780
 truth truth let's go step by step 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.349
 step by step, very slow 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.660
 let's see here we can win let's see a 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.370
 ad and already seeing this ad we 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.920
 would give coins in this case 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.680
 there's the ad but I want to see it 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.060
 well you will not see it because you can 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.340
 they put me I draw something percent 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.269
 the lots then appears simply 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.910
 is to see the ad and not pay coins 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:20.970
 I get this from croft clank and there's 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.890
 sent 20 coins we will win a 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.900
 prize here we give it to him like this and they relieve us 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.400
 100 coins and let's see what we get 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.019
 Well, do not leave a character 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.690
 good or anything else let's see 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.990
 I left a cow either had not let 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.780
 to play with the cow 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:42.140
 As you can see, each character is equal to 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.820
 500 coins of those but if they do not come out that way 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.400
 a prize because we will save a lot 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.620
 money has been evaluated here and the 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.380
 sound the cow I do not know if it will be 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.160
 recording the sound of 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:59.170
 of the game to see 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.570
 pass passa passa passa passa no w 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.850
 very slow there does not come out to qualify 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.040
 well that would be everything I hope there 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.410

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.150

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.340
