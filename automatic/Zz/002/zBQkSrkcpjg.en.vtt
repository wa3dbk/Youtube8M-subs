I got a ten and a half the knees just

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.080 
I got a ten and a half the knees just
like<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.069> get<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.370> Jordans<00:02:11.870> but<00:02:13.159> in<00:02:14.159> path<00:02:14.580> Kobe's

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.730 

and<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.540> reason<00:02:30.870> why<00:02:30.960> I<00:02:30.990> said<00:02:31.230> if<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.500> look<00:02:31.620> at

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
and the reason why I said if you look at

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.350 
and the reason why I said if you look at
my<00:02:31.890> passive<00:02:32.340> user<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.670> code<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.030> inks<00:02:33.240> they

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
my passive user to code the inks they

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.080 
my passive user to code the inks they
were<00:02:33.480> ten<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.810> half<00:02:33.930> two<00:02:34.290> but<00:02:34.790> they<00:02:35.790> fit

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
were ten and a half two but they fit

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.580 
were ten and a half two but they fit

you<00:04:16.320> guys<00:04:16.500> know<00:04:16.769> I<00:04:16.799> hate<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.310> infrared<00:04:17.850> but<00:04:18.090> it

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
you guys know I hate the infrared but it

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.360 
you guys know I hate the infrared but it
turned<00:04:18.780> out<00:04:18.959> pretty<00:04:19.140> nice<00:04:19.470> in<00:04:19.709> this<00:04:19.829> shoot

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
turned out pretty nice in this shoot

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.750 
turned out pretty nice in this shoot
that's<00:04:20.820> pretty<00:04:21.150> toned<00:04:21.479> down<00:04:21.630> compared<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:22.890> all

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
that's pretty toned down compared to all

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.760 
that's pretty toned down compared to all
the<00:04:24.000> other<00:04:24.180> shoe<00:04:24.479> especially<00:04:25.200> considering

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
the other shoe especially considering

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.540 
the other shoe especially considering
like<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:27.240> Yeezy<00:04:27.930> positive<00:04:28.890> stuff<00:04:29.100> like<00:04:29.310> that

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
like the Yeezy positive stuff like that

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.820 
like the Yeezy positive stuff like that
it's<00:04:29.790> in<00:04:30.060> that<00:04:30.090> family<00:04:30.810> tree<00:04:31.140> because<00:04:31.410> that's

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
it's in that family tree because that's

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.260 
it's in that family tree because that's
what<00:04:31.950> they're<00:04:32.130> doing<00:04:32.460> all<00:04:32.610> these<00:04:32.820> shoes<00:04:33.060> are

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
what they're doing all these shoes are

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.390 
what they're doing all these shoes are
pretty<00:04:33.419> much<00:04:33.690> in<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.050> idea

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
pretty much in the idea

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.730 
pretty much in the idea
the<00:04:36.560> easies<00:04:37.560> so<00:04:38.160> I<00:04:39.020> know<00:04:40.020> a<00:04:40.169> lot<00:04:40.410> of<00:04:40.440> people

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
the easies so I know a lot of people

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.379 
the easies so I know a lot of people
probably<00:04:41.070> ain't<00:04:41.190> paying<00:04:41.729> attention<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.270> that

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
probably ain't paying attention to that

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:43.850 
probably ain't paying attention to that
but<00:04:42.630> that's<00:04:42.780> that's<00:04:43.320> what<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:43.560> lot<00:04:43.710> of<00:04:43.740> these

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
but that's that's what a lot of these

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.469 
but that's that's what a lot of these
shoes<00:04:44.130> aren't<00:04:44.370> reminisces<00:04:44.940> uh<00:04:44.970> who's<00:04:45.360> the

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
shoes aren't reminisces uh who's the

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.120 
shoes aren't reminisces uh who's the
easy<00:04:45.660> they're<00:04:46.020> gonna<00:04:46.139> make<00:04:46.560> milk<00:04:46.830> and<00:04:47.009> his

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
easy they're gonna make milk and his

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.790 
easy they're gonna make milk and his
idea<00:04:47.520> as<00:04:47.699> much<00:04:47.880> as<00:04:48.000> they<00:04:48.150> can<00:04:48.389> pretty<00:04:48.720> much<00:04:48.990> now

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
idea as much as they can pretty much now

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.100 
idea as much as they can pretty much now
that<00:04:49.949> he's<00:04:50.100> would<00:04:50.280> indeed<00:04:50.960> almost<00:04:51.960> like<00:04:52.080> a

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
that he's would indeed almost like a

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.150 
that he's would indeed almost like a
slap<00:04:52.440> in<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.620> face

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
slap in the face

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.710 
slap in the face

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.350 
like I said they release Mather and
they're<00:04:56.940> going<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.150> go<00:04:57.270> for<00:04:57.889> 160<00:04:59.030> true<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:00.150> size
