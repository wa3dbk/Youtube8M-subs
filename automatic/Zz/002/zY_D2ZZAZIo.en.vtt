trying to hurt your family so the

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.349 
trying to hurt your family so the
problems<00:04:12.950> sometimes<00:04:13.249> can<00:04:13.609> arise<00:04:13.879> in<00:04:14.060> martial

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
problems sometimes can arise in martial

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.810 
problems sometimes can arise in martial
arts<00:04:14.450> that<00:04:14.749> if<00:04:15.049> you<00:04:15.499> always<00:04:15.739> train<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.639> fight

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
arts that if you always train to fight

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.330 
arts that if you always train to fight
fairly<00:04:17.120> when<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:17.989> time<00:04:18.199> comes<00:04:18.530> to<00:04:18.799> cheat<00:04:19.160> and

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
fairly when the time comes to cheat and

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.340 
fairly when the time comes to cheat and
not<00:04:19.430> fight<00:04:20.299> fairly<00:04:20.539> sometimes<00:04:20.870> people<00:04:21.259> have

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
not fight fairly sometimes people have

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.230 
not fight fairly sometimes people have
trouble<00:04:21.680> making<00:04:21.859> that<00:04:22.009> switch<00:04:22.280> because<00:04:22.910> a<00:04:23.060> way

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
trouble making that switch because a way

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.520 
trouble making that switch because a way
that<00:04:23.419> you<00:04:23.479> train<00:04:23.720> is<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:23.960> way<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.169> you<00:04:24.289> fight

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
that you train is the way that you fight

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.339 
that you train is the way that you fight
so<00:04:25.430> if<00:04:25.669> you<00:04:25.820> fight<00:04:26.330> fairly<00:04:26.810> when<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:27.080> train

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:27.349 
so if you fight fairly when you train

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:29.140 
so if you fight fairly when you train
you<00:04:27.680> tend<00:04:27.979> to<00:04:28.070> fight<00:04:28.250> fairly<00:04:28.490> when<00:04:28.849> you're<00:04:29.000> not

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
you tend to fight fairly when you're not

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.879 
you tend to fight fairly when you're not
training<00:04:30.910> for<00:04:31.910> us<00:04:32.090> there's<00:04:32.509> a<00:04:32.599> definite<00:04:33.050> idea

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
training for us there's a definite idea

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.760 
training for us there's a definite idea
of<00:04:34.130> thinking<00:04:34.460> outside<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.820> box<00:04:35.410> put<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.560> Sun

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
of thinking outside the box put the Sun

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.290 
of thinking outside the box put the Sun
in<00:04:36.979> your<00:04:37.190> opponent's<00:04:37.370> eyes<00:04:37.639> spilled<00:04:38.060> beer<00:04:38.270> on

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
in your opponent's eyes spilled beer on

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.060 
in your opponent's eyes spilled beer on
the<00:04:38.479> floor<00:04:38.690> and<00:04:38.870> make<00:04:38.990> them<00:04:39.139> slip<00:04:39.380> on<00:04:39.530> it<00:04:39.650> no

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
the floor and make them slip on it no

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.469 
the floor and make them slip on it no
it's<00:04:40.460> going<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.669> bars<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:41.090> let<00:04:41.210> them<00:04:41.360> and

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
it's going to bars to let them and

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.210 
it's going to bars to let them and
they're<00:04:41.570> not<00:04:41.599> looking<00:04:42.070> anything<00:04:43.070> and

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
they're not looking anything and

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.909 
they're not looking anything and
everything<00:04:43.550> is<00:04:43.729> is<00:04:44.300> okay<00:04:44.720> a<00:04:44.930> traditional

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
everything is is okay a traditional

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.800 
everything is is okay a traditional
martial<00:04:46.070> arts<00:04:46.250> I<00:04:46.430> think<00:04:46.639> have<00:04:46.849> a<00:04:47.180> depth<00:04:47.630> of

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
martial arts I think have a depth of

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.230 
martial arts I think have a depth of
spirituality<00:04:48.710> that<00:04:49.190> comes<00:04:49.460> from<00:04:49.880> actually

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
spirituality that comes from actually

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.020 
spirituality that comes from actually
trying<00:04:50.630> to<00:04:50.690> understand<00:04:51.259> the<00:04:52.030> relationship

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
trying to understand the relationship

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.730 
trying to understand the relationship
between<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.419> practitioner<00:04:53.990> in<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.139> world<00:04:54.410> so

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
between the practitioner in the world so

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.249 
between the practitioner in the world so
for<00:04:54.889> example<00:04:55.340> within<00:04:56.000> Budo<00:04:56.389> taijutsu<00:04:56.419> there's

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
for example within Budo taijutsu there's

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.230 
for example within Budo taijutsu there's
the<00:04:57.440> idea<00:04:57.560> that<00:04:57.889> I<00:04:57.919> have<00:04:58.099> to<00:04:58.130> understand<00:04:58.669> when

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
the idea that I have to understand when

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.270 
the idea that I have to understand when
to<00:04:59.449> kill<00:04:59.630> somebody<00:04:59.840> and<00:05:00.169> when<00:05:00.710> not<00:05:00.919> to<00:05:01.099> kill
