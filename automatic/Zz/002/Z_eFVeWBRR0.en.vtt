 they loaded them well 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.840
 it seems perfect because from 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.840
 started hitting 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.400

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.400

 It's the first time I play call of duty 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.150
 in the xbox 1 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:48.730

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.730
 option and what game in the xbox one 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.120
 and the controls are very different 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.379

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.310

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.480
