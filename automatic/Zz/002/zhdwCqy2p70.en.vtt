00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
it kind of a cleaner look and I'll have

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.080 
it kind of a cleaner look and I'll have
the<00:03:52.110> little<00:03:52.350> turn<00:03:52.920> signal<00:03:53.280> lights<00:03:53.459> down<00:03:53.670> here

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
the little turn signal lights down here

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.690 
the little turn signal lights down here
so<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:55.049> don't<00:03:55.590> want<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:55.980> put<00:03:56.100> them<00:03:56.220> on<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.370> forks

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
so I don't want to put them on the forks

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.000 
so I don't want to put them on the forks
as<00:03:56.910> I'm<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.090> how<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.239> fairing<00:03:57.660> so<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:58.170> have<00:03:58.920> the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
as I'm a how the fairing so I have the

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.630 
as I'm a how the fairing so I have the
fort<00:03:59.250> boots

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
fort boots

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.180 
fort boots

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
so it'd be pretty clean by going to get

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.400 
so it'd be pretty clean by going to get
rid<00:04:02.310> of<00:04:02.340> every<00:04:03.269> bit<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.450> chrome<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:03.900> can<00:04:04.110> on<00:04:04.260> the

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.920 
rid of every bit of chrome I can on the
