00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
all sort of driven by this what I think

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.050 
all sort of driven by this what I think
is<00:03:21.959> really<00:03:22.140> kind<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.680> stereo<00:03:23.640> ver<00:03:23.820> drunk

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.340 
actually I think the the PR campaign
that<00:03:29.970> we've<00:03:30.060> had<00:03:30.239> since<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.600> early<00:03:30.870> 80s<00:03:31.170> on

stumbles out of the bar and gets into

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.479 
stumbles out of the bar and gets into

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
the car and sort of swell longer do now

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.009 
the car and sort of swell longer do now
we<00:03:44.549> that<00:03:44.970> guy's<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.180> pariah<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:45.840> think

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
we that guy's a pariah and I think

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.930 
we that guy's a pariah and I think
that's<00:03:46.140> great<00:03:46.440> but<00:03:47.280> I<00:03:47.340> think<00:03:47.400> it's<00:03:47.730> it's

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
that's great but I think it's it's

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.580 
that's great but I think it's it's
social<00:03:48.329> pressure<00:03:48.570> that<00:03:48.870> has<00:03:48.989> done<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.560> I

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
social pressure that has done that and I

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.530 
social pressure that has done that and I
thought<00:03:49.739> but<00:03:49.920> let's<00:03:50.100> talk<00:03:50.310> about<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.610> law<00:03:51.329> the

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540

the<00:05:51.900> actual<00:05:52.260> reckless<00:05:52.620> driving<00:05:53.070> and<00:05:53.130> not

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
the actual reckless driving and not

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.720 
the actual reckless driving and not
whatever<00:05:53.729> it<00:05:53.880> is<00:05:54.000> that's<00:05:54.150> causing<00:05:54.419> it
