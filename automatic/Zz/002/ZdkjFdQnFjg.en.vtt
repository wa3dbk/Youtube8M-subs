00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
problem so created a nice I think a very

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.820 
problem so created a nice I think a very
interesting<00:01:06.240> cover<00:01:06.600> for<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.650> what

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
interesting cover for it it's like what

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.160 
interesting cover for it it's like what
you<00:01:07.860> can't<00:01:08.159> hide<00:01:08.400> highlight<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.720> what<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.020> got

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
you can't hide highlight so what you got

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.560 
you can't hide highlight so what you got
is<00:01:10.200> three<00:01:10.650> humbuckers<00:01:11.369> mm-hmm<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.420> also

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
is three humbuckers mm-hmm and you also

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.719 
is three humbuckers mm-hmm and you also
have<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> switch<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.740> let<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.920> connect

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
have a switch that can let you connect

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.429 
have a switch that can let you connect
these<00:01:14.850> two<00:01:15.060> pickups<00:01:15.390> together<00:01:15.720> mm-hmm

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
these two pickups together mm-hmm

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.109 
these two pickups together mm-hmm
