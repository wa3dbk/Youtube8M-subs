 few personal posts plus one that 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.280
 I wanted to draw attention 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.180
 the windows 7 simulator 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.550

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.070
 website that made it available for you to do 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.199

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.470

 start converting it sometimes 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:38.720
 sometimes not this process of cd paradise 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:43.860
 takes a while but has its advantages 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.340
 example if by chance you en-sc or 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.340
 in the car 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.200
 in the case of a customer 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.050
 you take a client without wanting you 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.150
 Forget your cd inside your computer. 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:08.130
 Customer already happened to me this cd you 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.570
 can you recover or not you do not have everything 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.510
 a stress of calling the customer 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:16.890
 asked the computer to look, I do not know who 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.390
 has the skin time of passage and 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.050
 money why waste time already 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:26.310
 but money is so you do this 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.670
 backup with this decap in hand is only 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.690
 to record a cd and a personal cd is a 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.840
 seated 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.310
 I do not know where you live more here, this is 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.200
 a real maximum 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.910
 if I go to the most expensive bookstore on ipsep 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:47.250
 complain but that's not the case now 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:52.160
 I'm going to leave here for years and I'll go here. 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.160
 countless files where I already have one 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.930
 made does not have to be at all 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.290
 process 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:06.120
 The girl plays here already has this is not the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:10.620
 shame of the country games gta 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.070
 What's this one, it's just me. 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:19.370
 I can call it like an app 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:19.370
 It's true that when I click here 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:31.230
 recorded on a disc dvd cd 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.550
 if I had another unit I could boto 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.240
 a dvd 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.480
 ie boot record after I return to 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.880
 record it will record this is the cd that 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.480
 had to have pictures here is nothing short of 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.390
 than the image of the cd will record all in 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.360
 other dvd or cv case 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.570
 so I'll have the same cd in others 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.360
 even if you understood me and if I did not 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.910
 I want to see if I want to, for example, have 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.570
 I particularly do not carry the 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.990
 cd games 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.400
 sorry I do not download cd games I 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.150
 I carry it 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.590
 click here with this program iha 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.590
 installed right-click 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.440
 opens with an error 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:30.150
 and Rรกรกรก opens the file for me 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.030
 hotels there I'll open here that this 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.060
 here is a cd with two floors 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.790
 okay then he will open here for me to open and 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.480
 going to extract it will take a millennium 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.980
 then I could go into a game setup 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.660
 quietly as if nothing had happened 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:56.400
 It's happening, everyone is fine, this is it. 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.960
 Did you understand that to record 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.180
 there is only give two clicks 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.740
 after that he will ask for the place where 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:09.130
 It's going to be a cd and that's a question. 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:13.600
 That you will not do enough is 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:17.080

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:20.220
