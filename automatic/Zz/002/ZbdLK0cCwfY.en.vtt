00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
a lesson in biomechanics you can see the

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.799 
a lesson in biomechanics you can see the
the<00:00:10.290> ligament<00:00:10.620> itself<00:00:10.980> has<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.809> complicated

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
the ligament itself has that complicated

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.169 
the ligament itself has that complicated
twist<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.469> using<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.250> leg<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.580> lamb<00:00:14.610> from<00:00:15.089> a

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
twist to it using a leg of lamb from a

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.750 
twist to it using a leg of lamb from a
local<00:00:15.389> butcher<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.830> typically<00:00:17.400> how

local butcher this is typically how
Donnell<00:00:18.210> McNally<00:00:18.600> would<00:00:18.960> teach<00:00:19.199> Anatomy<00:00:19.800> but

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
Donnell McNally would teach Anatomy but

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.880 
Donnell McNally would teach Anatomy but
he's<00:00:20.760> also<00:00:20.970> devised<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.960> cookbook<00:00:22.380> for

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
he's also devised this cookbook for

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.620 
he's also devised this cookbook for
students<00:00:23.490> what<00:00:23.880> I'm<00:00:23.970> going<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.119> do<00:00:24.240> first<00:00:24.449> of

students what I'm going to do first of

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.410 
students what I'm going to do first of
all<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:25.019> take<00:00:25.289> off<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.769> string<00:00:26.240> that<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
all is just take off the string that the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.689 
all is just take off the string that the
butcher<00:00:28.170> has<00:00:28.260> kindly<00:00:28.560> put<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:29.220> full<00:00:29.550> of

image in your mind about what these
structures<00:00:47.430> are<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:47.910> what<00:00:48.390> they<00:00:48.510> feel<00:00:48.690> like

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
structures are like what they feel like

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.500 
structures are like what they feel like
how<00:00:49.230> strong<00:00:49.530> they<00:00:49.680> are<00:00:49.710> how<00:00:49.980> tough<00:00:50.219> they<00:00:50.430> are

how strong they are how tough they are
you're<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.780> make<00:00:51.870> decisions<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
you're going to make decisions that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.069 
you're going to make decisions that
aren't<00:00:52.920> based<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:54.000> everything<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.840> you

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
aren't based on everything that you

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.040 
aren't based on everything that you
could<00:00:55.590> know<00:00:56.300> whereas<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.629> take<00:00:57.809> something

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
could know whereas if you take something

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.930 
could know whereas if you take something
apart<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.129> play<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.910> feel

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
apart and you play with it and you feel

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.209 
apart and you play with it and you feel
it<00:01:00.149> any<00:01:00.570> fiddle<00:01:00.899> with<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.829> get<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.010> much

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
it any fiddle with it you get a much

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.520 
it any fiddle with it you get a much
better<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.570> model<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.960> what's<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.409> on

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
better in a model of what's going on

better in a model of what's going on
Donna's<00:01:05.430> cookbook<00:01:05.820> might<00:01:06.030> not<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
Donna's cookbook might not be in the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.780 
Donna's cookbook might not be in the
local<00:01:07.020> stores<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.890> will<00:01:08.070> continue<00:01:08.490> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
local stores but it will continue to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.050 
local stores but it will continue to
educate<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.570> feed<00:01:10.520> students<00:01:11.520> who<00:01:11.640> take<00:01:11.850> his

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
educate and feed students who take his

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:25.000 
educate and feed students who take his
course<00:01:13.490> Brady<00:01:14.490> Haran<00:01:14.610> East<00:01:15.390> Midlands<00:01:15.810> today

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.950 

so<00:01:26.010> this<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.520> leg<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.790> lamb<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.210> we've

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
so this is just a leg of lamb that we've

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.730 
so this is just a leg of lamb that we've
got<00:01:28.800> from<00:01:28.980> the<00:01:29.070> butchers<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:30.410> fact<00:01:31.410> if<00:01:31.560> we<00:01:31.590> have

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
got from the butchers in fact if we have

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.710 
got from the butchers in fact if we have
a<00:01:31.770> look<00:01:31.890> at<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.670> see<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.030> ball<00:01:33.300> of<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
a look at it you can see the ball of the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.890 
a look at it you can see the ball of the
hip<00:01:33.960> joint<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.400> there<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:38.900> back

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
hip joint just there so this is a back

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.320 
hip joint just there so this is a back
leg<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.700> think<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.940> ball<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.300> hip

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
leg so if you think the ball of the hip

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.940 
leg so if you think the ball of the hip
joints<00:01:42.720> there<00:01:42.930> that's<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.530> Achilles<00:01:43.890> tendon

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
joints there that's the Achilles tendon

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.359 
joints there that's the Achilles tendon
there<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:45.450> we've<00:01:45.630> got<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> right<00:01:46.080> leg<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
there so we've got a right leg so the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.490 
there so we've got a right leg so the
idea<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.850> we<00:01:50.930> between<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.170> sort<00:01:52.380> of

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
idea is that we between the sort of

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.290 
idea is that we between the sort of
getting<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.220> meat<00:01:53.340> out<00:01:53.400> of<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:53.760> fridge<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
getting the meat out of the fridge and

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.389 
getting the meat out of the fridge and
the<00:01:55.610> cooking<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:58.040> have<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> bit<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.340> a

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
the cooking of it we have a bit of a

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.040 
the cooking of it we have a bit of a
defect<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.330> you<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.509> actually<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
defect so that you can actually see the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.690 
defect so that you can actually see the
structures<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> feel<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.160> look<00:02:02.550> at

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
structures and have a feel and look at

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.590 
structures and have a feel and look at
them<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.630> that's<00:02:03.810> what<00:02:04.050> so<00:02:05.009> important<00:02:05.490> about

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
them and that's what so important about

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.070 
them and that's what so important about
understanding<00:02:06.600> these<00:02:06.720> structures

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
understanding these structures

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.449 
understanding these structures
especially<00:02:07.229> from<00:02:07.649> these<00:02:07.830> sort<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.040> mechanics

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
especially from these sort of mechanics

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.070 
especially from these sort of mechanics
point<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.759> view<00:02:08.850> you<00:02:09.239> can<00:02:09.360> actually<00:02:09.450> hold<00:02:09.780> one

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
point of view you can actually hold one

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.930 
point of view you can actually hold one
and<00:02:10.259> fiddle<00:02:10.619> with<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.070> play<00:02:11.580> with<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.760> and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
and fiddle with it and play with it and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.910 
and fiddle with it and play with it and
see<00:02:12.030> what<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.270> feels<00:02:12.510> like<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:13.320> get<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:13.770> much

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
see what it feels like you get so much

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.440 
see what it feels like you get so much
more<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.220> an<00:02:14.340> understanding<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:15.000> what's

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
more of an understanding of what's

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.150 
more of an understanding of what's
happening<00:02:15.720> no<00:02:16.170> it's<00:02:16.380> not<00:02:16.470> required<00:02:16.920> it's

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
happening no it's not required it's

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.729 
happening no it's not required it's
something<00:02:17.489> that's<00:02:17.670> extra<00:02:18.120> they<00:02:18.300> want<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.750> and

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
something that's extra they want to and

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.040 
something that's extra they want to and
I<00:02:19.830> think<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:21.000> be<00:02:21.120> absolutely<00:02:21.390> honest<00:02:21.840> it

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
I think to be absolutely honest it

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.140 
I think to be absolutely honest it
really<00:02:22.080> rather<00:02:22.680> depends<00:02:23.160> how<00:02:23.310> happy<00:02:23.970> they<00:02:24.120> are

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
really rather depends how happy they are

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:31.699 
really rather depends how happy they are
in<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.510> kitchen<00:02:27.530> if<00:02:28.530> you're<00:02:29.370> um<00:02:30.260> but<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.410> the

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
in the kitchen if you're um but the the

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.590 
in the kitchen if you're um but the the
spare<00:02:31.950> ribs<00:02:32.130> seem<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.640> be<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.209> recipe

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
spare ribs seem to be the the recipe

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.860 
spare ribs seem to be the the recipe
that<00:02:33.750> attracts<00:02:34.410> them<00:02:34.560> if<00:02:35.489> you're<00:02:36.000> if<00:02:36.390> you're

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
that attracts them if you're if you're

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.270 
that attracts them if you're if you're
studying<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.590> sort<00:02:37.799> of<00:02:37.860> thing<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.130> have<00:02:38.160> a

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
studying the sort of thing you have a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.699 
studying the sort of thing you have a
picture<00:02:38.519> in<00:02:38.640> your<00:02:38.700> mind<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.930> if<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.410> look<00:02:40.560> at

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
picture in your mind and if you look at

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.320 
picture in your mind and if you look at
pictures<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:41.370> books<00:02:41.400> no<00:02:41.790> matter<00:02:41.940> how<00:02:42.090> good<00:02:42.269> the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
pictures in books no matter how good the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.370 
pictures in books no matter how good the
books<00:02:42.570> are<00:02:42.780> they<00:02:43.080> flap<00:02:43.350> their

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
books are they flap their

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.830 
books are they flap their
two-dimensional<00:02:44.220> from<00:02:45.150> some<00:02:45.330> fantastic

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
two-dimensional from some fantastic

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.590 
two-dimensional from some fantastic
websites<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.730> there<00:02:47.730> again<00:02:47.880> if<00:02:48.239> you<00:02:48.330> look<00:02:48.450> at

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
websites and there again if you look at

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.310 
websites and there again if you look at
them<00:02:48.720> they're<00:02:49.170> flat<00:02:49.470> there<00:02:49.920> two<00:02:50.040> dimensional

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
them they're flat there two dimensional

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.130 
them they're flat there two dimensional
so<00:02:52.320> this<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.620> an<00:02:52.739> idea<00:02:53.040> about<00:02:53.810> getting<00:02:54.810> them<00:02:54.959> to

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
so this is an idea about getting them to

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.050 
so this is an idea about getting them to
actually<00:02:55.440> get<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.130> there<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.430> feel<00:02:56.760> what<00:02:57.000> a

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
actually get in there and feel what a

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.120 
actually get in there and feel what a
joint<00:02:57.330> sly<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.380> can<00:02:58.530> see<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.769> dot<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
joint sly so you can see the dot in the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.520 
joint sly so you can see the dot in the
knee<00:02:59.280> joint<00:02:59.310> moving<00:02:59.880> now<00:03:00.000> but<00:03:00.930> also<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.290> get<00:03:01.500> a

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
knee joint moving now but also to get a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.770 
knee joint moving now but also to get a
feel<00:03:01.769> for<00:03:01.980> what<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.130> materials<00:03:02.549> align<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.630> if

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
feel for what the materials align so if

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.039 
feel for what the materials align so if
you<00:03:03.870> look<00:03:03.989> at<00:03:04.110> this<00:03:04.230> hip<00:03:04.980> joint<00:03:05.250> here

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.000 
you look at this hip joint here
absolutely<00:03:07.049> beautiful<00:03:07.170> it's<00:03:07.590> lovely<00:03:07.860> and
