 favorites that I always speak on the blog 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.800
 Well, welcome the Latino community 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.530
 and good thing before starting with the 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.260
 juices and recipes practically a 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.300
 bit like how you got you started 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.339
 what about the cubes, well, I am an actress 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.629
 I am a producer of a long time ago and 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.089
 four years ago I started a blog called 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.460
 natural organic and latina chicanos 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.780
 dotcom and there I started talking after 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.330
 of holistic life after I graduated from 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.369
 holistic nutritionist and the juices or the 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.080
 juice therapy as I like to call 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.520
 something that I 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.380
 a long time ago and you can not 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.180
 write about something you do not know about 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.190
 final always disguises true and 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.619
 people discover things then 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.210
 good I started to give in my blog of my 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.310
 own experiences of how I change 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.140
 my life to a more natural life here is 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.290
 the tour and chemical preservative already start 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.600
 to make it happen in mother nature what 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.820
 that mother nature gives you is always 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.580
 good for you then I started 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.040
 develop games and different recipes 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.509
 and now I'm presenting you here 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.320
 I want to present you and your audience 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.789
 two very good natural juices that 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.190
 I developed for an organization that 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.360
 called honey pure point or heretic that I 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.070
 loved developed because they are 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.050
 originals for them today I'm going to 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.360
 share those recipes with you too 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.770
 here that comes in handy and they are juices that 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.020
 always incorporate honey as the 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.300
 main ingredient because honey is 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.649
 one of the natural sweeteners that 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.810
 gives us the nature is worth the 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.450
 redundancy and that we sometimes do not 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.830
 we know if it's good if it's bad and here 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.840
 I'm here to tell you that the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.610
 We can use with confidence over 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.680
 everything if you are in some diet 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.880
 or if you 're not also or if you want 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.490
 just him 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.710
 late your life the sweeteners that do not 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.940
 are natural that my communication and I 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.700
 statistics I always tell people 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.280
 that goes by the natural thing and that that 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.900
 try to remove and make a step to the 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.060
 time that seems more important to me than 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.380
 send you a radical customer 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.750
 from one day to the next yes and that is 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.000
 important so if you do not have paper 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.340
 and go pen because you're going to have to 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.940
 write down some great things look 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.240
 which is very important me for example 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.750
 I want to start started little by little 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.060
 I'm not full because then no no no 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.620
 I know a lot of what there was of all this I 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.940
 that's why I'm happy about life 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.530
 because today we are going to learn 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.940
 a lot of things that I'm going to go 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.880
 houston with a good impression that 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.900
 I'm going to make it clear 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.060
 of course 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.280
 good start with how good I am going to 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.630
 do I have two games here I have one 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.700
 that I really like that is the one 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.650
 avocado to the truth the avocado with 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.660
 honey also always add a 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.040
 little bit of parsley if you have extractor 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.510
 of juices you can make the extractor 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.790
 of the cube or if you can do in the 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.500
 blender I like a blender more 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.760
 the consistency I made them and you 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.819
 project not to be here 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.560
 to the blender and everything here I have it here 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.349
 the consistency is a little more liquid to 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:38.920
 I like it a little more sometimes more I 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:40.720
 I am professional because suddenly I eat 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.250
 that if they have a flavor half rare 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.659
 you're also because it's also very 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.640
 sweet is very rich then also you 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.739
 You put your two teaspoons of honey as 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.390
 you want after which what 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.250
 do yes because there are people who 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.599
 they use sugar but this is much more 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.340
 healthy yes but sugar by 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.680
 diabetics can not use sugar 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.390
 also l honey has to also 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.609
 control yourself depends on your condition 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.109
 I always say this is a this is not a 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.810
 regime this is a lifestyle and 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.340
 season shows life is what it is 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.349
 what I recommend and that's why I have two 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.760
 things to share with you this juice 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.470

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.569
 ingredients for you give me what 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.879
 you can take it daily in the morning 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.859
 love taking it daily is 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.660
 honey very nice if you have something in the 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.690
 throat who also clarified a 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.190
 little throat because honey has 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.990
 properties not like who says anti 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.000

 there you have your morning juice with the 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.210
 fish about the avocado with what to me 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.340
 I like to refuse in my blog in girl not 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.039
