00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 I'll come back today for a 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.319
 new video so this will be a tutorial 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.540
 makeup 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.719
 so it's necessarily the one I'm wearing 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.969
 the currently and it's a make-up that 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.360
 I realized with the very last 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.850
 collection of ac ac a toy alvarez and 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.410
 it's the collection so mecha people 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.420
 selected from the collection some 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.609
 items that tempted me which pleased me 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.650
 and I decided to make a tutor with 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.990
 so that you can 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.099
 report pigmentation and 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.109
 the quality of its products 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.790
 so here's how comes the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.489
 packaging of the collection so it's a 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.570
 packaging very very very solar and for 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.219
 those but as I got everything 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.930
 simply inspired by the photo of 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.610
 cover that I will put you in bar 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.610
 of information and I find that this make 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.070
 up really gathers the cold side of 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.690
 the sea and the show side of the sun 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.879
 since there is a mixture of hot and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.610
 cold on in this tutorial I'm going to use 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.320
 so the little trio I chose because 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.170
 it seems to me that there is so blush to 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.180
 eyelids and so I chose the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.800
 warm shades and in regards 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.199
 the cool shades be it blue 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.180
 marine or turquoise in internal corner 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.939
 know that they are available in 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.619
 this collection here I used some 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.780
 flagship of my arabian palette everything 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.950
 just because I'm not here 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.900
 selected its flagship here since I 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.880
 had already in my collection and so of 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.890
 that's it I chose it 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.140
 headlights that are extremely pigmented 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.340
 I think they call it lighthouses 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.930
 micronized so they are very very 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.250
 pigmented by cons I find them a 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.409
 little drop where I'm also going in 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.189
 enjoy to introduce yourself and put 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.770
 in action 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.000
 the latter thus leaving home is 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.020
 donald is what I had presented to you 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.329
 in my favorites 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.610
 and so that's the luxury range is 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.750
 essential and that are really great 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.220
 as I wanted to say in the video 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.350
 favorites are passers - by who are 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.939
 extra sweet so that 's how 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.710
 who knows you realize what 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.180
 it can give with his brushes the hand 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.479
 if you're interested I leave you with 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.479
 Coy 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.040
 m 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.700
 and 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.350
