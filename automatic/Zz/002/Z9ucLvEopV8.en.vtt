00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:36.370

 And the tofu . 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.000
 I think you should pour it only until you want to be a little browned. 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:37.200
 You can always get ready for that in the scramble. 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:42.110

 So you can mix it up . 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:14.560
 Now that I 'm sick, I give too much breath to the bonus. 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.560
