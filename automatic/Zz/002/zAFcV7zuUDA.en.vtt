00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Translator: Liridon Shala Reviewer: Amantia Gjikondi 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
 I've been learning to think about Ted's audience as a very cool collection 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
 some of the most intelligent, effective, 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
 intellectual, wise, 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
 globally and at the same time very innovative people in the world. 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
 And I think this is true. 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
 However, I also have reason to believe 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
 that many, if not many of you 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
 are tying your dice wrongly. 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
 (Laughter) 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
 Now I know it looks ridiculous. 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
 I know you look ridiculous 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
 And believe me, I have lived the same painful life 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
 up to 3 years ago. 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
 And what happened to me is that I am 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
 I bought the church, what was for me, a very expensive pair of shoes. 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
 Those shoes came with a nylon tie, 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
 and I could keep you connected. 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
 So I went back to the store and asked the owner, 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
 "I love the shoes, but I hate my bonds." 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
 He saw them and said, "Oh you are tying those mistakes." 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
 Now until that moment, 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
 I had thought that, up to the age of 50, 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
 one of the skills I've really nailed to 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
 was to tie my shoes. 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
 But it was not ashty - let me demonstrate it. 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
 That's the way 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
 that most of us have been taught how to tie our shoes. 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
 Now apparently - Thank you. 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
 Wait, there's more. 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
 As it seems, 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
 there is a strong way and a weak knot shape, 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
 and we are taught to tie it to the weakest. 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
 And that's how it should. 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
 If you put the thread on the base of the node, 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
 you will see that the bow will orient yourself 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
 down the shoe axis. 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
 This is the weak form of node connection. 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
 But do not be bored. 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
 If we start from scratch 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
 and just go in the opposite direction 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
 around the arch, 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
 we benefit from this, the strong knot connection mode. 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
 And if we put the spangles under the node, 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
 you will see that the axis orientates itself 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
 on the ankle axis. 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
 This is a strong way of joining the joints. Most of the time comes unrelated. 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
 It will leave you to, 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
 and not just that, looks better. 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
 We will do this one more time. 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
 (Applause) 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.260
 It starts as usual, 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
 goes to other menya around the loop. 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
 This is a bit difficult for children, 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
 but I think we can handle it. 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
 Drag the node. 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
 Here's the tight knot connection. 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.260
 Now, if we continue on the topic of the day, 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
 I want to emphasize - something you already know - 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
 which is sometimes a small advantage 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
 somewhere in the jet 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
 can bring you very good results elsewhere. 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
 Live long and successfully. 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
 (Applause)
