the deposition he thought using

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.719 
the deposition he thought using
quaaludes<00:01:55.229> was<00:01:55.500> no<00:01:55.680> different<00:01:56.130> from<00:01:56.310> using

civil lawsuit so it's correct that he's
never<00:03:38.110> faced<00:03:38.530> any<00:03:38.860> type<00:03:39.160> of<00:03:39.600> prosecution<00:03:40.600> he's

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
never faced any type of prosecution he's

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.350 
never faced any type of prosecution he's
never<00:03:41.530> been<00:03:41.710> convicted<00:03:42.160> of<00:03:42.460> rape<00:03:42.670> but<00:03:43.240> the

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
never been convicted of rape but the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.480 
never been convicted of rape but the
fact<00:03:43.570> that<00:03:43.660> he<00:03:43.870> admitted<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.680> obtaining<00:03:45.250> these

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
fact that he admitted to obtaining these

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.000 
fact that he admitted to obtaining these
drugs<00:03:45.850> with<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.810> intention<00:03:47.290> of<00:03:47.380> drugging

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
drugs with the intention of drugging

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.580 
drugs with the intention of drugging
young<00:03:48.220> women<00:03:48.520> and<00:03:48.610> having<00:03:48.850> sex<00:03:49.090> with<00:03:49.150> them

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
young women and having sex with them

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.140 
young women and having sex with them
proves<00:03:50.590> that<00:03:50.980> he's<00:03:51.280> done<00:03:51.490> something<00:03:51.850> wrong

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
proves that he's done something wrong

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.870 
proves that he's done something wrong
yeah<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.080> I<00:03:53.650> think<00:03:53.800> their<00:03:54.130> cover<00:03:54.340> story<00:03:54.430> is

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
yeah and I think their cover story is

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.090 
yeah and I think their cover story is
and<00:03:55.210> the<00:03:55.600> cover<00:03:55.810> itself<00:03:56.110> is<00:03:56.320> incredibly

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
and the cover itself is incredibly

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.330 
and the cover itself is incredibly
powerful<00:03:57.610> so<00:03:58.150> first<00:03:58.690> off<00:03:58.930> you<00:03:59.320> look<00:04:00.040> at<00:04:00.130> all

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
powerful so first off you look at all

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.090 
powerful so first off you look at all
those<00:04:00.760> women<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:01.360> it<00:04:01.720> tells<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.830> Whoopi

you<00:04:27.130> know<00:04:27.250> that's<00:04:27.699> it's<00:04:28.210> kind<00:04:28.539> of<00:04:28.630> brilliant

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
you know that's it's kind of brilliant

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.370 
you know that's it's kind of brilliant
because<00:04:29.590> some<00:04:30.009> people<00:04:30.280> took<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.789> as

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
because some people took it as

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.860 
because some people took it as
representing<00:04:32.380> all<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.650> other<00:04:32.830> women<00:04:33.130> who

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
representing all the other women who

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.390 
representing all the other women who
might<00:04:34.870> have<00:04:35.020> come<00:04:35.259> forward<00:04:35.530> or<00:04:35.770> could<00:04:36.160> come

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
might have come forward or could come

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.659 
might have come forward or could come
forward<00:04:36.970> later<00:04:37.240> I<00:04:37.539> took<00:04:38.199> it<00:04:38.319> as<00:04:38.500> could<00:04:39.460> be<00:04:39.580> the

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
forward later I took it as could be the

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.210 
forward later I took it as could be the
next<00:04:39.910> person<00:04:40.240> if<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.199> don't<00:04:41.380> put<00:04:41.740> a<00:04:41.770> stop<00:04:41.860> to

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
next person if you don't put a stop to

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.830 
next person if you don't put a stop to
it<00:04:42.250> yeah<00:04:42.610> it's<00:04:43.000> it's<00:04:43.210> really<00:04:43.419> up<00:04:43.630> for

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
it yeah it's it's really up for

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.360 
it yeah it's it's really up for
interpretation<00:04:44.349> which<00:04:44.650> is<00:04:44.680> why<00:04:44.919> I<00:04:44.949> think<00:04:45.130> it's

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
interpretation which is why I think it's

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.850 
interpretation which is why I think it's
so<00:04:45.490> clever<00:04:45.819> and<00:04:46.240> it's<00:04:47.050> just<00:04:47.199> a<00:04:47.319> smart<00:04:47.680> way<00:04:47.830> to

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
so clever and it's just a smart way to

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.730 
so clever and it's just a smart way to
get<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.400> message<00:04:48.639> across<00:04:48.880> I<00:04:49.419> love<00:04:50.410> what<00:04:50.620> they

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
get a message across I love what they

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.070 
get a message across I love what they
did<00:04:50.800> and<00:04:51.310> I<00:04:51.460> think<00:04:51.699> it's<00:04:52.030> one<00:04:52.300> thing<00:04:52.569> to<00:04:52.630> talk

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
did and I think it's one thing to talk

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.680 
did and I think it's one thing to talk
about<00:04:53.410> the<00:04:53.979> 46<00:04:54.550> women<00:04:54.819> who<00:04:54.910> have<00:04:55.030> come<00:04:55.240> forward

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
about the 46 women who have come forward

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.659 
about the 46 women who have come forward
it's<00:04:55.810> another<00:04:56.080> thing<00:04:56.349> to<00:04:56.410> visualize<00:04:57.250> some<00:04:57.550> of

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
it's another thing to visualize some of

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.820 
it's another thing to visualize some of
them<00:04:57.789> remember<00:04:58.150> this<00:04:58.240> is<00:04:58.360> only<00:04:58.389> 35<00:04:58.990> of<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.259> 46

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
them remember this is only 35 of the 46

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.990 
them remember this is only 35 of the 46
women<00:05:00.099> who<00:05:00.160> have<00:05:00.250> come<00:05:00.460> forward<00:05:00.729> with<00:05:00.849> their

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
women who have come forward with their

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.469 
women who have come forward with their
stories<00:05:01.919> visualizing<00:05:02.919> it<00:05:03.039> it<00:05:03.669> hopefully

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
stories visualizing it it hopefully

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.330 
stories visualizing it it hopefully
changes<00:05:05.229> some<00:05:05.410> people's<00:05:05.710> minds<00:05:06.099> because

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
changes some people's minds because

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.700 
changes some people's minds because

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
people feel this need to defend him

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.469 
people feel this need to defend him
because<00:05:08.919> of<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.370> image<00:05:09.789> that<00:05:09.820> he<00:05:10.060> had<00:05:10.240> for

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
because of the image that he had for
