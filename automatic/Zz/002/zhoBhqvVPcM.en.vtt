00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:14.230
 to win 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.230
 to me 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.930
 what's up kids here the general me 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.090
 I bring a trick for whites 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.300
 two for the transit mode since this 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.800
 trick to multiply the shields and what 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.420
 first thing we need to do is place 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.790
 the turbine catch a shield 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.350
 we leave the shield where we want it 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.059
 let's leave it on the ground worth that is 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.250
 the position where the shield will stay 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.309
 because where we want it to be now 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.400
 we take the turbine we make the change with 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.820
 The shield 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.170
 we make the change again and 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.579
 now we ask our partner to 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.859
 leave the shield on the ground 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.109
 at the moment of the axis the companion 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.149
 we only make the change and you see that 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.890
 the turbine disappears and I take the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.839
 shield without me other cubes 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.960
 disappear because in theory if you 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.040
 we do wrong the game would disappear 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.520
 then you see that I put the two 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.640
 shields and I have two I have one and the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.350
 another two then now let's see how 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.159
 our partner who has left me the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.299
 shield goes to the table and takes another 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.429
 shield if everything goes well that once 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.920
 the turbine disappears already means that 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:32.459
 it goes well but we see that we already have three 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.600
 shields mine the one that I caught him and 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:38.280
 the one who just caught him then now 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.679
 at this point it would be ideal as I 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.649
 I would have my shield on and my other 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.850
 shield that I can take you see that I do not 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.850
 I can carry more shields 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.659
 but now he's going to do 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.150
 the move is going to make my partner to 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.120
 get another shield you see more than the 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.000
 chang'e iii and another is the exchange but 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.159
 it's not going to work, you 're going to see that it's not going to 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.740
 work I will not be able to come to catch 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.570
 no shield yet because it turns out that 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.000
 you do not have to make the exchange with the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.530
 first shield caught it turns out that it has 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.390
 to make the change with the shield that I 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.730
 he had caught him or that is when 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.110
 you have to make the change 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.230
 you see how much to do change here with 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.540
 my shield does not come out first because 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.010
 it turns out that it does not work then here 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.709
 with me tell him me then guys are we going to 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.780
 try with the other to see with another shield 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.310
 to see if it is that because we are 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.870
 here trying because there are so many 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.350
 combinations to do with this trick 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.800
 12 66 there makes change the turbine and 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.510
 disappears then at this moment it is 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.910
 when the trick you do not know that I 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.070
 I approach the table and I can take another 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.660
 shield 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.760
 then we have managed to make four 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.560
 shields between two people as 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.410
 they imagined the madness of four 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.990
 people do the shields would be eight 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.210
 people more than we are two people and 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.680
 four shields and so you see that no 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.260
 they are female now the third one comes 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.880
 person and he carries his shield also that 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.110
 would be five shields for three people 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.110
 that is crazy 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.800
 what to say about the trick this look now 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.290
 you are going to see that I take this shield that 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.170
 I'm here in front of me and I saw what happens 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.390
 now you are going to see the eyes and disappear 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.709
 I had in front 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:26.750
 to see this is a mess because here 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:29.430
 we already arrived at a contradiction because 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.620
 we did not know well then that I shielded that 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.780
 catch that why I say that the trick yes ideal 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.910
 that he was only a person then 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.480
 that would be the first step that would be that 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.610
 I put the shield and to take the one of my 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.590
 partner I have my shield placed and 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.959
 I can and I carry another one where I can 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.310
 place where I want then we know 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.989
 that shield we can see it 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.510
 let move and I will do what I want 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.490
 with him always being on the other side but 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.500
 at the moment when we all double 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.180
 we are making the game have a 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.960
 I do not know if you understand me is a fault 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.430
 then to see so much shield 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.710
 usually yes that when taking one 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.670
 another one will disappear that if we know 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.650
 which one to catch would not happen he would not 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.500
 it would disappear but of course it is very difficult 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.000
 and the more it doubles in the 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.920
 moment when there are eight shields per 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.350
 example I already know that it would be a mess 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.810
 exaggerated why I recommend that you 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.940
 duplicate nothing but you and you 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.740
 deal with this shield because I already say 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.170
 that the more I doubled the more the 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.060
 game and I have not got to apply 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.680
 eight shields but better rejoinders eight 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.140
 shields even the game is already respected 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.640
 be that there is too much I do not know 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.380
 so nothing I leave to you 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.540
 choice because combinations there 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.430
 very many because of four shields I 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.900
 I caught one and disappeared another could 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.240
 have caught another I do not know what 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.759
 past 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.880
 but that already I say innovar you a 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.199
 I'll leave it to your choice well 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.150
 that nothing I hope you liked this 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.680
 trick to give life favorites
