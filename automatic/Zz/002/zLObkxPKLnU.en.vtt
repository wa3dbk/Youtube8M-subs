hello I am Lee Ann spar in this section
we<00:00:09.809> will<00:00:09.929> discuss<00:00:10.040> addition<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.190> subtraction

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
we will discuss addition and subtraction

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.310 
we will discuss addition and subtraction
of<00:00:12.059> decimals<00:00:14.089> specifically<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.690> will<00:00:15.870> address

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
of decimals specifically we will address

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.609 
of decimals specifically we will address
the<00:00:16.770> following<00:00:16.910> objectives<00:00:18.350> we<00:00:19.350> will<00:00:19.470> add

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
the following objectives we will add

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.509 
the following objectives we will add
decimals<00:00:20.810> estimate<00:00:21.810> answers<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.529> subtract

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519

decimals<00:00:24.500> now<00:00:25.500> let's<00:00:25.769> look<00:00:25.949> at<00:00:26.189> addition<00:00:26.880> of

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
decimals now let's look at addition of

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.339 
decimals now let's look at addition of
decimals<00:00:28.760> we<00:00:29.760> will<00:00:29.939> add<00:00:30.179> these<00:00:30.779> decimal

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
decimals we will add these decimal

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.950 
decimals we will add these decimal
numbers<00:00:31.710> by<00:00:32.040> arranging<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.730> numbers<00:00:33.090> keeping

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
numbers by arranging the numbers keeping

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.590 
numbers by arranging the numbers keeping
the<00:00:34.110> decimal<00:00:34.620> points<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.370> column<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.030> we

now let's look at front and rounding to

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.830 
now let's look at front and rounding to
estimate<00:01:53.090> answers<00:01:54.880> we<00:01:55.880> will<00:01:56.030> take<00:01:56.270> each<00:01:56.479> of

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
estimate answers we will take each of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.649 
estimate answers we will take each of
these<00:01:57.080> decimal<00:01:57.649> numbers<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.369> we<00:01:59.240> will<00:01:59.390> change

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
these decimal numbers and we will change

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.050 
these decimal numbers and we will change
all<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.140> digits<00:02:00.500> but<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:00.770> first<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.700> zero

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
all the digits but the first to a zero

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.499 
all the digits but the first to a zero
in<00:02:02.509> order<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.110> estimate<00:02:03.530> an<00:02:04.009> answer<00:02:07.149> 1889<00:02:08.149> and

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
in order to estimate an answer 1889 and

in order to estimate an answer 1889 and
76<00:02:09.170> one<00:02:09.349> hundredths<00:02:10.090> becomes<00:02:17.349> 2021<00:02:18.349> and<00:02:18.800> 40<00:02:19.370> to

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:35.050 
100 becomes 2019 and 35 one hundredths
becomes<00:02:28.340> 20<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:30.099> 8<00:02:31.099> and<00:02:31.370> 1/10<00:02:31.940> becomes<00:02:32.720> 8<00:02:34.060> we

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
becomes 20 and 8 and 1/10 becomes 8 we

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.160 
becomes 20 and 8 and 1/10 becomes 8 we
add<00:02:35.300> these<00:02:35.780> digits<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.650> we<00:02:37.370> get<00:02:40.090> 2048<00:02:41.090> as<00:02:41.540> an

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
add these digits and we get 2048 as an

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:49.720 
add these digits and we get 2048 as an
estimate<00:02:45.760> however<00:02:47.080> had<00:02:48.080> we<00:02:48.349> have<00:02:48.590> added<00:02:49.220> the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
estimate however had we have added the

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.530 
estimate however had we have added the
decimal<00:02:50.209> numbers<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:51.230> exact<00:02:51.560> answer<00:02:51.830> is<00:02:55.540> 1938

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
decimal numbers the exact answer is 1938

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.890 
decimal numbers the exact answer is 1938
and<00:02:57.790> 63<00:02:59.140> hundredths<00:03:01.180> now<00:03:02.180> let's<00:03:02.510> look<00:03:02.720> at

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
and 63 hundredths now let's look at

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.970 
and 63 hundredths now let's look at
subtracting<00:03:03.830> decimals<00:03:05.500> in<00:03:06.500> order<00:03:06.830> to

subtracting decimals in order to
subtract<00:03:07.489> decimals<00:03:07.970> we<00:03:08.960> arrange<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.650> numbers

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
subtract decimals we arrange the numbers

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.340 
subtract decimals we arrange the numbers
keeping<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:10.940> decimal<00:03:11.360> points<00:03:11.690> in<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.870> column

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
keeping the decimal points in a column

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.290 
keeping the decimal points in a column
and<00:03:12.530> we<00:03:12.680> use<00:03:12.890> zeros<00:03:13.430> as<00:03:13.700> place

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
and we use zeros as place

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.270 
and we use zeros as place
holder's<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:14.990> we<00:03:15.860> subtract<00:03:16.460> as<00:03:16.900> normal

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
holder's and we subtract as normal

holder's and we subtract as normal
we<00:03:19.280> cannot<00:03:19.580> subtract<00:03:20.090> two<00:03:20.330> from<00:03:20.540> zero<00:03:21.020> we

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
we cannot subtract two from zero we

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.770 
we cannot subtract two from zero we
cannot<00:03:21.980> subtract<00:03:22.520> eight<00:03:22.730> from<00:03:22.760> zero<00:03:23.360> so<00:03:23.660> we

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
cannot subtract eight from zero so we

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.590 
cannot subtract eight from zero so we

one making that a nine making that a 10

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.740 
one making that a nine making that a 10
so<00:03:33.440> 10<00:03:33.580> subtract<00:03:34.580> 2<00:03:34.970> is<00:03:35.330> 8<00:03:35.980> 9<00:03:36.980> subtract<00:03:37.820> 8<00:03:38.060> is<00:03:38.390> 1

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
so 10 subtract 2 is 8 9 subtract 8 is 1

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.960 
so 10 subtract 2 is 8 9 subtract 8 is 1
7<00:03:39.500> subtract<00:03:39.920> 5<00:03:40.220> is<00:03:40.550> 2<00:03:40.940> 7<00:03:41.930> subtract<00:03:42.470> 3<00:03:42.830> is<00:03:43.040> 4<00:03:43.550> and

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
7 subtract 5 is 2 7 subtract 3 is 4 and

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.140 
7 subtract 5 is 2 7 subtract 3 is 4 and
2<00:03:44.000> subtract<00:03:44.840> 1<00:03:45.140> is<00:03:45.440> 1<00:03:45.890> and<00:03:46.190> we<00:03:46.910> have<00:03:47.320> 14<00:03:48.320> and<00:03:49.150> 218

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
2 subtract 1 is 1 and we have 14 and 218

turkeys were raised than cranberries
how<00:04:16.549> many<00:04:16.760> more<00:04:17.030> indicates<00:04:17.660> that<00:04:17.870> we<00:04:18.049> should

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
how many more indicates that we should

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.810 
how many more indicates that we should
subtract<00:04:19.359> so<00:04:20.359> we<00:04:20.570> have<00:04:20.989> six<00:04:21.770> point<00:04:22.580> nine
