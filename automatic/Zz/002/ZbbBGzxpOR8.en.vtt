00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.799
 hello friends of Nestor today in our 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.139
 table we have the motor or the motorcycle g 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:19.279
 second generation one of the terminals 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.170
 more expected since last year its 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.090
 previous version conquered many 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.269
 people thanks to your relationship 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.550
 quality-price and today we have the second 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.609
 edition of this terminal and we will see if 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.920
 are enough reasons or if you give us 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:37.640
 enough reasons to renew from 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:42.440
 device the exact model is x 10 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:45.049
 63 8 gb in white say that this 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.420
 mobile is not compatible with 4g networks 

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:50.750
 if some people were waiting 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.940
 that functionality so we open the 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.199
 box and we find the terminal 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.180
 white color weighs 139 grams is a 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.330
 little lighter than the version of the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.610
 last year inside the box nothing more 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.710
 we found the charger I think 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.640
 a normal decision on the part of 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.130
 motorola, they imagine that their 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.860
 costs when you give them and put the others 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.899
 accessories like hearing aids and so on 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.060
 that just put us the charger 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.159
 which is in one piece but still 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.100
 being of good quality and the cable is 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.289
 pretty long let's see what else we 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.070
 we found in here only some 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.060
 manuals we have one in Spanish and two 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.729
 more in English 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.950
 these are initiation guides where you 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.679
 give some tips on how you can 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.470
 use your phone and they are sometimes 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.299
 very useful but good now 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.670
 let's focus on the device that has 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.689
 had its certain improvements in the 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.810
 hardware let's start with the back 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.080
 we will see 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.810
 printed motorola logo on 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.970
 terminal is still plastic that's not 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.729
 has changed but always with that 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.729
 soft feeling so that the grip 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.490
 with the hand is very comfortable part 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.709
 Superior headset sensors LED 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.500
 notifications and secondary cameras 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.780
 lower part we have a speaker in the 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.790
 Right side and power button 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.819
 raise and lower volume in the part 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.849
 lower the microusb connector 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.490
 and on the left side we do not have any 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:28.160
 just button 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.980
 the camera goes up to 8 megapixels 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.260
 with a focal aperture of 2.0 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.140
 let's try how it behaves more 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.060
 go ahead and now let's know the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.190
 inside I remind you that the battery does not 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.690
 It is removable and maintains the same 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.320
 capacity than the previous model 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.480
 we talk about 2,070 milliamps then 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.150
 I suspect that the battery will last us less 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.580
 there is a version of this terminal that 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.620
 supports double sim but it will only be 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.340
 marketed in some countries of 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.770
 europe and as a novelty this terminal 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.390
 now it has support for cards 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:09.020
 microsd so let's turn it on the 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.570
 terminal grows the screen until 5 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.880
 inches if we compare it in relation to 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.000
 last year's terminal last year 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.270
 I had 45 inches this 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.220
 increase 0.5 the two lines that you see from 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.680
 metal in the part of the headset and in the 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.160
 part of the bottom are two speakers 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.300
 similar or very similar to the one htc 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.030
 8 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.460
 I mentioned them from the screen even though 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.900
 increased maintains the same resolution 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:42.320
 of 1280 x 720 but by keeping the same 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.050
 resolution and be bigger that provokes 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:49.640
 that the pixel density is lower 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:52.690
 so he stays at 294 and nothing else 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.130
 still the colors look pretty good 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.440
 honestly it looks very good here nothing 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.870
 more we have a screen is the one that comes 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.580
 pre-configured buttons are followed 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.640
 keeping inside the screen and 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.970
 we can see that this takes away space 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.190
 Useful 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.060
 let's open the menu as you can see the 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.670
 Android is a factory stock we are going to 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.760
 see what version it has installed 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.030
 and it is the latest version 4.4 points 4 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.820
 Kitkat the phone has a processor 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.820
 qualcomm snapdragon 400 1.2 gigahertz 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.430
 and also a gig of ram 5 gigas 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.290
 available to the user we are going to 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.050
 open the camera to see how it is 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.330
 behaves and well guys sincerely 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.490
 motorola like that has made a great 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.230
 improvement in this section I think the 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.360
 camera you will love when you try 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.520
 this terminal with a gesture we access 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.000
 the gallery to see we want to use the 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.790
 gallery always low accept we give 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.880
 zoom and then the level of detail is very 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.610
 well it 's very good that it seems to me that 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.979
 be if it has been has been a detail 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.970
 pretty good the high school camera 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:05.760
 goes up to 2 megapixels and then 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.979
 also the image no no no 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.690
 Detail as long as there is good 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:13.710
 lighting is fine with this gesture 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:16.169
 we access quick functions and so that 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.289
 tell them is a highly recommended terminal 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.430
 if you think about buying it in amazon 179 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.470
 Dollars 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.170
 to the respective taxes that 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.000
 Tap pay in your respective country if you 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:31.170
 shopping in one of our stores you 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.210
 It goes for $ 225 about is 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.220
 a terminal that I liked a lot in 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.410
 the time to have it in your hand and if 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.810
 they want some other comparison with another 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.300
 apparatus see how the games behave 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.740
 Do not hesitate to leave it in the comments 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.720
 good friends and I always invite you to

 write it I hope the video has them 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.330
 I'm like Jorge Romero until the 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.330
 next
