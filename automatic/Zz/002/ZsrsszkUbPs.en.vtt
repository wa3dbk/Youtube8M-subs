00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.030 
hey guys in this video I'm gonna show
you<00:00:10.620> how<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.040> outline<00:00:11.880> my<00:00:12.240> drawings<00:00:12.840> as<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.889> can

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
you how I outline my drawings as you can

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.919 
you how I outline my drawings as you can
see<00:00:14.340> I'm<00:00:14.610> starting<00:00:15.210> out<00:00:15.450> with<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.660> pencil

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
see I'm starting out with a pencil

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.700 
see I'm starting out with a pencil
sketch<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.190> pretty<00:00:17.640> much<00:00:17.850> completed<00:00:18.710> so

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
sketch that is pretty much completed so

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.679 
sketch that is pretty much completed so
for<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> pins<00:00:20.699> I'm<00:00:20.880> using<00:00:21.119> I'm<00:00:21.510> using

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
for the pins I'm using I'm using

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.970 
for the pins I'm using I'm using
prismacolor<00:00:22.140> fine<00:00:22.980> line<00:00:23.369> markers<00:00:24.800> there's<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
prismacolor fine line markers there's a

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.250 
prismacolor fine line markers there's a
zero<00:00:26.490> zero<00:00:26.550> five<00:00:27.000> at<00:00:27.330> zero<00:00:27.570> one<00:00:27.779> zero<00:00:27.810> three

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
zero zero five at zero one zero three

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.589 
zero zero five at zero one zero three
zero<00:00:28.529> five<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.460> zero<00:00:29.699> eight<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.359> set

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
zero five and a zero eight and the set

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.040 
zero five and a zero eight and the set
you<00:00:31.529> use<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.980> zero<00:00:32.279> five<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:33.120> outline<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
you use the zero five to outline the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.010 
you use the zero five to outline the
head<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.820> so<00:00:35.820> basically<00:00:36.480> what<00:00:36.750> I'm<00:00:36.870> going<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
head and so basically what I'm going to

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.119 
head and so basically what I'm going to
do<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.290> I'm<00:00:37.350> going<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.500> use<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> thicker

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
do is I'm going to use the thicker

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.619 
do is I'm going to use the thicker
tipped<00:00:38.870> marker<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.500> outline<00:00:40.980> major<00:00:41.940> elements

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
tipped marker to outline major elements

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.170 
tipped marker to outline major elements
of<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> drawing<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.379> then<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:44.460> interior

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
of the drawing and then for interior

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.660 
of the drawing and then for interior
detail<00:00:46.079> work<00:00:46.410> I'm<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.010> use<00:00:47.190> like<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
detail work I'm going to use like the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.600 
detail work I'm going to use like the
zero<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.239> or<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> zero<00:00:48.899> five<00:00:49.430> that's<00:00:50.430> what

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
zero one or the zero five that's what

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.180 
zero one or the zero five that's what
I'm<00:00:50.700> using<00:00:50.910> right<00:00:51.090> now<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.140> zero<00:00:52.620> zero<00:00:52.890> five

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
I'm using right now is a zero zero five

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.939 
I'm using right now is a zero zero five
to<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.940> details<00:00:54.270> interface<00:00:54.890> this<00:00:55.890> is

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
to do the details interface this is

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.599 
to do the details interface this is
really<00:00:56.579> fine<00:00:56.789> tip<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.710> it's<00:00:58.710> what<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.340> want

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
really fine tip and it's what you want

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.389 
really fine tip and it's what you want
is<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.940> want<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.449> get<00:01:00.570> line<00:01:01.170> contrast<00:01:02.160> you

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
is you want to get line contrast you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.490 
is you want to get line contrast you
don't<00:01:02.609> want<00:01:02.879> all<00:01:03.149> your<00:01:03.510> lines<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:04.019> be<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> same

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
don't want all your lines to be the same

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.890 
don't want all your lines to be the same
thickness<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.339> using<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.150> set<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.630> this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
thickness so using a set like this

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.050 
thickness so using a set like this
really<00:01:07.229> helps<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.770> add<00:01:08.040> interest<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:09.030> your

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
really helps to add interest to your

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.260 
really helps to add interest to your
drawing<00:01:09.890> so<00:01:10.890> all<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> outlining<00:01:11.640> I'm<00:01:11.970> doing

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
drawing so all the outlining I'm doing

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.429 
drawing so all the outlining I'm doing
right<00:01:12.570> now<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.860> zero<00:01:14.340> five<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:16.110> you

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
right now is with the zero five so you

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.649 
right now is with the zero five so you
can<00:01:16.619> see<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.189> major<00:01:17.670> elements<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
can see it's all major elements of the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.270 
can see it's all major elements of the
suit<00:01:18.869> she's<00:01:19.140> wearing<00:01:19.409> there's<00:01:19.560> no<00:01:19.710> inside

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
suit she's wearing there's no inside

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.820 
suit she's wearing there's no inside
work<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:21.030> I'm<00:01:21.119> doing<00:01:21.150> with<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
work that I'm doing with this just the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.600 
work that I'm doing with this just the
outlines<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:24.950> as<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.250> can<00:01:26.340> see<00:01:26.490> I'm

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
outlines and then as you can see I'm

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.359 
outlines and then as you can see I'm
kind<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.909> adding<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.600> black<00:01:28.259> those<00:01:29.040> are<00:01:29.189> kind

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
kind of adding like black those are kind

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.330 
kind of adding like black those are kind
of<00:01:29.400> pipes<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.880> are<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.600> background

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
of pipes that are in the background

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.330 
of pipes that are in the background
that's<00:01:32.340> another<00:01:32.670> thing<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.630> these<00:01:34.619> those

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that's another thing I do is these those

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.749 
that's another thing I do is these those
black<00:01:35.720> thick<00:01:36.720> black<00:01:37.140> pipes<00:01:37.500> add<00:01:37.799> contrast<00:01:38.460> to

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
black thick black pipes add contrast to

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.330 
black thick black pipes add contrast to
most<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> really<00:01:40.140> thin<00:01:40.560> lines<00:01:41.040> that

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
most of the really thin lines that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.639 
most of the really thin lines that
you'll<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.689> detail<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.380> her

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
you'll see for the detail so for her

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.920 
you'll see for the detail so for her
body<00:01:47.009> inside<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.030> suit<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:48.659> see<00:01:48.810> I'm

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
body inside the suit you can see I'm

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.630 
body inside the suit you can see I'm
using<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:50.100> much<00:01:51.030> finer<00:01:51.450> tip<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.649> that's<00:01:53.280> what

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
using the much finer tip and that's what

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.760 
using the much finer tip and that's what
I'm<00:01:53.729> doing<00:01:53.970> all<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.450> really<00:01:54.840> small<00:01:55.200> details

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
I'm doing all the really small details

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.520 
I'm doing all the really small details
like<00:01:56.070> her<00:01:56.189> hands<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.180> things<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.689> with

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
like her hands and things like that with

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.890 
like her hands and things like that with
but<00:01:59.520> when<00:01:59.820> you're<00:01:59.970> outlining<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.659> really

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
but when you're outlining it's really

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.080 
but when you're outlining it's really
important<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.590> pay<00:02:02.100> attention<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.670> what<00:02:02.940> it<00:02:03.060> is

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
important to pay attention to what it is

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.760 
important to pay attention to what it is
you're<00:02:03.450> outlining<00:02:04.310> big<00:02:05.720> solid<00:02:06.720> objects<00:02:07.470> if

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
you're outlining big solid objects if

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.130 
you're outlining big solid objects if
it's<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.340> big<00:02:08.580> piece<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.690> suit<00:02:09.929> or

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
it's a big piece of the suit or

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.270 
it's a big piece of the suit or
something<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.590> or<00:02:10.830> whatever<00:02:10.950> you're

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
something like that or whatever you're

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.300 
something like that or whatever you're
drawing<00:02:11.490> or<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.150> edge<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.870> tree<00:02:13.310> that's

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
drawing or the edge of the tree that's

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.160 
drawing or the edge of the tree that's
when<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.580> use<00:02:14.760> my<00:02:14.790> really<00:02:15.330> thick<00:02:15.600> lines<00:02:15.870> and

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
when I use my really thick lines and

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.350 
when I use my really thick lines and
then<00:02:16.770> let's<00:02:17.280> say<00:02:17.430> if<00:02:17.700> you're<00:02:17.819> drawing<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.150> tree

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
then let's say if you're drawing a tree

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.570 
then let's say if you're drawing a tree
and<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.690> do<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.900> inside<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.800> bark<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.370> stuff

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
and you do the inside the bark and stuff

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.500 
and you do the inside the bark and stuff
I<00:02:20.760> would<00:02:21.000> use<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> really<00:02:21.510> fine<00:02:21.840> tip<00:02:22.260> pen<00:02:23.510> so

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
I would use a really fine tip pen so

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.050 
I would use a really fine tip pen so
when<00:02:24.959> I'm<00:02:25.050> drawing<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.500> robot<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
when I'm drawing this robot like the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.880 
when I'm drawing this robot like the
piece<00:02:27.300> I'm<00:02:27.480> drawing<00:02:27.750> right<00:02:27.810> here<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.530> detail

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
piece I'm drawing right here the detail

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.440 
piece I'm drawing right here the detail
work<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.190> numbers<00:02:29.610> all<00:02:29.970> those<00:02:30.209> little

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
work the numbers all those little

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.720 
work the numbers all those little
intricate<00:02:30.959> things<00:02:31.170> I'm<00:02:31.410> using<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.860> fine<00:02:32.370> tip

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
intricate things I'm using that fine tip

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.340 
intricate things I'm using that fine tip
and<00:02:32.910> I'm<00:02:33.360> not<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.540> don't<00:02:33.690> want<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.019> get<00:02:34.140> too

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
and I'm not I don't want to get too

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.009 
and I'm not I don't want to get too
heavy-handed<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:35.190> want<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.550> have<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.300> like<00:02:36.900> I

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
heavy-handed I want to have that like I

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.890 
heavy-handed I want to have that like I
said<00:02:37.230> before<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.620> want<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.630> contrast<00:02:39.630> between

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
said before I want that contrast between

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.699 
said before I want that contrast between
those<00:02:40.290> thick<00:02:40.769> lines<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.459> those<00:02:41.850> thin<00:02:42.209> lines

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
those thick lines and those thin lines

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.860 
those thick lines and those thin lines
now<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:44.100> didn't<00:02:44.700> do<00:02:44.819> it<00:02:44.970> for<00:02:45.000> this<00:02:45.330> drawing<00:02:45.540> but

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
now I didn't do it for this drawing but

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.440 
now I didn't do it for this drawing but
you<00:02:45.959> can<00:02:46.140> do<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.319> lot<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.650> like<00:02:46.950> line<00:02:47.760> work<00:02:48.030> cross

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
you can do a lot of like line work cross

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.240 
you can do a lot of like line work cross
hatching<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.200> stuff<00:02:49.410> like<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:49.769> even

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
hatching and stuff like that that even

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.660 
hatching and stuff like that that even
adds<00:02:50.430> more<00:02:50.819> contrast<00:02:51.769> some<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.040> like

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
adds more contrast some of the like

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.790 
adds more contrast some of the like
vents<00:02:54.180> for<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.690> ears<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.290> stuff<00:02:55.470> like<00:02:55.590> that

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
vents for the ears and stuff like that

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.300 
vents for the ears and stuff like that
that's<00:02:56.630> repetition<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.870> that's<00:02:58.500> some<00:02:58.980> nicer

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
that's repetition and that's some nicer

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.350 
that's repetition and that's some nicer
elements<00:02:59.819> of<00:02:59.940> art<00:03:00.090> as<00:03:00.239> well<00:03:01.970> now<00:03:02.970> what<00:03:03.209> you're

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
elements of art as well now what you're

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.140 
elements of art as well now what you're
watching<00:03:03.480> me<00:03:03.750> do<00:03:03.870> here<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:05.070> kind<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.850> started

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
watching me do here is I kind of started

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.539 
watching me do here is I kind of started
out<00:03:06.269> with<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.540> zero<00:03:06.900> five<00:03:07.260> tip<00:03:07.829> and<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.280> felt

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
out with that zero five tip and I felt

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.009 
out with that zero five tip and I felt
like<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.820> wasn't<00:03:09.090> giving<00:03:09.540> me<00:03:09.660> quite<00:03:09.810> the

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
like it wasn't giving me quite the

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.500 
like it wasn't giving me quite the
contrast<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:10.650> wanted<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.459> so<00:03:11.670> I<00:03:11.700> decided<00:03:12.390> to

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
contrast I wanted and so I decided to

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.470 
contrast I wanted and so I decided to
add<00:03:12.720> another<00:03:12.799> like<00:03:13.799> line<00:03:14.340> thickness<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.360> the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
add another like line thickness to the

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.890 
add another like line thickness to the
drawing<00:03:15.750> I'm<00:03:16.560> just<00:03:17.130> outlining<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:18.600> main

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
drawing I'm just outlining the main

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.860 
drawing I'm just outlining the main
drawing<00:03:19.410> with<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.680> really<00:03:20.130> thick<00:03:20.840> marker

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.349 
Annetta is a faber castell black marker
and<00:03:27.900> it's<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.980> tip<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.400> flimsy<00:03:29.700> it's<00:03:30.030> not<00:03:30.209> like

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
and it's the tip is flimsy it's not like

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.390 
and it's the tip is flimsy it's not like
a<00:03:30.390> hard<00:03:30.720> tip<00:03:30.959> like<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.260> other<00:03:31.410> ones<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:31.980> feels

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
a hard tip like the other ones it feels

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.979 
a hard tip like the other ones it feels
a<00:03:32.609> little<00:03:32.790> bit<00:03:32.970> more<00:03:33.030> like<00:03:33.329> a<00:03:33.359> brush<00:03:33.720> when

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
drawing you can really see the contrast

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.030 
drawing you can really see the contrast
now<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:41.820> mean<00:03:42.180> I<00:03:42.420> feel<00:03:42.870> like<00:03:42.930> for<00:03:43.019> my<00:03:43.350> style<00:03:43.739> and

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
like that really thick outline it really

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.259 
like that really thick outline it really
makes<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:59.040> feel<00:03:59.310> like<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.549> drawing<00:03:59.790> pop<00:04:00.090> off

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
makes I feel like the drawing pop off

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.199 
makes I feel like the drawing pop off
the<00:04:00.420> page<00:04:00.799> and<00:04:01.799> it<00:04:01.980> makes<00:04:02.310> that<00:04:02.459> detail<00:04:02.910> work

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
the page and it makes that detail work

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.530 
the page and it makes that detail work
stand<00:04:03.540> out<00:04:03.750> -<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.049> believe<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:06.030> feel<00:04:06.510> like
