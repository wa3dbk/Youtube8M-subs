00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 hello, Miguel Ángel Rocha speaks to you already 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.650
 I'm going to show you how to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.230
 we can enable the quit button in 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.150
 our device on 9 the cool guy 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.309
 is one of the characteristics of some 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.990
 devices because it allows to open 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.929
 an application with just pressing 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.119
 a key in this case will not be with a 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.180
 key but with an icon in the bar 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.119
 not be reached to see but in 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.099
 the upper left corner looks a 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.830
 icon us with just pressing the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.420
 will open an application for example already 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.800
 you have enabled the music player 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.780
 I'm going to press him 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.160
 and as you can see he sent me to 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.930
 music player you are going to 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.149
 to be able to choose the application that you 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.190
 want to be able to install this quit 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.019
 button we're just going to need a 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.059
 requirement that is to have a custom 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.550
 installed recovery this is 100% 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.739
 necessary for two reasons the first 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.320
 because by means of custom recovery 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.989
 we are going to install the quit button and the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.670
 second for us to make a copy of 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.129
 security of our system is to say a 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.659
 backup of the whole system this in case 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.879
 we do not like the quick button 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.600
 we can restore it to the original without 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:12.110
 any problem and ready double tested / 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.229
 768 778 and p 760 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.030
 I do not know if it works in the 769 variant 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.340
 so I recommend you do your 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.050
 backup for anything from 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.000
 same way I just show you how 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.160
 do it and you decide if you do it or 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.679
 not once said all that we started 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.570
 as you can see here my status bar 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:32.450
 no longer has the cut button this so that 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.220
 see how it is installed the first thing they go 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.110
 to do is download the following 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.030
 file as always me down here in the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.520
 description of the video I will leave the inter 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.500
 Download the following file called 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.149
 quick button by rocha once what 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.329
 have downloaded and moved to their 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.500
 device will proceed to turn it off and 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.500
 enter into recovery mode 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.270
 once inside the custom recovery we go 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.180
 to go to install yes depending where 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.030
 have moved your file that they downloaded 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.550
 they will select if they moved it to the 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.709
 internal memory select susi from sd 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.400
 card and if it went to external memory 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.740
 select giusti from external sd in my 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.390
 case went to the external you 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.910
 they select the route where they have 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.430
 moved and they will proceed to locate the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.740
 file called quick button by rocha 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.650
 once they have located it they will 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.620
 select you will give in yes install 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.670
 and we wait for it to be installed once 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.570
 has been installed only dan go back and 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.570
 redwood system nou 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.920
 that would be all once I started the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:46.349
 device we will have the quit button 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.349
 enabled on our device on 9 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.230
 let's wait for it to start so that 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.230
 let's see 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.390
 here already started the device we are going to 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.630
 wait for the system to load a bit 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.280
 I will proceed to unlock it and how 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.830
 we can see already in the upper corner 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.600
 The quit is already enabled 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.060
 I will quickly teach you 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.580
 how to configure the button the only thing that 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.010
 have to do is go to settings 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:35.420
 and it will disappear in this menu and the option 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:39.349
 of the quick key you select it 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.360
 they put in shortcuts and here they appear the 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.010
 select applications are going to be able to 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.349
 select any application either 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.480
 of the system or that have been installed by 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.280
 example here I do not have many 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.660
 installed applications but I can 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.330
 select what is being the 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.030
 gallery without any problem I proceed to 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.730
 get out 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.670
 and just select the icon 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.230
 there he is calling the gallery and for 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.750
 last if you do not like the quit 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.340
 button to return to the original what 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.769
 only thing they have to do is restore 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.959
 their backup they did as I said 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.760

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.440
 make a backup and how 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.359
 restore it do not worry me here 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.910
