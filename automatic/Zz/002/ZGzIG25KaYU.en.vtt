 all the heavyweights of very important composers there was an interpreter 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.339
 It is also very important if we think that he likes to thorny 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.800
 everything that has been shown in the text of the day said 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.259
 Mauricio Macri told us 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.970
 He is not waiting for the jury to come to the river 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.720

 transport that comes perera 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.600
 and I thought to ask periquillo to tasks to immediately start the 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.500
 at that time they are doing sound test 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.620
 If you treat me devoured, we initiate the vision and later on, 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.270

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.780
