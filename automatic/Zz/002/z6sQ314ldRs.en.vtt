00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
with the applicator that's fine if you

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.920 
with the applicator that's fine if you
do<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.980> way<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> spray

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
do it that way but I do with the spray

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.290 
do it that way but I do with the spray
is<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:56.039> spray<00:00:56.340> directly<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.059> should<00:00:57.270> be

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
is if I spray directly on you should be

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.250 
is if I spray directly on you should be
able<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.600> get<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.809> most<00:00:57.989> shine

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
able to get the most shine

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.229 
able to get the most shine
hypothetically<00:00:58.890> correct<00:00:59.160> because<00:00:59.850> here's

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
hypothetically correct because here's

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.459 
hypothetically correct because here's
the<00:01:00.390> fact<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.719> you're<00:01:00.809> gonna<00:01:00.899> spray<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.320> an

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the fact if you're gonna spray it on an

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.049 
the fact if you're gonna spray it on an
applicator<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.100> then<00:01:02.160> you're<00:01:02.789> going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> go

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
applicator and then you're going to go

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.280 
applicator and then you're going to go
ahead<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.359> put<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> tire<00:01:03.870> let's<00:01:04.080> say

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
ahead and put it on the tire let's say

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.960 
ahead and put it on the tire let's say
like<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.710> you're<00:01:05.369> going<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.610> spreading

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
like this you're going to be spreading

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.130 
like this you're going to be spreading
it<00:01:06.060> out<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.330> might<00:01:06.479> not<00:01:06.659> actually<00:01:06.840> get

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
it out it might not actually get

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.289 
it out it might not actually get
actually<00:01:07.560> all<00:01:07.740> on<00:01:08.010> there<00:01:08.310> or<00:01:08.790> if<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.970> spray<00:01:09.270> it

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
actually all on there or if I spray it

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.240 
actually all on there or if I spray it
directly<00:01:09.479> onto<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.080> tire<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> get

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
directly onto the tire it's going to get

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.740 
directly onto the tire it's going to get
the<00:01:11.369> most<00:01:11.580> effect<00:01:11.909> bang<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.360> effect<00:01:12.570> so

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the most effect bang for the effect so

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.149 
the most effect bang for the effect so
that<00:01:12.900> way<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.200> know<00:01:13.320> exactly<00:01:13.409> how<00:01:14.040> much

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
that way we can know exactly how much

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.190 
that way we can know exactly how much
shine<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.479> when<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.659> actually<00:01:15.840> go<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.080> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
shine it is so when you actually go to a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.899 
shine it is so when you actually go to a
point<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.439> your<00:01:16.500> own<00:01:16.710> there's<00:01:17.460> nothing<00:01:17.820> wrong

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
point on your own there's nothing wrong

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.100

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.350 
tire shine alright so we're at the back
of<00:05:30.470> the<00:05:30.530> car<00:05:30.710> today<00:05:31.010> right<00:05:31.430> now<00:05:31.610> remember<00:05:32.270> this

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
of the car today right now remember this

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.640 
of the car today right now remember this
is<00:05:32.510> the<00:05:32.539> one<00:05:32.810> that<00:05:32.960> I<00:05:33.020> actually<00:05:33.260> use<00:05:33.530> the

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
is the one that I actually use the

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.100 
is the one that I actually use the
applicator<00:05:34.010> pad<00:05:34.250> on<00:05:34.570> if<00:05:35.570> you<00:05:35.690> just<00:05:35.870> see<00:05:36.020> this

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
applicator pad on if you just see this

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.680 
applicator pad on if you just see this
pretty<00:05:36.320> good<00:05:36.530> I<00:05:36.910> don't<00:05:37.910> know<00:05:38.060> if<00:05:38.150> it's<00:05:38.270> higher

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
pretty good I don't know if it's higher

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.390 
pretty good I don't know if it's higher
maybe<00:05:39.139> the<00:05:39.380> applicator<00:05:39.800> is<00:05:39.889> not<00:05:40.010> putting<00:05:40.280> on

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
maybe the applicator is not putting on

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.890 
maybe the applicator is not putting on
right<00:05:40.580> but<00:05:40.760> I<00:05:40.820> see<00:05:40.970> a<00:05:41.000> lot<00:05:41.060> of<00:05:41.240> little<00:05:41.539> misty

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
right but I see a lot of little misty

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.000 
right but I see a lot of little misty
areas<00:05:42.199> right<00:05:42.320> through<00:05:42.530> here<00:05:42.650> and<00:05:42.710> that's

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
areas right through here and that's

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.520 
areas right through here and that's
probably<00:05:43.699> the<00:05:44.030> fault<00:05:44.270> of<00:05:44.330> the<00:05:44.419> applicator<00:05:44.810> so

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
probably the fault of the applicator so

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.810 
probably the fault of the applicator so
I'm<00:05:45.710> not<00:05:45.860> going<00:05:46.010> to<00:05:46.099> really<00:05:46.280> knock<00:05:46.550> it<00:05:46.699> too

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
I'm not going to really knock it too

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.149 
I'm not going to really knock it too
much<00:05:46.970> okay<00:05:47.300> just<00:05:47.960> got<00:05:48.080> to<00:05:48.199> look<00:05:48.349> over<00:05:48.470> that<00:05:48.770> and

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
much okay just got to look over that and

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:51.310 
much okay just got to look over that and
I'll<00:05:49.310> just<00:05:49.490> spray<00:05:49.760> it<00:05:49.820> on<00:05:49.940> the<00:05:50.090> edge<00:05:50.270> so<00:05:51.110> let<00:05:51.260> me

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
I'll just spray it on the edge so let me

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.480 
I'll just spray it on the edge so let me
stand<00:05:51.530> back<00:05:51.710> so<00:05:51.889> you<00:05:51.949> can<00:05:52.039> actually<00:05:52.159> see<00:05:52.460> but

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
stand back so you can actually see but

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.640 
stand back so you can actually see but
that's<00:05:52.820> just<00:05:52.909> me<00:05:53.120> looking<00:05:53.300> up<00:05:53.570> close<00:05:53.870> let's

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
that's just me looking up close let's

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:55.810 
that's just me looking up close let's
see<00:05:54.770> from<00:05:54.889> a<00:05:55.010> distance<00:05:55.159> that<00:05:55.400> actually<00:05:55.669> looks

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
see from a distance that actually looks

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.070 
see from a distance that actually looks
pretty<00:05:55.880> good<00:05:56.060> now<00:05:56.210> remember<00:05:56.659> this<00:05:56.810> is<00:05:56.960> the<00:05:56.990> one

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
pretty good now remember this is the one

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.240 
pretty good now remember this is the one
I<00:05:57.229> had<00:05:57.320> to<00:05:57.349> go<00:05:57.470> over<00:05:57.620> two<00:05:57.740> or<00:05:57.770> three<00:05:57.860> times<00:05:57.979> to

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
I had to go over two or three times to

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.850 
I had to go over two or three times to
make<00:05:58.430> sure<00:05:58.610> it<00:05:58.960> was<00:05:59.960> fully<00:06:00.199> covered<00:06:00.440> what<00:06:00.830> I

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
make sure it was fully covered what I

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.219 
make sure it was fully covered what I
thought<00:06:01.130> was<00:06:01.280> fully<00:06:01.460> covered<00:06:01.639> at<00:06:01.820> the<00:06:01.880> time<00:06:02.229> so

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
thought was fully covered at the time so

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.170 
thought was fully covered at the time so
the<00:06:03.740> results<00:06:04.159> might<00:06:04.310> be<00:06:04.340> skewed<00:06:04.820> a<00:06:04.880> little<00:06:04.909> bit

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
the results might be skewed a little bit

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.879 
the results might be skewed a little bit
because<00:06:05.780> that<00:06:06.199> means<00:06:06.320> I<00:06:06.470> actually<00:06:06.560> went<00:06:06.860> over

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
because that means I actually went over

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.219 
because that means I actually went over
like<00:06:07.340> three<00:06:07.610> times<00:06:07.909> so<00:06:08.570> and<00:06:08.780> of<00:06:08.840> course<00:06:09.050> if<00:06:09.169> you

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229 
like three times so and of course if you

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:10.960 
like three times so and of course if you
go<00:06:09.349> the<00:06:09.500> more<00:06:09.590> you<00:06:09.740> go<00:06:09.860> over<00:06:10.070> it<00:06:10.190> with<00:06:10.340> most<00:06:10.639> car

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
go the more you go over it with most car

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.330 
go the more you go over it with most car
tyre<00:06:11.270> shines<00:06:11.599> the<00:06:12.229> wetter<00:06:12.650> look<00:06:12.889> and<00:06:13.099> brighter

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
tyre shines the wetter look and brighter

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.010 
tyre shines the wetter look and brighter
shine<00:06:13.610> it's<00:06:13.699> going<00:06:13.820> to<00:06:13.880> be<00:06:13.970> I'll<00:06:14.690> go<00:06:14.810> ahead<00:06:14.870> and

I<00:06:17.080> had<00:06:18.080> to<00:06:18.199> reapply<00:06:18.530> some<00:06:18.919> of<00:06:18.979> it<00:06:19.070> to<00:06:19.159> this<00:06:19.280> one

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
I had to reapply some of it to this one

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.890 
I had to reapply some of it to this one
I<00:06:19.550> kind<00:06:19.789> of<00:06:19.849> screwed<00:06:20.030> up<00:06:20.210> and<00:06:20.389> I<00:06:20.419> got<00:06:20.599> the<00:06:20.690> tires

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
I kind of screwed up and I got the tires

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.310 
I kind of screwed up and I got the tires
wet<00:06:21.229> and<00:06:21.440> I<00:06:21.530> was<00:06:21.650> worried<00:06:21.949> it<00:06:23.110> they're<00:06:24.110> going

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
wet and I was worried it they're going

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.990 
wet and I was worried it they're going
to<00:06:24.380> be<00:06:24.470> thrown<00:06:25.039> off<00:06:25.190> so<00:06:25.370> I<00:06:25.400> kind<00:06:25.580> of<00:06:25.639> respray

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
to be thrown off so I kind of respray

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.339 
to be thrown off so I kind of respray
just<00:06:26.240> in<00:06:26.360> certain<00:06:26.659> areas<00:06:26.900> that's<00:06:27.169> why<00:06:27.289> it

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
just in certain areas that's why it

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:28.420 
just in certain areas that's why it
looks<00:06:27.530> a<00:06:27.620> little<00:06:27.800> bit<00:06:28.010> like<00:06:28.099> it's<00:06:28.250> dripping

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
looks a little bit like it's dripping
