so<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.780> strumming<00:01:25.140> pattern<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:25.979> two

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
so the strumming pattern is one two

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.130 
so the strumming pattern is one two
three<00:01:26.700> change<00:01:27.259> to<00:01:28.259> three<00:01:28.619> change<00:01:29.780> one<00:01:30.780> two

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
three change to three change one two

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.710 
three change to three change one two
three<00:01:31.530> change

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
three change

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.770 
three change

one two three change

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.580 
one two three change
one<00:01:36.780> two<00:01:37.140> three<00:01:37.530> change<00:01:38.600> Jen<00:01:39.680> see

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
one two three change Jen see

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.130 
one two three change Jen see
why<00:01:42.710> not<00:01:42.950> date

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.770 

so<00:01:48.740> as<00:01:49.040> you<00:01:49.250> as<00:01:49.610> you<00:01:49.790> get<00:01:49.940> better<00:01:50.060> at<00:01:50.330> that<00:01:50.540> then

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
so as you as you get better at that then

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.750 
so as you as you get better at that then
you<00:01:50.930> speed<00:01:51.290> that<00:01:51.500> up

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.860
