00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:20.700 
I did the the Great North Run a few

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.290 
I did the the Great North Run a few
weeks<00:00:20.880> ago<00:00:21.000> which<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.900> excellent<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.530> year

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
weeks ago which is excellent this year

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.780 
weeks ago which is excellent this year
beautiful<00:00:24.300> weather<00:00:24.450> did<00:00:25.200> it<00:00:25.290> in<00:00:25.380> 239<00:00:26.100> which<00:00:26.640> I

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
beautiful weather did it in 239 which I

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.930 
beautiful weather did it in 239 which I
was<00:00:26.880> quite<00:00:26.970> pleased<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:28.010> I<00:00:29.010> found<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> elite

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
was quite pleased with I found the elite

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.640 
was quite pleased with I found the elite
blade<00:00:30.150> was<00:00:30.360> very<00:00:30.540> light<00:00:30.720> which<00:00:31.320> was<00:00:31.440> good

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
blade was very light which was good

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.259 
blade was very light which was good
because<00:00:31.830> I've<00:00:32.249> recovered<00:00:32.550> fast<00:00:32.910> after<00:00:33.089> the

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269 
because I've recovered fast after the

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:36.709 
because I've recovered fast after the
rears<00:00:34.190> you<00:00:35.190> get<00:00:35.339> a<00:00:35.370> lot<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.789> whatever<00:00:36.510> energy

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
rears you get a lot of whatever energy

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.380 
rears you get a lot of whatever energy
you<00:00:36.989> put<00:00:37.109> into<00:00:37.289> it<00:00:37.379> you<00:00:37.469> get<00:00:37.679> back<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.359> a

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
you put into it you get back so it's a

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.419 
you put into it you get back so it's a
lot<00:00:39.570> easier<00:00:39.929> for<00:00:40.019> you<00:00:40.530> know<00:00:40.589> half<00:00:40.890> marathon

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:41.429 
lot easier for you know half marathon

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:45.169 
lot easier for you know half marathon
distance<00:00:42.739> to<00:00:43.739> you're<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> lot<00:00:44.609> less<00:00:44.730> tired<00:00:45.030> you

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:45.179 
distance to you're a lot less tired you

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.660 
distance to you're a lot less tired you
recover<00:00:45.510> faster

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.750 

the<00:00:49.670> elite<00:00:50.120> blade<00:00:50.450> is<00:00:50.750> a<00:00:50.780> lightweight<00:00:51.140> foot

lifestyle the elite blades feels really

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.640 
lifestyle the elite blades feels really
good<00:00:58.340> to<00:00:58.400> walk<00:00:58.640> on<00:00:58.850> but<00:00:59.660> the<00:00:59.750> useful<00:01:00.410> thing<00:01:00.620> for

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
good to walk on but the useful thing for

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.160 
good to walk on but the useful thing for
me<00:01:00.890> about<00:01:01.100> it<00:01:01.250> is<00:01:01.370> I<00:01:01.550> can<00:01:01.580> I<00:01:01.910> can<00:01:02.150> go<00:01:02.630> from<00:01:02.840> each

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
me about it is I can I can go from each

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.689 
me about it is I can I can go from each
activity<00:01:03.560> during<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.010> deer<00:01:04.220> without

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
activity during the deer without

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.000 
activity during the deer without
changing<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.180> leg<00:01:05.330> so<00:01:05.900> I<00:01:06.229> can<00:01:06.530> go<00:01:06.860> to<00:01:06.920> the

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
changing the leg so I can go to the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.890 
changing the leg so I can go to the
allotment<00:01:07.400> I'm<00:01:08.030> an<00:01:08.150> architectural<00:01:08.600> designer

allotment I'm an architectural designer

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.930 
allotment I'm an architectural designer
so<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:09.170> can<00:01:09.260> go<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.410> the<00:01:09.500> site<00:01:09.710> and<00:01:10.640> then<00:01:10.760> I<00:01:10.790> can

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
so I can go to the site and then I can

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.010 
so I can go to the site and then I can
go<00:01:11.030> straight<00:01:11.090> at<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.390> gym<00:01:11.570> I<00:01:11.690> haven't<00:01:11.900> got<00:01:11.990> a

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
go straight at the gym I haven't got a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.750 
go straight at the gym I haven't got a
curry<00:01:12.260> you<00:01:12.860> know<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:12.979> running<00:01:13.340> leg<00:01:13.490> and

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
curry you know a running leg and

curry you know a running leg and
everything<00:01:14.510> else<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.050> it's<00:01:15.200> kind<00:01:15.710> of<00:01:15.800> it<00:01:16.040> does

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
everything else so it's kind of it does

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.600 
everything else so it's kind of it does
a<00:01:16.220> lot<00:01:16.430> of<00:01:16.550> different<00:01:16.820> activities<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:19.280> elite

next<00:02:06.289> step<00:02:06.619> I<00:02:10.330> think<00:02:11.330> it's<00:02:11.630> very<00:02:11.780> good<00:02:11.930> because

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
next step I think it's very good because

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.020 
next step I think it's very good because
you<00:02:12.530> get<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.740> lot<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.010> propulsion<00:02:13.459> back<00:02:13.760> from<00:02:13.940> it

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
you get a lot of propulsion back from it

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.270 
you get a lot of propulsion back from it
when<00:02:14.780> you're<00:02:14.900> going<00:02:14.959> uphill<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.530> really<00:02:16.040> feel

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
when you're going uphill you really feel

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.830 
when you're going uphill you really feel
like<00:02:16.310> it's<00:02:16.640> pushing<00:02:16.819> you<00:02:17.060> forward<00:02:17.300> but<00:02:17.720> you

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
like it's pushing you forward but you

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.050 
like it's pushing you forward but you
would<00:02:17.990> normally<00:02:18.440> do<00:02:18.950> with<00:02:19.130> your<00:02:19.459> normal<00:02:19.850> foot

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
would normally do with your normal foot

would normally do with your normal foot
