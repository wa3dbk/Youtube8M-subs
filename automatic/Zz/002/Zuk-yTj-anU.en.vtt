forward<00:01:48.460> from<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.670> objective<00:01:49.030> now<00:01:49.420> there's<00:01:50.050> a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
forward from the objective now there's a

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.389 
forward from the objective now there's a
reason<00:01:50.500> why<00:01:50.649> I'm<00:01:50.770> staying<00:01:50.979> this<00:01:51.160> closely

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
reason why I'm staying this closely

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.040 
reason why I'm staying this closely
objective<00:01:51.850> normally<00:01:52.300> we<00:01:52.420> push<00:01:52.600> up<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.840> little

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
objective normally we push up a little

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.609 
objective normally we push up a little
bit<00:01:53.170> but<00:01:53.619> on<00:01:53.890> this<00:01:54.399> base<00:01:54.729> okay<00:01:55.380> often<00:01:56.380> if<00:01:56.560> you

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
bit but on this base okay often if you

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:57.960 
bit but on this base okay often if you
go<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:56.950> little<00:01:57.160> bit<00:01:57.340> further<00:01:57.550> forward<00:01:57.820> you're

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
go a little bit further forward you're

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.190 
go a little bit further forward you're
going<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.149> be<00:01:58.240> extremely<00:01:58.420> vulnerable<00:01:58.869> to

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
going to be extremely vulnerable to

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.290 
going to be extremely vulnerable to
sniper<00:01:59.530> fire<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.220> this<00:02:00.580> little<00:02:00.790> kind<00:02:01.119> of

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
sniper fire and this little kind of

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.030 
sniper fire and this little kind of
gully<00:02:01.990> in<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.229> ground<00:02:02.410> this<00:02:02.560> hole<00:02:02.800> in<00:02:03.009> the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
gully in the ground this hole in the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.740 
gully in the ground this hole in the
ground<00:02:03.250> here<00:02:03.580> was<00:02:03.910> really<00:02:04.210> good<00:02:04.390> because<00:02:04.509> it

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
ground here was really good because it

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.880 
ground here was really good because it
meant<00:02:04.869> that<00:02:04.930> you<00:02:05.050> could<00:02:05.080> stay<00:02:05.410> out<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.649> way<00:02:05.740> of

when I look back at this kind of game
play<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.459> I<00:03:15.640> find<00:03:15.880> that<00:03:15.940> even<00:03:16.090> just<00:03:16.269> random

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
play and I find that even just random

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.110 
play and I find that even just random
public<00:03:17.140> games<00:03:17.350> quite<00:03:17.799> focused<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.549> they

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
public games quite focused and they

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.610 
public games quite focused and they
really<00:03:19.360> do<00:03:19.480> focus<00:03:19.690> on<00:03:19.959> taking<00:03:20.079> those<00:03:20.290> vehicles

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
really do focus on taking those vehicles

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.610 
really do focus on taking those vehicles
down<00:03:20.890> dealing<00:03:21.579> with<00:03:21.610> enemies<00:03:22.260> what

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
down dealing with enemies what

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.259 
down dealing with enemies what
right<00:03:23.709> little<00:03:23.980> distraction<00:03:24.970> from<00:03:25.120> that

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
right little distraction from that

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.589 
right little distraction from that
grenade<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.890> yeah<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:26.950> know<00:03:27.069> so<00:03:27.430> it's<00:03:28.360> just

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
grenade and yeah you know so it's just

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.449 
grenade and yeah you know so it's just
very<00:03:29.379> very<00:03:29.500> frustrating<00:03:29.799> when<00:03:30.220> I<00:03:30.280> look<00:03:30.430> back

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
very very frustrating when I look back

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.009 
very very frustrating when I look back
and<00:03:30.790> see<00:03:31.030> how<00:03:31.209> things<00:03:31.420> have<00:03:31.599> changed<00:03:31.629> I

and see how things have changed I

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.630 
and see how things have changed I
honestly<00:03:32.230> don't<00:03:32.560> know<00:03:32.709> why<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.040> don't<00:03:33.519> know<00:03:33.610> why

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
honestly don't know why I don't know why

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.119 
honestly don't know why I don't know why
players<00:03:34.450> would<00:03:34.870> change<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.680> way<00:03:35.799> they<00:03:35.950> deal

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
players would change the way they deal

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.440 
players would change the way they deal
with<00:03:36.159> things<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.580> I<00:03:36.670> don't<00:03:36.730> know<00:03:37.000> why<00:03:37.239> when

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
with things and I don't know why when

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.300 
with things and I don't know why when
you<00:03:37.480> in<00:03:37.629> again<00:03:37.870> people<00:03:38.080> just<00:03:38.440> fail<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.129> see

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
you in again people just fail to see

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.920 
you in again people just fail to see
things<00:03:39.489> that<00:03:39.700> right<00:03:39.909> in<00:03:40.060> front<00:03:40.269> of<00:03:40.390> them<00:03:40.569> it

things that right in front of them it
seems<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:41.379> culture<00:03:41.860> with<00:03:41.950> battlefield<00:03:42.250> 3

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
seems this culture with battlefield 3

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:43.680 
seems this culture with battlefield 3
where<00:03:42.760> people<00:03:43.000> seem<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.209> assume<00:03:43.629> that

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
where people seem to assume that

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.690 
where people seem to assume that
everyone<00:03:44.260> else<00:03:44.349> would<00:03:44.560> do<00:03:44.709> their<00:03:45.250> role<00:03:45.489> for

everyone else would do their role for

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.490 
everyone else would do their role for
them<00:03:45.819> because<00:03:45.970> people<00:03:46.750> have<00:03:46.900> got<00:03:47.140> you<00:03:47.470> know

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
them because people have got you know

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.259 
them because people have got you know
something<00:03:47.950> that<00:03:48.040> they<00:03:48.159> want<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.519> do<00:03:48.670> I<00:03:48.879> don't

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
something that they want to do I don't

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.369 
something that they want to do I don't
know<00:03:49.360> whether<00:03:49.480> that's<00:03:49.629> because<00:03:49.989> of<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.140> game

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
know whether that's because of the game

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.160 
know whether that's because of the game
dynamic<00:03:50.829> I<00:03:51.040> don't<00:03:51.459> know<00:03:51.579> whether<00:03:51.760> dice<00:03:52.569> change

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
dynamic I don't know whether dice change

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.170 
dynamic I don't know whether dice change
things<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:53.769> made<00:03:54.129> certain<00:03:54.430> things<00:03:54.700> more<00:03:54.940> fun

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
things and made certain things more fun

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.869 
things and made certain things more fun
or<00:03:55.480> whatever<00:03:56.049> I<00:03:56.319> don't<00:03:56.590> know<00:03:56.739> but<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:57.640> just

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
or whatever I don't know but it just

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.110 
or whatever I don't know but it just
seems<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.239> me<00:03:59.280> that<00:04:00.280> things<00:04:00.549> have<00:04:00.700> changed<00:04:01.060> for

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
seems to me that things have changed for

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.849 
seems to me that things have changed for
the<00:04:01.209> worse<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:01.870> I<00:04:01.959> couldn't<00:04:02.560> give<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:02.769> a

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.290 

it's<00:04:13.100> often<00:04:13.340> very<00:04:13.370> useful<00:04:13.820> in<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:13.940> space<00:04:14.150> to

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
it's often very useful in the space to

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.390 
it's often very useful in the space to
have<00:04:14.420> mines<00:04:14.720> down<00:04:15.050> because<00:04:15.800> that<00:04:15.950> raid<00:04:16.160> is<00:04:16.340> you

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
have mines down because that raid is you

have mines down because that raid is you
can<00:04:16.519> see<00:04:16.640> on<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.820> right<00:04:16.940> hand<00:04:17.090> side<00:04:17.180> see<00:04:17.810> that

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
can see on the right hand side see that

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.090 
can see on the right hand side see that
quad<00:04:18.170> going<00:04:18.410> around<00:04:18.530> there<00:04:18.709> that's<00:04:18.860> another

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
quad going around there that's another

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.620 
quad going around there that's another
really<00:04:19.280> bad<00:04:19.459> thing<00:04:19.730> for<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:19.910> space<00:04:20.120> I<00:04:20.360> often

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
really bad thing for the space I often

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.660 
really bad thing for the space I often
would<00:04:20.840> do<00:04:20.989> that<00:04:21.140> drive<00:04:22.130> down<00:04:22.310> with<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.460> court

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
would do that drive down with the court

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.370 
would do that drive down with the court
flank<00:04:23.120> all<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.420> way<00:04:23.480> around<00:04:23.570> you<00:04:24.110> can<00:04:24.140> drop

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
flank all the way around you can drop

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
flank all the way around you can drop

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030 
through the rounds I gave a little

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.850 
through the rounds I gave a little
overview<00:06:59.300> of<00:06:59.479> the<00:06:59.570> mall<00:06:59.720> and<00:06:59.870> for<00:07:00.620> the<00:07:00.680> most

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 
overview of the mall and for the most

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.469 
overview of the mall and for the most
part<00:07:01.010> I<00:07:01.430> found<00:07:01.729> that<00:07:01.820> this<00:07:01.910> was<00:07:02.120> kind<00:07:02.270> of<00:07:02.330> odd

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 
part I found that this was kind of odd

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:03.850 
part I found that this was kind of odd
the<00:07:02.570> rounds<00:07:02.780> went<00:07:02.930> down<00:07:03.050> for<00:07:03.229> defenders<00:07:03.680> and

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:03.860 
the rounds went down for defenders and

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.620 
the rounds went down for defenders and
attackers<00:07:04.070> and<00:07:04.550> from<00:07:04.970> what<00:07:05.120> i<00:07:05.150> remember<00:07:05.270> as

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.630 
attackers and from what i remember as

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.629 
attackers and from what i remember as
well<00:07:05.780> attacking<00:07:06.410> on<00:07:06.560> bad<00:07:06.949> company<00:07:07.100> two<00:07:07.430> often

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 
well attacking on bad company two often

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:09.550 
well attacking on bad company two often
could<00:07:08.030> be<00:07:08.120> really<00:07:08.360> really<00:07:08.720> difficult<00:07:09.080> I'm

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.560 
could be really really difficult I'm

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.140 
could be really really difficult I'm
battle<00:07:09.919> for<00:07:10.039> three<00:07:10.220> it<00:07:10.400> never<00:07:10.610> seems<00:07:10.880> to<00:07:10.940> be

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
battle for three it never seems to be

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.550 
battle for three it never seems to be
seems<00:07:11.510> to<00:07:11.630> be<00:07:11.690> if<00:07:11.780> you<00:07:11.870> attacking<00:07:12.139> you<00:07:12.350> win

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
seems to be if you attacking you win

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.920 
seems to be if you attacking you win
almost<00:07:12.770> every<00:07:12.979> single<00:07:13.340> time<00:07:13.669> so<00:07:14.300> you<00:07:14.810> know

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930 
almost every single time so you know

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.360 
almost every single time so you know
this<00:07:15.080> has<00:07:15.229> been<00:07:15.260> his<00:07:15.530> round<00:07:15.830> I<00:07:16.039> think<00:07:16.250> it's

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.370 
this has been his round I think it's

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.040 
this has been his round I think it's
been<00:07:16.520> an<00:07:16.610> interesting<00:07:16.820> little<00:07:17.150> insight<00:07:17.570> but

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
been an interesting little insight but

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.540 
been an interesting little insight but

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:19.550 
you know let me know I really interested

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.529 
you know let me know I really interested
to<00:07:19.610> see<00:07:19.729> what<00:07:19.850> people<00:07:19.880> think<00:07:20.180> do<00:07:20.389> you<00:07:20.449> think

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:20.539 
to see what people think do you think

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:22.420 
to see what people think do you think
that<00:07:20.900> I<00:07:20.930> just<00:07:21.199> had<00:07:21.350> a<00:07:21.380> little<00:07:21.500> bad<00:07:21.740> games<00:07:22.070> and

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.430 
that I just had a little bad games and

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.920 
that I just had a little bad games and
I'm<00:07:22.669> feeling<00:07:23.090> really<00:07:23.270> negative<00:07:23.810> about

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:23.930 
I'm feeling really negative about

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.260 
I'm feeling really negative about
battlefield<00:07:24.350> 3<00:07:24.620> because<00:07:24.919> of<00:07:25.039> it<00:07:25.160> however<00:07:25.789> you

battlefield 3 because of it however you

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.550 
battlefield 3 because of it however you
know<00:07:26.389> I<00:07:26.419> don't<00:07:26.600> think<00:07:26.870> that's<00:07:27.020> the<00:07:27.050> case<00:07:27.139> the
