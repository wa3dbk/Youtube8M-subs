00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.930 
to be wrapping my hair around it as you
can<00:04:28.419> see<00:04:28.479> and<00:04:29.080> I'm<00:04:29.500> going<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:30.010> be<00:04:30.160> going<00:04:30.520> in<00:04:30.639> two

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
can see and I'm going to be going in two

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.210 
can see and I'm going to be going in two
different<00:04:31.120> directions<00:04:31.419> so<00:04:32.289> first<00:04:32.650> I'm<00:04:32.979> going

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
different directions so first I'm going

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.670 
different directions so first I'm going
to<00:04:33.370> flip<00:04:33.849> it<00:04:34.030> out<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:34.660> then<00:04:35.080> I'm<00:04:35.320> going<00:04:35.620> to

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
to flip it out and then I'm going to

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.879 
to flip it out and then I'm going to
flip<00:04:36.070> the<00:04:36.490> curls<00:04:36.849> inward<00:04:37.539> so<00:04:38.110> that<00:04:38.349> makes<00:04:38.680> a

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
flip the curls inward so that makes a

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.219 
flip the curls inward so that makes a
different<00:04:39.550> effect<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.660> curls<00:04:40.960> will

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
different effect and the curls will

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.900 
different effect and the curls will
actually<00:04:41.710> bounce<00:04:41.979> off<00:04:42.310> of<00:04:42.340> each<00:04:42.669> other

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
actually bounce off of each other

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.570 
actually bounce off of each other
instead<00:04:43.479> of<00:04:43.630> just<00:04:43.930> forming<00:04:44.680> one<00:04:44.950> big<00:04:45.250> curl

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
instead of just forming one big curl

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.820 
instead of just forming one big curl
once<00:04:45.880> you<00:04:46.090> brush<00:04:46.389> it<00:04:46.570> all<00:04:46.690> out<00:04:46.930> so<00:04:47.410> you'll<00:04:47.590> see

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
once you brush it all out so you'll see

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.010 
once you brush it all out so you'll see
what<00:04:47.950> I<00:04:48.010> mean<00:04:48.099> in<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.760> end<00:04:48.940> but<00:04:49.510> for<00:04:49.870> now<00:04:49.960> you

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
what I mean in the end but for now you

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.409

can<00:04:50.229> just<00:04:50.560> watch<00:04:50.800> and<00:04:51.130> see<00:04:51.550> how<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:51.970> curl<00:04:52.389> my
