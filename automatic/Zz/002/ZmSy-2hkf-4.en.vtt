00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.869
 you could have told me 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:10.189
 I wanted to tell you 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:12.069
 you said enough 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:14.099
 only the truth 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.320
 i can deal with ricca 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.130
 absurd that it's past to accept the fact that you're a little bit 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.779
 and have it 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.919
 it's the brother - and that 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.909
 my best friend is a witch 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.039
 I can accept the fact that the world is a much more mysterious place than 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.039
 as far as I could imagine 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.560
 I cannot accept this page 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.090
 what are they? 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.270
 who am I for you you are not pretty 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.790
 if the exact opposite of all that for this when you understood it 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.860
 before kissing her 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.860
 before the thought went wrong 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.080
 before you even know you 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.070
 the first day of school 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.980
 when we met 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.980
 it is not the first time elena 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.590
 then when it was 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.110
 on May 23, 2009 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.840
 but that one 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.710
 the day when your parents' car 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.180
 has fallen tel. 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.370
 you must 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.190
 every two years or back here 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.750
 to find bags see my home 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.690
 and last spring 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.160
 I was walking in the woods 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.510
 near the bridge on twitter i 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.930
 historical figures always 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.530
 all 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.530
 I ran lean but not fast enough 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.420
 the author traces founded 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.590
 your father 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.080
 was still conscious I managed to grab it 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.080
 but he didn't want him to be there 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.980
 if it doesn't help first 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.980
 google reader 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.930
 when I woke up and masked 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.290
 for me alone 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.290
 understand how it came out of the other 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.310
 the site was a miracle I came back 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.449
 but not too much - I am 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.129
 failed to save 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.040
 when he pulled your face out of you and I saw that he laughs old 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.219
 Incredible frozen cellar 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.419
 after that I spent months making sure that it wasn't her 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:36.229
 chiosso tattoo took everything I could on you and saw that you didn't 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.709
 you had nothing in common - 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.739
 I wanted to leave the city 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.349
 elena could not I could not go away without knowing you 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.839
 I am so sorry not to have told you polyphosphates 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:52.839
 but you were so sad 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.319
 why companies 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.369
 sufficient elements 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:04.400
 because the dream is so star 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.059
 what are you telling me 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:09.389
 I found it an inexplicable thing 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.489
 you were a gilbert her for free 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:13.439
 but the similarity 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:14.799
 too strong 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.899
 then I discovered the truth 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:20.029
 you have been thumbelina
