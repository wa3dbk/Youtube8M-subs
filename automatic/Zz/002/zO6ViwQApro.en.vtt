00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
same technology we have we are using

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.480 
same technology we have we are using
actually<00:01:07.790> in<00:01:07.880> digital<00:01:08.210> imaging<00:01:09.190> but<00:01:10.190> on<00:01:10.310> top

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
actually in digital imaging but on top

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.760 
actually in digital imaging but on top
of<00:01:10.550> that<00:01:10.810> we<00:01:11.810> actually<00:01:11.930> working<00:01:12.560> now<00:01:12.710> the

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
of that we actually working now the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.980 
of that we actually working now the
camcorder<00:01:13.400> experience<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.390> for<00:01:14.570> example<00:01:14.600> you

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
camcorder experience so for example you

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.940 
camcorder experience so for example you
get<00:01:15.460> record<00:01:16.460> in<00:01:16.700> 4k<00:01:17.150> videos<00:01:17.620> that<00:01:18.620> you<00:01:18.710> can<00:01:18.740> the

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
get record in 4k videos that you can the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.630 
get record in 4k videos that you can the
only<00:01:19.100> one<00:01:19.250> on<00:01:19.400> your<00:01:19.580> 4k<00:01:19.850> TV<00:01:20.230> you<00:01:21.230> also<00:01:21.680> get<00:01:21.860> what

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
only one on your 4k TV you also get what

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.610 
only one on your 4k TV you also get what
we<00:01:22.790> call<00:01:22.940> time<00:01:23.180> shifts<00:01:23.540> video<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.470> you<00:01:24.590> can

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
we call time shifts video so you can

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.950 
we call time shifts video so you can
recall<00:01:25.070> video<00:01:25.400> and<00:01:25.730> actually<00:01:26.090> create<00:01:26.660> slow

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
recall video and actually create slow

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.340 
recall video and actually create slow
motions<00:01:27.560> of<00:01:28.100> your<00:01:28.340> videos<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:29.750> have<00:01:29.780> also

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
motions of your videos you have also

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.940 
motions of your videos you have also
augmented<00:01:31.250> reality<00:01:31.790> video<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.380> you<00:01:33.440> can<00:01:33.530> for

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
augmented reality video so you can for

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.560 
augmented reality video so you can for
example<00:01:34.010> with<00:01:34.490> your<00:01:34.520> children<00:01:34.790> we<00:01:35.270> increase

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
one with a spiderman you can actually

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.600 
one with a spiderman you can actually
recognize<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.590> faces<00:01:39.800> and<00:01:40.040> it<00:01:40.250> will<00:01:40.460> add

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610

interesting<00:02:36.239> is<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.510> digital<00:02:36.959> noise<00:02:37.380> canceling

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
interesting is a digital noise canceling

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.190 
interesting is a digital noise canceling
technology<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:39.120> we<00:02:39.480> introduced<00:02:39.959> for<00:02:40.170> the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
technology so we introduced for the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.990 
technology so we introduced for the
first<00:02:40.290> time<00:02:40.709> digital<00:02:41.430> noise<00:02:41.519> canceling

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
first time digital noise canceling

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000 
first time digital noise canceling
technology<00:02:42.090> built<00:02:42.900> into<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.319> smartphone<00:02:43.530> and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
technology built into the smartphone and

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.759 
technology built into the smartphone and
also<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.580> tablet<00:02:44.910> so<00:02:45.569> you<00:02:45.630> get<00:02:45.900> up<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.350> ninety

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
also the tablet so you get up to ninety

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.670 
also the tablet so you get up to ninety
eight<00:02:46.950> percent<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.810> noise<00:02:48.810> reduction<00:02:49.140> ambient

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
eight percent of noise reduction ambient

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.930 
eight percent of noise reduction ambient
noise<00:02:49.800> reduction<00:02:50.040> for<00:02:50.370> example<00:02:50.640> when<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:50.819> on

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
noise reduction for example when you on

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.449 
noise reduction for example when you on
the<00:02:50.970> train<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.870> plane<00:02:52.260> or<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:52.590> traffic

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
the train in the plane or in traffic

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.400 
the train in the plane or in traffic
it's<00:02:53.730> reduce<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.209> noise<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.540> always<00:02:55.049> get<00:02:55.260> the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
it's reduce the noise you always get the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.920 
it's reduce the noise you always get the
clear<00:02:55.650> sound<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.459> kiss<00:02:57.090> on<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.360> can<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.750> can

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
clear sound a kiss on you can you can

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.160 
clear sound a kiss on you can you can
get<00:02:58.430> on<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.640> place<00:02:59.880> I'd<00:03:00.120> working<00:03:00.930> closely

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
get on the place I'd working closely

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.500
