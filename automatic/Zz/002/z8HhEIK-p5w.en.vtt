00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.270
 hu 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.770
 hi it's coaching you ask 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.330
 how to have lots of money in animals 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.040
 crossing 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.370
 it's very simple so it's a 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.260
 technique that takes up to seven years so 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.990
 about an hour well will take time 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.660
 when so for this technique rather 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.980
 simple it is necessary to put must regulate your 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.279
 clock from 20 hours 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.609
 so I put it at 8:30 pm and you 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.110
 should put your your city in 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:37.090
 stop economic because you 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.200
 will earn more money ie 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.290
 thanks to this technique you make a 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.890
 eric about 400 thousand bell in 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.110
 economic 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.840
 and if you are in other camels 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.510
 stop you will gain that 300000 have 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.399
 first of all where should I go to the port 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.469
 so to have admiral you must have 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.230
 repaid the first debt of your 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:01:01.480
 house and wait a week so he 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:04.500
 will appear you will talk to him and him 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.740
 give myth the ch is to embark 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.740
 so here we go 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.640
 I do not want to see anyone 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.560
 So here is admiral his habit 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.450
 cows yard which is pretty annoying 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.399
 so there is a technique to do it 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.049
 stop singing 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:34.200
 in fact it is to support many times 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.430
 on eure where i will show you when 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.710
 he started singing to remind 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.560
 many times and it will stop as 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:46.189
 by magic 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.189
 so here we go 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.010
 - he is not very happy but hey 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.780
 now you have arrived on 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.780
 the island I was going to go outside 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.179
 and you will talk to the giro ide who 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.670
 adjust there and you'll take all the 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:19.100
 objects that offers us 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:21.610
 I had something and you go 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:27.560
 take the call 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:29.570
 the ax the net for the fishing rod 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.190
 and indispensable homeland but you can 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.520
 take it to fish not for that 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.770
 wanted nor the combination is not no 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:42.650
 more indispensable so you go 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:45.110
 start with dug up and removed all 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.380
 the trees all the flowers all the 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.140
 bushes that has in the middle of the island except 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.690
 the baskets because the palms are 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.310
 very important because that's where 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.690
 you will win it's thanks to these 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.930
 landings you will win a lot 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:04.750
 money so after unearthing everything 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.450
 all the flowers the beginnings are and where 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.340
 you will hunt all the beds j 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.840
 every gilles night and six duels 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.070
 and the hermit crabs especially the 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.100
 hermit crab because the one who 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.570
 poses problem is so once this 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.769
 all done for the person that the 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.810
 bernard lamit is especially important 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:25.910
 get rid of it and so you're going to do the 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.450
 turn slowly to blaye to a shark by 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.670
 example we do not care but stop 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.560
 this insect there is what it takes 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.330
 catch and you're coming in staying 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.709
 leaning on everything gently with my sons 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:43.060
 and he was doing the catching them so I 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.060
 am going for a last ride on the island 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.060
 on a last round to show you 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.489
 all beetles that can have it's 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.810
 not that to have a lot but hey 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.810
 place but if we have a lot 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:03.760
 here is another scarab atlas 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.130
 now I will go back and put them 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.130
 in the basket 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:18.260
 you have inside so also the 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.880
 technique to catch beetles I 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.410
 wanted to say it 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.440
 it's looking at london and that's 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.810
 almost cross your shadow to you that is 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.490
 almost close to that of the tree and 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.940
 as soon as they almost touch the shadow of 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.130
 the tree 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:36.530
 you have to have butter then you have to 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.200
 let go of the completely held on dropped 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.810
 so has it you're going to press this 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.760
 basket and put beetles in it 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.800
 so the goal is there you can not 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.280
 see but it's filling in every 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.100
 baskets 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.230
 finally there are four lockers and fill 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.500
 everything and if you are in economic 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.510
 you will be able to win 400 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.160
 milos is so now I'm going 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.310
 go home so I only had 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.910
 four loses points only two but they 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.800
 had caught two fronts of which I 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.460
 go home and show you there 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.560
 where to sell them 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.310
 because if you ask not in the 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:17.990
 good shop you are not going to have enough 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:22.970
 money finally not the same income yes 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.890
 let's go so I'm going with a 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.070
 mineral he was going to feel dirty a little 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.070
 music 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.210
 we still support it sure that a weight 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:52.560
 veil are mine his music but hey 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:55.680
 you right now so I 'm going to take 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.800
 my scarlets in that year I have 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.860
 took four months I'm going to take that 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.860
 two years to show you so to the 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.980
 class 22e so what is needed 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.970
 to know is that goliath beetles 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.810
 lescar b which sells the cheapest 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.430
 the red and gilded beetles etc that get 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.590
 sell the most proud is the primate momentum 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.670
 and setbacks that are very difficult to 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.210
 catch because they are very 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:23.640
 sensitive so I advise you more 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:26.130
 do not catch the end goliath there has been 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.600
 still wind 6000 or 7000 closed 7 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:31.290
 but if it's not so good that 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.560
 others so excused a little every 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:44.640
 flowers that hang in my house 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:48.030
 you're going to sell to recycling he was going 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.940

 arms 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.460
