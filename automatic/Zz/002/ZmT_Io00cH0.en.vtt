the<00:00:52.620> speed<00:00:52.860> knife<00:00:53.129> especially<00:00:53.940> since<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:54.300> have

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the speed knife especially since we have

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.180 
the speed knife especially since we have
the<00:00:54.570> option<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.170> put<00:00:55.379> velocity<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.070> our

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
work and that would be a regular

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.399 
work and that would be a regular
triangle<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:18.960> you're<00:01:19.140> not<00:01:19.229> being
