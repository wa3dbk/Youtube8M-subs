00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
you can make now the first is slightly

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.049 
you can make now the first is slightly
smaller<00:00:33.680> takes<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.800> lot<00:00:35.010> less<00:00:35.160> stuff<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.610> make

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
smaller takes a lot less stuff to make

torch there and a piece of wood there
they<00:01:58.200> go<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.409> then<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.710> get<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.860> basic<00:01:59.310> house

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
they go so then you get the basic house

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.660 
they go so then you get the basic house
parts<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.149> put<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.570> there

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
parts you put that there

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.069

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
stuff I mean it's a lot easier to get

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.830 
stuff I mean it's a lot easier to get
the<00:02:08.190> my<00:02:08.310> redstone<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> lot<00:02:09.810> more

the my redstone but it's a lot more
complicated<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.619> build<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.430> house<00:02:11.670> is

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
complicated to build and this house is

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.700 
complicated to build and this house is
kind<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.540> fucking<00:02:12.810> ugly

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
let's see if this works

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.070 
let's see if this works
and<00:03:16.730> boom<00:03:17.730> okay<00:03:18.210> even<00:03:18.570> if<00:03:18.660> your<00:03:18.780> house<00:03:18.900> is

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
and boom okay even if your house is

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
blown to pieces you just rebuild it and

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.450 
blown to pieces you just rebuild it and
then<00:03:20.820> get<00:03:20.970> stuck<00:03:21.210> by<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.450> tree<00:03:21.980> but<00:03:22.980> yet<00:03:23.310> the

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
then get stuck by a tree but yet the

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.070 
then get stuck by a tree but yet the
other<00:03:23.580> thing<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:23.970> can<00:03:24.150> do<00:03:24.270> and<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.660> is<00:03:24.840> kind

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
other thing you can do and this is kind

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.080 
other thing you can do and this is kind
of<00:03:25.170> my<00:03:25.350> favorite<00:03:25.620> thing<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:26.280> do<00:03:26.400> with<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.610> I

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
of my favorite thing to do with it I

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.790 
of my favorite thing to do with it I
think<00:03:27.540> I'll<00:03:27.720> actually<00:03:27.810> just<00:03:28.110> give<00:03:28.260> myself<00:03:28.470> one

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
think I'll actually just give myself one

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.700 
think I'll actually just give myself one
to<00:03:29.070> save<00:03:29.370> time<00:03:29.790> as<00:03:30.090> there<00:03:30.840> we<00:03:30.930> go<00:03:31.050> custom

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
to save time as there we go custom

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.900 
to save time as there we go custom
objects<00:03:32.430> there<00:03:32.550> we<00:03:32.610> go

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
objects there we go

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.300 
objects there we go
now<00:03:33.840> so<00:03:34.020> I'm<00:03:34.110> just<00:03:34.170> saving<00:03:34.470> time<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.160> also

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
now so I'm just saving time and I also

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.190 
now so I'm just saving time and I also
fly<00:03:35.700> more<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.090> save<00:03:36.240> time<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:36.750> there'll<00:03:37.080> be<00:03:37.110> a

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
fly more to save time so there'll be a

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.330 
fly more to save time so there'll be a
link<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.500> all<00:03:37.590> these<00:03:37.680> other<00:03:37.740> mods<00:03:38.130> in<00:03:38.250> the
