00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.310 

this<00:00:54.020> CD<00:00:55.020> we<00:00:55.379> find<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.739> we've<00:00:55.890> got<00:00:57.199> in<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
this CD we find that we've got in the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.110 
this CD we find that we've got in the
windows<00:00:58.680> directory<00:00:59.070> we've<00:00:59.730> got<00:01:00.030> our<00:01:00.890> 2.91<00:01:02.120> for

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
windows directory we've got our 2.91 for

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.690 
windows directory we've got our 2.91 for
windows<00:01:03.750> 32-bit<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:05.220> now<00:01:05.369> I'm<00:01:05.489> actually

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
windows 32-bit so now I'm actually

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.090 
windows 32-bit so now I'm actually
running<00:01:06.000> Vista<00:01:06.360> 64-bit<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.740> computer

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
running Vista 64-bit on this computer

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.550 
running Vista 64-bit on this computer
and<00:01:08.450> it<00:01:09.450> doesn't<00:01:09.810> really<00:01:09.960> matter<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:10.439> if

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
and it doesn't really matter but if

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.190 
and it doesn't really matter but if
you're<00:01:10.710> running<00:01:10.830> Vista<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.909> will<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:13.020> will

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
you're running Vista it will this will

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.260 
you're running Vista it will this will
still<00:01:13.500> work<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.040> what<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:14.880> probably<00:01:15.119> best

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
still work but what it's probably best

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.510 
still work but what it's probably best
to<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.689> run<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.280> administrator<00:01:17.280> if<00:01:17.400> you're

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
to do is run as administrator if you're

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.609 
to do is run as administrator if you're
just<00:01:17.640> running<00:01:17.820> XP<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.320> double

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
just running XP you can just double

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.910 
just running XP you can just double
click<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.979> install<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:21.180> you're<00:01:21.360> running

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.590 
click and install it if you're running
Vista<00:01:22.920> then<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.729> got<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> bit<00:01:24.060> more<00:01:24.210> security

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
Vista then it's got a bit more security

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.410 
Vista then it's got a bit more security
you<00:01:24.810> better<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.439> an<00:01:25.710> administrator<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:27.240> that

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
go programs you can find it and I've

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.810 
go programs you can find it and I've
just<00:02:17.880> created<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.390> quick<00:02:18.600> launch<00:02:18.780> icon<00:02:19.290> here<00:02:19.820> so

just created a quick launch icon here so

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.240 
just created a quick launch icon here so
that<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.030> can<00:02:21.150> find<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.510> easily<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:22.250> basically

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
that I can find it easily and basically

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.380 
that I can find it easily and basically
now<00:02:23.520> it's<00:02:23.760> going<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.030> be<00:02:24.120> install<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:27.240> now

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
now it's going to be install and now

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.270 
now it's going to be install and now
we're<00:02:27.570> back<00:02:27.750> again<00:02:27.930> I'll<00:02:28.230> just<00:02:28.440> pause<00:02:29.040> before

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
we're back again I'll just pause before

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.110 
we're back again I'll just pause before
so<00:02:29.790> we<00:02:29.910> could<00:02:30.090> not<00:02:30.780> sit<00:02:31.080> through<00:02:31.320> all<00:02:31.380> the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
so we could not sit through all the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.890 
so we could not sit through all the
installation<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.209> only<00:02:33.390> took<00:02:33.570> about<00:02:33.840> a

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
installation that only took about a

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
else that sees in the computer so I'll

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.190 
else that sees in the computer so I'll
just<00:03:01.739> allow<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.190> program<00:03:02.610> again<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.959> we'll

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
just allow this program again and we'll

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.650 
just allow this program again and we'll
see<00:03:04.230> here<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:05.580> is<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.150> sort<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.420> going

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
see here that is that is sort of going

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.550 
see here that is that is sort of going
off<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.989> screen

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
off the screen

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.259 
off the screen
so<00:03:08.220> I'll<00:03:08.280> just<00:03:08.459> bring<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.700> back<00:03:08.760> onto<00:03:09.060> the

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
so I'll just bring it back onto the

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.220 
so I'll just bring it back onto the
screen<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:09.720> we<00:03:09.810> can<00:03:09.840> see<00:03:09.989> what's<00:03:10.290> happening<00:03:10.380> um

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
screen so we can see what's happening um

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.000 
screen so we can see what's happening um
so<00:03:13.230> basically<00:03:13.470> in<00:03:14.040> terms<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.430> packages<00:03:14.970> I

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
so basically in terms of packages I

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.250 
so basically in terms of packages I
could<00:03:17.010> load<00:03:17.640> them<00:03:17.940> or<00:03:18.239> install<00:03:18.750> them<00:03:18.930> straight

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
could load them or install them straight

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.050 
could load them or install them straight
off<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.590> internet<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:20.130> can<00:03:20.220> choose<00:03:20.730> from<00:03:20.760> a

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
off the internet I can choose from a

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.410 
off the internet I can choose from a
list<00:03:21.680> but<00:03:22.680> but<00:03:23.100> I've<00:03:23.220> already<00:03:23.400> put<00:03:23.850> them<00:03:23.970> on<00:03:24.090> on

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
list but but I've already put them on on

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
a CD so that'll save downloading them

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.949 
a CD so that'll save downloading them
and<00:03:28.370> or<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.400> could<00:03:29.790> put<00:03:29.940> them<00:03:30.030> on<00:03:30.180> hard<00:03:30.390> disk<00:03:30.660> and

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
that we're going to use and so now if we

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.190 
that we're going to use and so now if we
if<00:05:09.530> we<00:05:09.940> didn't<00:05:10.940> have<00:05:11.060> access<00:05:11.510> to<00:05:11.720> that<00:05:11.870> to<00:05:12.080> the

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
if we didn't have access to that to the

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.460 
if we didn't have access to that to the
batch<00:05:12.380> file<00:05:12.620> if<00:05:12.740> you<00:05:12.800> just<00:05:12.980> type<00:05:13.190> in<00:05:13.400> library

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
batch file if you just type in library

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.110 
batch file if you just type in library
now<00:05:15.470> at<00:05:15.680> the<00:05:15.800> moment<00:05:15.980> I've<00:05:16.220> installed<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:16.790> EPI

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
now at the moment I've installed the EPI

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.830 
now at the moment I've installed the EPI
package<00:05:17.540> you'll<00:05:18.170> notice<00:05:18.500> that<00:05:18.680> our<00:05:19.580> itself<00:05:20.570> is

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
package you'll notice that our itself is

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.870 
package you'll notice that our itself is
case-sensitive<00:05:21.290> so<00:05:21.800> it<00:05:22.010> needs<00:05:22.220> a<00:05:22.340> capital<00:05:22.730> e

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
case-sensitive so it needs a capital e

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.830 
case-sensitive so it needs a capital e
here<00:05:23.150> and<00:05:23.300> small<00:05:24.020> p<00:05:24.260> and<00:05:24.290> small<00:05:24.680> i<00:05:25.540> and<00:05:26.540> just

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
here and small p and small i and just

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.130 
here and small p and small i and just
load<00:05:27.050> that<00:05:27.080> in<00:05:27.470> for<00:05:27.770> us<00:05:27.890> and<00:05:28.360> also<00:05:29.360> we<00:05:29.720> can<00:05:29.900> load

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
load that in for us and also we can load

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.620 
load that in for us and also we can load
in<00:05:30.380> library<00:05:31.010> our<00:05:32.380> Cmdr<00:05:33.380> for<00:05:33.710> our<00:05:33.800> commander

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
in library our Cmdr for our commander

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.880 
in library our Cmdr for our commander
noticing<00:05:35.630> here<00:05:35.840> uppercase<00:05:36.470> and<00:05:36.650> lowercase

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
noticing here uppercase and lowercase

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.990 
noticing here uppercase and lowercase
again<00:05:37.400> and<00:05:37.610> so<00:05:38.540> once<00:05:39.110> we<00:05:39.460> fire<00:05:40.460> that<00:05:40.670> off<00:05:40.790> it's

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
again and so once we fire that off it's

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.490 
again and so once we fire that off it's
gone<00:05:41.180> off<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.510> screen<00:05:41.780> I'll<00:05:42.020> just<00:05:42.200> bring<00:05:42.350> it

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
gone off the screen I'll just bring it

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.400 
gone off the screen I'll just bring it
back<00:05:42.650> on<00:05:42.970> of<00:05:43.970> course<00:05:44.210> if<00:05:44.360> you<00:05:44.450> had<00:05:44.600> the<00:05:44.780> if<00:05:45.230> I

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
back on of course if you had the if I

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.110 
back on of course if you had the if I
wasn't<00:05:45.620> recording<00:05:46.130> at<00:05:46.220> your<00:05:46.370> dad<00:05:46.580> or<00:05:46.910> if<00:05:47.000> I

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
wasn't recording at your dad or if I

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.610 
wasn't recording at your dad or if I
recorded<00:05:47.540> the<00:05:47.630> whole<00:05:47.660> screen<00:05:48.110> you<00:05:48.230> could<00:05:48.410> see

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
recorded the whole screen you could see

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.040 
recorded the whole screen you could see
it<00:05:48.790> and<00:05:49.790> so<00:05:50.540> then<00:05:50.780> we<00:05:50.990> could<00:05:51.200> just<00:05:52.630> we<00:05:53.630> can<00:05:53.840> just

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
it and so then we could just we can just

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.140 
it and so then we could just we can just
use<00:05:54.200> any<00:05:54.410> of<00:05:54.530> these<00:05:54.680> many<00:05:55.010> menus<00:05:55.400> here<00:05:55.820> to<00:05:55.940> do

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
use any of these many menus here to do

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.000 
use any of these many menus here to do
stew<00:05:56.360> basic<00:05:56.990> statistical<00:05:57.530> things<00:05:57.800> or

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
stew basic statistical things or

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.220 
stew basic statistical things or
graphics<00:05:58.430> and<00:05:58.640> first<00:05:59.480> of<00:05:59.630> all<00:05:59.720> though<00:05:59.930> let's

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230 
graphics and first of all though let's

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.990 
graphics and first of all though let's
find<00:06:00.530> some<00:06:01.310> data<00:06:01.520> to<00:06:01.760> work<00:06:01.910> with<00:06:02.080> and<00:06:03.700> so<00:06:04.700> if<00:06:04.880> I

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
find some data to work with and so if I

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.990 
find some data to work with and so if I
look<00:06:05.210> in<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.540> in<00:06:05.780> the<00:06:06.020> EPI<00:06:06.350> file<00:06:07.010> and<00:06:07.840> I<00:06:09.520> can<00:06:10.520> I

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
look in the in the EPI file and I can I

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.820 
look in the in the EPI file and I can I
can<00:06:11.210> double<00:06:11.540> click<00:06:11.570> or<00:06:11.930> I<00:06:11.960> can<00:06:12.200> just<00:06:12.380> type<00:06:12.560> in

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
can double click or I can just type in

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.490 
can double click or I can just type in
one<00:06:13.010> that<00:06:13.160> I<00:06:13.220> know<00:06:13.280> is<00:06:13.460> there<00:06:14.260> let's<00:06:15.260> just

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
one that I know is there let's just

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.620 
one that I know is there let's just
double<00:06:15.800> click<00:06:16.120> show<00:06:17.120> you<00:06:17.180> there's<00:06:17.390> quite<00:06:17.600> a

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
double click show you there's quite a

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.150 
double click show you there's quite a
lot<00:06:17.750> of<00:06:17.780> data<00:06:18.050> that<00:06:18.200> we<00:06:18.440> might<00:06:18.650> be<00:06:18.770> looking<00:06:19.040> at

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
lot of data that we might be looking at

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.180 
lot of data that we might be looking at
later<00:06:19.340> and<00:06:19.870> just<00:06:20.870> this<00:06:21.530> time<00:06:21.740> I'll<00:06:21.890> just<00:06:22.010> use

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
later and just this time I'll just use

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.950 
later and just this time I'll just use
the<00:06:22.340> diet<00:06:23.050> data<00:06:24.050> set<00:06:24.580> and<00:06:25.580> so<00:06:26.270> we<00:06:26.660> can<00:06:26.810> have<00:06:26.930> a

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
the diet data set and so we can have a

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.620 
the diet data set and so we can have a
look<00:06:27.110> at<00:06:27.260> that

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.480 

you<00:06:32.630> see<00:06:32.810> there's<00:06:32.990> a<00:06:33.080> whole<00:06:33.230> lot<00:06:33.410> of<00:06:33.490> variables

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
you see there's a whole lot of variables

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.910 
you see there's a whole lot of variables
there<00:06:34.810> how<00:06:35.810> many<00:06:35.870> might<00:06:36.170> say<00:06:36.380> just<00:06:36.650> want<00:06:36.830> to

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920 
there how many might say just want to

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.550 
there how many might say just want to
look<00:06:37.490> at<00:06:37.640> a<00:06:37.730> histogram<00:06:38.060> of<00:06:38.390> energy<00:06:38.750> so<00:06:39.110> just<00:06:39.440> a

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
look at a histogram of energy so just a

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.080 
look at a histogram of energy so just a
basic<00:06:40.160> graph<00:06:40.450> just<00:06:41.450> a<00:06:41.570> histogram<00:06:41.930> and<00:06:43.090> there's

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
basic graph just a histogram and there's

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.600 
basic graph just a histogram and there's
energy<00:06:44.360> so<00:06:44.900> let's<00:06:44.930> look<00:06:45.260> at<00:06:45.380> that<00:06:45.560> and<00:06:45.920> there

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 
energy so let's look at that and there

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.330 
energy so let's look at that and there
it<00:06:46.760> is<00:06:46.790> so<00:06:47.680> that's<00:06:48.680> all<00:06:48.920> for<00:06:49.130> now

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 
it is so that's all for now

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.260 
it is so that's all for now
I<00:06:49.520> will<00:06:50.050> also<00:06:51.050> just<00:06:51.980> put<00:06:52.220> on<00:06:52.430> the<00:06:52.610> desktop<00:06:53.120> a

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
I will also just put on the desktop a

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.480 
I will also just put on the desktop a
batch<00:06:53.960> file<00:06:54.260> that'll<00:06:55.010> bring<00:06:55.160> up<00:06:55.310> our

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
batch file that'll bring up our

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.190 
batch file that'll bring up our
commander<00:06:55.970> automatically<00:06:56.540> so<00:06:56.750> instead<00:06:57.080> of

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.200 
commander automatically so instead of

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.830 
commander automatically so instead of
typing<00:06:57.560> in<00:06:57.800> library<00:06:58.190> our<00:06:58.340> our<00:06:58.640> Cmdr

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.980 

then<00:07:02.840> these<00:07:03.440> files<00:07:03.860> here<00:07:04.360> we'll<00:07:05.360> just<00:07:05.660> put

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
then these files here we'll just put

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.470 
then these files here we'll just put
them<00:07:06.110> on<00:07:06.200> the<00:07:06.380> desktop<00:07:06.710> and<00:07:07.490> put<00:07:08.090> this<00:07:08.270> one

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:08.480 
them on the desktop and put this one

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.330 
them on the desktop and put this one
this<00:07:08.660> is<00:07:08.840> an<00:07:08.960> environment<00:07:09.380> file<00:07:09.650> that<00:07:09.890> sets<00:07:10.130> up

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
this is an environment file that sets up

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.060 
this is an environment file that sets up
our<00:07:10.610> how<00:07:11.360> we<00:07:11.390> want<00:07:11.690> our<00:07:11.810> to<00:07:11.990> run<00:07:13.390> we<00:07:14.390> can<00:07:14.510> just

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.070 
our how we want our to run we can just

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:21.400 
our how we want our to run we can just
just<00:07:16.070> use<00:07:16.430> that<00:07:19.300> so<00:07:20.300> we'll<00:07:20.600> say<00:07:20.810> one<00:07:21.020> thing<00:07:21.230> if

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:21.410 
just use that so we'll say one thing if
