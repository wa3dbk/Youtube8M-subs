 that the competition will be able to take place 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.570
 areva loses his mandate 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.030
 the time is easier to find a parade 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.600
 you have to go for it is that the horse that is favorite in this 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.440
 competition

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.730
 as well as five canadair justine 10the racist 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.230
 after all, it's a horse 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.370
 with ap 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.370
 who is currently only 13 years old 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.960
 to mark his amazing daughter 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.320
 while the boxes 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.770
 gold to the congruous portion in the room at that moment that the agent agent to four 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.329
 this ongoing investigation 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:25.219
 ap 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.290
 then I can not hear myself 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.570
 and she will not be able to participate in the race the field preferred the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.280
 dispensing of the circuit 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.500
 so here is dakota 4 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.500
 the city wants a good recovery 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.930
 having learned you see 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.340
 this draft agreement that studies to date 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.400
 picasso who relaxes with them it's a mandate 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.810
 the very beautiful fixed of biakolo 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.520
 so percent he is participating in his first race 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.650
 with its imposing build gerra 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.280
 but it will also be pretty red feathers 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.650
 that there is life 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.119
 a spade 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.119
 has every chance of winning 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.570
 look 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.570
 he has an absolutely wonderful stride 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:18.239
 so while we rest a little in the boxes 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.339
 we're finally going to why in my career 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:27.579
 yes we are now indoors with the gym of 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.669
 jacques charon 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:30.869
 her too 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:33.019
 I start to faint 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.539
 and we see now 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:37.859
 he is remarkable 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.859
 it's the 12th 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.519
 ap this is the only talent of this meeting she is called filevault 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.129
 and it's on his part for security reasons 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.099
 and that seems to have potential but 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.170
 his skills will not be enough to beat a horse like royal crowd 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.430
 he is currently trading the art market 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.430
 attention you will see yes 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:06.359
 it's a change in their entirety 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.619
 Draka see here 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:13.719

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:20.199
 in this discipline 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:24.659
 especially since m the first candidates they are already gone 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.379
 I remind you that autumn when he has to leave tiny minute 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.249
 and then completed this news this competition 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:38.349
 you have to cross the finish line it is 28 km from here 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.229
 it is obvious he will have to choose his itinerary
