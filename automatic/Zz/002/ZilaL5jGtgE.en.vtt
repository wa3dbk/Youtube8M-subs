00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.130
 yes first if we are going to confirm you in the 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.870
 market 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:13.080
 good barovero 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:14.960
 most maidana market atlanta funes mori 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.030
 coal 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.100
 ledezma 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.100
 red oak I have to walk 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.789
 with respect to funes mori you already know the 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.789
 position 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.530
 so we want to be aggressive 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.300
 we want to handle the ball is going to be a 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.769
 important match I think for the two 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.620
 teams a nice classic because the twelve 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.390
 the two teams are intentional of 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.239
 go find the result we 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.860
 also so I like this kind of 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.519
 party also in the instance where 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.530
 we are that we are four points of the 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.230
 first and surely we're going to go to 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.150
 try to win 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.530
 they are calling us to radio the network the 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.780
 silence that is an important match 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.150
 for both match and sacred closing 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.350
 the team wins the candidates you 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.840
 you strengthen if river nothing na si river 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.520
 loses then it can be conditioned in the 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.130
 future can flow 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.510
 first if I had the magic wand not 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.400
 I would be here 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.610
 so I 'm also in places that I 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.870
 I like that I know that I love it and 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.290
 love to also play this kind of 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.560
 match 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.770
 I love the pressures that exist what 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.110
 what is at stake and I feel very 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.810
 first very proud to have a team 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.240
 who understands 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.159
 who has the situation as we show to 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.979
 its all kind of responsibility to me 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.110
 I feel proud of the team as it trains 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.120
 how it behaves 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.930
 how education works 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.250
 and those things make me do very well and 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.950
 we know we have to play a game 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.430
 important against a great rival a 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.220
 nice court to play so and where 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.130
 there are important game points so 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.790
 I like all that and wait until the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.010
 Monday to say 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.900
 everything else I think today is at stake 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.840
 three important points but I trust 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.140
 fully in the team I know it's a 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.590
 team apart from being a great professional 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.790
 they are very polite I feel proud that 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.170
 in that and we're going to play a game of 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.360
 football 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.030
 in charge that we are live for 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.590
 sport center chain and said these days 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.930
 that as a tribute to people who are not going 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.400
 to be able to go to the river people if I did 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.069
 a goal in the bonbonnata if he scores a goal 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.480
 kiss the shield later if I told you that 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.950
 that was selling smoke and I love you 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.110
 ask you now you have in the sack 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:54.580
 you have a shield this would be your reaction 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.580
 to celebrate some 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.380
 I think we have players from 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.170
 category of international level 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.930
 we come from beating lanús to a team 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.730
 very important and we are not four 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.340
 points so we surely like 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.730
 look for the result and how we did it 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.040
 always every every party that I propose 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.510
 I do it to earn it and this is not going to be 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.850
 the section will be the same because 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.010
 trust the players I trust the 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.630
 group that I have so it's in a 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.240
 very good time so surely 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.940
 as they disputed a single party respect 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.400
 what they say that good everyone who 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.870
 make responsible for what he says because 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.870
 if I have to go out to 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.049
 by countering everything they say we're going 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.870
 to be three days or four days but if 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.750
 I like to be spicy 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.849
 like to spice the classic 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.040
 so I have to say something with 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.440
 respect to fernando that has a 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.530
 history in the club has won a lot 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.940
 was born in this club is our idol 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.070
 is the most representative we have 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.190
 he has given him many things in the club and 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.190
 hopefully 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.960
 the other players can give you what 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:18.340
 he has given this club hopefully he 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.340
 they can give everything that is giving 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.840
 we are can do so as often 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.939
 for cooperative radio 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.740
 exclusively the classic talk 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:30.599
 exclusively the classic is inevitable 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.430
 wonder about the situation of france 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.680
 that again it will not be concentrated 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.710
 it's your decision but what is the 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:42.680
 situation of what 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.210
 considered that is in clan avoid or the 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.240
 number five and two central flyers not 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.250
 You can get so 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.319
 yes but he is training very well is a 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.300
 great professional is doing it very 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.000
 well you know there are moments and 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.830
 circumstances when you do not have to be 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.560
 you have to do what the coaching does 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.509
 waiting for the moment and surely 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.910
 the opportunity will come as it happens to 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:08.699
 all ramón good afternoon we are in 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.039
 I live in fox sports I want to ask you 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.910
 purpose of the rival and the purpose of 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.680
 Carlos Bianchi 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.539
 you look similar to the mouth technician in 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.889
 many aspects at the moment because 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.500
 It's up to them to lead the biggest 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.090
 Argentina for the relationship with people 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.880
 how do you see him and I think we have 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.090
 the luck of directing the two most teams 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.460
 great of argentina and that one feels 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.229
 proud I think it's the same for 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.720
 he is the same he feels proud of 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.280
 lead in one of the most teams 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.810
 great from argentina we too 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.870
 we know the environment we know 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.910
 we know the mentality the demands 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.100
 that there is a place where 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.500
 we want and part of both him and the 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.000
 I try to do the best and that the 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.730
 young people keep growing keep 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.260
 Progressing is a football match 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.480
 where the two coaches want it 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.840
 win 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.790
 they are below our colon if 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.650
 win can not happen and if we 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.960
 we operate we are not going to go to five 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.630
 points so there's pressure from part of 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.790
 both on their part as well as on 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.580
 we fully trust 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:14.130
 how is the team how are the 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.600
 players we come from winning a match 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.160
 important and I'm telling you we're in 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.320
 good conditions to face this 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.090
 park this great game that all 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.390
 they wait and we hope to make a great 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.390
 match
