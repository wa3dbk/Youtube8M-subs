out<00:01:32.939> probably<00:01:33.630> 15<00:01:34.020> 15<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.650> both<00:01:34.890> sides<00:01:35.540> there

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
out probably 15 15 on both sides there

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.319 
out probably 15 15 on both sides there
15<00:01:36.960> negative<00:01:37.350> 15<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.009> again<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:38.939> gives

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
15 negative 15 and again this just gives

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.440 
15 negative 15 and again this just gives
you<00:01:39.540> more<00:01:39.869> control<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.470> your<00:01:40.590> board<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.970> it's

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
you more control of your board and it's

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.069 
you more control of your board and it's
a<00:01:42.540> better<00:01:42.720> transition<00:01:43.430> to<00:01:44.430> your<00:01:44.460> edges<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.930> now

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
a better transition to your edges so now

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:46.999 
a better transition to your edges so now
we're<00:01:46.259> actually<00:01:46.380> going<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.710> mount<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
we're actually going to mount the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.030 
we're actually going to mount the
binding<00:01:47.930> just<00:01:48.930> all<00:01:49.259> bindings<00:01:49.799> are<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:49.979> to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
binding just all bindings are going to

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.700 
binding just all bindings are going to
come<00:01:50.220> with<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> plate<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.259> you<00:01:52.259> slide<00:01:52.560> it

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
come with a plate like this you slide it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.219 
come with a plate like this you slide it
right<00:01:52.740> into<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.310> binding<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.659> decide<00:01:55.020> what

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
right into the binding you decide what

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.100 
right into the binding you decide what
angle<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.740> want<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:56.070> at<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.780> then<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.930> line

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
angle you want it at and then you line

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.670 
angle you want it at and then you line
up<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.590> holes<00:01:58.710> I<00:02:00.290> simply<00:02:01.290> have<00:02:01.409> four

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
up with the holes I simply have four

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.480 
up with the holes I simply have four
screws<00:02:03.500> we're<00:02:04.500> going<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.710> slide<00:02:05.040> right<00:02:05.070> into

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
screws we're going to slide right into

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.770 
screws we're going to slide right into
the<00:02:05.610> plate<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.000> binding<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:08.660> then<00:02:09.660> you

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
the plate of the binding and then you

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.700 
the plate of the binding and then you
just<00:02:09.959> tighten<00:02:10.259> those<00:02:10.470> all<00:02:10.830> up<00:02:11.129> individually

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.780 

now<00:02:16.710> you<00:02:16.770> really<00:02:17.010> want<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.370> make<00:02:17.460> sure<00:02:17.670> you

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
now you really want to make sure you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.570 
now you really want to make sure you
have<00:02:17.970> these<00:02:18.180> tight<00:02:18.660> but<00:02:19.560> even<00:02:19.860> after<00:02:20.190> writing

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
have these tight but even after writing

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.910 
have these tight but even after writing
a<00:02:20.790> couple<00:02:21.090> times<00:02:21.270> they<00:02:21.960> will<00:02:22.080> loosen<00:02:22.470> up<00:02:22.650> so

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
a couple times they will loosen up so

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.370 
a couple times they will loosen up so
it's<00:02:23.100> good<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.340> carry<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.820> tool<00:02:24.150> on<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.570> they

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
make a lot of these small tools that

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.060 
make a lot of these small tools that
will<00:02:27.000> fit<00:02:27.210> in<00:02:27.360> your<00:02:27.510> pocket<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:28.290> your<00:02:28.530> snoring

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
your bindings are still tight so once

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.180 
your bindings are still tight so once
you<00:02:35.730> have<00:02:35.850> all<00:02:36.060> four<00:02:36.120> screws<00:02:36.960> tightened<00:02:37.380> you

you have all four screws tightened you

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.040 
you have all four screws tightened you
can<00:02:38.370> actually<00:02:38.520> take<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.000> binding<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.600> try<00:02:39.990> to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
can actually take the binding and try to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.480 
can actually take the binding and try to
put<00:02:40.260> pressure<00:02:40.530> on<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:41.070> shouldn't<00:02:41.310> be

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
put pressure on it it shouldn't be

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.670 
put pressure on it it shouldn't be
shaking<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.000> shouldn't<00:02:42.300> be<00:02:42.390> moving<00:02:42.600> at<00:02:43.200> all<00:02:43.470> on

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
shaking it shouldn't be moving at all on

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.020 
shaking it shouldn't be moving at all on
the<00:02:43.800> board<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.280> that's<00:02:44.460> going<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.730> tell<00:02:44.910> you

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
the board and that's going to tell you

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.260 
the board and that's going to tell you
that<00:02:45.180> it's<00:02:45.300> tight<00:02:45.510> enough<00:02:46.160> now<00:02:47.160> most<00:02:47.850> bindings

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
that it's tight enough now most bindings

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.920 
that it's tight enough now most bindings
are<00:02:48.420> actually<00:02:48.780> going<00:02:48.960> to<00:02:49.140> come<00:02:49.350> with<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:50.930> leash

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
are actually going to come with a leash

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.950 
are actually going to come with a leash
and<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.260> stomp<00:02:52.530> pad<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.940> leash<00:02:54.180> goes<00:02:54.540> on<00:02:54.780> the

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
and a stomp pad the leash goes on the

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.740 
and a stomp pad the leash goes on the
front<00:02:55.440> binding<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.850> what<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.210> does<00:02:57.480> is<00:02:57.720> it

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
front binding and what this does is it

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.650 
front binding and what this does is it
keeps<00:02:58.460> you<00:02:59.460> actually<00:02:59.790> connect<00:03:00.060> this<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.300> your

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
keeps you actually connect this to your

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.530 
keeps you actually connect this to your
boot<00:03:00.870> if<00:03:01.710> for<00:03:01.920> some<00:03:01.980> reason<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.670> binding<00:03:03.060> was

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
boot if for some reason the binding was

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.120 
boot if for some reason the binding was
to<00:03:03.630> come<00:03:03.780> undone<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.530> keeps<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.920> board

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
to come undone it keeps the board

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.650 
to come undone it keeps the board
attached<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.880> from<00:03:06.060> flying<00:03:06.270> down<00:03:06.510> the

strapped<00:03:22.950> in<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.610> put<00:03:23.850> your<00:03:23.940> back<00:03:24.300> foot<00:03:24.570> right

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
strapped in you put your back foot right

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.150 
strapped in you put your back foot right
on<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.380> keeps<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.680> from<00:03:25.830> sliding

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
on this and it keeps you from sliding

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.460 
on this and it keeps you from sliding
around<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.730> board<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.930> after<00:03:28.080> you're<00:03:28.320> done

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
around on the board so after you're done

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.530 
around on the board so after you're done
mounting<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.010> binding<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:30.180> want<00:03:30.390> to

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
mounting the binding you want to

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.760 
mounting the binding you want to
actually<00:03:30.660> adjust<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.530> boot<00:03:31.680> because

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
actually adjust it to the boot because

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
actually adjust it to the boot because
you<00:03:31.950> don't<00:03:32.100> want<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.310> be<00:03:32.400> screwing<00:03:32.640> around

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
you don't want to be screwing around

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.460 
you don't want to be screwing around
with<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.150> once<00:03:33.360> you're<00:03:33.540> on<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.750> hill<00:03:33.930> the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
with that once you're on the hill the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.940 
with that once you're on the hill the
cold<00:03:35.720> so<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.840> straps<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.380> bindings<00:03:37.800> should

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
cold so the straps the bindings should

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.950 
cold so the straps the bindings should
actually<00:03:38.160> be<00:03:38.460> hitting<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.820> boot<00:03:39.150> right<00:03:39.900> in

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
actually be hitting the boot right in

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.480 
actually be hitting the boot right in
the<00:03:40.200> middle<00:03:40.380> it<00:03:40.650> shouldn't<00:03:40.920> be<00:03:41.010> shifted<00:03:41.370> off

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
the middle it shouldn't be shifted off

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.370 
the middle it shouldn't be shifted off
to<00:03:41.700> one<00:03:41.850> side<00:03:41.880> or<00:03:42.090> another<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.750> they<00:03:43.140> give<00:03:43.350> you

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
to one side or another and they give you

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.290 
to one side or another and they give you
a<00:03:43.500> lot<00:03:43.740> of<00:03:43.860> different<00:03:44.220> options<00:03:44.700> as<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:44.910> how<00:03:45.240> to

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
a lot of different options as to how to

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.420 
a lot of different options as to how to
adjust<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:45.990> in<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.800> case<00:03:47.040> with<00:03:47.250> this

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
adjust that in this case with this

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.700 
adjust that in this case with this
binding<00:03:47.880> you'd<00:03:48.330> simply<00:03:48.690> unscrew<00:03:49.260> this<00:03:49.410> and

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
binding you'd simply unscrew this and

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.920 
binding you'd simply unscrew this and
move<00:03:49.830> it<00:03:50.010> back<00:03:50.190> if<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.520> needed<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.820> some<00:03:51.780> of

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
move it back if you needed to some of

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.450 
move it back if you needed to some of
them<00:03:52.050> will<00:03:52.230> actually<00:03:52.260> have<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:53.010> tool<00:03:53.280> this

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
them will actually have the tool this

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.120 
them will actually have the tool this
adjustment<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.500> then<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:55.620> can<00:03:55.740> just<00:03:55.890> pop

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
adjustment and then you can just pop

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.730 
adjustment and then you can just pop
that<00:03:56.160> open<00:03:56.520> and<00:03:56.930> you<00:03:57.930> can<00:03:58.080> make<00:03:58.320> this<00:03:58.470> longer

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
that open and you can make this longer

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.160 
that open and you can make this longer
bring<00:03:59.310> it<00:03:59.430> in<00:03:59.580> but<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.090> should<00:04:00.360> be<00:04:00.390> again<00:04:00.870> just

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
bring it in but it should be again just

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.160 
bring it in but it should be again just
fitting<00:04:01.500> right<00:04:01.800> over<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.980> boot<00:04:05.190> evenly<00:04:06.170> so

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
fitting right over the boot evenly so

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.360 
fitting right over the boot evenly so
you<00:04:07.230> basically<00:04:07.470> just<00:04:07.770> want<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.190> make<00:04:08.310> sure

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
you basically just want to make sure

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.340 
you basically just want to make sure
that<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.880> boot<00:04:09.090> is<00:04:09.300> fitting<00:04:09.690> properly<00:04:09.930> in<00:04:10.320> the

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
that the boot is fitting properly in the

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.710 
that the boot is fitting properly in the
binding<00:04:10.860> because<00:04:11.640> if<00:04:11.940> it's<00:04:12.120> loose<00:04:12.330> or<00:04:12.660> if

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
binding because if it's loose or if

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.180 
binding because if it's loose or if
there's<00:04:12.900> any<00:04:13.080> kind<00:04:13.320> of<00:04:13.440> movement<00:04:13.620> in<00:04:13.950> there

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
there's any kind of movement in there

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.490 
there's any kind of movement in there
it's<00:04:14.580> not<00:04:14.730> going<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.000> give<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:16.170> proper

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
it's not going to give you the proper

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.720 
it's not going to give you the proper
response<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.100> you're<00:04:17.220> going<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.400> lose<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.609> lot

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
response and you're going to lose a lot

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.700 
response and you're going to lose a lot
of<00:04:17.970> energy<00:04:18.120> transfer<00:04:18.840> between<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.530> boot<00:04:19.680> and

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:19.710 
of energy transfer between the boot and

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.130 
of energy transfer between the boot and
the<00:04:19.890> binding<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.460> board<00:04:20.790> so<00:04:21.720> mining<00:04:22.020> your

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
the binding and the board so mining your

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.750 
the binding and the board so mining your
bindings<00:04:22.500> is<00:04:22.650> really<00:04:22.950> easy<00:04:23.040> it's<00:04:23.370> simple<00:04:23.430> you

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
bindings is really easy it's simple you

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.030 
bindings is really easy it's simple you
can<00:04:23.910> do<00:04:24.000> it<00:04:24.090> yourself<00:04:24.290> and<00:04:25.290> you<00:04:25.380> can<00:04:25.530> also<00:04:25.680> add

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
can do it yourself and you can also add

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.490 
can do it yourself and you can also add
from<00:04:26.460> time<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:26.880> time<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:28.110> don't<00:04:28.320> you're

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
from time to time to you don't you're

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.990 
from time to time to you don't you're
not<00:04:28.650> stuck<00:04:28.920> with<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.220> stance<00:04:29.490> that<00:04:29.580> you<00:04:29.760> set

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
not stuck with the stance that you set

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.760 
not stuck with the stance that you set
it<00:04:30.090> at<00:04:30.180> to<00:04:30.330> begin<00:04:30.570> with<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:31.020> can<00:04:31.200> change<00:04:31.500> it

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
it at to begin with you can change it

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.310 
it at to begin with you can change it
once<00:04:31.980> you<00:04:32.100> progress<00:04:32.400> you<00:04:32.670> can<00:04:32.790> change<00:04:33.030> it<00:04:33.180> to

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
once you progress you can change it to

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.260 
once you progress you can change it to
different<00:04:34.320> styles<00:04:34.800> of<00:04:34.920> writing<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:36.060> it's

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
different styles of writing and it's

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.840 
different styles of writing and it's
very<00:04:36.510> simple
