00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.580
 ugh so friends well well shorter while we 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.559
 a little fucked i first 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.860
 changed in general RAM 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.110
 tried to turn it on without RAM with 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.810
 RAM further turned off the video card 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.689
 powering the video card took out the battery 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.390
 Bios disconnected all hard drives in the end 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.210
 As you can see, the motherboard seems to be burning when 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.650
 start buttons I press the start button 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.449
 I have a little cooler start and fucked up 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.969
 that is, if I pinch up to kick well 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.969
 let's say reset button and hold button 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.050
 food and hold it accordingly 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.329
 post code I have to fast for 4 zeros and 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.129
 in the end at the start I just 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.469
 motherboard does not start, I understand that 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.570
 it's all a problem 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.850
 directly to the motherboard then 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.570
 I will try it now 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.969
 to do but in the end when i opened bye 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.430
 something here bitch zavonyalo in the area 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.939
 cpu that's what not 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.689
 will understand 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:12.430
 The essence of what I have is this block 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:16.580
 supply how much he is there a thousand 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:20.330
 1080 in the hotel 1100 somewhere there on it 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.610
 1100 is written well, in short it does not matter well 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.430
 pretty powerful i have this one 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.130
 my old man 550 in my 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.220
 the result is such a borodulin fuck it 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.350
 He knows what is going on here at all so 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.979
 so so in the end I will try to lay out the hour 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.770
 Vidosik on the channel I think that maybe 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:44.270
 have any thoughts 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:47.240
 I will specify the motherboard processor also show and 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.549
 everything seems to be all i know about 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.030
 disconnected tried everything individually 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.670
 but nichrome does not work 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.579
 there is a problem most likely in 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.630
 to the motherboard 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.360
 guys like things described everything 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.670
 shit for everything what is happening but the essence 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.250
 in that it is very unpleasant to have everything 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.830
 it repair fuck it takes a lot 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.849
 a lot of time is shorter I do not know soon 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.150
 It's easiest to look for a new motherboard though 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.150
 is not a fact
