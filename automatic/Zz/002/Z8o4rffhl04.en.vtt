00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
right here you don't really need to get

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.630 
right here you don't really need to get
a<00:00:51.899> card<00:00:52.699> so<00:00:53.699> really<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.500> thing<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.489> you

a card so really it's the thing is you
got<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:56.879> fast<00:00:57.180> action<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.780> gonna<00:00:57.930> take

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
got to be fast action it's gonna take

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.119 
got to be fast action it's gonna take
some<00:00:58.260> practice<00:00:58.440> actually<00:00:59.370> to<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.510> these<00:01:01.129> I've

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
some practice actually to do these I've

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.670 
some practice actually to do these I've
actually<00:01:02.579> took<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.719> know<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.989> cars<00:01:04.229> took<00:01:04.500> off

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
actually took you know the cars took off

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.850 
actually took you know the cars took off
for<00:01:04.890> me<00:01:04.949> cuz<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.630> know<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.810> what<00:01:07.619> do

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
for me cuz I just you know you what do

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.230 
for me cuz I just you know you what do
it<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.130> then<00:01:08.250> time<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.850> going<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> take

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
it and then time so it is going to take

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.490 
it and then time so it is going to take
a<00:01:09.270> little<00:01:09.450> bit<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.689> practice<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.200> get<00:01:10.320> these

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
a little bit of practice to get these

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.039 
a little bit of practice to get these
advanced<00:01:10.890> settings<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:12.000> hopefully<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.869> walk

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
advanced settings but hopefully the walk

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.190 
advanced settings but hopefully the walk
through<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.409> will<00:01:13.560> give<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:14.010> will<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.549> easy

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
through that will give you will be easy

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.039 
through that will give you will be easy

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
settings so and then basically the only

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.340 
settings so and then basically the only
all<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.369> do<00:01:53.490> after<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.420> shut<00:01:55.229> it

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
all you have to do after that is shut it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.300 
all you have to do after that is shut it
off<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.770> turn<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.820> back<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:57.829> after<00:01:58.829> you've

off and turn it back on after you've

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.959 
off and turn it back on after you've
done<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.630> set<00:02:01.009> so<00:02:02.009> basically<00:02:02.790> what

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
done that and it's set so basically what

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:03.950 
done that and it's set so basically what
we're<00:02:03.090> going<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:03.329> I'll<00:02:03.540> push<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.930> button

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
we're going to do I'll push the button

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.319 
we're going to do I'll push the button
here<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.799> hopefully<00:02:05.250> here<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:06.000> see<00:02:06.149> this

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329

beep<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.750> wait<00:02:18.560> for<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.830> flash<00:02:19.069> there's<00:02:19.910> the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
beep and wait for the flash there's the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.660 
beep and wait for the flash there's the
first<00:02:20.240> flash<00:02:20.540> BAM<00:02:20.930> I'm<00:02:21.110> in<00:02:21.260> DRS<00:02:21.680> mode<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.490> right

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
first flash BAM I'm in DRS mode so right

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.270 
first flash BAM I'm in DRS mode so right
now<00:02:22.819> it's<00:02:23.060> red<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.900> green<00:02:24.200> which<00:02:25.040> is

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
now it's red in a green which is

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.520 
now it's red in a green which is
aggressive<00:02:25.700> frequency<00:02:26.240> of<00:02:26.750> click<00:02:27.080> it<00:02:27.230> red

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
aggressive frequency of click it red

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:37.220 
aggressive frequency of click it red
only<00:02:28.100> is<00:02:28.610> smooth<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.950> click<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.370> again

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.180 

and<00:02:37.800> there's<00:02:38.489> okay<00:02:38.879> so<00:02:38.910> there's<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.420> smooth

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
and there's okay so there's a smooth

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.420 
and there's okay so there's a smooth
there<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.700> normal<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:43.560> there<00:02:44.069> is<00:02:44.250> the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
there is the normal and there is the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.449 
there is the normal and there is the
aggressive<00:02:44.970> frequency<00:02:45.569> now<00:02:46.050> uh<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.800> default

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
aggressive frequency now uh the default

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.949 
aggressive frequency now uh the default
says<00:02:47.849> smooth<00:02:48.709> but<00:02:49.709> I'll<00:02:50.220> tell<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.519> right<00:02:50.700> now

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
says smooth but I'll tell you right now

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.690 
says smooth but I'll tell you right now
it's<00:02:51.959> not<00:02:52.200> smooth<00:02:52.620> you're<00:02:53.190> gonna<00:02:53.340> rip<00:02:53.580> your

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
it's not smooth you're gonna rip your

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.550 
it's not smooth you're gonna rip your
gears<00:02:54.030> out<00:02:54.269> if<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.660> keep<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.989> in<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.230> smooth

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
gears out if you keep it in this smooth

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.550 
gears out if you keep it in this smooth
mode<00:02:56.330> really<00:02:57.330> I<00:02:57.360> think<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.810> smooth<00:02:58.050> mode<00:02:58.380> is

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
mode really I think the smooth mode is

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.050 
mode really I think the smooth mode is
the<00:02:58.680> aggressive<00:02:59.160> mode

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
the aggressive mode

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.110 
the aggressive mode
I've<00:03:00.420> already<00:03:00.630> ripped<00:03:01.019> out<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.860> gear<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.459> this

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
I've already ripped out a gear in this

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.900 
I've already ripped out a gear in this
truck<00:03:03.450> having<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.860> because<00:03:05.760> it

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
truck having it in that because it

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.280 
truck having it in that because it
basically<00:03:06.090> sends<00:03:06.510> all<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.780> power<00:03:06.989> straight

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
basically sends all the power straight

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.640 
basically sends all the power straight
to<00:03:07.470> your<00:03:07.910> your<00:03:08.910> wheels<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.599> just<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.470> lot<00:03:10.590> of

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
to your your wheels and just a lot of

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.410 
to your your wheels and just a lot of
jerking<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.489> something's<00:03:11.880> gonna<00:03:11.940> get<00:03:12.150> broke

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
jerking and something's gonna get broke

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.380 
jerking and something's gonna get broke
so<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.380> strongly<00:03:13.769> suggest<00:03:14.130> put<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.150> in<00:03:15.239> the

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
so I strongly suggest put it in the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.089 
so I strongly suggest put it in the
aggressive<00:03:15.870> mode<00:03:16.110> it's<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.739> little<00:03:16.980> bit

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
aggressive mode it's a little bit

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:23.259 
aggressive mode it's a little bit
smoother<00:03:17.640> take<00:03:17.910> off<00:03:18.150> with<00:03:18.540> your<00:03:18.569> wheels<00:03:21.170> that

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
smoother take off with your wheels that

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.420 
smoother take off with your wheels that
sounds<00:03:24.269> really<00:03:24.510> good<00:03:24.780> help<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.680> put<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:26.010> in<00:03:26.130> the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
sounds really good help I put it in the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.400

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
put it in that mode because it's gonna

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.960 
put it in that mode because it's gonna
jerk<00:03:30.180> really<00:03:30.989> hard<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.530> after<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.190> wild<00:03:32.610> your

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
to have these two two settings to learn

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.260 
to have these two two settings to learn
these<00:05:43.510> two<00:05:43.750> settings<00:05:44.020> and<00:05:45.090> hopefully<00:05:46.090> this

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
these two settings and hopefully this

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.920 
these two settings and hopefully this
video<00:05:46.419> will<00:05:46.780> help<00:05:46.840> you<00:05:47.370> set<00:05:48.370> this<00:05:48.930> just

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820 
temperature protection so and that's it

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.159 
temperature protection so and that's it
so<00:06:44.130> just<00:06:45.130> hang<00:06:45.640> out<00:06:45.850> maybe<00:06:46.120> I'll<00:06:46.780> try<00:06:46.960> to<00:06:47.020> get
