put to twitter's add to YouTube's below

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.500 
put to twitter's add to YouTube's below
of<00:00:47.070> two<00:00:47.489> people<00:00:47.640> who<00:00:47.820> are<00:00:47.910> actually<00:00:47.999> doing<00:00:48.329> it

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
of two people who are actually doing it

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.599 
of two people who are actually doing it
for<00:00:48.690> free<00:00:48.929> I<00:00:49.230> think<00:00:49.920> they're<00:00:50.070> actually<00:00:50.190> doing

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
for free I think they're actually doing

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:52.819 
for free I think they're actually doing
lobbies<00:00:51.089> all<00:00:51.329> day<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:51.629> obviously<00:00:52.199> go<00:00:52.379> message

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
lobbies all day so obviously go message

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.979 
lobbies all day so obviously go message
them<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.789> think<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.269> want<00:00:54.449> more<00:00:54.780> than

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
them and I think if you want more than

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.630 
them and I think if you want more than
two<00:00:55.230> million<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.679> think<00:00:55.949> they<00:00:56.070> charge<00:00:56.280> five

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
two million I think they charge five

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.910 
two million I think they charge five
dollars<00:00:56.999> but<00:00:57.449> anything<00:00:57.899> up<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.319> two<00:00:58.530> million<00:00:58.739> I

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
dollars but anything up to two million I

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.979 
dollars but anything up to two million I
think<00:00:59.159> they<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.339> free<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.600> lobbies<00:01:00.899> are

background isn't actually from one of
the<00:01:12.479> lobbies<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.049> actually<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.500> think<00:01:13.770> it's

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
the lobbies is actually I think it's

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.580 
the lobbies is actually I think it's
from<00:01:14.159> last<00:01:14.460> year<00:01:14.759> when<00:01:15.450> lobbies<00:01:16.380> were

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
from last year when lobbies were

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.319 
from last year when lobbies were
actually<00:01:17.100> around<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.880> anyone<00:01:18.149> could

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
actually around and anyone could

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.209 
actually around and anyone could
actually<00:01:18.479> hosting<00:01:18.960> themselves<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:20.040> yeah

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
actually hosting themselves but yeah

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:22.039 
actually hosting themselves but yeah
it's<00:01:20.430> basically<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.000> concept<00:01:21.299> where<00:01:21.719> you<00:01:21.899> can

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
it's basically the concept where you can

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.260 
it's basically the concept where you can
just<00:01:22.079> someone<00:01:22.979> drops<00:01:23.219> money<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.090> could

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
just someone drops money and you could

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.389 
just someone drops money and you could
just<00:01:24.299> pick<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:24.950> they<00:01:25.950> basically<00:01:26.100> doing
