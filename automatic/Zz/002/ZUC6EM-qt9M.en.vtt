00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
bit the connection is pretty bad so if

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.120 
bit the connection is pretty bad so if
we're<00:03:01.390> running<00:03:01.690> out<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.810> time<00:03:02.080> I'm<00:03:02.800> going<00:03:03.040> to

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
the widget yeah so for example you had

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.080 
the widget yeah so for example you had
okay<00:03:08.230> we've<00:03:08.470> seen<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.860> lot<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.220> different<00:03:09.430> sizes

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
lot of long list of

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.790 
lot of long list of
we<00:03:15.190> get<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.180> users<00:03:16.629> can<00:03:16.930> choose<00:03:17.230> and
