into<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.920> gearbox<00:02:16.160> there<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:17.060> do<00:02:17.570> this<00:02:17.900> right

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
into the gearbox there I do this right

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.330 
into the gearbox there I do this right
there<00:02:19.550> we<00:02:19.700> go

bolted on to the other half of the jaw
coupler<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.860> see<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.220> turning<00:02:34.670> over<00:02:34.820> there

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.820 

and<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.850> just<00:02:41.540> go<00:02:41.690> ahead<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.110> do<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.230> quick<00:02:42.500> demo

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
and I just go ahead and do a quick demo

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.949 
and I just go ahead and do a quick demo
here<00:02:42.980> now<00:02:43.400> with<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.760> 12-volt<00:02:44.270> car<00:02:44.540> battery

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.860 

it's<00:02:47.959> in<00:02:48.290> gear<00:02:48.620> at<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:48.860> minute<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.720> think<00:02:50.720> it's

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
it's in gear at the minute I think it's

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.680 
it's in gear at the minute I think it's
actually<00:02:51.140> in<00:02:51.739> fourth<00:02:52.580> gear<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.209> couldn't<00:02:53.600> be

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
actually in fourth gear I couldn't be

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.930 
actually in fourth gear I couldn't be
sure

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
sure

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.470 
sure
all<00:02:55.940> right<00:02:56.150> go<00:02:56.959> ahead<00:02:56.989> now<00:02:57.530> I'm<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:58.670> quick<00:02:59.209> demo

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
all right go ahead now I'm a quick demo

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.970 
all right go ahead now I'm a quick demo
with<00:02:59.720> this<00:02:59.840> 12<00:03:00.080> volt<00:03:00.380> battery<00:03:00.890> here<00:03:02.800> let<00:03:03.800> you

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
with this 12 volt battery here let you

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.699 
with this 12 volt battery here let you
see<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:06.040> driveshaft<00:03:07.040> end<00:03:07.670> here<00:03:08.030> when<00:03:08.239> I

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
see the driveshaft end here when I

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:26.170 
see the driveshaft end here when I
the<00:03:09.739> battery

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.780 

so<00:03:27.180> there's<00:03:27.390> no<00:03:27.540> oil<00:03:27.959> in<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.530> gearbox<00:03:29.430> at<00:03:29.670> the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
so there's no oil in the gearbox at the

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.509 
so there's no oil in the gearbox at the
minute<00:03:30.090> so<00:03:30.120> that's<00:03:30.860> causing<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:32.159> to<00:03:32.310> make<00:03:32.489> a

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
minute so that's causing it to make a

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.030 
minute so that's causing it to make a
bit<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:32.909> a<00:03:33.030> thumping<00:03:33.959> sound<00:03:33.989> those<00:03:34.650> two<00:03:34.799> gears

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
bit of a thumping sound those two gears

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:51.280 
bit of a thumping sound those two gears
turn<00:03:35.370> over<00:03:48.980> that's<00:03:49.980> about<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.400> folks<00:03:50.640> and

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
turn over that's about it folks and

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.460 
turn over that's about it folks and
simple<00:03:52.760> took<00:03:53.760> about<00:03:53.939> two<00:03:54.269> days<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:55.049> get<00:03:55.260> this

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
simple took about two days to get this

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.569 
simple took about two days to get this
place<00:03:56.269> made<00:03:57.269> up<00:03:57.829> it<00:03:58.829> could<00:03:59.159> have<00:03:59.280> been<00:03:59.370> done

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
place made up it could have been done

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.960 
place made up it could have been done
faster<00:04:00.239> if<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.450> had<00:04:00.480> more<00:04:01.129> time<00:04:02.129> to<00:04:02.430> spend<00:04:02.549> on<00:04:02.909> a

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970

Boulder<00:04:35.900> of<00:04:36.900> course<00:04:37.430> in<00:04:38.430> this<00:04:38.699> case<00:04:39.030> I<00:04:39.270> think

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
Boulder of course in this case I think

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:46.070 
Boulder of course in this case I think
the<00:04:40.310> cheap<00:04:41.310> option<00:04:41.760> is<00:04:41.910> just<00:04:41.940> as<00:04:42.389> good<00:04:45.080> so

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
the cheap option is just as good so

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.710 
the cheap option is just as good so
that's<00:04:46.199> about<00:04:46.410> it
