00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.819 

today<00:00:00.719> we're<00:00:00.900> going<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.110> learn<00:00:01.260> how<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.500> tie<00:00:01.800> a

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
today we're going to learn how to tie a

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.800 
today we're going to learn how to tie a
double<00:00:02.129> uni<00:00:02.639> knot<00:00:02.820> and<00:00:03.090> what<00:00:03.300> I<00:00:03.330> like<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.780> call

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
double uni knot and what I like to call

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.970 
double uni knot and what I like to call
the<00:00:04.110> 96<00:00:04.770> method<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:06.270> tie<00:00:06.480> this<00:00:06.540> knot<00:00:07.020> we're

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
the 96 method and to tie this knot we're

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.509 
the 96 method and to tie this knot we're
going<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.780> overlap<00:00:09.780> both<00:00:10.650> ends<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.099> our<00:00:11.190> line

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
going to overlap both ends of our line

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.629 
going to overlap both ends of our line
like<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.740> then<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:13.980> top<00:00:14.190> one<00:00:14.400> we're

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
like that and then in the top one we're

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.179 
like that and then in the top one we're
going<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.910> make<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.089> nine<00:00:18.230> and<00:00:19.230> then<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
going to make a nine and then in the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.189 
going to make a nine and then in the
bottom<00:00:20.490> line<00:00:21.140> we're<00:00:22.140> going<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.380> make<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> six

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
bottom line we're going to make a six

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.900 
bottom line we're going to make a six
giving<00:00:25.199> ourselves<00:00:25.350> plenty<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.220> tail<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.519> work

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
giving ourselves plenty of tail to work

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.650 
giving ourselves plenty of tail to work
with<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.900> makes<00:00:28.170> them<00:00:28.320> 96<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.310> bit<00:00:30.240> more<00:00:30.420> tail

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
with so it makes them 96 a bit more tail

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.319 
with so it makes them 96 a bit more tail
on<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.019> one<00:00:31.489> now<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.700> left<00:00:32.880> one<00:00:33.120> what

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
on that one now on the left one what

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.819 
on that one now on the left one what
we're<00:00:33.450> going<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.600> do<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.110> we're<00:00:34.440> going<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.590> take

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
we're going to do is we're going to take

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.280 
we're going to do is we're going to take
wraps<00:00:35.309> around<00:00:37.460> these<00:00:38.460> two<00:00:38.850> parts<00:00:39.629> going

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
wraps around these two parts going

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.619 
wraps around these two parts going
through<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.860> loop<00:00:41.360> now<00:00:42.360> we're<00:00:42.480> going<00:00:42.570> to

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
through that loop now we're going to

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.200 
through that loop now we're going to
take<00:00:42.840> four<00:00:42.870> wraps<00:00:43.410> today<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:44.969> take

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
take four wraps today but you can take

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:59.200 
take four wraps today but you can take
as<00:00:45.360> many<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:46.039> six<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:48.210> that's<00:00:49.280> one<00:00:53.660> two<00:00:54.660> three

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.420 
that tail coming upwards I'm going to
tighten<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.040> down<00:01:10.010> just<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.189> that

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
turns around these two parts go one two

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.410 
turns around these two parts go one two
three<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.490> four<00:01:33.200> with<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> tail<00:01:34.590> coming<00:01:34.890> up

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
well just loosely set it and you should

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.820 
well just loosely set it and you should
have<00:01:46.229> some<00:01:47.159> link

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
have some link

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.490 
have some link
that<00:01:49.830> looks<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:52.820> now<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.810> set<00:01:55.050> this<00:01:55.230> not

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that looks like that now to set this not

what we want to do is we want to tug on

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.520 
what we want to do is we want to tug on
these<00:01:59.270> standing<00:02:00.270> parts<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.750> line<00:02:00.960> to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
these standing parts of the line to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.730 
these standing parts of the line to
bring<00:02:01.740> these<00:02:01.920> together<00:02:03.410> pull<00:02:04.410> it<00:02:04.530> nice<00:02:04.710> and

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
bring these together pull it nice and

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.490 
bring these together pull it nice and
tight<00:02:05.270> then<00:02:06.800> we<00:02:07.800> want<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.100> grab<00:02:08.280> our<00:02:08.460> tag<00:02:08.759> ends

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
tight then we want to grab our tag ends

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.600 
tight then we want to grab our tag ends
we<00:02:10.500> want<00:02:10.710> to<00:02:10.830> pull<00:02:11.009> them<00:02:11.220> as<00:02:11.430> well<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:13.610> tighten

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
we want to pull them as well to tighten

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.340 
we want to pull them as well to tighten
the<00:02:14.700> knot<00:02:15.410> around<00:02:16.410> these<00:02:16.590> standing<00:02:17.100> parts

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
the knot around these standing parts

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.140 
the knot around these standing parts
you'll<00:02:19.350> notice<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.400> takes<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.000> knot

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
you'll notice that that takes the knot

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.570 
you'll notice that that takes the knot
apart<00:02:21.600> just<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.170> little<00:02:22.440> bit<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.310> middle

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
apart just a little bit in the middle

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.810 
apart just a little bit in the middle
there<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:25.200> where<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.440> want<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.709> pull<00:02:25.950> on<00:02:26.220> our

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
there so where you want to pull on our

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.380 
there so where you want to pull on our
standing<00:02:27.630> parts<00:02:27.989> one<00:02:28.500> more<00:02:28.680> time<00:02:28.920> just<00:02:29.390> to

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
standing parts one more time just to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.830 
standing parts one more time just to
bring<00:02:30.540> those<00:02:30.750> knots<00:02:31.050> together<00:02:32.480> then<00:02:33.480> we<00:02:33.630> can

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
bring those knots together then we can

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.910 
bring those knots together then we can
cut<00:02:34.050> these<00:02:34.290> tail<00:02:35.250> ends<00:02:35.520> off<00:02:36.650> flush<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.890> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
cut these tail ends off flush to the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.810 
cut these tail ends off flush to the
knot<00:02:38.190> here<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:40.070> that's<00:02:41.070> your<00:02:41.190> double<00:02:41.370> uni

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
knot here and that's your double uni

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.970 
knot here and that's your double uni
knot
