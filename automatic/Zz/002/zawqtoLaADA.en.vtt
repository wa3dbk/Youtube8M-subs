00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:50.590 

they<00:01:42.740> go<00:01:42.950> through<00:01:43.460> here<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:49.270> there's<00:01:50.270> four

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
they go through here and there's four

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.150 
they go through here and there's four
teleporters<00:01:51.280> um<00:01:52.990> that<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.440> can<00:01:54.620> go<00:01:54.770> through

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
teleporters um that you can go through

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.800 
teleporters um that you can go through
but<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:55.730> have<00:01:55.970> to<00:01:56.060> figure<00:01:56.210> out<00:01:56.420> which<00:01:56.570> one's

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
but you have to figure out which one's

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.030 
but you have to figure out which one's
right<00:01:57.080> or<00:01:57.320> else<00:01:57.410> you'll<00:01:57.590> start<00:01:57.830> all<00:01:58.010> over

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
right or else you'll start all over

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.280 
right or else you'll start all over
again<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:58.760> that<00:01:59.390> will<00:01:59.480> certainly<00:01:59.810> reduce

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
again and that will certainly reduce

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.760 
again and that will certainly reduce
your<00:02:00.470> time<00:02:01.450> so<00:02:02.450> they<00:02:02.540> use<00:02:02.720> a<00:02:02.750> jump<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.500> get<00:02:03.650> up

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
your time so they use a jump to get up

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.300 
your time so they use a jump to get up
here<00:02:04.010> one<00:02:04.460> guy<00:02:04.760> grabbed<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.390> gravel<00:02:05.750> if<00:02:09.310> you
