00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.690
 good morning we are here from 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.379
 new in the ski resort of 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.599
 valdelinares 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.089
 Now as you can see we have changed places 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.300
 we are in the snowpark area 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.320
 which is the area reserved for 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.320
 Prisa practice 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.490
 or not 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.440
 let's start by explaining the rules 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.730
 of security to take into account when 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.730
 let's use the snowpark 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.239
 we have to see the different lines 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.579
 which are marked inside the snowpark 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.159
 because because within that line can 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.199
 have any user in the path of 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:50.519
 modules what we can not do is go 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.519
 crossing us between the modules 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.629
 we will also take into account the state of 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.030
 the snow since it is a changing state 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.039
 we will not find the snowpark equal to 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.960
 first hour of the morning the last hour 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.239
 in the afternoon taking into account the 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.320
 speed that we have to follow the 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.320
 time to take each module 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.760
 As you can see inside the park, there is 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.860
 several mobile difficulty lines 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.720
 We will always try to adapt our 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.720
 level of snowboarding to each module 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.380
 remember guys before entering the 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.810
 snowpark we should have a series of 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.750
 very clear movements per track as 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.070
 can be the all and the 'nole' and nose pre 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.170
 state press 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.060
 all that then are the most tricks 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.590
 elementals that we will be able to use 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.150
 in the snowpark to have a good 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.150
 progression inside the crystal 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.710
 then I'm going to introduce you to me 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.200
 fellow frames that's going to be the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.149
 responsible for performing the most tricks 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.310
 basic that we will be able to find 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.310
 inside the snowpark we will go 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.790
 efe 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.020
 we are already inside the snowpark what 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.360
 first thing we have to do is do 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.310
 a choice of the appropriate module to 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.530
 our level how are we going to start by 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.840
 the simplest and most basic exercises 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.510
 we have chosen this module because the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.760
 entrance is totally flat let's 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.770
 start with a fifty-fifty consisting 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.810
 in passing with the straight board above 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.220
 of the module once we have chosen the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.230
 speed at which the module enters 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.300
 we will put our flat table in 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.920
 base position towards the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.750
 module the only thing we will do will be 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.510
 keep the base position a bit more 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.400
 flexed from the normal as we have 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.840
 chosen a flat input module what 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.570
 only we will do once we get to the 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.250
 module will maintain the base position and 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.650
 let us take until the end of 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.600
 module once we are going to leave the 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.930
 module what we will do will be a small 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.150
 Cop to go out we will perfect also 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.220
 in base position and with the table 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.340
 totally flat the next trick that 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.650
 let's perform it's called fail press that 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.050
 consists of putting pressure on 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.300
 the tail to lift the nose a little 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.000
 of the table the preparation of this trick 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.080
 is equal to the fifty fifty 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.780
 we will commission the module with the table 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.850
 flat and in base position crystal the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.610
 input to the module has to be doing 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.190
 a little olli and when we reflect 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.890
 instead of receiving flexing the 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.230
 two legs flex we have only the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.670
 back leg being extended the 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.040
 front leg 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.650
 the output of the module is making a 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.780
 little cop and going out with the table 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.780
 well flat and in freestyle base position 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.099
 good has seen the movements in 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.439
 easier modules of the snowpark we are going to 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.260
 continue with the progression increasing the 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:50.269
 input speed to the modules the 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.249
 height and with a little gap to the 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.260
 entry this means that there is a 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:57.010
 little separation between the jump of 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.010
 input and the module 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.459
 good guys up here the advice of 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.440
 this first freestyle class we 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.770
 we see in a next class until later 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.770
 see you later 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.430
